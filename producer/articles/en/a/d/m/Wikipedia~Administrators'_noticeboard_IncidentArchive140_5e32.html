<p>As you can see, these users are abusing wikipedia by asking people to revert edits made by me under the untruthful charge that I am a sockpuppet for a user I didn't come into contact with until AFTER I started editing the gothic metal page. This is a cheap and unfair way to try to revert SOURCED changes (I have provided multiple sources for the changes I made, including both doom-metal.com and allmusic.com, each of with are reputable sources. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred138_5e21.html" title="User:Fred138">Fred138</a></p>
<p>It should also be noted that the RFC has already proven me NOT to be a sockpuppet for Leyasu, and therefore these attacks are immature and unfounded. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred138_5e21.html" title="User:Fred138">Fred138</a></p>

<dd>I don't want to fight, but I am not that person. I have never met OzWrestlemaniac and never plan to. The IP Address is a multi-user address. Why do people like Moe assume everyone from that address is a sockpuppet? I'm sorry I added some previously deleted information but I honestly thought it was relevent. I thought i could edit anywhere I wanted on Wikipedia? Normy edits wrestling more than I do, would he not fall in the above catagories as an OzWrestlemaniac SockPuppet? If you look closely 90% of my edits have nothing to do with wrestling and what OzWrestlemaniac edited. Also, if anyone bothered to check, OzWrestlemaniac edited on IP Address 203.45.248.72, while I edit on IP Address 203.45.253.109.

<p>OK, this is fairly extreme. It's not so much against any particular instance of personal attacks, but rather, the users entire attitude and refusal to accept that his views are not aligned with consensus on issues pertaining to gender/sex and insistant derogatory/offensive comments to these ends. As such, I'm proposing that this user is acting and will continue to act in a disruptive manner above and beyond that which WP:PAIN can really deal with.</p>
<p>Please will somebody take a look at my talk (or the talk history if he sees this and removes his comments) for details under the (somewhat provocative and offensive) section heading "Are you a Feminist?".

<dd>Does Wikipedia have a policy on this? I mean its odd to tell someone that they have to go against a highly publicized facet of their religion to edit this encyclopedia. While I do agree with the idea that everyone should be equal, I think we should also to some degree respect others religions and simply ask he not voice his religious views or attempt to put them on others, not that he ignore them or dismiss them so as to edit here. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 20:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Indeed NuclearUmpf - and that is all I would ask (and a cessation of needless hostilities perhaps). However, refraining from pushing religious views and religion on other editors doesn't constitute "going against your religion". It surely constitutes not going against wiki policy and ranting offensively about it when a legitimate warning is given? Even still, this does not account for the vitriol with which a large number quite nasty of personal attacks have been made in just a few edits, nor does it account for unreasonable <i>demands</i> or insistance of the submission of a female editor (ie, me) just for being female.</p>
<p>Apparently, all he wants is an apology from me for giving him a perfectly legitimate warning in response to a WP:PAIN report. Needless to say, I'm not going to apologise for a legitimate action. Further, I could easily have added quite a variety and number of warning templates for much of what he has said to me personally as a result. However, that's not the issue for me - the issue is one of what I believe to be the disruptive attitude of this editor, where somehow he doesn't believe that the quite fundamental statement on WP:NPA somehow doesn't apply to him because of his religious views...</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Racial, sexual, homophobic, ageist, religious or ethnic epithets directed against another contributor. (Disagreement over what constitutes a religion, race, sexual preference, or ethnicity is not a legitimate excuse.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>... Well, what if I mentioned that such attitudes are unacceptable in <i>my</i> religion? To be honest, I wouldn't (which is why I'm not going to name my relifgious beliefs here), but the question does demonstraet an important concept - using ones religion or other beliefs (or those of others) as a tool or means by which to circumvent or break the rules needlessly has no place on wikipedia. Any given editor can believe or opine in or on any concept or opinion they want to - such is the right of every individual. There are however limits to how far that can be acted upon, and I'm pretty sure that that limit is the point where such views, beliefs, or opinion are either used as an excuse for breaking rules, deliberately deriding, hurting, or offending others, or otherwise attempting to force another into acting as though said user is in a position of superiority (ie, forcing submission).</p>
<p>To be honest, all I did (as per my comment in response to the WP:Pain report) is to issue an npa2, inform that the statement he made was sexist - ths derogatory and offensive by it's very wording (whether intended that way or not), and that the user he made it to took it in that very way. All told what's happened as a result is pretty extreme, and demonstrates more than could be comfortably written here in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think the applicable phrase may be "When in rome..." - <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 05:42, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I am out of line commenting here - my apologies. The editor in question, despite demanding "respect" and "tolerance" from others particularly regarding his "beliefs" which he seems to think provide him special rights (while claiming others have superiority complexes - lol), shows blatant inability to return tolerance or respect. This is typical: "The way we talk to you may seem rude but to me it doesn't. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_Scholar_1652.html" title="User:Street Scholar">Street Scholar</a> 10:58, 23 May 2006 (UTC)" Are respect and tolerances not 2 way streets? I think Nucleafumpf makes good sense in his post above - his comments are particularly apt if Street Scholar is trying to use his claimed "beliefs" to justify these edits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67692407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67692407" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feminism&amp;diff=56392909&amp;oldid=56387564" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feminism&amp;diff=56392909&amp;oldid=56387564" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tantrum&amp;diff=56393156&amp;oldid=56017351" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tantrum&amp;diff=56393156&amp;oldid=56017351" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67692407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67692407" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 05:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's slightly complex as our coverage of roadstone and coating processes is patchy and could certainly do with expanding, but the opening line of the Ecopave article describes it as "a company with a mission" and that is what we have here - editors on a mission, looking back form a solution rather than documenting a historical continuum. If anyone can help with resolving the confusion between <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitumen.html" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphalt.html" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a>, and help with more information on bituminous mastics and emulsions that would be greatly appreciated. The whole collection needs picking up by the corners and shaking, I think. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 13:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingstonjr_4863.html" title="User:Kingstonjr">User:Kingstonjr</a> has a "Work Gallary" on their userspace (User:Kingstonjr/Work Gallery) which, for the lack of a better term, is simply a porn gallary.</p>
<p>The "Work Gallary" has nothing to do with <i>work</i> he, or any other wikipedian, is doing for wikipedia. Another user who checked this "Work Gallary" confirmed that the majority of pictures there are linked to only on his, and a small number of other users, userpages.</p>
<p>I believe this is breaking guilelines at <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a>, especially the line that says <i>"...avoid substantial content on your user page that is unrelated to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a general hosting service, so your user page is not a personal homepage. Your page is about you as a Wikipedian."</i>. The member seems to be using his wikipedia user subpage for a personal collection of porn images.</p>
<p>Further more, it is clear from this user's <a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKingstonjr_5f69.html" title="User talk:Kingstonjr">talk page</a> that many of his pictures on that gallary are <i>not</i> free images, and do not fall under fair use guildlines.</p>
<p>The user seems to be <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html#Gaming_the_system" title="WP:POINT">purposely exploiting</a> the "Wikipedia is not censored" philosophy to prove some point and show off his "gallary" of pornographic pictures, but maintains that it's within rules because wikipedia is not censored.</p>
<p>THe user's talk page also shows evidence of other WIkipedians trying to reason with this user regarding the gallary in the past, but has recieved no replies.</p>
<p>This Gallary really does concern me, i stumbled upon it by accident from <a href="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/%7Eleon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=User&amp;limit=100&amp;month=09%2F2006&amp;mode=view" class="external text" title="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/%7Eleon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=User&amp;limit=100&amp;month=09%2F2006&amp;mode=view" rel="nofollow">these stats</a> because it was one of the most highly viewed userpages. I was quite shocked to end up on a porn gallary. WIkipedia may not be censored, but WIkipedians' having personal gallaries of such pictures on their user pages really doesn't send out the correct message.</p>
<p>I believe this "Gallary" Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Wikipedians against censorship/Gallery (which is linked to by <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingstonjr_4863.html" title="User:Kingstonjr">User:Kingstonjr</a> on his userpage) also needs to be checked.</p>
<p>I do not wish to start a debate with an established wikipedia user over his personal userpage, but i really do think something needs to be done about it. Can an administrator please look into this, and if it is indeed not within wikipedia's guildlines, please make sure this gallary is deleted?

<p>I do not want to get in the middle of this but it was brought to my attention. Apparently an anon user has a RfC filed against them and they are not being permitted to reply, the person who filed it, or one of the supporters at least keeps reverting when the anon user attempts to comment on it. I am asking for an admin to either close the RfC if appropriate, since you cant have one sided dispute resolution or simply ask the people reverting to allow the anon to comment. I am not sure if they are even blocked or banned and if they can post to the RfC while under those conditions.</p>
<p>The RfC is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/203.54.%2A.%2A" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/203.54.%2A.%2A" rel="nofollow">here</a> and it came to my attention because some information is being reverted on an article on Gundai, New South Wales, I asked why and he responded on my page, apparently its his information that keeps being removed. The user who is removing the information genuinely feels they are removing lies and so its justified. I tried telling them that you cant have ones sided dispute resolution. Can an admin please take care of this and get it far away from me. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:02, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recently sprotected the page because of edit warring by the anon. I suggest the parties apply to the mediation cabal for help, where they can create a page for discussion that the anon can participate in, and have an uninvolved moderator. It's a content dispute, not vandalism, and the anon <i>may</i> have a good point to make, however he is going about it entirely the wrong way. He may really just need wikification rather than to be treated like a vandal. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, I was trying to find out the locus of the dispute, I noticed a story the anon tried to insert was removed, it seemed sourced (I did not verify them) and so I was confused especially since it was a popups revert (no summary). I found the story apparently its true and documented history <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/hc16.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/hc16.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> but I hope they can come to some resolution, one of them is threatening to quit if the anon users information gets included. Again thank you Thatcher, if I could, I would change my vote, you have been quite a respectable admin thus far. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This incident is really about a long term abuse. Galatasaray article and some Turkey related football articles are heavily vandalising by two IPs (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.168.59.236.html" title="User:82.168.59.236">User:82.168.59.236</a> and <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.94.108.html" title="User:82.92.94.108">User:82.92.94.108</a>). At first i don't want to interfere, for thinking it was a revert war. But then take a look what is happening on Galatasaray. And see that this IPs are just reverting page to a version, they even revert newly added interwikis, notes section. And they don't mind warning messages or talk pages. I request for semi-protection, then it's semi-protected and then <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurak18_eaa5.html" title="User:Burak18">User:Burak18</a> started to revert page with same pattern to same version. I report them several times to 3RR page, they blocked several times. But they don't stop. I even request for <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Burak18_12eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Burak18">checkuser</a>, but the result is <i>Obvious 3RR evasion should be treated as such</i> by Mackensen. Actually i know that, blocking one ip or users, or protecting an article is not the solution. Because, this user is coming with many new IPs, and vandalising several articles.</p>
<p>His general motivation on changing and reverting articles are. He wants to Turkify Galatasaray (or other clubs) manager carriers with removing foreing coachs etc, adding conjectural coach assignments, like X'll be coach of Galatasaray next year, removing fact, POV tags, and many other things.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">User:Robdurbar</a>, he's trying to help on this subject but one admin is not enough. There must be a different solutions because it's really not managable. His last anon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Robdurbar&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Robdurbar&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">block are all about this user</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to state that I would like to see the talk page remain, since I archived his talk page (after a year of requests, it was killing all of our connections) - which contains warnings, block notices, etc. that should not be removed from the talk page. Note policy is not to remove the warnings from the talk pages, to which it is linked from the main talk page, so if it is blanked, how will people find out how many blocks/warnings SPUI received? Also, I highly doubt that SPUI will "leave". Remember he pulled this stunt off before, so why should we presume he won't come back and try to start "fresh" with a "new" user talk page? Oh well, at least we won't have to face the crap that goes on at the state highways project again. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 03:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct. (I need to make a template so I can subst this) There is a perpeutal conflict between vandal fighters who want to force users to keep warnings visible (or archived in a linked archive) and other editors who think people should be allowed to remove things from their talk page and that forcing people to keep warnings is more disruptive than removing them. At the present time, the vandalism policy <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> I believe, states users may remove content, including warnings, from their own user talk pages. There is also a centralized discussion at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_cf76.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings</a>.

<dd>I can only second this. SPUI was a right pain in the arse, I told him so all the time. He kicked up a stink on a regular basis, and was nudged back into line just as regularly. He took it well if it were done with even the slightest bit of mutual respect. The vast majority of the "disruption" he caused was from knee-jerk over reactions combined with stubborn insitance that everything was SPUI's fault. Still, a right pain in the arse.

<dd>I meant the goal <i>of the warnings</i> was to get SPUI to play nice with the rest of us. The goal of Wikipedia is still to build an excellent encyclopedia. And I don't dispute that he's skilled and productive at what he does. But the constant bickering and arguing over roads is a distraction from the task of building the encyclopedia. We need people with expertise and a willingness to contribute, but we also need to do it with a spirit of consensus and collegiality. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 14:50, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, its all about raods. Which are hardly my cup of tea, but then niether are species of bats. SPUI was orderly, consistant, meticulus about sourcing, and had volumous output.

<li>Yes, this is a ridiculous discussion. It's in the history if anyone cares. (That's why, when someone leaves, we are often very reluctant to delete their talk pages.)

Blanking pages is part of the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> for sure ... the only reason to revert warnings or block notices in my view (which I acknowledge is a minority) is if the user is involved in an active, ongoing situation in which other admins need to know that warnings have already been issued and for some reason it's so hot that they might not have time to check history. On an ongoing basis, separate from the above, can you blank pages without setting up a proper archive? yes. Should you? no, I don't think so, it's inconsiderate of others. I've opposed admin candidates for this (for hiding things by blanking at a convenient time). But then I never blank my page. I refactor, but I leave pointers to where stuff was moved to. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:44, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He may be a pain in the ass, but I'm also sorry to see him go. If he wants to blank his page and vanish I say let the man leave in peace. Diffs are still available via history, and it doesn't violate policy as has been pointed out. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 18:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Leave it blank, he's leaving and it's all going to be in the history anyway.

<p>None. He's not currently at this moment involved in anything that requires warnings or information to stick around, so no positive reason to force it to remain, and every reason to let him do as he likes.

I was a bit amazed that this was being discussed, for it not only goes against everything Wikipedia stands for, but for the sheer stupidity of discussing it in an IRC channel with such a silly name and where many admins were present (upon invititation to the channel, and remained out of curiousity, or so I assume). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone">User:Draicone</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelBillington_855e.html" title="User:MichaelBillington">User:MichaelBillington</a> have allowed for their content to be publicised.</p>

<p>It appears one of the quoted gentlemen is leaving over this. Well, that's his choice. I can't say I agree that the failure of Rory's RfA proves Wikipedia is broken. Although, I suppose that if I'd only been here since June, that would look somewhat bruising (having never seen Sam Spade run for adminship).

<dd>I'm sure it is unnerving and even somewhat threatening to find out that people are negatively discussing your RFA in an off-wiki format. There doesn't seem like there's much to do about it, though. There are no policies preventing off-wiki discussions, and some (en-wikipedia-l, unblock-l) are actively encouraged. Even if the IRC channel were closed, people could use AIM, or open a new private channel with a less obvious name, or even use e-mail. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:41, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so people realize, #wikipedia-cabal-en is publically advertised in #wikipedia (which is open to all), consists mostly of people joking about or griping about Wikipedia, and is heavily ironic and silly (last time I was in there, we were discussing forming a cabal on Klingon Wikipedia). If people have a problem with private groups influencing Wikipedia, that's a legitimate issue, but I think the worst thing this cabal might do is vandalize each others' userpages and make silly Wikipedia-space pages. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 12:01, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand the silliness that goes on in that channel, but humour should not detract from the actual attempts at gaming the system that went on. The snippets I provided were just that; snippets. There's lots of silliness, but there was also lots of serious inappropriateness. If you look that the history of Rory096's RfA (and the participation by these individuals, specifically) and the full logs, it becomes clear that there was an overt attempt to manipulate it. Furthermore, the quotes I provided were not jokes, and the surrounding context would show that, regardless of Mike42's attempt to brush it off as humour. I'm aware that IRC is not Wikipedia and as such, I wouldn't expect any serious ramifications, but it's important to realise that there was/is gaming of the system by these individuals, regardles of how they attempt to disguise it through irony. In short, I fully agree with brenneman, but felt that this sort of shadiness should not be dismissed as simpe humour, hence my elaboration <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 07:09, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A good faith effort to select the best images would include discussing the changes on the talk page, but he's refraining from any discussion whatsoever, despite multiple requests to explain his edits. So, I agree with Nixer's classification of this as vandalizm. As to the images - the main problem is that he's not just uploading dozens of unsourced images, but consciously falsifying licenses and removing warning tags on questionable uploads. I went through a bunch of his uploads and tagged unsourced ones, but I feel like I may be wasting my time as nothing prevents him from just removing the tags as he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AThewhitehouseinmoscow.jpg&amp;diff=79865567&amp;oldid=79863308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AThewhitehouseinmoscow.jpg&amp;diff=79865567&amp;oldid=79863308" rel="nofollow">did before</a>. <a href="../../../a/z/o/User%7EAzov_7723.html" title="User:Azov">Azov</a> 16:45, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that Fisss is not an editor in good standing. The guy does not respond to any queries concerning his actions. I have yet to see him posting on a talk page. He starts one-line articles specifically to illustrate the images he uploaded (e.g., <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Michaels_Church_153e.html" title="Saint Michaels Church">Saint Michaels Church</a>). Wikipedia for him is a large image gallery. But, Nixer, it is strange to hear complaints from you. Fisss's behaviour mirrors your own, to a degree. You both seem to have serious problems with <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> of articles written by others. It was you who ousted other contributors from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, replaced a lot of free images with those of unclear copyright status, revert warred about it, reigned over the article for months as if it were your personal diary page, and now come here to complain when Fisss does the same to you? --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 14:04, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

Editors can tell that something used to be on his talk page by virtue of it existing. His non-talk page-related warnings are nearly a month old and so I think they can be removed safely. If the user has new problems, the chain of warnings would be started fresh, anyway.

<p>I have left a message asking the user to stop, I do not think they realize they are making themselves look bad by these actions as Bigjake is allowed to blank his page, but I believe Cacophony is not allowed to start an edit war over it. I am sure Bigjake can even argue that Cacophony is breaking 3RR and he is not since he is reverting vandalism. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 00:53, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think the problem is that Centrx forgot to put the deletion reason or maybe if the reason was already discussed on some thread (albeit a thread that will get lost in the archive later) it got annoying (they bug admins and potential admins like mad about edit summaries I've noticed. It's like it's good practice and well I don't put those summaries in as much as I could). Maybe a solution is to restore it with the reason "forgot to put deletion reason in. restoring to put deletion reason in on next deletion reason." And then delete it again with the reason you gave, but shortened to fit into the deletion reason box or some diff to the discussion. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 20:32, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright, I know this isn't the right place, but I need some help. My signature won't show up. I don't know what happened to it, but no matter <i>what</i> I put for my sig, it always comes out as just the text I wrote. Example:</p>

<dd>Templates are things between curly brackets (like {{this}}). If you use a template (transclusion) in a sig, then each time the template changes, the previously signed signature changes. Since this would require the page be changed everywhere you have a signature, it'd put massive load on the MediaWiki software and bog the site down. If EVERYONE used a template signature on here... well, it'd be a Bad Thing(tm). <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 04:55, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think it was correct to remove the request.

<li>I have no opinion either way about whether admins should be able to close no-chance-in-hell RfAs or whether it should be left to the beaurocrats. Regardless, it's done all the time, and you should be thankful that it was. Voters tend to be pretty hard on someone who thinks they should be an admin with just 20 edits.

<p>Hi people, I'd like to report 86.145.55.59's vandalism. This person is not an editor, he masks his IP behind an anonymous proxy and flames editors in random articles talk page.<br />
He always act the same way, adding nonsense to discussion page, claiming that the article is atrocious, that the editors are pretentious and claiming that anyway he don't want to edit wikipedia. This vandal is really annoying as i've seen vexed editors answering him. By checking his log I've just realized he was just a vandal having fun by trolling editors. Please can't you block this vandal's IP or something? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

After which a few edits were made to some other articles to caumoflage sockpuppetry and then out of nowhere this user comes into <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> page.

Just check the systematic and caumoflaged sockpuppetry of <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">User:Sarvagnya</a>.

But, the sockpuppetry has been meticulously well-disguised, so that the culprit doesn't get caught. Just see how KNM comes to the rescue of Sarvagnya many times when Sarvagnya is caught in a heated fued or vice-versa. And not to forget, it is <a href="../../../k/n/m/User%7EKNM_6bb1.html" title="User:KNM">User:KNM</a> who reports about Mahawiki's 3RR violation. Their sockpuppetry has been well-disguised.</p>

Speaking for myself, my reversions of KraMuc socks have rested on the principle that <i>a permabanned individual should not be editing the Wikipedia at all</i>---certainly not the very articles where he got himself into such trouble in the first place--- whether these edits are made from an obvious <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppet account</a> for the banned user account or as anon IPs obviously representing the banned individual. Why take the trouble to try to apply this principle rigorously? My thinking is that if bad actors demonstrate that they are <i>de facto</i> free to create socks or use anon IPs and carry on as before, then they would appear to be justified in concluding that our behavioral policies have no teeth and have become essentially pointless. That would be very bad for Wikipedia, in my view.</p>
<p>About the "misunderstanding": I long ago noted KraMuc's "correction" in my notes on the KraMuc affair, although I plan to reread these pages in their entirety when I get a change. The notes have always had the form <i>"KraMuc has said X,Y,Z"</i>, with links documenting such statements, not <i>"X,Y,Z"</i>, and I have made a serious effort to stress this distinction in the notes themselves. I stress that from the very beginning (I created these notes some weeks before <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Iloveminun_bfb0.html#Keeping_notes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iloveminun">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iloveminun#Keeping_notes</a> appeared), on the basis of common sense, I have tried to stick to simply collecting publically available facts in a convenient form. I hope and trust that it is fairly obvious that the intent of these pages is to further the goals of Wikipedia, not to attack a particular user (banned or otherwise), although this would be clearer if I were left in sufficient peace to complete my planned essays which were to have used these documented cases as examples, since I feel a need to draw attention to phenomena which I feel are highly inimical to the best interests of Wikipedia readers, but which appear to be largely unrecognized. I think I've been fairly generous in voluntarily noting "information" he has provided in these notes after being permbanned, overlooking the fact that his habititual method of comment is to vandalize the notes or to leave personal attacks on myself in various places. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Things move on. At the time of the AFD I guess they were not notable enough, but in three months a lot can change, especially in the run up to an election which is only four weeks away now. An AFD delete vote does not mean delete and salt - if the subject does become more notable then it is ok for somebody to re-create the article. The unusual thing her is the undeletion, but I see no problem with somebody starting with a decent article rather than a bare stub.

<dd>From <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a> - "If it is believed that a significantly better researched article would be verifiable and otherwise meet Wikipedia article criteria, then recreation for good cause and in good faith may well be reasonable. This underlines that research and good writing is part of creating good articles. Also repeated re-creation of an article by previously unassociated editors may at times be evidence of a need for an article." The original AfD was in July and (IMO) was fairly close to no consensus. I discussed this with Malangali on IRC the other day, and given the evidence he provided then and on my talk page (including national and international news coverage) restored a reasonable version for him and others to work on. <s>Also in future Sandy if you have questions about my actions please ask me on my talk page.</s> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 18:24, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did ask on your talk page, as you know. It concerns me that community consensus decisions are overturned by one person based on IRC chats: this goes on all too often on Wiki. Should we now restore all candidates who are up for election Nov 7? Absolutely - you've set a precedent. Further precedent that process is irrelevant next to IRC and AN/I is being established. Yes, I do believe process should be respected, and individual exceptions shouldn't override community decisions based on chats that occur out of community view. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:34, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry Sandy, I just noticed you did leave a note on my talk before coming here, but you didn't give me very long to respond. As for the IRC thing, believe me I'm not part of "The Sekrit IRC Cabal", in fact I am usually fairly sceptical about decisions made there. This was also one of the first times I've used it, and honestly all happened was Malangali said that his page had been deleted and he didn't know why, I asked him a few questions, and asked him to post evidence on my talk page. If you really care and Malangali agrees I can post the logs, as we were the only ones involved in the discussion.</dd>
<dd>No I don't think we should restore all candidates, but this one is in a particularly marginal constituency and has hence recieved a significant amount of news coverage.</dd>
<dd>Also note that I don't have a problem with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, though it is only a proposal. In fact I mentioned it to Malangali on IRC and suggested making a page about the race, but of course he couldn't see the old Diane Farrell page to work from. I would be happy for this article to end up merged, though with all this bureaucracy she may well have been elected and become "officially worthy" of her own page by the time that happens. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 18:44, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I mentioned on Aaron's talk page, the bigger issue is why individual decisions are made on IRC, basically invalidating community decisions. This is the kind of thing that makes editors really resentful of admins. It also sets a very bad precedent: what is good for Diane Farrell should now be good for every single candidate who wants to bypass Wiki process by approaching an admin on IRC. EVERY candidate becomes more notable as elections near: that's why the election article is supposed to be created first. Perhaps I'm a policy wonk, but this is wrong. EVERY candidate is notable now, as elections near and coverage increases, the election article should have been created first, and the precedent of overturning community decision via approaching an admin on IRC is troubling. On a side note, I'm sorry for not giving you more time to respond, but you didn't appear to be online. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:55, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

I regularly wail to people who are trying to get useless sub-stubs restored via deletion review to "just re-write the damn thing." However, that <b>does not mean</b> that an admin is able to use his sysop rights in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Wub had restored this into user space, that would have been acceptable.</li>
<li>If the user had written a new and different article from scratch in main space, that would have been acceptable.</li>
<li>When something has been speedied twice by two admins, don't take it upon yourelf to undo it.</li>
</ul>
<p>A modicum of respect for the decisions of fellow admins, a little bit of propiety, and a good long think about the path of least resistance should have been applied here.<br />

<dd>[edit conflict reponse to Brenneman]: That is the sensible kind of response I was hoping for: my concern is when decisions such as this one unfold on IRC, leading one to believe that "process" may mean nothing on Wiki, and one should just shortcut to an admin on IRC. Since I still don't know what IRC is, that locks me out&#160;:-) A DRV on Farrell could have been put up long ago, without any need for the appearance of circumventing guidelines because of a last-minute, pre-election rush which sets a bad precedent and is prejudicial against other candidates, who might not have IRC channel advocates. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:28, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Not sure if there's some better page to report this, but this ought to get someone's attention to put it where it needs to go if nothing else.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.50.208.4.html" title="User talk:69.50.208.4">User_talk:69.50.208.4</a> -- Someone has been using a bot to go through and request password resets for accounts that are not his over and over and over through an open proxy IP address. The IP addres has already been banned from editing, but not apparently from causing massive email floods into the mailboxes of accounts it requests passwords for. This has been going on for a few weeks and seems to be escalating across more affected accounts and more requests made. Just in a few hours today I had some 200 emails alerting me that my password was being reset because someone, "probably you", wanted it reset... which would be fine if it was accidental and a one time thing ("ooh, what was my account name? me forget"), but some of these are some 65+ requests IN LESS THAN 60 SECONDS. It's like a denial of service attack kind of thing.</p>
<p>Seems to me that there needs to be a change in how these things are handled, otherwise lots of innovent people's mailboxes will get full. Of course I could just filter it, but Wikimedia really doesn;t want to be sending out this level of bad email. I know AOL starts to block the whole server after a while if it sees suspicious emails, as one example.</p>
<p>Banned IPs should not be allowed to attempt password resets. No account should be allowed to have more than one password reset per hour or day or whatever. And so forth and so on.</p>

<dd>Ah great, another reason to discourge people from getting usernames. "Don't register with wikipedia, your email will get flooded with 200 password requests a day."

<li>I must say, I'm a little puzzled. How could WP:BLP be relevant? He's saying here -- and correctly, I might add -- that Bush has been labelled a Satanist (and a lot of loony ultra-weird-religious sites have indeed said that, as well as some insane conspiracy sites, and some sites which combine the two), but that he is not one (the entry is in the section entitled "Mislabeled Satanists".) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 22:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with Jayjg, saying someone is not something is an end run around BLP. If we do not allow into the article that "Person X calls Person Y a satanist", then we should not allow into another article "Person X calls person Y a satanist, but that is false". Its basically restating the same BLP violation. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 03:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Personally, I've no compunction with Asylum being posted in the article, the beef everyone is having lately is the contributor 206.162.192.39 was a former Asylum member and his additions to the articles have no source merit to them, except based on his personal experiences. The only problem I've got is the accusation he makes about GameCrazy employees "buying up" rare games with high online value and selling them on auctions. Especially since 206.162.192.39's source is severely limited to one store in a whole franchise. Though he's attempting to make it appear objective, he has blatantly admitted to the company in general that he would purposely post the "truth" about the company, all because he failed in receiving a hard-to-find video game.</p>
<p>As a journalist myself, this shows lack of maturity and responsibility on 206.162.192.39's part especially when you read his own History pertaining to this article, he's not attempting in being informative but actually vindictive, and I feel this is not what Wikipedia was designed for. When I come here for articles, I want to be informed, not deal with editorial comment from a person who wants to ruin a company for his dissatisfaction. And though I've heard some members have attempted to go through your <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution process</a> with 206.162.192.39, he doesn't want to respond or negotiate, and he has made caustic, unverifiable remarks pertaining for his additions in this article. Here's some proof in his history:</p>
<ol>
<li>23:24, 10 October 2006 (hist) (diff) Movie Gallery <b>(I am no longer an Asylum meber or Game Crazy MVP member. Ask Mr. Asylum to confirm this. I am not bound by the rule anymore. And remember, this text stays in the history so you never really remove it.)</b></li>
<li>04:17, 9 October 2006 (hist) (diff) Movie Gallery <b>(I'm gonna print out copies of that paragraph and put them under windshields at Game Crazy store parking lots too)</b></li>
<li>04:16, 9 October 2006 (hist) (diff) Movie Gallery <b>(I warned you. And Ive posted extensively at the Asylum boards about this. They want the text gone? Then they can send a C&amp;D letter to me.)</b></li>
<li>01:48, 8 October 2006 (hist) (diff) Movie Gallery <b>(Lame Lazy failed to deliver on my FF7 special order as well, no doubt some employee bought it after I paid the $6 fee, hence my blabbing of Asylum)</b></li>
<li>01:44, 8 October 2006 (hist) (diff) Movie Gallery <b>(I'm keeping a copy of this text. If Game Crazy wants to sue me for revealing this info then let them, but leave it!)</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Not complaining, mind you, but giving you a source to go back on demonstrating 206.162.192.39's behaviour.</p>
<p>As I said before, I really don't care one way or another about Asylum or the MVP Program being mentioned, but when you read this as a whole, it really degrades the Movie Gallery Article into something you'd find in a tabloid or forum board, rather than a respectable information site where one can share their knowledge on information. I really don't want to cause trouble, but I do want to let you know what's really been going on with this particular article, and the battle really originated with 206.162.192.39's insensitive attitude. Basically, I'd just like the mods or admins here to explain to this guy that you don't go and "tell all" on a website, just because you can't get your way. Thanks for at least hearing me out, and I hope Wikipedia can find a way to resolve this problem soon.</p>

<p>I've come across an IP vandal this morning that I'm having great difficulty in tracking/dealing with. I first encountered him as User:64.231.54.40. As his contribs show, the majority of his edits were removing he: interwiki links from anime related articles. I blocked him to stop the flood, and spent the morning reverting him. However, I've now come across User:67.71.19.130. Same MO, same articles, same removal of interwiki links. I'm working on reverting them, but this is a fairly large number of articles, and if he's switching IPs once, he'll most likely do it again.

<p>Let me also add that this user quite possibly is the one who made a personal attack against me with a sockpuppet account (see my discussion page) which had words which stated my edits were "peanuts" and calling me a "dick" . Edit: I've communicated with him several times and he still does not take me seriously. See his/her discussion page; he/she was completely rude as well.

<p>I realise this may be controversial, so I'm listing it here for discussion and review. Danny speedy deleted the article <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleshlight.html" title="Fleshlight">Fleshlight</a> under the new CSD. As it had previously survived afd, a DRV was begun and is still running. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Fleshlight" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">here for the DRV</a>. Whilst that was still in progress, Phil Sandifer started a fresh Afd, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Fleshlight_%28third_nomination%29_10f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fleshlight (third nomination)">here</a>. I've speedily closed the afd, until the Drv has finished. Else we could end up with two contradictory results, and a resulting mess. I'm sure Phil was trying to do the right thing, but for once I think we need to follow some order of process if we are to harmoniously arrive at a result 9whatever it may be).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 08:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you were absolutely right to close of the the 2. Personally, I think it should have gone to AfD in the first place, so I would have kept that one and closed DRV. However, it did NOT go to AfD in the first place, so technically policy says DRV should happen first. Therefore, I can't fault you for the choice you made. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 16:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Phil Sandifer reverted me back to his own version. I think this is now a mess as the discussion is split between two fora, which may come up with contradictory results. If the AfD comes up with a keep, shall I open a DRV to review it? I invite someone who is not involved in this to try to sort out the mess. One of these discussion should be closed and stay closed.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree it is a mess. All may not be lost, however. The question at the DRV is not really whether the article should be deleted or not, but whether it was properly deleted or not (under proceedure). I haven't counted heads, but it is clear that a significant number of people think it was *not* closed properly. Since Wikipedia is not a vote, does it matter if those people end up being 40% or 60%? Either way, maybe the AfD is a good idea. So, we just look at the DRV as demonstrating the AfD should run its course, and we accept the results of the AfD. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:34, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Poorly phrased on my part. I've never doubted Snowspinner's <i>motives</i> were for the good of the project, simply that he often chooses to follow though in disruptive ways. In both of the cases I referenced above, he acted quickly, with little discussion, and contrary to the <i>status quo</i>.

My question here is entirely peripheral to the dispute currently at the RfC.</p>
<p>My concern is this: I warned her about blanking pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80675149" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80675149" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. She proceeded to remove the warning, claiming to "archive" it (but she didn't put it in her archive: she just deleted it) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80677128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80677128" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. I replaced the warning, and warned her about removing talk page warnings (an annoying habit she has). She responded by setting her Werdnabot talk page archiver to only 1 day, and then posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80685295" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrL&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80685295" rel="nofollow">this</a> comment, where she not only insults me (calling me "Byrgleturd") but brags about how her Werdnabot will remove the warning for her. I find this devious sort of behaviour deeply worrying.</p>
<p>Can something be done? Removing the Werdnabot facility from her talk page would probably be a good start, since she is clearly using it for purposes for which it wasn't intended.

<dd>Jeezum Crow how often is this going to come up, anyway. Vandal fighters like to say that removing warnings is vandalism. The user page policy allows editors to remove warnings from their own talk page.

<li>The point of a warning is not a mark on someone's "permanent record", a warning is a message to a user to stop behaving in a certain manner. If the user removes said warning, that should be taken as an indication of <i>having read</i> it. Thus, if the user repeats said behavior, it is time for a stronger warning and/or a block. Removing warnings is not in and of itself disruptive. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 22:18, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

No warnings were given. I'm fine with squashing obvious vandal/troll/POV-warriors with long blocks without warning, but a look at Lorenzo's history shows this isn't the case.

<dd>First, any block should surely be explained on the user's talk page. There doesn't seem to have been any explanation there. I'm therefore forced to <i>guess</i> that, yes, it's related to <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groucho_Marx_8301.html" title="Groucho Marx">Groucho Marx</a>. I haven't carefully gone through the edit history of the Marx article, but Perosi seems to have made the mistake of disagreeing with PMA. He may also have done something like 3RR (I haven't counted, and it's not what he's accused of), and he may, according to your taste, be too interested in anecdote or too prolix, neither of which is a blockable offense. The talk page of the article contains no argument that he has wilfully ignored. All in all I can't see any reason why he should have been blocked at all. The onus is on PMA to explain the reason, and also to explain why 24 hours (at the most) shouldn't have been tried first as a preventative/deterrent measure. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:03, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>As for the Marx article - that person was also the source of some very POV pro-Groucho material (in the ad-lib section) that was removed by another user. I provided a cite for my part about Groucho being senile towards the end of his life - I feel that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Evanier_96ad.html" title="Mark Evanier">Mark Evanier</a> is extremely trustworthy when it comes to matters like this and, seeing as there seemed to be no possibility of "LorenzoPerosi1898" backing down on his/her POV given their history, i saw no choice but to block. As for <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisanthrope00_fb54.html" title="User:Misanthrope00">User:Misanthrope00</a>, I was planning to put a block notice on her page but real life intervened and i was away from my computer for an extended time - my apologies. Also, there is no guarentee that if i unblock her that she will not return to her image stealing copyright infringing tricks - i've been with this project for nearly five years and know how much trouble such people can cause - <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">DW</a> for example - in these circumstances it is better to be safe than sorry.

<dd>PMA, I have a lot of respect for your 5 years service to the project and 3 years admin. But your reply above disquiets me. Regarding Lorenzo, you just <i>should not</i> block a user you are in a content dispute with, and the argument "he was making POV edits, I had provided a reference for my side, and I thought he would continue pushing his POV" just does not cut it for appropriate admin blocking behaviour. I see you have blocked a number of users for increasing lengths of time over the past few weeks for "POV edits and article degradation", including an anon who you blocked (for 30 days) 17 days after his previous edit. The lack of apparent communication -- for any reason -- around several of your blocks seems a bit disturbing as well. While I know battle fatigue sets in for all of us, I would challenge you and us all what we can do to limit curt damage-control actions to a minimum and avoid behaviour which make slightly misguided but potentially valuable contributors feel pushed around rather than welcome. And apologies in advance if I have completely misread the situation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 15:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Martin, perhaps you are right about "battle fatigue" - just i have learned the hard way over many years that with some people you just can't argue with - i wasn't always this way - i gave such people lots of chances once but it was thrown back in my face repeatedly, culminating in what Americans call "felonius impersonation" in order to defame me. What am i supposed to do about people like Lorenzo who ignore credible cites - Evanier knew Groucho in the last few years of his life and i footenoted his articles about Groucho's decline. As for Misanthrope - Netsnipe agrees that she ignored warnings - it seemed like another DW to me - i apologise. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> 17:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I wanted to bring this problem with user snowolf doing content blanking of stuff on Tamilnet. User snowolfd4 has come up ambiguous/mickey mouse reasons to remove relevant content from the Tamilnet article as he did for the Vellupillai Prabhakaran article (diff) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Velupillai_Prabhakaran&amp;diff=79903708&amp;oldid=79894526" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Velupillai_Prabhakaran&amp;diff=79903708&amp;oldid=79894526" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> (his justification then: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Velupillai_Prabhakaran" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Velupillai_Prabhakaran" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Velupillai_Prabhakaran</a>, after which he backed down following admin intervention ). We really need admin intervention.</p>
<p>Here is his justification for blanking parts of the Tamilnet article:</p>
<p><i>Sudharsansn the reasons are given in the edit summery. Thats not vandalism. Get your facts straight. Practically everything I removed is irrelevant to the context of the article. The international news organizations don't say sympathetic to LTTE website. Its plain pro LTTE website. That means they support the LTTE. Plain English. Not sympathetic. Support. And stuff like</i></p>
<p><i>David Jeyaraj a Canada based freelance journalist known for his neutral stance in the current Sri Lankan civil war had written that Karuna, was personally involved in the murder of famed journalist Taraki Sivaram</i></p>
<p><i>is just not encyclopedic and doesn't belon in WP. So again I'm removing irrelevant content and restoring my previous version. --snowolfD4( talk / @ ) 04:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>He claims David Jeyaraj's ( a journalist) statement (with reference) is unencylopedic, so he decides to remove it completely. He also insists on mentioning the LTTE with the list of countries banned in detail. Is the article about the LTTE or Tamilnet&#160;? But he wants to include as much negative detail about the LTTE in order to highlight his POV. He also insists on saying the website supports the LTTE, which is legally vague. Material support, financial support, political support what does support mean&#160;?? The best word as far as I see it is that it is sympathetic to the the LTTE. Furthermore he blanks many other factual statements, with relevant citations without even discussing it. Here is the diff (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamilnet&amp;diff=80561873&amp;oldid=80558808" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamilnet&amp;diff=80561873&amp;oldid=80558808" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamilnet&amp;diff=80561873&amp;oldid=80558808</a>)</p>
<p>Please also look into the section which labeled as "Time", because there is the added complication of old Sri Lanka time (5h30 difference from GMT) and new Sri Lanka time (6h difference from GMT) with regards to one of the allegations.</p>

He then threatened on his Talk page to sue me and to "alert me to the Anti-Defamation League" (though why that organization would care, this not being a matter of racism or anti-semitism, is beyond me). When I told him to not make legal threats, he then began to accuse of racism and anti-semitism (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crculver&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80812861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crculver&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80812861" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to my Talk page) I know that in the past legal threats have been taken very seriously, so I hope that my case will be dealt with appropriately. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 14:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The relevant sentence on his Talk page, made after I simply alerted him to rules against vanity or autobiographical editing is: "I know your identity and if you should seek to defame me any further I will seek legal action in court!

<p>Dear Administrators,</p>
<p>I am concerned about two articles about brands of rolling papers, <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambu.html" title="Bambu">Bambu</a> and [[Shttp://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/button_sig.png Your signature with timestampmoking rolling papers]]. There has been a sort of edit war between User:Mrtobacco and an anonymous editor for the sake of adding and removing a claim that the manufacturer of Smoking rolling papers did something illegal. Unfortunately, the only reference is in Spanish, and a Google search did not provide any more insight into the matter other than the article in Spanish.</p>
<p>I don't feel that an article I can't even read should be enough to justify damning comments about a living person or working corporation. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilliamJF_c8cc.html" title="User:GilliamJF">GilliamJF</a> 18:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have zero affiliation with any such sites. I am here to try to help and your nazi type approach has made it virtually unbearable. I copied some user icons to spruce up my user page and made the mistake of copying a user admin icon. I apologize no where did I claim to be an admin? I asure you I am here to help and clean spoam, and add valuable links that I come across on a daily basis. I'm not sure why you think I am someone else or own sites but I do not. I'd appreciate if you laid off I'm trying to be apart of the wikipedia experience and your constant abuse and torment is making it very unpleasant to try and contribute--<a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinsteinEdits_7b00.html" title="User:EinsteinEdits">Edited By a Professor of Life</a> 19:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My apologies i copied a list of neat looking user icons and that was included. Again i'm sorry what is the issue that you can not understand that it was removed, not put back, and apologized for. I had no idea how user icons worked or userpages i thought it was your own place to list stuff. Again sorry. As for other comments I have zero clue who that person is, don't see any links, don't know what you mean by strawman but you guys are really going overboard I was simply contributing, and have no affiliations other than being a member on one of the message forums I found useful. --<a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinsteinEdits_7b00.html" title="User:EinsteinEdits">Edited By a Professor of Life</a> 23:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for making the admin tag confusion clear. My point after was that when <b>www.tmx-elmo.org</b> was removed, because it had ads, the ads disappeared. After mentioning that the same group of links you have inserted and focused on here at wiki (<b>www.nitrousdirect.com</b>, <b>www.nascarspace.com</b>, <b>www.dieselsmoke.com</b> , <b>www.cocaine-drink.com</b> ) were curiously in a "signature" on another forum, showing their relationship to you, they too disappear after its mentioned. then my user page gets vandalized excessively, along with all but my contribs involving you. An amazing string of coincidences. A <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man argument</a> is a misrepresentation of a position.

<p>I've observed frequently few users like idleguy launches lot of personal attacks against her. She is the one of the political leader of India. They write about her personal life and quote references from gossips appeared in various magazines. They also mentions defamatory languages like that she is the concubine, she has child(though she is spinster)etc etc which are not relevant for the article concerning political leader. Could you please something to prevent such vandalism. <a href="../../../l/r/a/User%7ELravikumar_53a1.html" title="User:Lravikumar">Lravikumar</a> 17:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It appears to be a content dispute rather than vandalism. Some of the references you blanked are from academic journals, Asia Week magazine, and several other sources.

<li>It appears Lravikumar has mistaken me for someone else who might have indulged in personal attacks in the past on such articles. I saw that a certain user named Jjayalalitha had blanked the section in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jayalalithaa_Jayaram&amp;diff=78094689&amp;oldid=76943189" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jayalalithaa_Jayaram&amp;diff=78094689&amp;oldid=76943189" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and a couple of edits later I reinstated it and added more sources for the same. I reworded "conspiracy theories" which has an entirely different meaning to a temporary heading of "Secret personal life". I also provided credible sources for the "mistress" issue and can continue to point to other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jayalalithaa_Jayaram&amp;diff=27916098&amp;oldid=27915696" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jayalalithaa_Jayaram&amp;diff=27916098&amp;oldid=27915696" rel="nofollow">edits like this</a> in the past where I've blanked baseless allegations whenever this article does catch my eye. I've even replied in the talk page previously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jayalalithaa_Jayaram#blp" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jayalalithaa_Jayaram#blp" rel="nofollow">here</a> stressing that "Her so called marriage with Shoban Babu unless backed by a proper cite will have to go soon" and retagged the 2nd para talking about her alleged wedding as [citation needed]. I have given solid sources for the "concubine" issue and I can provide tons more if needed. (btw concubine isn't the correct term and was planning to change that until I was notified not to change for the time being) There has been no violation of any WP policies, especially concerning biographies of living persons. The contentious first para's statements are verifiable instantly, not original research and taken from multiple non-partisan sources. I suspect Lravikumar has not fully read the sources, half of which come from reputable Indian publications like for instance <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economic_Times_374d.html" title="The Economic Times">The Economic Times</a> or DCRC, a Delhi University research center among other esteemed publications which cannot be dismissed as mere "gossips". <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 18:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I strongly disagree with your view. Any mention of derogatory statements like concubine,mistress etc to be avoided on living persons. You can get umpteen sources regarding personal life of notable public figures.For example,I can find 1000 websites which makes derogatory statements about Bill Gates or George Bush.(There is a website which even says Bill Gate is dead.Will you believe it?).If some website says person "xxx" is gay does not give authority for wikipedians to edit concerned person article saying that he is a gay quoting that as a citation.</p>
<p>Any personal allegations regarding illegal relationship,dating,sexual orientation etc on individuals to be considered wrong unless it is accepted by concerned person even if there is 100 gossip websites writing about it.I wish Wikipedia to remain as collection of knowledge not as a collection of gossips. If we allow this to happen then each article on living persons will be flooded with Junk personal attacks. Jayalalitha is a political leader. I don't mind if you attack about her political decisions/political life etc.I even wish to develop consensus on modifying Policy on living persons to cite my views without any ambiguity. I can argue that each one of your citation is from unreliable sources. I don't want to indulge in edit war.I hope you will agree with my points and remove concerned section.--<a href="../../../l/r/a/User%7ELravikumar_53a1.html" title="User:Lravikumar">Lravikumar</a> 18:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You should have only blanked the page after a consensus was reached. More over, there is nothing called as Gossip Magazine. It is Magazine. And I don't agree with you calling all the sources as Gossip Magazines. You should note that the para is based on well cited sources, which no one in Tamil Nadu can disagree.</dd>
<dd>Point two. I disagree with your view that <i>don't mind if you attack about her political decisions/political life etc</i> Even that has to be cited and there should be more sources for that.</dd>
<dd>Remember that it is clearly given (in another article) that another Tamil Nadu CM has two wives.</dd>
<dd>If people go on blanking all that is not good about their favourite leaders, then we will have no articles in Wikipedia at all.</dd>
<dd>There is no policy in Wikipedia which says you cannot write about affairs. (Note that Sexual Orientation is different from affairs). See <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Diana_4f2c.html" title="Princess Diana">Princess Diana</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> for example. Of course, you cannot write completely baseless affairs. But the para is question is NOT ORIGINAL RESEARCH and should be maintained as it is well cited. <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 19:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Dr.Bruno/Idleguy. 1) As suggested in my Talk page, I will edit only unsourced contents of the page till we reach consensus on controversial sourced edit. 2) Regarding your comments on sourced edit. a) I did not mean she can be attacked politically without citations. b) Having two wives is not derogatory term.(which is also accepted by biographer) Alleging affair is derogatory term especially when it is not accepted by biographer. c) Both Bill Clinton &amp; Diana has accepted their extra marital affairs. So it can be mentioned. But same is not the case with Jayalalitha. d) I edited many pages of Movie actresses and other celebrities when personal attacks are launched against them. You can see from my contributions. Jayalalitha is not my favourite leader as indicated(I hope you also did not mean that Jayalalitha is my favourite leader and indicated in generic sense.I know you will talk only issue and not launch personal attack) e) Personal attacks on personal life are common against prominent public figures. They cannot see all news articles and refuse them. So unless otherwise accepted by biographer,we should not consider it as a source.(For example if you search internet, there may be 1000's of personal attacks against George Bush personal life. Do you think it gives right for any wikipedian to add such material in criticism or personal life section of George Bush). Jayalalitha herself launched personal attacks by using filthy languages against people like sonia gandhi,vajpayee,Janaki ramachandran,Advani etc etc without giving any proof. Does it give right for wikipedians to add such personal allegations in respective biographies. f) I have quoted relevant wikipedia policies on living persons in concerned article's talk page about why it needs to be removed.Pl clarify me if you feel that my understanding of policies are wrong.

<dd>The consensus among those that chose to respond on this seems to be that it is well cited and there is no issue.

<p>I just noticed something that seems a little too big for me to deal with. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=free-game-downloads.mosw.com&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=free-game-downloads.mosw.com&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=free-game-downloads.mosw.com&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0</a> shows links to a particular game download site in many articles, 50 of them so far. The curious thing, having done a small random check, is that they have been added recently, each time by a different anon IP with no other contributions. Rather than just wade in and delete, I wonder if this merits deeper investigation. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 14:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This looks like a job for the spam blacklist. And if those links actually do lead to somewhere where the games in question can be downloaded, that's bad news too, as most of them aren't in the public domain and still covered by copyright. Providing links to download spots for copyrighted games is shaky legal territory indeed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Actually, some were missed, and more continue to be added (see the link in my first post). I've done a few more, but when will it end?

<dd>I see someone is hard at work keeping up, and I've added a request for blocking. Here is something that might be interesting: the editor or program is currently working through their PC games alphabetically, and at the time of writing reached Ecco the Dolphin. It might be possible to anticipate a couple of articles ahead and (a) try rearranging the page to see if a robot can be tricked (just to see if it's a robot or a human; all edits I've seen have been at the end of the last section, but before the trailing stuff); (b) stick a warning in, though someone determined enough to use a different IP for each edit isn't likely to heed a warning. I also speculate that the web site might be creating zombies as people sign up (ironically, the "free" software requires a subscription). <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Type F. I have a suspicion that after being blocked for a week for repeated violation of 3RR, this user continued editing under the name twentyboy. My reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP 65.31.99.71's first edit to WP was to make a small stylistic change to one of Chad's talk page edits, and he started editing after Chad was blocked.</li>
<li>Twentyboy started editing just after Chad was blocked, and started off by posting a message on the talk page of Chad's favourite article, the "Randy Orton" talk.</li>
<li>After being warned by me for posting inappropriate content on article talk pages, Twentyboy started threatening me at <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html#Twentyboy" title="User talk:Yandman">User_talk:Yandman#Twentyboy</a>, but forgot to log in for his last message, signed IP 65.31.99.71 .</li>
</ul>
<p>I was told that this wasn't worthy of a checkuser, because 3RR blocks are not "community based blocks". This means I can't really prove they're the same, but the evidence seems pretty overwhelming.

<p>Type E asks for 4 diffs showing 3RR violations by the puppets. He didn't break 3RR with sockpuppets, though. He broke it with his original account, and then made another one to continue editing despite the ban, so I don't think E is the right type either. It'll just get refused with the rather laconic "declined" tag. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 11:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The same users that have been editwarring at <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</a> are now engaging in an editmoverevertwar at other articles relating to Turkey and Greece.

<dd>Hahahihihoho is a nationalist POV-pusher. He's also a young user. There's something disarming about him, and he has in fact been extended <i>vast</i> amounts of patience and special newbie-consideration, especially by kindly non-admin users, in the hope that the penny would eventually drop. My one-month block was a last-ditch effort, where I explained to him that if he hadn't figured out the difference between a blog and an encyclopedia when he returned, he'd be blocked indefinitely. I guess he still hasn't.

<dd>I started to fill out a 3RR about it, but I realized how <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">stupid this edit war is</a>. You can request semi-protection of the page if it's really that bad, but there is no acute POV warring or modifications of large amounts of text (it's one word!). If I were you, I'd contact the editors involved and encourage them to discuss the dispute on the article's talkpage (which, coincidentally, hasn't been done yet).

<dd>I posted on the talk page, and told both users about it. We will see if it helps any. A 3RR might need to be filled out about this, they simply shouldn't continue to do it (without making a compromise: which they have yet to do).

<dd>Ha, gimme a break, I'm trying to come up with a solution to the problem and you're accusing me of not listening. Choose your words a little more carefully.

<p>Why don't we set a rule that anyone that is to edit wikipedia MUST register his/her IP number or numbers? Whoever does not have a registered IP number won't be able to change anything on the wikipedia. I mean, wikipedia is already big right? If we want to make it better maybe we should start sharpening our means to access pages.Besides that is going to discourage vandals and we will be able to track down the ones that mess with pages.

<dl>
<dd>The username and IP address used to make every edit is already recorded, so that information is available to certain privileged users if required: that's how Checkuser works.

<p>I was recently visited and vandalized by user:aurention aka user:akusudo with oddball accusations, vague threats, and demands to remove all the user's "personal information" from their archives. I rv'd the comments, but here is the link&#160;: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Richardjames444&amp;oldid=80917170" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Richardjames444&amp;oldid=80917170" rel="nofollow">old usertalk page</a>] <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">User:bucketsofg</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">user:Wildthing61476</a> have also been vandalized along the same lines. This whole thing stems back to his hurt feelings about deletion of a vanity page for a little-known and non-notable art project of his. Various users tried to work with him to a compromise solution but to no avail. He has not shown himself particularly understanding of what Wikipediais about or how it operates. I am starting to resent his periodic vandalistic lashing-out, which is boring and tiresome to deal with, and frankly, really really old news at this point. If admins could put their heads together or have a serious talk with him, it would be appreciated. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 13:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I remember this guy. I don't know - something about a guy submitting an article *about* himself, and then when it's removed, wanting to excise all traces of the fact that he did so... seems disingenuous.

<p>Date: Fri 13 Oct 13:01:02 EDT 2006 From: ion aurent" &lt;.com&gt; Add To Address Book To: &lt;RJAMES@UDel.Edu&gt; <strong>Stop whining, get the fuck out of my life, my business and my art! I don't have time for your shit, your games and your harrassment. I have asked you nicely several time to stop fucking with me, and now it is to the point of really pissing me off.</strong> I have repeatedly asked this guy to stop referring to my name, project name in any regard, and have yet again edited his comments that refer specifically to me. I have the right create on my user page in a form of computer/new media art, to comment in whatever language or form I feel free to express in. I have done nothing to the above but request that he not mention my personal info. in his posts, but he insists on continuing this bullshit. I am not editing anonymously as there is no secret as to who I am. Yes, I attempted to expunge my earlier username and still prefer to, but this fucker keeps harassing me and insists on mentioning my name, project and username , all of which refer to personal and private info., and ultimately have turned to slander and libel, after repeated requests for him to stop. My use of language is free speech, I am an atheist, though spiritual I think god is the santa of adults, I don't think fuck is a bad word, nor nigger or white nigger dependent upon use ( see chris rock or george carlin) I was a white nigger for the 6 years that I traveled and painted my way across asia, and it was good. I don't give a shit what a conservative little twat thinks of me or my work, my use or words, symbols and expressions. I have no issue over a few teenagers blacklisting one of my works of art from wikipedia. I do have an issue with the manner by which it was done, the red-neck good 'ol boy behavior of their klan, the hypocrisy of their actions and continued actions. There is no reason for you to delete my use of combined words and symbols, and no reason not to expunge as requested. btw...on the advice of buckets, see comments, I attempted to drop first username and logged in a new one, but these gays kept referring to and using earlier name...so I am responding to discussions that refer to both until this is resolved. As posted by buckets, this is the principle upon which my requests to expunge and remain anonymouys are supported. Wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right if they wish to remain completely anonymous. Wikipedia policy on that issue is strictly enforced. Posting private information about a user, specifically their (alleged) name and/or personal details, is strictly prohibited as harassment, and users who do that are often immediately blocked from editing Wikipedia. Such posting can cause offence or embarrassment to the victim of the posting, not least because it means that their name, and any personal criticism or allegations made against them can then appear on web searches. If you have posted such information, please remove it immediately. Please then follow the link to this page and inform people there that the information was posted (but crucially, do not repost it on that page). An admin or developer can then remove the information from the archives of Wikipedia. If you do not ensure that personal information you posted is removed from this site you may be blocked from editing this site. REMEMBER: Wikipedia's privacy policy is there to protect the privacy of every user, including you.</p>

<p>The first para. is the money quote, I guess, as to defining where ion is coming from. I imagine that must be in violation of some Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 17:20, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, the money quote is that I'm fucking pissed off at the insistence of Richard James continually harrassing me, refusing to stop identifying my personal info. (as with posting my personal email above with website). I have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info. in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james. I don't give a shit that my project is not listed here. I found the whole process interesting and hilarious, though quite hypocritical. WHo can take the piss out of who here. THe article was about an art project, not me. I don't care that it's not there. It doesn't exist, nor does Bigfoot! His compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article, a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when, like a fascist pig. I could have campaigned for votes, but what the fuck...Before final vote and deletion, Richard James posted an article about me without my desire nor consent, and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when I jokingly said the first article is dead at another's insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days. He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious. His high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange. All I have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project, and the old username that I was attempting to expunge. Why?</p>

How is it vandalism to attempt to remain anonymous?! and to attempt to separate personal and professional reputation from libelous attacks?</p>

<dd>It's due to the nature of blocking being preventative, not punative. A short duration block is usually intended as a cooloff period. It's pretty much also the strongest signal that the community can give a user that certain demonstrated behavior is unacceptable. The idea is that with this signal and resultant cooloff period, it will prevent disruption through ensuring that there will not be "more of the same" at a later point (whether in an immediate or long/mid-term sense). With this diff, I really don't see a problem with the decision. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 23:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am sitting here with my head in my hands. I thought we had all learned something during the past several weeks. Giano's post to the RfAr evidence page was inflammatory, untimely, and completely unnecessary. The resultant 3-hour block for Giano to "cool down," while well-intentioned, sounds in some ways like an echo or a parody. The arbitration case resulting in large measure from the last round of this, which I feared would wind up as a complete nightmare, seems to have reached some reasonable conclusions (save the ban on John Reid, which I find troubling and may bring before Jimbo). To <i>all</i> concerned, do we <i>really</i> want to start all this again? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:42, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cyde, despite my previous admonitions, you and Doc still engage in old good IRC-style incivility. Given the background of the arbitration, Doc's block appears to have been a deliberate povocation. He was aware that the block will not have a cooling effect, rather otherwise, and he defiantly chose to open this can of worms again. I don't see how such admins may be valuable to Wikipedia. I advise everyone more interested in politics than editing to move their activities to IRC (where Tony and Kelly are already profitably employed). Please don't involve Giano and other contributors into your games. You know that they can't respond to you symmetrically. They don't have a block button at their disposal. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You want agreement? I'll agree with Giano's comments <i>about the blog.</i> That's what he commented upon. The blog became germane when it was allowed as evidence, and therefore the blog became subject of review. Giano looked at it (and I shan't) and found it to be foul. He was correct in saying that it wasn't a personal attack, because it was a blog attack. Since that blog had been lodged as "evidence" to attack him, I'm not sure what's so surprising. He felt that a person who would write so toxically was not a person anyone should thank. About that I have no opinion, but I find it disgraceful that an off-wiki attack can be entered into evidence, but no one can say that it's a horrible blog and that it shows a bad personality without being blocked? Why is someone trying to protect the integrity of an off-wiki blog? I have worse things to say on the subject of people who blog about their screen names than that, perhaps, but I'm a "primo don" (correcting the Italian, there). Someone tell me that the blog isn't a private voodoo doll, that it is somehow Wikipedia, that it is, in fact, a Wikipedia editor and not an extranneous artifact. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If anybody has a better suggestion, I'd be more than happy to hear it. As far as I can tell, a cooldown block is about the strongest thing anybody can do with the exception of an indef or long term block, which would be inappropriate in this case. In the mean time though, should wikipedia really be turning an effective blind eye to unacceptable behaviour on the basis of whether a user is established here or not? If the user is established and thus knows the policies, it just makes such behaviour all the more unacceptable. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 00:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few comments: First, undoing a single admin action is not generally considered wheel-warring and to call what Bish did wheel-warring seems inaccurate. That said, while I understand that one would want evidence pages to be closer to allowing free speech than other areas, I have trouble seeing how anything in evidence or workshops could require the need to be uncivil or make personal attacks. Unlike Giano's earlier comments that Tony blocked for, this comment seems to be a blatant violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and therefore the block was arguably appropriate. Also, whether or not Giano was blocked earlier for a less than optimal reason is not relevant to whether this particular block should have been used. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He needs either to be convinced to do so, or <i>indefinitely</i> blocked in order to stop it. The unilateral unblock went against consensus and was <b>completely</b> uncalled for. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>) 00:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar, if I recall correctly, you openly acknowledged that it was you who orchestrated Giano's previous block on IRC. I wonder whether the history repeats itself. It would have been interesting to have statistics as to how much time people supporting Giano's block spend on IRC and how much time people opposing the block spend editing Wikipedia. Then it would be clear what is going on there. Who is building the encyclopaedia and who is buzzing and playing power games around it. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, in light of everything said and the favourable concensus formed, along with Bishonens statement that she will not replace the block (on Docs talk page), the remaining question it seems would be that of who's going to re-apply it? --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 00:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before we start saying that there is "consensus" let's let some time elapse. Obviously, there wasn't consensus if Bishonen and ALoan were against it. Second, before we start saying there's a "pattern," let's see where that "pattern" comes from. Lar is upset at Giano, who is upset at Lar, and the "evidence" has never been ruled to be accurate. Third, it is the heart of the "contentious Rfar" that "cool off blocks" don't work and aren't sanctioned. Giano was blocked for <b>what?</b> He was blocked for posting evidence to the evidence page, while Cyde and "Pizzahut2" and Kelly Martin were exempted from all civility rules when posting a <i>blog entry</i> to the same page that called several respected administrators all sorts of names and which attacked Giano to boot. Therefore, if you want to suddenly thin your skin and want to police civility on the <i>evidence page</i> of an Rfar, and if you want to appoint yourself Patrolman of ArbCom, then let's get with it and block all of the people who have been uncivil in their evidence. So, this comes down to the following:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Justification for the block? Civility where the civility policy either doesn't apply or where it has been waived by the attrocious and absurd "evidence" "on behalf of" Kelly Martin.</li>
<li>Validity of the block type? None, as the Rfar has demonstrated with its suspension of Tony Sidaway.</li>
<li>Validity of the unblock? I'll see your AN/I consensus and raise it with an AN consensus against "cool off" blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the blocking was inflammatory (and therefore a form of baiting, according to the consensus on AN and the Rfar) and the unblocking was to reverse that wrong. This has nothing to do with whether Giano was <i>right</i> for posting that evidence. However, that evidence page has a precedent for calling established wikipedians "trolls" and "prima donnas," so it's already a charred document and a poisoned well. Any further blocking to "cool off" would be another example of trying to provoke, in my opinion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Forgive me Geogre, but you really lost me here. How exactly does the civility policy not apply? Is it open season on the evidence page? Furthermore, Tony hasn't been suspended yet--you can't cite precedent where it doesn't exist. Going beyond that, Tony was considered to be in a dispute with Giano, whereas Doc was not. Finally, you're mixing apples and oranges. Consensus demands context. There was a developing consensus right here, right now, that this block was justified. Let's talk about the issue here. The issue is that Giano is using the kind of language that got Tony blocked, and you're standing here saying it's okay. I'm appalled. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 01:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>If</i> the blog is valid evidence, <i>then</i> civility must not be applying to the evidence page. Secondly, Tony was telling people to fuck off, was calling those who disagreed with him a boil, etc. Giano called <i>a blog</i> nasty names. It's on par with someone calling Something Awful forums bad names: it's <i>not us.</i> To defend the honor of an off-Wikipedia website by throwing the civility policy at someone is illogical. I am saying that the blog entry should have been kicked off instantly. If it had been, it wouldn't have been sitting there for over a week calling everyone who took Kelly to task horrible names. However, the lack of action by <b>anyone</b> to mention it, sanction it, or remove it was certainly suggesting that it was time for someone to talk about that blog. Again, I do not agree with Giano's having said what he said, and I do not endorse his conclusions about the people in their on-wiki life, but I would go further than him and suggest that it's the height of pride to believe that your blog <i>should</i> be used in a case or the height of disrespect for ArbCom to think that the arbitrators will be moved by name-calling. Had the blog's use been sanctioned, I doubt Giano even would have <i>wanted</i> to say anything. Once it's there, though, attacking the blog entry is not attacking a Wikipedia user. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Geogre, you seem to be taking the position that evidence of incivility, if introduced, means that commentary on the evidence may also be incivil. I don't buy that for an instant. Furthermore, there's precedent that the use of inflammatory and incivil language, even if not directed at a specific user (which is arguably was, regardless), is improper.

<li>I am all for holding everyone accountable to consistent standards, however, IMHO Giano's post was not evidence, was not reasonable debating talk, but crossed the line into unacceptable. It was a proper block for incivility.</li>

"If this is the best she has to offer, etc." is clearly an enthymeme, with the implied premise that it <i>is</i>, in fact, the best she has to offer. Arguing that Giano should not have been blocked because other parties have, up to now, had a free hand to be uncivil and the block represents favoritism, cabalism, surrealism, or whatever is reasonable.

How was that vicious, attack-strewn post not censured? It was breath-taking. Also, if Kelly has left (although she's on IRC every day), then putting in a block for repeated personal attacks won't harm her any, and it would do a great deal to show that civility is expected on all sides. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For this matter, I would feel worse about the block if Giano had actually posted some evidence, but clearly that wasn't the case. The quality of the blog is not relevant to the arbitration case at issue. Denigrating its quality was a completely unuseful attack. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 01:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And just to add to that, Cyde admitted that it might not have been a good idea to post the blog excerpt, and taken some responsibility for it.

<p>Jesus, I go off to talk to a man about a horse and I come back and find the lights on and loud music playing and all of you wrestling naked in lime Jell-O. Why doesn't anyone <i>tell</i> me when the parties start?</p>
<p>OK, listen, everyone take a deep breath. Really. Do it now. In.... out... There. Doesn't that feel good?</p>
<p>Now then. To work. Without getting into the minutiae of whether Kelly's blog post was vile (it was) or whether Giano's post on the evidence page was a personal attack on a former editor (it was), the only point I'd like to make is that blocking someone who is <i>currently in the middle of an arbitration case</i> is not the best thing to be doing. If it was, I can promise you that there is at least one person recently active on this same RFArb who I would have been blocking for 3.6 minute stretches every 4 minutes. For fun. Until he cried. But I held off <i>because it's an arbitration case</i>, and because the arbitrators get to determine what is "too far" in that context. Generally speaking, I don't see any utility in blocking people for comments <i>on arbitration cases</i> unless they are engaging in behavior that is actively disruptive, as opposed to just nasty.</p>
<p>So please, everyone, on both sides of this question, dial down the indignation. If you think the other guy is clearly wrong, just remember that time wounds all heels. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 02:15, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Giano should have been blocked for a <b>minimum</b> of 24 hours, not to "cool down", but to let him know that basic standards of civility are enforced here. The fact that Giano has supporters among respected admins does not relieve him of the responsibility to be nice, or at least minimally decent, and the support he gets simply teaches him that he is untouchable. Well then, why should I block some anonymous lady for calling other editors liars, vandals and thugs just because she never had the fortune to befriend a senior administrator? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thatcher, I see that there have been good grounds for opposing your RfA. Concerns about your facile interpretation of the blocking policy are valid. You seem to be unable to see a difference between a stray troll (whose edits you cite) and a "high status contributor" as Fred Bauder termed Giano. Since incivil comments by non-editing admins are still allowed (see examples below), your denigrating attitude towards prolific editors will lead to massive exodus of quality contributors from Wikipedia to rival projects. Since I've never seen you active in mainspace, I don't think such a perspective bothers you, right? --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 08:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't <i>want</i> to see anyone blocked, even the anonymous editor I have been dealing with lately. And Interiot's comment below (the second one, at 04:49) hit me right between the eyes. However, I am at a loss over what to do about it. (It is for this reason that I never commented in the first Giano thread, and will probably avoid this one from now on.) Let's say we only block "when a user is in some way making it difficult for others to contribute to Wikipedia". Well, slagging off on someone is only disruptive if that person or that person's friends take offense. So should we all turn the other cheek, and let some editors make crude personally disparaging remarks? There wouldn't be any disruption that way, but Wikipedia would be a less and less inviting place to hang around. Or, if disruption only occurs when people take offense, then the disruptiveness of a comment (and hence, its blockability) becomes a function of how many friends the target and offender each have. Regarding your specific concerns about me, my approach in this case would have been to ask Giano nicely to reword his observations. It's a fair question to ask if the arbcom should really be thanking someone who writes such things on a public blog. And my opinion is somewhat different now than when I started this subthread, thanks to Interiot, although I now have no idea how to deal with cases like this (and will nothing to do with them myself any more), and clearly the 50 or so principles and findings of fact haven't helped a damn thing. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see no point in shouting that Kelly left Wikipedia, especially after reading the thread about "drama queens" on her talk page. I'm sure Kelly will return whenever she thinks it's time. From what I know, both Kelly and Tony are busy on IRC, where they may be more helpful at the moment. Since comments about "bitches from hell" are tolerated there, civility rules apparently don't apply to IRC and people who spend most time there. They are applied only to those who is active in mainspace editing. Nobody is disputing that incivility is blockable. The question is who determines which comments are beyond the pale and deserve blocking. As interpreted by Dmcdevit, Cyde and Thatcher, only defenceless prolific editors are guilty of incivility, while IRC regulars are given a free pass.

<dd>Either we discuss issues openly and robustly, or we have a maiden aunts' tea party. As with every subjective (not to say speculative) concept, the discussion of civility is prone to degenerating into mutual accusations of incivility (which it does below). It's very easy to hijack any discussion in that direction. You can't measure incivility by meters and tons. What is incivil for one person, is quite civil for another. Therefore I apologise to everyone who thought my comments were incivil.

<p>Usually if I can remove the personal attack and the user does not re-insert it, or if the PA was in the edit summaries but the editor apologized, I see the matter to be closed. Otherwise I act if there is a number of incivility warnings already or the incivility is really gross (do you really need examples of gross incivility?). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 06:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<a name="Proposal" id="Proposal"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive140_5e32.html" title="Edit section: Proposal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposal</span></h4>
<p>I propose we either set a precedent or start a process/procedure for blocking established editors for incivility. It has been shown that there are editors who aren't vandals, POV pushers, trolls, or spammers that tend to the incivil side and currently Wikipedia is giving them a free pass in its indecision and dislike of drama. Not that I blame anyone for that...</p>
<p>The purpose of this would be to make it very clear that Wikipedia will not allow gross incivility from <i>anyone</i> while ensuring that every block does not need to result in or result of an ArbCom case. If the whole thing is engineered to be as kind, but firm as possible, I'd hope it could prevent the huge drama which seems to result from situations such as this.</p>
<p>This is what I'd hope to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>A decision on what to put as a block reason that isn't "HAY LOOK AT [WORST DIFF EVER]" nor that puts the user in any <i>great</i> disrepute, as the block log is permanent, as others have said.</li>
<li>A set amount of time that isn't controversial, and a set way to come to the conclusion that the editor should be blocked.</li>
<li>No amount of favoritism as to administrators, bureaucrats, stewards, FA writers, vandal fighters, anyone. Everyone should be held to the same standards of civility.</li>
<li>An extreme disinclination to undo the block. Editors should ideally sit out their blocks and if they dislike the inconvenience should note doubly not to repeat the behavior. Current blocking policy says that blocks are not punishment, but if there are no consequences for being grossly incivil, there is no incentive not to be. Wikipedia needs to maintain a collegial atmosphere and needs to give a stern message to those who disrupt that, no matter who they are.</li>

<dd>My comments were valid and to the point. There are various civility standards for IRC regulars and quality editors. Incivility blocks are OK. It's just the matter of interpretation. I fail to see how Cyde's posting on behalf of Kelly was civil, while Giano's retort merited a block. Either they both should have been blocked, or both comments should have been speedily removed (as you just did with mine). --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 09:01, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your comments were not civil. Don't crusade to clean up IRC, when you can't clean up your own posts. And that Cyde behaved badly excuses nothing. 'Oh but he did it first' is a silly argument. Cyde has (I believe) aknowledged his error, I would have unblocked Giano the instant he aknowledged his. Will you please aknowledge the fact that your edit was most unhelpful.

<dd>I think punitive blocks such as these should never be done at a single administrator's discretion (that means, they should be discussed on Wikipedia first), as the block log is permanent and different people have different standards for what constitutes "gross incivility". In the case of blocks that are not meant to be preventative, there is time to discuss first, block later. Otherwise, unblocking will very often be justified. I have no idea how to do anything against the favoritism, though. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 08:31, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with incivility blocks for established editors is that they split editors into two groups. Established editors who are incivil are probably at the end of their teather, and if they find themselves blocked for letting their true feelings show they are just as likely to see this as yet another injustice as they are to pause and reflect, then withdraw their comments. Personally I would suggest incivility blocks only be applied after discussion and last for a token length of time (an hour, half an hour, something like that.) However I haven't applied one. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 08:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't applied a block for incivility either, but I probably have a higher tolerance than many other people. I agree with you that quickly applied blocks often just lead to more perceptions of injustice. That is why I think they should never be applied vigilante-style by a single admin's discretion. Separation of executive and judicial powers is a good thing, and should look and be more fair than having admins act as policeman and judge at once. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 10:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems pretty clear that there is a tendancy to say that incivility is utterly unacceptable. It also seems that some people have some concerns over the effects and the process that would result and be used for incivility blocks.</p>
<p>Personally, on the matter of Giano, I am now (reluctantly) giving in to letting it pass by now - it's a long time in the past, and this entire debate is evidence enough to demonstrate to him the disruption that can be caused by and from and the unnacceptable nature of his incivility.</p>
<p>However, it seems that this heated debate may have spawned some positive results in the form of suggestions of how to improve Wikipedia. It does still seem to be a little overheated though (I say after having just sat out a self imposed 9 hour block lol!). While I accept that neither RFC or ANI are usually the most ideal places for it, in the interests of cooling down and hopefully bringing all concerned back together, might I suggest an end to this particular debate for now, and that an RFC be opened on the subject of incivility blocks in (maybe) 12-24 hours time?</p>

<dd>The primary problem isn't incivility blocks, the problem is incivility and personal attacks, and people who tolerate them. We should not tollerate such, <i>especially</i> from established editors. However, we've still got people who'd rather wikilawyer and politic rather than condeming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Evidence&amp;curid=7140456&amp;diff=81062550&amp;oldid=80571004" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Evidence&amp;curid=7140456&amp;diff=81062550&amp;oldid=80571004" rel="nofollow">this type of thing</a>.

<dd>I'm not going to disagree with you Doc (really, I'm not. I agree. lol). However, this long after the event, I'm not sure a block can reallly have much validity. However, if a course of action is decided in dealing with incivility, then the tools will be there should this arise again (and thus, in that knowledge, this wouldn't arise again).</dd>
<dd>Only yesterday I removed a report of mild incivility from <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, and the user got back to me on my talk page asking what to do about it. Of course, the only answer I could give was that of "contact an admin if you like, though the norm is to reason it out between yourselves" - not so good.</dd>

<dd>The discussion should have ended when folks had set out their positions, which was yesterday.

<dd>On the subject of personal attacks and civility, I say <b>No.</b> There is a really good reason that NPA doesn't enter BP. There is a really good reason that I don't block for NPA. No one knows who determines the difference between an "incivil" comment and a "provocative" comment and a "debate." I absolutely, wholeheartedly, disagree with this sort of blind plunging ahead. The entire thing <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begs the question</a>. You cannot block for an incivil comment unless you know what one is. Bishonen, ALoan, and I all thought, for example, that Giano's comments were at least poorly timed, and I thought they were harsh, but they were not an attack on a person. On the other hand, Friends of Kelly see them as vicious attacks. So...where does that leave us? Does the most offended win? Tony and others were previously blocking people for <i>being angry.</i> No, no, no. Explain in detail who is going to determine when and whether an attack has been made, and then we can advocate blocking for attacks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Geogre, there never could have been a moment when his remarks were "well-timed." Futhermore, suggesting that the only people who seek his remarks as inappropriate are "Friends of Kelly" is needlessly divisive. I'm not aware that I've openly placed myself in one camp or the other; I prefer that I not be pigeonholed in such a manner. I would point to the recent precedent regarding Tony Sidaway as evidence that the "most offended" do indeed win. Tony's being punished for his "filth" comment, in case you missed it. I don't support a general blocking policy at the moment, but I do support dealing with editors who think they have a free pass to shoot their mouth off and make inappropriate comments. This isn't the first time Giano crossed the line, and I have little doubt that it will be the last. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 10:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>where does it say we block for incivility <i>without warning</i>? Blocking Giano in the middle of his (heated) RfAr was stupid, and arguably partisan. If Doc really, absolutely felt he had to invervene to save Wikipedia from Giano's venomous remarks, he could have posted a warning or two "I am going to block you soon" on Giano's talkpage. Protesting a "cooling off" block sounds like a sick joke in this case, and I am sure it didn't have the desired effect. Instead we are having another endless debate here. WP:CIVIL like any policy must be applied <i>with common sense</i>.

<p>What's all this about IRC? As my father would say, what does have to do with the streetcar running? IRC isn't part of Wikipedia. It's not. Repeat that until it's firmly ingrained. If people make personal attacks on the IRC channel then I deplore their candor and ask them to cool off. If people make personal attacks on Wikipedia, in full view of the whole world, I remind them that Wikipedia (as opposed to IRC) has a civility policy and that they should consider their remarks more carefully. To each according to its own rules. If I go walk outside and tell my neighbor what a horrible [gerund] that [adjective] [username] is, do I face arbcom sanction? No, because arbcom doesn't have jurisdiction over Michigan (thank heavens). What someone may or may not have said on a completely different site does not, has never, and will never excuse or justify incivility on <b>this</b> site. Any discussion in this context of an IRC channel is an attempt to divert our attention from things which happen on-wiki. I am responsible to Wikipedia for things that I say here, and I am responsible to freenode and members of the channel for things I say there.

<p>Geogre: I hope it's not coming across that I was trying to implement a means to block Giano as this was not my intention at all. Rather, I intended to provoke discussion as to how one could go about dealing with the incivility everyone seems to take so much offense to (cf. reaction to comments by Tony Sidaway, etc). I apologize if this is the wrong place to initiate discussion. However, the discussion of blocking established editors for perceived incivility had been started here, so I figured trying to begin constructive discussion in this vein was worth a shot. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 11:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I object to any attempt to suggest that discussion need serve a purpose. Shame Brenneman, for trying to silence discourse. Actually, no, I think we've long moved past the point where anything useful might be accomplished, but the precedent this sets scares me. The ability of editors to insist on on-wiki civility has been severely compromised today. All anyone need to do know is point to or claim "off-wiki" incivility "made him do it" and we'll have to give him a pass.

<p>Please note the hidden comments. Does anyone have any verification that this is legit or is just mildly clever spam? It certainly smells fishy to me... If it's not legit, can an admin roll back all of this user's edits so an editor doesn't have to tackle them all by hand? Thanks! --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 23:44, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've reverted his edits. I don't know if they are legit or not, but the talk pages of articles is clearly not the appropriate place for this kind of stuff. Talk pages are for discussion on how to improve the articles <i>only</i>, not for solicitation to help out with other projects. Jimbo certainly knows this, so that's why I don't think he endorsed this particular tactic. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:01, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cyde - I am that user with 136.141.2.76 IP. Please do accept my apologies for the spam. I have wrongly assumed that talk pages are used to announce related wiki projects (thus the name "talk page"?) I don't have any experience with wikipedia and didn't know that this would be considered spamming. Again, my sincere apologies are in order...Incidentally, what would be an appropriate way to announce <a href="http://www.WeAreSmarter.com" class="external free" title="http://www.WeAreSmarter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.WeAreSmarter.com</a> project to wikipedia community?</p>

<li><b>Absolute revert</b>: Forget whether the project is laudable or not, look what it says: "Wikipedia...invites you." No one speaks for Wikipedia, and "Wikipedia" is not a person who can invite anyone. That invalidates the claim by itself. It wouldn't matter if it were a link to Wheresgeorge.com or answers.com: serial promotion of any venture, non-profit, or informational page is absolutely out. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:45, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Concur,</b> and I've removed a couple other instances. In one of the hidden comments, the banner says, "The project is led by Tom Malone... and Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia." <s>I've heard nothing whatever about Jimbo working on this project, and WeAreSmarter.com makes no claim to this connection either.</s> Jimbo is listed as being on their "advisory board," but does not a Wikipedia-endorsed project make. (Even if Jimbo <i>is</i> involved, the spam is inappropriate.) I know there's a fancy schmancy way of seeing whether there are outbound links on Wikipedia to WeAreSmarter.com; I would suggest someone conduct such a search to make sure the claim that WeAreSmarter.com is somehow a Wikipedia project has been purged. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 03:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd think that such a project might be mentioned at Community Portal talk, Village Pump or some other places; perhaps even Signpost - but certainly not random article talk pages.

<p>The English Wikipedia article <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a> is about the company that provides audio CD track information for computer applications.</p>
<p>The founder/owner of the Gracenote company, Steve Sherf is openly "maintaining" the article, with Talk comments like:</p>
<p><br />
"Please stop reverting everything I add</p>
<p>This article is about Gracenote, and I am the founder. I know the details of its founding. I know the details of its products. I know the details of its legal history"</p>
<p><br />
Some of his edits may be factually appropriate -- but this seems to be unacceptable behavior for a company to be using Wikipedia as a public relations outlet.</p>
<p>In generally the article seems to be experiencing a traumatic life -- an entire useful section I added was deleted without explanation (though seemingly not by Mr. Sherf).</p>
<p>Is there some parental supervision that can be applied here? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.7.8.180 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.8.180_dc81.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.8.180">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not think its using it for a public relations outlet however if I had a company with an article here I wouldnt feel it right to leave in information I, as the owner, know is incorrect. If you look at some dif's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gracenote&amp;diff=81202772&amp;oldid=81119663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gracenote&amp;diff=81202772&amp;oldid=81119663" rel="nofollow">[116]</a> it seems there is criticism being emphasized that is of little importance and honestly original research. You can see a large dif <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gracenote&amp;diff=81099636&amp;oldid=81009396" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gracenote&amp;diff=81099636&amp;oldid=81009396" rel="nofollow">[117]</a> of a revert where some of the wording is being made more product friendly and some of the history changed. However its important to note that sections such as "Commercialization and controversy" are not showing a source for the controversy, or even if its legit. There is also a major issue where an incomplete legal history may be being used to smudge the name of the company, as the person in question Sherf has provided a complete legal history and the one being removed was limited in scope and did not expand further into the over ruling of a previous decision. You can see that in the section "Lawsuits" in regard to MusicMatch. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 14:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually, I'd be on this guy like a ton of bricks, but the snippets above sound like he's frustrated that some factual edits are being reverted. I don't see a claim that he <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owns</a> the article, if that's an issue, then I'd expect the poster to include that relevant data here. A quick glance at the article shows some room for improvement (in terms of PR-Speak), but unless there's clear evidence that the gentleman in question is trying to keep a wikefellow down, I don't see any admin intervention needed. Finally, and this is perhaps the real meat of the issue, I see very little attempt to resolve this dispute on the talk page. The Gracenote guy has said the above "hey, don't revert everything I do" and then there are two small responses but no back and forth conversation. There's no traffic on his user page either. Y'all are WAY far away from needing help from here, try and work things out together first. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 14:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After looking at Supreme Cmdr's and Warhawk's edits, the edit summaries and the actual edits (even the reverts) are extremely similar, a little too similar (Supreme Cmdr: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Smart&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81201432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Smart&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81201432" rel="nofollow">[121]</a>, Warhawk: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Smart&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81087694" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Smart&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81087694" rel="nofollow">[122]</a>). Since Warhawk's account is a little too recently-created to be innocent (12 October 2006), it appears that Supreme Cmdr is using the Warhawk account to sockpuppet, while using his/her own account to evade the current block on the Warhawk account. I would recommend indef. blocking the Warhawk account for sockpuppetry before this gets out of hand and a Checkuser is needed. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 13:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
As I stated to another administrators, which I would have came here if I had known how to...here is the problem, which I tried to discuss a resoultion to, but Gnevin, and Beaumontproject (who just joined a couple days ago himself) both seem intent on having they're one-sided, bogus claim on the topic. I'm one of the many editors from boxrec, though I do not speak for Boxrec, and I am a member of several other boxing organizations as well and what I deleted should be deleted as it is the POV of only a small handful of people that are fantatics of John Duddy...the Criticism comment is completely irrelevant in describing boxrec as they formed from an internet flame war that a couple of these editors started over on the boxrec forum.</p>
<p>Anyway, below is what I sent to several other administrators:</p>
<p>If I am out of line by adding this I apologize as I am new and do not know how to work the site and I'm just doing what I can to be heard, but I apologize if this is poor etiquette. As to the issue that Beaumontproject speaks of...I have already sent two e-mails to wiki administrators several hours ago about the issue. Please do look into it though if you have power to do something about it.</p>
<p>Beaumontproject continues to post criticism that is complete nonsense that he bases on an argument that he and another pal had from an internet message board which they now have a grudge against, which anyone with any research knowledge knows that a flame war from an internet message board is not a valid source.</p>
<p>Another editor and myself have tried several times to explain to Beaumontproject that an argument from an internet message board is not a valid source yet they continue to ignore that.</p>
<p>Being that you know the difference can you enlighten Beaumontproject that an arguement, or anything from an internet message board is not a valid source...he will not listen to me, or another editor about it, but since he has seeked your help then maybe you can let him know what is and what isn't a valid source!</p>
<p>Now the rules of the site state that editors should discuss and try to come to an agreement, but Beaumontproject and Vintagekits are only interested in posting the bogus criticism claim that got them banned from another site instead of listening to what we tried to tell them...that an argument from an internet message board is not a valid source and has no business being presented as fact. The page is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxrec.com" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxrec.com" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxrec.com</a> which it is normal now as I deleted the criticism claim. Though I'm sure that we could probably use the stats for boxrec that is up on the Boxrec mediawiki page as it does what wiki does and describes the site...but it doesn't list any beef, which is what Beaumontproject wants to continue to post. As I said I sent two e-mails to wiki administrators several hours ago, but if you can do something a lot of people, including myself, would be grateful. Again, I apologize if I am contacting you in the wrong manner.</p>
<p>Lastly, Below is the resolution that I offered:</p>
<p>Hey...I have no problem with the Criticism, but if it is to stay up then so should the Comment about the Criticism comment only being the view of a couple of people and certainly not the view od all wikipedians...that's a clear way to resolve the issue. You want it up fine, but I want it to be clear that it is only the view of a couple of people...can you live with that, or is your grudge just too bad to have a opposing voice...after all, wiki stresses opposing views in an article! And Beaumontproject joined only a few days ago also and the boxrec page and the John Duddy page is the only thing he has edited.--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 16:40, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A user keeps reverting a "sources" tag from <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factions_in_the_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_06af.html" title="Factions in the Republican Party (United States)">Factions in the Republican Party (United States)</a>. The article contains no citations, with only a few books listed as "references." An easy question is what book supports what claim?

(Seems accurate enough, but this sort of thing is hard to get up to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards, and this article doesn't even try.) Regarding the tag, I changed it to the new {{<a href="../../../m/o/r/Template%7EMoresources_7955.html" title="Template:Moresources">moresources</a>}} tag, which comes off a little less harsh while still making it clear you can't just have one source for an entire article.

<li>I've withdrawn the AfD after being alerted to recent page vandalism. There appears to be a content dispute over how sources should be listed, and some questionable reverting is going on.

<p>This user is engaging on a series of controversial reverts and page moves without any sort of previous discussion. He has previously admitted his level of English is not up to scratch for en.wiki. I tried to explain it to him in Spanish but to no avail. His actions are quite disruptive and he has failed to assume good faith insofar (i.e. accussing people reverting his edits of vandalism), used offensive language towards another wikipedian (<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanot_ef86.html" title="User:Joanot">User:Joanot</a>), who I assume he has had clashes with in another language wikipedia (maybe Spanish or Catalan, not really sure). In any case, even if he raises what he thinks are valid points sometimes, the way he does it and his behaviour is utterly reprehensable. I would appreciate if someone can have a look at his contribution history, before the problem escalates into any sort of edit war.
