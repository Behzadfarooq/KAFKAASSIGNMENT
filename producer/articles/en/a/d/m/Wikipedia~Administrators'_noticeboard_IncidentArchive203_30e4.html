<p>I returned less than 24 hours after posting a comment, see <a href="#How_RunedChozo_was_and_should_be_handled" title="">above</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=108751437#How_RunedChozo_was_and_should_be_handled" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=108751437#How_RunedChozo_was_and_should_be_handled" rel="nofollow">permlink</a>), and the discussion has already been archived. That's a problem. I consider myself fairly active and I come to Wikipedia at least once a day, so to have a discussion I started, archived before I got a chance to come back and see what people said in response to my complaint is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Even worse, I didn't get a response to my complaint. Please consider this my opening a complaint on this board. I'd like a response from the people involved in the incident, and a comment on what will happen.</p>
<p>I don't know much about RunedChozo's past behavoir. But, after reading everything on this page I am under the impression, and correct me if I'm wrong, that most warnings and notices on user space can be removed, and that's effictively, the response that RunedChozo got here--except that while people here were SAYING that, there were also reverting his edits to his user page to keep warning there and protecting his userpage so that he couldn't edit it. Those are some pretty conflicting signals to send.</p>
<p>If in fact users are not allowed to take warnings off there user spaces, then all administrators had to do, was make that clear to RunedChozo here. They didn't need to go and revert edits on his userspace--they could have waited for him to and if he didn't move from there, and they didn't need to protect his userspace. These actions were hostile and provoctive, especially since that wasn't the information he was being given here. Administrators knew that there was something going on here, they came from this incident report and went to his userpage and took action, and did so without leaving clarifiying messages as to policy. There were a lot of messages about the user, and the user's behavoir on several other issues, but nothing about what the user actually brought up.</p>
<p>This user's user page and discussion page are still blocked, and the sockpuppet warning the user was trying to get removed is still on the userpage. These discussions have been archived riduclously quickly and I haven't gotten a response to any of my concerns. I'd like to know exactly what the policy is about the removal of warnings on userpages and I'd like a response about the action take on the userpage that was provocative and contradictory to the messages that the user was getting here. I'd also like to know what administrators plan to do about the locked status of the userpages and the sockpuppet warning on the userpage, and why all of these discussions have been archived so quickly.</p>
<p>Please do NOT prematurely archive this discussion. As I stated at the beginning, consider this comment my filing an incident report in response to what I consider the overall gross mishandling of this situation and I'd like a reasonable opportunity to respond. Everyone else, please don't turn this into another fight over whether or not RunedChozo is or is not a ______.

<dd>Oh, and this is not the place for a formal "incident report".

<dd>I linked to RunedChozo's initial complaint, the discussion on whether or not to ban him, and, in my <b>first paragraph</b> I linked to my own discussion <b>that was still on this page</b>, but that had been closed by administrators. (There's an in page link and a permanent link there, because I knew it would soon be archived). The discussion on whether or not to ban RunedChozo, as well as my own discussion were both archived early by administrators. My comment was created because I didn't get to comment on the ban, and my comment was closed to discussion not 24 hours after I'd posted it, without giving me an opportunity to comment again. It also had degenerated into basic squabbling and finger pointing and was ridiculously off-topic.</dd>
<dd>The reason I posted again here was two-fold. One was that this whole long thing has stemmed from RunedChozo's first incident report here. I was not commenting on that--I did not really get an opportunity to because the discussion had moved onto his ban, and that discussion was closed rapidly. But I and others still had concerns that we wanted to express there and so we opened up new comments here. We would never have had to do this and we wouldn't be having an issue now of where do I post if administrators hadn't terminated discussions far too early.</dd>
<dd>The other reason that I posted here is that I'm not the only person involved in, or concerned with this, and I knew that the people who were, were watching this page and the previous discussions. Some of them also posted their own comments in their own sections after something earlier got terminiated prematurely and they didn't get to comment, or reply to a comment. If administrators strongly believe that halfway through an issue it should be moved to a different forum, that's fine; tell me where post and I will. And I'll provide a link here to let the people involved in and following this issue know where it is being taken up. I also want to thank everyone who did post here for not turning this into another fight. I got to come here and read nice succint opinions and get new informations and know where everyone stood and it was really refreshing. Thanks. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> 22:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</b>

I don't have an issue with content that doesn't require administrative assitance, I require administrative assitance. And I don't really need dispute resolution either. I don't need an Rfc, and I don't need mediation, particularly as the people involved are on the arbitration commitee.</dd>
<dd>There was an incident, and just because it involves administrators doesn't mean that they themselves can't fix it. First, MY discussion was archived prematurely, and second, no where on here does it say that I have to be directly involved in something to report it. I saw an administrator insult someone and then add a banner to his userpage after he came here to request that administrators let him not have the banner, when apparantly policy is that the banner shouldn't be forced, and I saw a lot of other abysmal behavoir, and I can see a person with an indef block and a locked page so they can't say that they want to come back, and the banner still forced up there, and I want to report this. Please don't tell me to go somewhere to report "an issue with content that doesn't require administrative assistance" or to get dispute resolution. I can't have a dispute if no administrator will answer me, and I'm not having a dispute--I want to report an incident and get someone to do something about it. That is what this board is for. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 23:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</b>

<dd>I also share this view. I don't have an opinion on the block because that is for sysops to decide on, but the user did come with a complaint and I was hoping that it would have been looked into first. If he had spammed, then he would be stupid to come here with a report which could well incriminate himself. If he had not, then this was the correct place to come to. Unfortunately, due to his past behaviour, the discussion got nowhere - and now he has one more excuse to complain. <span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt;"><a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">x42bn6</span></a> <a href="../../../x/4/2/User_talk%7EX42bn6_bd12.html" title="User talk:X42bn6">Talk</a></span> 16:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fake block and fraudulent RFCU claiming PSPMario is a sockpuppet was never investigated, as is part of the entire thread here. But whatever, coverups are coverups, and this is obviously one going on. Admins aren't supposed to do what Mimsy Porpington did, and his claim of "trolling" in his summary for his reason to lock the page is a clear lie.</p>
<p>Then again, for pointing out when an admin abuses his power, there will likely be a block coming and they'll remove this comment to hide their abuse further. After all, that's what an abusive, incestuous, cronyist setup does.</p>

<p>Let's see: Three users are indefinitely blocked based on what is likely a falsified CU report, multiple threads here have been deliberately "closed" or "archived" early as documented by Miss Mondegreen above, and nobody is giving an answer, satisfactory or not, to questions raised. That you are so blind as to continually try to defend the obvious wrongdoings AND obvious coverup is amazing. If anyone's a "troll" here, it's you.</p>

<p>You're more inclined to trust a tool that lists uncertain results, and people who don't give a user-by-user result but instead just drop blanket condemnation? I don't. I think it's being abused, and that it was abusive in this case. I think you're showing your own hand, trying to protect someone for some ulterior motive; perhaps you think it'll make you more likely to get elected to arbitration committee or something if you can show how you can abuse people and stand up for those who abuse power. Perhaps you're just a troll. In either case, you're wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I trust CheckUser more because those reaching a result on CheckUser are accountable and responsible for their judgments, unlike your words with no backbone.

<p>"because those reaching a result on CheckUser are accountable and responsible for their judgments" - which is why users can't even see their own results, why results aren't listed name-by-name but all at once, and why there is no provision for appealing that it be doublechecked?

<p>It's an expression we Brits sometimes use...</p>
<p>Let me leave a final comment on this matter. The most important fact is that RunedChozo has lied throughout the above thread and engaged in numerous falsehoods and distortions. He used several sockpuppets and was blocked accordingly. I've reviewed the evidence myself and there's really no question about it. As to whether a user is required to wander around with a scarlet letter prominently displayed; where the user has not been blocked permanently CheckUser has traditionally left this matter to the judgment of the wide community to be determined on a case by case basis. There is no hard and fast rule nor should there be. He's right, though: administrators <i>do</i> have an odd habit of "silencing" banned users by blocking them. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:57, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Always keeping an eye of this important article. I'd unprotect it after a day or so as well.

<p>Serafin has been evading his block, and has been continuing his disruptive editting.

He has been banned from both Polish and German wikipedias (sometimes known as Aserafin, Bserafin, Cserafin), further indication that his actions are not likely to contribute anything to the English wikipedia. if that wasn't enough of a smoking gun, I would like to direct you to a talk that took place between him and another polish-speaking editor, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_f606.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski">User_talk:Philip_Gronowski</a>.

Can someone please block all his sockpuppets to allow the normal editors with good intentions to continue on wikipedia. and if he uses another anon IP, perhaps semi-protect the pages he has been seen to frequent.</p>

<p><br />
I can't believe no one cares. I mean, the case couldn't be more obvious:</p>
<p>Blocked users must not evade their block. If a user does, the block of this user should restart, restart with an increase in time, or made indefinite.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerafin_4705.html" title="User:Serafin">User:Serafin</a> did not only edit a couple of times during his block. He has been spending the whole month in which he was supposed to be blocked editing articles and talk pages, including edit warring if he faces opposition.</p>
<p>He mainly edited with the IP <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.104.218.46_5828.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.104.218.46">131.104.218.46</a>. And surprisingly, he has never made a secret of the fact that this is one of his IPs (see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jan_Dzier%C5%BCon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91322461" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jan_Dzier%C5%BCon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91322461" rel="nofollow">this</a>). He used new accounts, like <a href="../../../e/r/u/User%7EErudra_1309.html" title="User:Erudra">User:Erudra</a> and <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnieg_41b2.html" title="User:Snieg">User:Snieg</a>, to edit pages that were semi-protected at the time. And indeed, he has never made a real secret of his sockpuppets, either - these had the names of his proven sockpuppets in the German Wikipedia after in November 2006 his main account in the German Wikipedia - <a href="../../../../de/a/s/e/User%7EAserafin_822e.html" class="extiw" title="de:User:Aserafin">de:User:Aserafin</a> - was blocked indefinitely. He didn't get his ends in the German Wikipedia that way, but he's pulling the same on the English Wikipedia and apparently with success.</p>
<p>Serafin's month of being "blocked" is over in an hour and he still hasn't been blocked again. Why does he enjoy some kind of immunity while others have to wait patiently if they have a time out? <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 20:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>He seems to call anyone whom he doesnt agree with "pest of Nazis that are infesting Wiki" whom "Never in" his "entire life" has he "sat at the same table with disgusting Nazis".

<ul>
<li>Lots of attacks on Americans, just see white page talk and archives, here's an example: "...I have said more than once that some (only some I want to leave this clear) Americans, Australians, etc.. think themselves whiter and more European than the European themselves. It may be just because they live in countries that have an intensive history of bigotry and they cannot swallow easily that they are increasingly becoming non-White nations (in my opinion much more interesting for that, but they obviously see it differently). Just travel to any US city. The country is no more "white" than some South American countries, and I could bet my right hand that Uruguay and Argentina are right now "whiter" than the US by all means. It does not matter what their statistics say or how their media want to present them on TV or in the movies. Anyone who knows the country well knows it. Their position is probably one way to steam off their growing inferiority complex(because of their view on white and non-white people). It must piss them off that some South American or even Muslim countries like Turkey are by all means whiter than their countries and nations. It is sad. They may deserve some understanding. A shoulder to cry on. So they come here with their risible arguments: But these are considered white and those not by my uncle! It sounds like a desperate cry to claim their "whiteness" or their "Europeanness" or God knows what....." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWhite_people&amp;diff=99836705&amp;oldid=99724357" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWhite_people&amp;diff=99836705&amp;oldid=99724357" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>

<p>A user (Bbrcadu) just blanked a page. I warned him, but does anything else need done? This is my first time warning about this type of vandalism. <a href="../../../z/b/l/User%7EZbl_af8c.html" title="User:Zbl">Zbl</a> 01:50, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, treat it like any other vandalism. There is a specific series of warnings for deleting content if you wish to use them:<br />
{{uw-delete1}}, {{uw-delete2}}, {{uw-delete3}}<br />
In fact I see you didn't use a warning template at all, you might want to check out <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a> for specific ('official') warnings you can use on vandals' talkpages. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 01:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Go along with what WjBscribe said, for serious content removal cases like blanking articles, you can use <code>{{uw-delete4im}}</code> instead. If he ignores final warning, report to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.

Especially since the user seems as unaware of the function and purpose of Wikipedia as the account name suggests. Would somebody like to write to them and explain?

<dd>Tanjaharlock1 seems to have contributed nothing but spam to Wikipedia; I've given a level-3 warning. It's kind of ironic that they're attempting to spam on some of the most watched pages in Wikipedia (George W. Bush talk, an RFA subpage, and AN/I); I would have thought placing spam on AN/I would be one of the best ways to make admins aware that you were spamming! (By the way, all external links are nofollowed nowadays, so spamming won't help a search engine rank any more.) --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 11:51, 19 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>Normancliffe claims to be a spambot in the edit summary. They're all clearly vandal-only accounts (and should probably be blocked), but something doesn't seem quite right about this. They're changing their behaviour sufficiently that I'm wondering whether they're bots or not after all, or merely someone pretending to be a spambot. The pages that they're hitting are the /w/index.php? sort (sometimes), and things like AN/I, CSD talk, and an admin's talk page; maybe it's a human pretending to be a spambot because they want to cause an autoblock on their own IP? --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:01, 19 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive203_30e4.html" title="Edit section: Nick Palumbo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Palumbo_ccd9.html" title="Nick Palumbo">Nick Palumbo</a></span></h2>
<p>I have a strong feeling that the one main contributor is either Palumbo himself or someone working for him. There are two actual users (one being the IP User:204.62.68.23, the other being an actual registered user named User:S noone) but the unregistered IP has referred to himself as S noone a couple of times, and being that their edits are strikingly similar I have reason to believe that they are the same editor.</p>
<p>Anyway, prior to my edits the entire article read like a publicity fluff piece rather than an encyclopedia's article; the article at that time can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nick_Palumbo&amp;oldid=104469561" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nick_Palumbo&amp;oldid=104469561" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Palumbo is basically an amateur fake snuff film director who is very controversial in the extreme amount of violence and the use of actual children in his films. None of his controversies were present, instead there were uncited claims that he founded the "Splat Pack" that later become Hostel and Saw; "Palumbo is considered to be a founding member of the Splat Pack due to the graphic violence and extreme misanthropy found within Murder-Set-Pieces." So far, no one has ever verified this besides claims from Palumbo himself; for example, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eli_Roth_4b5c.html" title="Eli Roth">Eli Roth</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Zombie_3ea6.html" title="Rob Zombie">Rob Zombie</a> have <i>never</i> said that Palumbo influenced them. Some examples of the more 'fluff'ier edits read "It seemed everyone involved with the film were ashamed with their involvement and hoped that it would simply go away. Everyone that is except for Nick Palumbo. This was his dream, and he was not going to let it go down without a fight." and "This was as gentle as a droplet of rain compared to the maelstrom to come with his next slasher film." and so forth. It just read like a really bad press piece.</p>
<p>I tried adding some sourced criticism. Nick Palumbo often spams the boards and is pretty much reviled. I added this, as well as a reference to a board which he frequented with subsequent reactions, and the anon ip removed it. I also made reference to the fact that Palumbo often twists negative reviews to his own being, citing quotes that he often uses in his promo pieces in comparision to the finished review; "Nick Palumbo often posts clips from reviews on his films, sometimes changing the material of the quote to suit his own purposes. For example, on his site he quotes the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a> as saying, "The disturbing "Murder-Set-Pieces" is a highly stylized exploration of the mind of a serial killer, a gory, bloodsoaked snuff film, reveling in its own shock value as women are stabbed, strangled, raped and mutilated in every conceivable — and a few inconceivable — ways" when in reality the quote went "<b>Aspires to be</b> a highly stylized exploration of the mind of a serial killer, <b>but it's nothing more</b> than a gory, bloodsoaked snuff film, reveling in its own shock value." He's attempted to remove that a number of times as well.</p>
<p>Another point of controversy was Palumbo using a real infant in one of his scenes, in which a bloody toddler is crying and clutching her real life mom, who was a corpse in this scene in the film. I added that "Critics have pointed out that, unlike other scenes in the film in which the actors and actresses knew they were in a fictional film, the toddler was very frightened and confused and had no idea of knowing what was real and what was not." This has been brought to light numerous times in numerous reviews as an example of Palumbo going too far with his 'art'. This was reverted as well, only this time the anon IP wrote to me "Cyberghostface, stop adding non factual things to the entry. Your input is not needed. IE. The baby's state of mind is unknown to anyone including a poster who writes biographies for fictional characters like Worm man on the X-Files.", a reference to my <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flukeman.html" title="Flukeman">Flukeman</a> article.</p>

<dd>Um, you still can't put things together like that. Just because so-and-so says Nordic peoples are "exemplary" whites, and you believe these people to be Nordics, doesn't mean you can advance (on WP) that these people are whites.

<dd>Are you saying that I would have to verify that he was a real Nordic by citation? If I understand your argument correctly, then there can't be any exemplary pictures classified by a Wikipedian; they would have to be classified by an outside source.

<p>Miscegenation? White man par excellence? It just keeps getting creepier. I'm seeing geniune Nazi views now, with division of white people into Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. Also his main source is some sort of white supremacist site.</p>

<dd>Claiming that you can't have a picture of someone on this article because there's no source explicitly stating that the person is white (are you going to next ask for a source explicitly stating the picture is of that person?) seems <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTy</a>.

<dd>I was just reading the article, and I didn't understand how the editors chose who the pictured whites are, it seemed kind of arbitrary. Then I realized that it doesn't make sense to choose randomly, since there are no sources indicating that those people are white. In any case, the reason I came here is because of the racist views that he apparently holds and uses in editing the page. He is associating the supposed "excellence" of the "Nordic" race to "purity." He describes some groups as "miscegenations," which usually carries a negative connotation. Adherence to the Nordic-Alpine-Mediterranean model is essentially racism, for the system considers (1) white people best (2)Nordic best white people (3)then Mediterranean (3) last Alpine. Also, the fact that he is using a white supremacist source (just read around that site it is very obviously a white supremacist site) as an authority is disturbing. I may have to clear out the article of all information taken from such a biased and unreliable source that is displayed as authoritative fact. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 03:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Foreign characters have to be allowed to support the upcoming <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Single_User_Login" class="extiw" title="m:Single_User_Login">Single User Login</a>, since many wiki users natively operate in other texts. Once SUL goes live, there will be literally tens of thousands of such names imported on to Wikipedia. So in short, foreign scripts in usernames are something we just have to learn to deal with it. Also, per foundation direction (and as noted above) one should not be blocking such users, though they are strongly encouraged to add a latin version of their name to their sig. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>MediaWiki only disallows usernames that <i>mix</i> character sets. That's why, for example, I can't have the username "Tiтохd", as it is half in Latin, and the other half in Cyrillic. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 22:46, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It would be a good idea to suggest to users with non-Latin usernames that they provide a transliteration of their names with Latin characters by editing their Preferences, as a "patch" to accomodate those who might be unable to read their usernames, which can just appear as a row of small squares otherwise (as they do on my screen). <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

Will signatures be something that a user can set separately for each project?

<p>The user Duke53 has made it his personal mission to add non-notable photographs to anything related to LDS articles. The most recent (that I know of) is a section in Undergarments. The photograph that he added, and insists on keeping in there, is not notable and should be removed. On top of that, I question his "neutral" point of view on the article, as his editing history is very heavy with LDS articles (and adding his garment image any chance he gets).

<dd>This is a user who has long had a weird tendency to switch account names very often. I've never been able to find out exactly why he does it, but he is otherwise a trusted wikipedian in good standing. Fellow editors in the areas he works in know him well enough that they usually recognise him easily in each new incarnation, so in most cases there's really no issue of abusive sockpuppetry. I'd have expected that he'd be clever enough not to let his various incarnations cross paths in illegitimate ways; I'll have to check whether he did with any of these.

<p>Its to report a poster who is making unfounded allegations against me. The poster Lulubyrd asserts that i have "vandalised" posts pertaining to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_Artemis_c72a.html" title="Children of Artemis">Children of Artemis</a> thread and the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lon_Milo_DuQuette_515e.html" title="Lon Milo DuQuette">Lon Milo DuQuette</a> thread has well.

<p>Hi Dark Shikari. What it is is that Lulubyrd has made an accusation in the discussion section of the Chumbley post. The accusation "suggests" that i am repsonsible for "vandalism" on the Children of Artemis post and the Lon Milo Duquette post. I have nothing whatsoever to do with this so called vandalism. The Ip adresses are recorded anyway. So i deleted the accusation but the poster Lulubyrd insists on keeping this in, to the detriment of the post. I would appreciate a ruling/deletion eitherway on this.Its in the discussion section under the sub thread "<i>Tedious attention Seeking Stuff</i>"--Redblossom 14:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am little concerned by developments in this case. I have taken a break from discussing this topic because of attempts to bait me into attacking the other users by <a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a>. These 2 users have engaged in the discussion, but have failed to provide any good reason for not accepting the edits suggested. Recently, Vsion gave an example of Huaiwei's previous editting style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASingapore_Airlines&amp;diff=99643681&amp;oldid=99641900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASingapore_Airlines&amp;diff=99643681&amp;oldid=99641900" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, which coupled with his latest hint of some geo-political reason behind his refusal to accept the compromise suggested, seem to suggest that Vsion and Huaiwei are the recognised owners of the page and that I should back off. Since in effect Vsion's argument is that the edits are unacceptable because they go against whatever political reason said user is hinting that he/she holds with Huaiwei. In effect, the argument is that the edits are unacceptable because they would make the article NPOV.</p>
<ul>
<li>In summary, I would like as many editors and admins to have a look at the argument<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and make comment, because the current protracted non-discussion is a waste of time when invested users can so adversely affect the collegial atmosphere of the wiki. I would also like to know what action can or should be taken, because I still think the proposed edits should be made.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakujo_a2c9.html" title="User:Shakujo">Shakujo</a> 02:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find Shakujo's comment unnecesarily inflammataory and goes against principles of assuming good faith in others. Constant accusations of "article ownership", "colluded attempts to attack others", even "political edits" are unsupported, unfounded, unjustified, and completely unhelpful to mediation efforts. May I voice my concern over what appears to be individuals who take it upon themselves to "test the waters" and insist on initiating certain actions in articles just to see for themselves if the purported "article owners" are indeed as obstinate as allerged by others.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm having some peculiar technical difficulties, namely, it appears that when I'm logged in, I'm not logged entirely. That is to say, when I try to edit September 11 attacks (article/talk page) I'm suddenly logged out. Really not sure what the cause of this, but it is puzzling… Could someone kindly look into this, since I cannot log to the mentioned talk page at all.

<p>Yes... "Jacob Peters" is a legitimate Anglicization of <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakov_Peters_3653.html" title="Yakov Peters">Yakov Peters</a>, a Latvian Soviet secret policeman whom Stalin called <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/history/autors/syanova.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fsb.ru/history/autors/syanova.html" rel="nofollow">"the last of the romantic revolutionary warriors"</a>. Undoubtedly this is where <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacob_Peters_0519.html" title="User:Jacob Peters">User:Jacob Peters</a> got his username, but the redirect should stand. Ironically enough, the real Yakov/Jacob Peters was <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Purges_f772.html" title="Great Purges">purged</a> by Stalin in the late 1930's and arrested and executed by the <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a> (although I'm sure our own revisionist Jacob Peters would explain away the fate of his namesake, since we all know Stalin wouldn't hurt a fly). So a ban from Wikipedia, by comparison, is a relatively benign fate. Plus, the real Yakov Peters was posthumously rehabilitated in the 1980's, so there's still hope for <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacob_Peters_0519.html" title="User:Jacob Peters">his namesake</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Is it not something of my own design, as Instantnood allerges (all subcategories in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Category%7EMacau_bb75.html" title="Category:Macau">Category:Macau</a> has similarly been standardised and renamed accordingly through community concensus many months back). Instantnood has consistently attempted to ignore concensus by reverting the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macau.html" title="Macau">Macau</a> article and made similar changes elsewhere. His blatant disregard for community concensus is clearly a cause for concern as well.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 07:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Could you please elaborate why and in what way did those discussions constitute a community consensus? (If I read correctly the first and second links, which are in fact pointing at the same thing, affected only the title of the Macau article.) In what way are the titles of categories comparable to titles and contents of articles in the main namespace? And why should official names of institutions like the Monetary Authority of Macao <a href="http://www.amcm.gov.mo/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amcm.gov.mo/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> be affected? — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As a matter of fact, names of institutions and structures are left untouched as of now, if you did not realise, so I doubt there is a need to explain the latter. As for the former, I do not think I should be explaining the existance of community concensus when all evidence points to this fact. Consistency across article titles, contents of articles and categories (<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_January_24_90b3.html#Macau_categories" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 January 24">Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_24#Macau_categories</a>) need no explaination, because the only explaination is consistency. You were personally involved in many of these discussions, and I am sure you are aware that the issue of consistency has been constantly raised.

<dd>User:Huaiwei insists that consistency has to be maintained throughout Wikipedia (and he also claimed there's policy against linking to redirect). He has yet to produce any reference to any Wikipedia guideline or policy, however. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 13:38, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If one may refer back to the specfic policy, it clearly states that this provision applies <i>"where editors have been unable to reach a strong consensus to support one name above another name".</i> This has hardly been true for the case of Macau/o, where every single name request change has ended up with a preference for Macau. This is strong concensus. The majority of wikipedians has adhered to this, resulting in the majority of articles being spelt with the "u". Only a handful of wikipedians, chiefly Instantnood and a few of his sympahisers persist in using the "o".</dd>
<dd>It is untrue to argue that there are no guidelines pertaining to spelling consistency in geographic names, which Macau is one. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28geographic_names%29_f177.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)">Naming conventions (geographic names)</a> specifically states that <i>The contents (this applies to all articles using the name in question): The same name as in title should be used consistently throughout the article.</i> When combined with previous RFR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Macau/Archive1#Macau_.E2.86.92_Macao" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Macau/Archive1#Macau_.E2.86.92_Macao" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, and CFR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_24#Macau_categories" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_24#Macau_categories" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, this means that collectively, the spelling of "Macau" should be applied in all instances of article names and category names, and should be consistently used within the articles themselves.</dd>
<dd>It is clear from the above that I act based on exiting conventions and the result of community concensus. So I would be quite amused if Instantnood's anti-community behavior is actually vindicated. I certainly hope this is not going to set a negative preceedent for all other similar cases here.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 00:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This whole "Macau"/"Macao" and "PRC"/"Mainland China" stuff has, frankly, gone on too long. It gets resolved in one forum (or does not, as the case may be), and then simply spills over into another, either immediately or after a brief "lull". It's especially vexing that this is now affecting template-populated categories, like {{<a href="../../../c/h/i/Template%7EChina-geo-stub_0058.html" title="Template:China-geo-stub">China-geo-stub</a>}}, since each one of these reverts then shoves about 1000 articles onto the job queue. These naming and categorisation issues need to get wider input, get consensus one way or the other on an actual convention of one sort and another, and remove the excuse of "lack of guideline" from poor behaviour on both sides. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:07, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've put a request for Instantnood to be on 0RR at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">ArbCom</a> for his part in this behavior and the rest of his hundred reverts over the last day. 2½ years of this edit war is enough. There isn't any excuse for Huaiwei to pre-emptively change the spelling of Macao, either. 2 previous ArbCom cases mean both sides here know better, but 'nood is by far worse.</dd>
<dd>FYI, existing consensus for the Macao spelling issue is for article title preferences and category names only. The preference is: 1. actual spelling, 2. the u spelling. Inline text is treated like any other spelling difference (Commonwealth vs American, etc) where either could be correct but generally should be consistent with the title or other text. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 01:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems almost overkill to have Yet Another Arbcom Case over this; I'd have hoped that this could have been resolved via community-supported action, if necessary with reference to the previous Arbcom outcome. YAAC seems likely to give us a none-too-speedy, and probably fairy heavy-handed resolution of the whole business. However, I suppose that die is now cast. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have said repeatedly a heavy-handed result isn't desirable. I've proposed a creative solution that would stop the revert warring but allow continued editing and input. The only community supported action that the last ArbCom case would end up with is a complete ban which nobody wants. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 18:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Well here's something you guys can do. Spend 5-10 minutes a day on revert-warring, i.e. go to Islam articles and revert them back to the most anti-Islam one you see there. If you do this a few times you'll know which users to revert back to. If there's an edit war going on you can really help that way."<br />
<br />
"... It's a really, really small group of people! There is a group of 5 to 10 hardcore Muslim apologists who are constantly slanting the articles toward pro-Islam! This is so dangerous. When people use google they're going to be reading what a handful of Muslim apologists have to say about the subject. There are some people fighting for good but we really need some help.<br />

<ul>
<li>the most significant point here is that on a number of these articles, there have been an extremely low number of editors ever involved in them. for example, on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a>, the activity on the article remained rather low until mid-Jan when Arrow740 made a series of objectionable edits, and that was the start of the first actual dispute on that article. as so few people were involved (and as the articles are hardly visited), or even aware of the dispute (i.e. pretty much only myself and Arrow), highlighting such an article in an off-wiki appeal becomes extremely significant. exactly the same applies to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_and_the_Jews_2a27.html" title="Muhammad and the Jews">Muhammad and the Jews</a>, where controversy only ever started during mid-Jan when Arrow740 started editing the article. the same also applies to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad%27s_slaves.html" title="Muhammad's slaves">Muhammad's slaves</a>.</li>
<li>furthermore, the posts on FFI seem to have been made during the same period when Arrow740 was warring across several of the above articles (mid to late January), as many of the diffs provided above are similarly from around that time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Google=Wikipedia" describes eminent historian <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Watt_a7c5.html" title="Montgomery Watt">Montgomery Watt</a> as "<i>a stupid Christian minister who wrote that Muhammad was divinely inspired</i>",<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35741&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35741&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[112]</a> which correlates with the antagonism displayed against him by Arrow740. some sample diffs, among others: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99498924" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99498924" rel="nofollow">[113]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AReforms_under_Islam_%28610-661%29&amp;diff=88113495&amp;oldid=88113078" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AReforms_under_Islam_%28610-661%29&amp;diff=88113495&amp;oldid=88113078" rel="nofollow">[114]</a>. in particular, the statement: "<i>who wrote that Muhammad was divinely inspired</i>" corresponds with this sarcastic comment: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIslam&amp;diff=99949566&amp;oldid=99932697" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIslam&amp;diff=99949566&amp;oldid=99932697" rel="nofollow">"God exists and Muhammad was his prophet.

<li>"Google=Wikipedia" reveals extensive knowledge over the newly formed <a href="../../../c/o/f/WP%7ECOFI_e394.html" title="WP:COFI">Criticism of Islam taskforce</a> (of which he is a member): "<i>Of course I know about it. The task force is for anyone who wants to improve articles discussing criticism of Islam. You see how vague that is. There can be no official group whose stated purpose is to promote an anti-Islam point of view.</i>" , and also states his frustration over how the group isn't active enough "<i>Where do you get your information about this? The group serves no purpose. It's founder hasn't contributed in over a week. I assure you that I am already fully participating in the struggle to make wikipedia tell the truth about Islam.</i>",<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=710408" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=710408" rel="nofollow">[115]</a> a group to which Arrow has been one of the very few contributors. the quote also shows that Google=Wikipedia has been active and actively in disputes for a while, as can be seen by Arrow740's contribs during Jan (and this month in fact). the last point is also exemplified by the quote "<i>Don't bother to do anything myself? As a matter of fact I spend tons of time on wikipedia almost every day <u>doing exactly what I'm asking you to do</u>.</i>" (i.e. extensive edit warring, as demonstrated in the diffs above)</li>
<li>"Google=Wikipedia" holds an extremely reverential opinion of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a>, whilst understanding that he is not good enough for citation on wikipedia "<i>In the history articles you need to quote historians, not (great) guys like Spencer.

<p>i would appreciate administrators' opinions and any appropriate intervention. thank you.<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am confused as to what difference there is between groups like this being organized and what looks to be a very organized group of editors that work together with Itaqallah who take an opposing point of view, and why Itaqallah and his friends are not also called meatpuppets? And if so is this not something that should be addressed with relation to both of them? It looks like Itaqallah and Arrow740 from the link to each of their contributions have long histories around each other and that this may be just the latest attack from one to the other. I will be open and admit that I find many of Itaqallah's edits to be less than helpful or possibly factually incorrect after reviewing the various pages he links to that he himself has edited on repeatedly.</p>
<p>Also, wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, is it not? If there is a serious bias problem going on, it seems one acceptable solution should be to invite people to come in and fix the offending articles. When Itaqallah links to a page that I think means there is a debate on when an article might be deleted, and says Arrow was "vote stacking" by inviting people to view it, I am unsure of whether there is any difference between Arrow sending messages on here and what would happen if people sent messages to each other privately or on another forum somewhere. There are comments on that page that if I am reading them correctly indicate Itaqallah may have been doing this.</p>
<p>I do not know all the right terms to describe it but I hope I have made my points and questions clear.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._f25b.html" title="User talk:One Elephant went out to play...">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_One_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._3fd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/One Elephant went out to play...">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I don't spend much time on Islam related articles, but based on the fact that this individual, whomever he or she may be, is outright asking people to POV revert war, I consider that trolling for disruption and personally I would suggest taking a fairly hard line against it.

<dd>It is very clear to me that it is "Arrow740". First of all, he must be in the list of "good" guys "Arrow740,Beit Or, Hypnosadist, Karl Meier, Merzbow, Proabivouac, Sefringle, Str1977". Well, I have had interaction with all of these editors and I can say with certainty that it can be only Arrow740. His editing style is unique. For example please compare "Become a wikipedian and join us in the fight!" from FFI website with this comment of Arrow here "By the way, a co-religionist of yours is being attacked.

All it takes is perseverance. Some of the worst Muslim editors have been banned in the last few months. It all works out. Right now we have the upper hand and I think we might be close to critical mass over there. If you have a good secondary source (i.e. a book by a historian) then there's nothing they can do. If it's a website then they can get it censored.

<dd>Let me remind you people, there is some difference between a POV and the 'ill will'. The users like Arrow740 can not be covered under the shelter of the justification of 'POV'. We are here for the betterment of human beings and not to sell the evil systematic campaigns. The most important point to note is that, its not so easy and frequent to identify a hidden employee of FFI in wikipedia. Once it is identified then it is the most right moment to take the extreme action to uproot such venoms. There are many Atheist, Muslim, Christains as well as other editors who are supporiting to take action and not loose the chance. Any learnt scholar knows where do the authors like Rober Spencer come from. Just look at the typical talking and allegation style of Rober Spencer, But alas people take that uncredible filth as a POV. In fact, it is not necessary to put some filth in every truth to make it look miserable, sometimes you have to tell the real truth no matter you like it or not and you cant hide under the umbrella of POV.<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualEye_6b62.html" title="User:VirtualEye">VirtualEye</a> 06:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may have more to say in a bit, but for now: I'd like to totally disassociate myself from any list of "good" and "bad" editors.

<p>a)Anyone. b)I am not as restrained on WP as I should be, but there can be no doubt that every anti-Islam editor shares my feelings about Watt, our FFI poster included. I personally find Esposito to be even more objectionable. c)Obviously, the fact that articles were listed (on FFI but not mentioned here by you) in which I am not involved but others are proves your argument to be hollow. d)Anyone who uses a search engine about Islam comes across that site and others like it eventually, including, apparently, you. e)There are a few editors as active as me.

<dd>a)not likely in the least, especially when they list other articles which are similarly visited very little b) your ridiculing of Watt on FFI matches your comments on wiki at around the same time. c) as i said, it is totally understandable why you'd be aware of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_China_fdc4.html" title="Islam in China">Islam in China</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_conquest_in_the_Indian_subcontinent_9cfd.html" title="Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent">Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent</a>. with the first, there was an edit war raging between Proabivouac and an IP during mid Jan when you posted. with the second, you're an "anti-Islam", Indian editor. such an article would be of prime interest to you, non? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 21:46, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>this response is a non-sequitur. why don't you try addressing the actual evidences? please re-read my report, i said "almost all articles listed." it is entirely reasonable to assume you'd list other articles that you were aware of but had not participated upon . the other articles you list: maybe you didn't list them in the FFI thread because you <i>weren't revert warring</i> in them at the time? in response to new user "elephant" and yourself, indeed we have a history. i have a "history" with numerous other editors, yet they haven't been meatpuppeteering as you have. i "obliquely threatened" an RfC, so i don't know what "an action of this kind" refers to. dismissing it as a "set-up" is ridiculous, and you know too well that that's your only line of defense. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While there is some circumstantial evidence here, there is no smoking gun per se and I'd hesitate to block anyone based on this at this time.

<p>I blocked for a week as an extension of the first two blocks. I view it as a preventative thing: he's been blocked 3 times now, and still hasn't learned to be civil and not engage in personal attacks. Now, don't get me wrong, if there's some sort of sign this sort of thing won't continue there's no problem with lifting it early. But there's no evidence that it will. Osgoodelawyer, the last time you and I got together was for Hanzo's personal attacks. Now, I realize that's not why he was blocked before, but it does meant that you and I BOTH have warned him about them before, and the extent of the personal attacks warrented a block IMHO. As for the reasoning, I gave it to him on his talk page, "personal attacks". I was under the impression he was aware of this discussion, that's why I didn't include a specific diff, but the knell was the "Are you stupid?" edit summaries.</p>
<p>My apologies Ozgoodelawyer, I completely forgot that you were involved in mediation with Hanzo, I definitely should have gotten in touch with you first. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 21:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I posted to user CWC's talk page twice asking him to document or retract his claim that Admin JzG called user DeanHinnen a "neo-Nazi".

<p>He deleted my request as 'trolling'. Twice. At least where I live, the term "neo-Nazi" is pretty damned strong language, and I would not use it, or accuse somone of using to describe another person without proof and great care. IMO, this defamation of a valued Admin needs to be removed, (the edit itself removed from history as he even used the edit summary to repeat his baseless allegations) and the editor consoled about making this sort baseless allegation, and possibly about deleting my good faith efforts to rectify his faux pas, as well. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a> 10:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Serious personal attack situations can be brought here when necessary (i.e., not whenever there is a stray snide word that would have been better left unsaid, but when they start to damage the editing environment). In this case, as noted, there is a pending arbitration case which complicates matters.

<dd>It wasn't, until CWC used it. Demands for retraction from FAAFA are, I'd suggest, pretty much guaranteed to inflame the situation. Me, I laughed at the silliness of it. In an RFAR marked by family sized portions of idiocy, that was just a nonsense canapé. If CWC wants to drop an "oops, sorry" then I'll give full credit for that, but I'm not about to demand pistols at dawn for a Godwin's Law violation. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, thanks for letting me know about this discussion — <i>not!</i>.</dd>
<dd>The term "far right" has different meanings in different countries. In America, it means Neo-Nazis and similar types. Guy, a Briton, has now clearly stated that he did not mean the term in the way in which a knowledgeable American would understand it. I react negatively when "middle-distance righties" are called far right, because it leads people to underestimate how nasty and dangerous the far right can be. It's a sore point with me. Guy says he wasn't really calling Dino "far right" in the American sense. End of story?

<dd>As this illustrates, "far right" and "neo-con", like "liberal", are simply vague pejoratives in common discourse. While I appreciate CWC's point, that it's useful to recognize the distinction between, say, Cheney and the guys writing fifty-page screeds on why a yellow border on the flag means you don't have to pay income tax, it's not a distinction usually respected in the US, to the best of my knowledge. Jumping on Guy and yelling "admin abuse!" for failing to respect a distinction that 99% of *everyone* fails to respect strikes me as, frankly, unconstructive. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 21:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Done, although I can't get the article's history to load correctly. I deleted the page then restored all versions up to the offending one. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 21:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
