<p>I have been doing some small investigations, and I know exactly where to look. Certain people, mainly admins, are taking a decidedly adversarial stance with users, when coaching is what is needed. HRM would not tolerate this in a large Corporation. The result is that decent people are being driven away. I look at certain people's talk pages, see repeated confrontations, and blocking, when the admin can't get his (yes usually his) way. I look at the other party's user page, and guess what... "I've had enough." "I'll never come back" etc". The good work that many many people, both admins and users, in building up morale is being quickly dissipated by a few bad eggs. This CAN be rectified NOW. What are you going to do about it, guys? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 20:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Really, Wikipedia is unusually polite with vandals. First they get the nice {{test}} message, and then the {{test2}} message, and only by the time things reach {{test3}} are the messages even threatening. Then they're blocked for maybe 24 hours. It takes major obnoxiousness to be blocked for an extended period. If anything, the ease of repeat vandalism is driving away serious editors. There are articles that have to be fixed several times a day, every day. This is bad for morale. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 07:34, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I clearly agree and empathize with that. I guess that admins get upset and have morale lows too.</dd>
<dd>The main point I wanted to discuss was that people are getting banned or as least annoyed over edit wars in which an admin or his (usually) friend is one of the participants. If an admin disagrees with another editor, irrespective of who is right, the admin pulls rank and bans, warns, or is insulting to the competitor. The other person feels very hurt, as one does when slapped down by your Line Manager. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 07:42, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wallie is complaining about the banning of User:Aidan Work, who in his brief time here engaged in personal abuse, homophobic rants, widescale vandalism, posting libellous comments on his talk page about a politician (I think it was) and insulting everyone who wouldn't let him write in extreme right wing POVs into articles or wouldn't let him delete non-extreme right wing edits. Work was finally axed after a reign of abuse. Wallie doesn't seem to understand the scale of Worth's behaviour and thinks that a gang of nasty admins ganged up on poor elderly Mr. Work, beat him up and kicked him off ruthlessly. Some incautious comments were made about Worth by some users in sheer frustration at his abuse of them (often he laced those comments with <i>extreme</i> homophobia and rascism). Adam called him a "homophobic slimeball". That user may well have been tactless and offensive, but given Work's comments against gays (and everyone else to the left of the KKK) it pretty much summed him up. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 09:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope. OK. I will be a little specific, while not going into too many grubby details. I was objecting to one particular guy who I though was still trailing after Aidan, baiting him, and I thought gloating. I hate that sort of thing. Yes, I had crossed swords with him in the past too. In Aidans case, I always say if you do the crime you do the time. No more no less. As for the slimeball remark, I was just using this as an example that we can all get annoyed at times when baited. I can fully understand why he said it. It is the baitor I have an issue with, not the baitee. The "victims" I referred to in this section do not include Aidan. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 20:17, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Reply to Wally): When you have concrete cases of admin abuse bring them here. As you may have noticed, Wikipedia is not a corporation, but an encyclopedia. We do not have a strong hierarchy. Essentially, everybody who has been around productively for a time can become an admin. If some admins "pull rank", they are wrong. I have not, however, experienced that more than once or twice in my 2.5 years on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Some points here, in response to Wallie: (1). If you compare Wikipedia to other community-type websites, you'll find that we're actually more tolerant than most when it comes to not blocking/banning users. For all but the most egregious offences, we give warnings (usually several) before blocking. That's more than, say, the average video game forum will do. (2). Wikipedia cannot really be compared to a corporation, as corporations often have high employee-acquisition costs. However, you'll find that corporations are pretty quick to get rid of bad employees too. If FearÉIREANN's statement above is true, and you're posting to protest the banning of someone for homophobic and/or racist remarks, then you'll find that coporations have NO tolerance for that sort of crap. (3). An admin taking a bad user under his wing and slowly but surely rehabilitating them and turning them good is a nice story, but it's basically just that: a story. Admins don't get paid here, and most of us have jobs and/or school and social lives outside of Wikipedia. Homophobic and racist feelings tend to run very deep, and getting rid of them could take years even for a trained counsellor, which wikipedia admins generally are not. We can't expect to purge the world of all its racists, homophobes, or other miscelleneous bad guys through "coaching". What we're here to do is make a great free encyclopedia, with as little trouble as possible. No more, no less. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi. Just to clarify. I was not actually thinking about the case that Jtdirl is mentioning. That is a separate issue, and is definitely outside the scope of the issue here. I also agree that you can't have as you say "this sort of crap", and I don't think admins should have to or are up to counselling of that sort. I am not suggesting that either. That is the dilemma... if I make a general inquiry, it is up to interpretation - someone may get the wrong idea. If I give a specific example, then attention gets diverted onto that case, and everyone focuses on that, and not the general issue. Anyway, back to the topic. This is meant to be a <b>general observation</b>, not a specific case study. Thank you. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 19:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok. Our way of dealing with the general problem is to look at each case individually - for simple cases by discussion here, or through <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">conflict resolution</a>.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 20:08, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What it comes down to, I think, is whether "coaching" is really a task suitable for administrators. Let's imagine a possible scenario: I'm patrolling recent changes, and come across the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_d548.html" title="Martin Luther King">Martin Luther King</a> article, which a vandal has blanked and replaced with racist remarks. What would my most reasonable response be? (1) To revert and warn the user, then block if it reoccurs? (2) Or to take the user under my wing, try to find the reason for his hostility toward blacks, and through tender care and love, rehabilitate him into a respnsible citizen? Even if successful, the second option would be an enormous investment in time, which in my case would be better served writing and editing articles. At the very least, to expect "coaching" from admins is asking a lot. Worse still, it could actually make the situation worse, as few admins are trained counsellors or therapists, and few have the qualifications necessary to properly rehabilitate miscreants. What if I did try to coach the imaginary MLK vandal, and botched the job so badly that he went from vandalising wiki pages to burning down black churches? Wouldn't that be partly my own fault? The responsibility of transorming wayward people lies with their own parents, school guidance counsellors, church leaders, etc. It's unfair (to say the least) to expect website admins to do the job. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:35, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He keeps removing a link on <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Brinker_0954.html" title="Bob Brinker">Bob Brinker</a> that is critical of Brinker. A short history: another user was adding multiple critical links, all to the same website. I reduced it to just one link for balance and to keep the article neutral. Other user seems fine with that now. Redjax888 was blocked for removing all user comments on the talk page (seven times), but he was also removing anything critical of Brinker on the article page, and he's doing it again with this IP, I think, evading the block. I have no horse in this race - I just happened to be on vandalism patrol and have spent a week trying to keep a balance between two edit warring editors who don't seem to know much about Wikipedia, except that they can edit as often as they want.

<p>For the record, someone acting much like Redjax88 is continuing to delete the same material at <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Brinker_0954.html" title="Bob Brinker">Bob Brinker</a>.

<p>There's some weird anti-anti-userbox movement being formed here. For all intents and purposes it looks like a simple vote-stacking campaign designed to disrupt our consensus-seeking processes. I'm not going to deal with it myself because they seem to have singled me out personally as the enemy, but obviously this isn't the kind of thing we need to put up with at Wikipedia. They also have a signature, welcome message, recruitment message, and rejection message (in case you don't get into their little club!). Here's the message he's using on his userpage to advertise this crusade (his words): <i>You have been invited to join Fredil Yupigo's crusade against the mass deletion of userboxes. Click here to add your name to the list. (Created March 16)</i> They also have their own userbox. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:12, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

He was blocked for 3RR on the 21st by Katefan. An obvious sockpupppet apeared, <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarroteater117_5df6.html" title="User:Carroteater117">User:Carroteater117</a>, which I blocked indef and extended TMECM's block - another appeared, <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFooltocry_0811.html" title="User:Fooltocry">User:Fooltocry</a>, I again extended the block and warned him that the next sockpuppet would result in an indefinite block - lo and behold, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeway_80b3.html" title="User:Freeway">User:Freeway</a> appeared and carried on the same editing pattern.</p>
<p>TMECM claims on his talk page that the sockpuppeteer is someone else. There are numerous edits from a different IP contacting him on his talk page purporting to be from the 'second man', and he has exhorted me/us to lookup the IPs he gives and see that they come from different countries. However, by ruling of Arbcom, "For the purpose of dispute resolution when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iasson#One_user_or_several.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iasson#One_user_or_several.3F" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> That most definitely applies here (and on a personal level I haven't had any complaints applying it to <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoeCroydon_9af0.html" title="User:ZoeCroydon">ZoeCroydon</a>, who also used an open proxy and boasted about how his IPs proved he wasn't a sockpuppeteer). <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> agrees with me on this and has endorsed my indefinite block. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=54668771&amp;oldid=54668655" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=54668771&amp;oldid=54668655" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>
<p>So, in summary: notorious international troll, edits indicate that he intends to do the same here as he did on the two Norse Wikipedias, obvious sockpuppetry, I consider him to have exhausted this community's patience as he already has two others'.

<dd>Maybe someone uninvolved should go through the recent stack of speedy keeps of Jewish this-and-thats and re-nominate the obvious deletion candidates on AfD.

<dd>Nominating major Hasidic Rebbes with random summer camos was <i>something</i> of a faux-pas. Anyone remember Asterix on Corsica, when Asterix and Obelix are in that cave and Obelix mistakes a Corsican chieftain for a boar? ("Never had Corsican chieftain for dinner, and please don't stare at me like that, it gives me a headache!") Per Kim's suggestion I'll go and close all of PZFUN's nominations and will then re-list the non-controversial ones with a suitable note. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 22:50, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re Zoe above - Frankly, I am appalled at how a well-meaning, experienced editor on Wikipedia can be accused of poor faith to the degree that they feel it necessary to leave Wikipedia, when merely carrying out a task that is perfectly legitimate and in pursuit of improving the editorial quality of the articles in question. To accuse PZFUN of a "campaign" is quite wrong; it was merely a case of having "cleaned out" articles from a particular category, that did not otherwise conform to Wikipedia editorial standards such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, etc. I supported PZFUN in his deletions of the various articles, because I agreed with him about them, and we'd talked about them on IRC. I'm not terribly happy with many of the nominations being speedy delisted especially since some had already received delete votes from other participants. I think Dr Zak is correct in his suggestion above. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 22:10, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am greatly disturbed by the accusations made about me for stub-cleaning. While some have chosen to view such pruning as an attack on their religion, such a conclusion is entirely erroneous. I am not an anti-Semite. My grandfather is a Holocaust survivor, and I have no place in my life for anti-Semitism. That being said, I am greatly disturbed that nominating articles that do not meet any of the current Wikipedia criteria for inclusion as an article, notably <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_98cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference">referencing</a> has been met with such hostility and anger solely because the articles pertain to Judiasm. As a thank-you for trying to clean up some of the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">JudaismCruft</a> to be found in [[Category:Judaism stubs]] and other related categories, I have been extremely angrily attacked and had accusations levelled against me that I have either been a Crusader, a POV-pusher, an anti-Semite, etc, all of which are bogus. The only <a href="../../../p/o/i/Wikipedia%7EPOINT_9f2b.html" title="Wikipedia:POINT">WP:POINT</a> I had to make was that there are a lot articles related to Judaism on Wikipedia that do not meet any critera for inclusion. If that is a POINT made in bad faith, as I have so been accused, then Wikipedia is in a far more unhealthy place than I ever thought possible.</p>
<p>At no point were other users unable to make their views known in a healthy, non-confrontational manner on all of the AfD pages, on my talk page, or anywhere else: had I really wanted to make a POV-push or make a POINT, I would have circumvented community imput and listed them as Speedy candidates or just deleted them myself. Yet I remain deeply disturbed by the lack of regard for one of the few policies that have yet to make an appearance in this debate: <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_ae91.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership">Wikipedia:Ownership</a>. Neither Jewish editors nor those involved with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Judaism_0444.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Judaism">Judaism WikiProject</a> do not own any article nor the right to edit it. If this is the welcome given to anyone who attemps to clean up articles within their scope, then I am not surprised that the article quality remains low throughout.</p>
<p>I am more than happy to apologise for some of the things I did. Yes, perhaps some of the historically rabbis should have had tags applied to their articles before being listed for deletion. But I do not apologise for my attempts to clean out what has become an unhealthy part of the Wiki-verse. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 22:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Besides the fact that no one called you an anti-semite, your claim that none of the articles you nominated for an AFD were verifiable is clearly erroneus. Many of the articles had sources, they just weren't on the internet, they were books that were properly cited at the bottom of the article. Even if it was true that they had no references that does not make the subject any less notable, you do not nominate an article that is about the founder of Hasidism for deletion, you request more sources, or possibly a cleanup (although many of the AFDs didn't even need that).- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 22:39, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've taken a look at some of the articles that PZFUN nominated and the notion that the AfD nominations were a matter of clearing out a stub category is not upheld by the array of articles that were nominated.

<li>I'll repeat again: this seemingly arbitrary, en mass "reads like an ad" nominations of major Hasidic Rabis was highly questionable, at best.

<li>Though I'm skeptical myself of the notability of summer camps, I think the problem here has been that PZFUN took a "broad brush" approach, determining that there was a group of "problem editors" rather than some articles with problems. Personalization is never a helpful thing here, but I can only think that that was the emotive factor behind the AfDing of so many articles on really obviously encyclopedic Hasidic rebbes, something that I think PZFUN is conceding now was an error in judgement. That said, the "this doesn't smell right" comments were unwarranted; bigotry should be the last motive we ascribe to a fellow editor, reached only after we have exhausted the other much more likely possibilities, e.g. <i><a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_deadly_sins.html" title="Seven deadly sins">pride, avarice, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth</a></i>.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 04:58, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>While camps seem clearly dubious, and likely a good find, it far from offsets</s> [On closer look, it appears many of the camps are notable, but this is not the same thing as systematically nominating articles from <a href="../../../s/u/f/Category%7ESufis_4a21.html" title="Category:Sufis">Category:Sufis</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/n/Category%7EHindu_religious_figures_84ca.html" title="Category:Hindu religious figures">Category:Hindu religious figures</a>, and so on] [T]he insultingly-phrased mass nominations of "really obviously encyclopedic Hasidic rebbes." What PZFUN, Nicholas, and Kim fail to appreciate is the extraeditorial act itself. The talk pages of those articles were not employed and individual attention was not accorded to each entry. Nor were querries placed in other, more central places: the category talk page, the PJ, etc. By entrenching themsleves in their positions, they're setting a bad precedent. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyway, as mentioned elsewhere, in order to demonstrate to you that I am not evil, and am in fact, <i>good</i>, I will be proposing a specific set of reforms to AfD in the near future. This will involve a two-part effort: 1. Better clarifying the guidelines in terms of the minimum steps necessary to file an AfD for single and multiple articles. 2. Better organizational structure. Once we defeat the aggregate nature of AfD, it will become <i>drastically</i> more accessible to outsiders and especially, respective experts. So watch out for my proposal soon. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:08, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I for one find it refreshing to see people blowing up over the mass deletion of something <i>other</i> than userboxes.&#160;:]</dd>
<dd>Seriously though, I think we all have particular topics which we care about and there are always going to be a few who go ballistic when <i>their</i> interests are 'attacked' (or looked at funny). One of my favored topics has unimaginable tons of unreferenced cruft that we are slowly trying to sort out and organize into lists and sub-groups and whatnot, and I would certainly be less than pleased if someone came along and nominated huge chunks of the admittedly unencyclopedic/unreferenced/et cetera stuff for deletion before it could be cleaned up. Lacking verifiability, notability, et cetera are reasons to delete <i>individual articles</i>... not entire topics with dozens of articles. There is almost always going to be another option. For instance, these 'Jewish summer camps' might not be notable individually (I really have no idea), but an article listing them and explaining why such camps exist or how they are different from other camps would seem to be more notable... thus a discussion <i>before</i> taking action might have resulted in an amicable agreement to merge some of the articles or efforts to add references and explanations of those which <i>were</i> notable, et cetera. Ditto the rebbes (sp?). <i>Any</i> mass action at odds with the efforts of some group will lead to disruption and anger. Not may, not could... <b>will</b>. Is that 'unfortunate' and 'unneccessary' and 'bad'? Yes... but railing against that which is inevitable (unless we replace all the humans with robots) is equally pointless and 'bad'. Accept that all humans are jerks - it allows you to feel indifference on those occasions when they prove it and surprise and admiration on those occasions when they don't.&#160;:]</dd>

<li>I've had another look. To me it seems that there are three points:
<ul>
<li>The user is continually engaged in POV-pushing on an article</li>
<li>The user refers to other peoples' edits as vandalism</li>
<li>The user has made one, not very credible, threat to 'publish' something about someone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I've misunderstood something pelase let me know, but to me that doesn't indicate that he's a threat to anything, just a fairly unproductive user. I am not happy with an indefinite block against him and would urge people like MONGO and Tom harrison not to block him themselves - further action should only be taken by someone who's not party to the dispute.

<li>I believe this block is unwarrented. This is part of a battle between several users, some of whom use their admin power to win arguements. This user has been politely argueing his case and has been repeatedly and often agressively shouted down and unnecessarily reverted by Mongo, Tom Harrison and others. Accusations of vandalism have been made all round, not just by truthseeker. I for one have gotten bored of these irrational arguements, but Truthseeker, Mongo and Tom Harrison have all continued. It is unfair for this user to be blocked simply because he disaggrees with an admin. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 22:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that blocking people who deserve to be blocked for incivility and failure to respect the consensus reached in articles is not a bad thing. I also think that he should be indefinately blocked but considering the AbrCom maybe we can let them decide that. With regards to <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> assertions I must diagree. If you see the user's history of edits, he continously defends users like TruthSeeker because they hold his 9/11 truth point-of-view regardless of what Wikipedia policies they break. This is extremely frustrating. It is not fair that administrators refuse to acknowledge users who break with Wikipedia policy because they share their POVs. I would say that this is reason enough to remove adminship from users.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 01:08, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, it's a flagrant violation of WP:POINT, for the most part. "This means that an individual who opposes the state of a current rule or policy should not attempt to create in Wikipedia itself proof that the rule does not work." I'm making a point, sure, but I'm not showing that any policy doesn't work. In fact, this is an attempt to force the article to improve itself.</dd>

<dd>I also should point out that WP:POINT clearly states: "This page is considered a guideline on Wikipedia. It illustrates standards of conduct that many editors agree with in principle.

Seeing as those statements were the only cited pieces of the article, I decided to go fact by fact and force them to cite it, especially an opinion, unbalanced, and the attempt to cite something with another statement. There were more than 17 facts in that statement, all uncited as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I could in all rights, delete everything BUT the prejudice section, but I don't see that as helpful. But if I force them to cite everything, they'll 1) create a reputable article and 2) learn that you cannot be extremely stringent on the applications of WP policy, overriding policy that override even editor consensus according to all three, in the support of one viewpoint..... and then expect extremely lax in the application of it to your own.</dd>

<p>User is on his third and final reversion for the fact tags. I'd suggest that things are left be right now.

<dd>No, actually I am not.

I am still entitled to one more reversion, and even if I were to use it now, I could revert three more times tomorrow...... so long as no four are within 24 hours of one another.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And then I notice that there is no worry to enforce WP:V here. That is an overriding policy that cannot be compromised except as per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> which are equal.

Then, <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7ERevert_be8e.html" title="WP:Revert">WP:Revert</a> explains "To revert is to undo all changes made after a certain time in the past. The result will be that the page becomes identical to how it used to be at some previous time. A partial revert undoes only some of those changes." I did not undo anything, I added demands for citations. When I had a series of citations to make, word after word, I did it, properly.

<dd>Oh my god, this has to be one of the most retarded conflicts I've ever been in. I'm arguing against someone I completely agree with. <b>YES, ALL THOSE CLAIMS NEED CITATIONS! WE GET IT!</b> Not only do we get it, we ALL agree with you! You keep trying to make the case it needs to be cited... and wow! You win! Your right! It does need to be cited! But, 17 bloody tags is inappropriate! It completely disrupts the article. 3 or 4 tags is fine. I'd even be fine with a tag a sentence. If 17 different citations is needed for the first paragraph, then fine. But 17 tags aren't needed to get the point acrost that citations are needed. Can I say this in any other way? Shall I try French? err... never mind, I don't actually know French. You may not belive this, but this weekend when I was reviewing the article I was planning on actualy going to the bookstore and buying a biliography so I can fill in some of the citations, but if I need work under these combative conditions, I'm not so sure I want to do that. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 07:27, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to add to the above — King Vegita added 36 {{fact}} tags to the Christianity article on 15 March.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43859231" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43859231" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> I tried, politely and gently, to tell him that we don't need citation tags for things like Christians believe Jesus in the Messiah, or Chritians believe in heaven and hell, or Catholics also believe in purgatory. I did not call his edit vandalism, but said that if it had been made by an anon, it would possibly, though unfairly, have been called vandalism.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43886592" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43886592" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> (I'm sure we've all seen cases of eccentric edits being labelled as vandalism.) He then went to the talk page of Trollwatcher (an editor who has been banned indefinitely for his part in contributing to and promoting a website that attacked Christian editors and gave personal information about them, which had led to stalking) and asked that my reverting of the fact tags and calling it vandalism would be reported to that website.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Trollwatcher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47358828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Trollwatcher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47358828" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> In fairness to King Vegita, the website <i>at that time</i> did not yet give personal details about the editors. He has also, made what seemed to be a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by removing things from the article when something he wanted met with opposition. It's discussed <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_Archive_27_1301.html#Removal_of_all_dissenting_views_from_Beliefs_section" title="Talk:Christianity/Archive 27">here</a>. I don't think his edits are in bad faith, though his support for the stalking website raises questions, but he seems not to understand policy properly — expecting me to block an editor for seven reverts when four of them were reverts of vandalism, and questioning the block of <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENPOV77_69f0.html" title="User:NPOV77">an obvious sockpuppet</a>, which was reported by the blocking admin (myself) and upheld by others. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 12:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I found 17 cite tags added by an anon, I'd revert it as vandalism on the spot. Adding all those tags was disruptive, and was clearly meant to be. That was his <i>point</i>. I also dislike this counting of reverts, as if someone could say "No, that was two, not three, so I get 2 more before 10:30, then I get another until 2:15 when it resets." My answer to that would be, "No, you get a block right now for edit warring and disruption, with an oakleaf cluster for wikilawyering." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 12:58, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh, I have two administrators who I have disagreed with, who are included in a mediation project, but haven't made any appearance either trying to argue that I am a bad editor. Hearing JS say that he understood that a citation would be needed in all those places eventually was all I actually needed to hear. WP:POINT is saying that I'm trying to prove a rule does not work...... which in neither case is applicable. In this case, I was trying to prove that there was a bias in how the rules were applied, not that the rules shouldn't exist. Technically you DO have to verify all of that, I have done so in other articles I have made and worked on. My additions are always full of citations, so I am certainly not saying that WP:V does not work. In the addition of the tags on Christianity, that was after having mentioned that I planned on doing that, 3 days prior, and having no reply on an active talk page. Nothing was cited, and I had been arguing for weeks prior that that way to solve the conflicts <b>was</b> to verify it. Both cases are the opposite of WP:POINT, though someone not looking into it would think that just that I was pointing something out, that I was violating it.</dd>

<dd>I would like to have it explained exactly HOW it is disruptive. <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISRUPT_3700.html" title="WP:DISRUPT">WP:DISRUPT</a> does not suggest that at all. As much as that might apply, the others would be in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, removing NPOV tags, and removing requests for facts to be cited. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states "Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed." I am challenging the contents, as they are not verified, in an attempt to improve the article quality. I know that most of it will be verified shortly, and that which cannot can then be removed, if it seems untrue, otherwise we have it noted that it is not cited. That increases Wikipedia's credibility. Yes, it wasn't the easiest to read, and when I hear JS state that he recognizes that each of those facts still have to be cited, I won't feel the need to add as many fact tags. But that should have been fixed within 24 hours as those are all basic facts which made it into the introduction. In the end, the article, and in a slight way Wikipedia as a whole, would be much better off. <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISRUPT_3700.html" title="WP:DISRUPT">WP:DISRUPT</a> also applies to policies, whereas I'm not disagreeing with any policy, a review of my contributions will show that I have gone out of my way to include heavy citation whether or not I am being challenged. I have gone out of my way to cite opponents' views as well. So please, give some reasoning.</dd>

<dd>I've been active in the discussion on the Crowley talk page, and am not an Admin. I think this would have been avoided if you would have challenged it on the talk page first KV, like these people are saying. You disrupted the article in order to make a "point" that more citations were needed, where as, a fact tag after a sentence would have made the page easier to read. This however was not addressed in the talk page prior to demontrating this, and NPOV tags were removed as well because it appeared you were trying yet again to prove a point. The problem is, this needs to be discussed first, and then resolved. I learned this when I added fact tags to the page, and was corrected. I hope this helps in answering some of your questions. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 23:01, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did bring it up on the talk page. And I did not disrupt the article, in my opinion. I made the first step in a movement of drastic article improvement in the way of verifiability. If I were trying to disrupt the article, I would have riddled the entire page at once with such tags. I, however, did not. It was not disrupting, it was proving a point as per Wikipedia policy suggests "If you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, a good idea is to move it to the talk page. Alternatively, you may tag the sentence by adding the {{fact}} template, or tag the article by adding {{not verified}} or {{unsourced}}. " I could have taken this to a much larger extreme, which would be the case if I were trying to disrupt. The <b>guidelines</b> don't even require that to be true, as I was not trying to prove that any policy did not work. And NPOV tags, everyone knew what my objections were, I had voiced them constantly on the talk page. It is not disrupting, and it cannot be done to "prove" a point, but rather to make one.... and the tag cannot be used if one isn't trying to make the point that the article is biased.</dd>

<p>user Llort continues to revert my edit to Wushu. He has asked for evidence, i have obliged. Yet he continues to revert on the grounds that he does not feel it is relevant, which i contest and i have reinforced through my representation of the gpforums as being very very large. I have tried to enter into dialogue about why he continues to revert it, but all he does is play on my anger when i revert the article back by complaining and getting me banned for an understandable reason, but the grounds are unclear. Can someone please warn him not to revert unless he has given proper reasoning as to why he has done so? Cheers. --<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubwaynz_26cd.html" title="User:Subwaynz">Subwaynz</a> 11:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are absolutely right to be reverting your edit. You're trying to add a section on the <a href="../../../w/u/s/Wushu.html" title="Wushu">Wushu</a> disambiguation page on <i>Wushu&#160;: a frequent poster who claimed at times to be in the posession of a Toyota Supra, which was later discredited and unsubstantiated. More recently wushu, under various aliases (such as japanese_girls) has spammed GPforums with copious amounts of softcore japanese pornorgaphy under the pretences that they were somewhat hot, thus he has gained a cult status and is a very famous member of gpforums.</i> The fact that no less than 3 different people have reverted this, and that there IS an explanation for this on <a href="../../../w/u/s/Talk%7EWushu_f19d.html" title="Talk:Wushu">Talk:Wushu</a> asking you very politely to stop doing this, should have clued you in to the fact that a troll on a forum (that doesn't warrant its own article) is not encyclopaedic. You are now disrupting Wikipedia. Please do not add the section again, or you will be blocked. I'm going to copy this to your talk page. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 12:02, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even as I generally look with great disfavor on indefinite blocks, I certainly can conceive of a situation in which Subwaynz might exhaust the community's patience and merit such a block. His/her account was ostensibly created in order that he might continue making edits to Wushu, having been reverted whilst editing anonymously (this proposition, raised on his/her talk page, seems undisputed), and his/her contributions are only to the Wushu article, the concomitant talk page, and the talk pages of users with whom he/she has quarreled over the Wushu page. I certainly believe the user to be <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">acting in good faith</a>, but his/her recalcitrance seems to suggest either that he/she is incapable of appreciating our verifiability and notability guidelines or that he/she, comprehending them, simply flouts them; neither scenario is particularly comforting. One always hopes that users such as this will comport themselves with policy, in order that they might contribute effectively, but surely this account should be watched closely, as it shows signs of having been created for disruptive purposes (or, at the very least, of being wholly, if avolitionally, disruptive in practice). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:04, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do agree entirely with Moby's summary. Cool Cat's disruptions do it hard to write articles about anythings related to Kurds. And it is indeed not an extenuating circumstance that user themselve stated, as quoted above, that they intended to sabotage the Category:Kurdistan, as it during the debate for its deletion was clear that it would stay. I hope some action will be taken, since the alternative seems to be continuing of disruptive edit wars. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 13:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ArbCom verdict which you've posted above says that he should be blocked for up to 3 days if he engages edits disruptively in Kurdish related areas.

<dd>Just to clarify my position here, Cool Cat invited me into the discussion claiming that he was having <i>POV issues</i> with Kurdistan related articles, implying that he had received death threats from other users as a result of the discussion getting heated (see here). I got involved and made some progress with the other users in getting some agreement over the inclusion of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdistan_cd6f.html" title="Category:Kurdistan">Category:Kurdistan</a> in articles, and this I believe has led to some of the sub-categories such as those listed above being created. I have since stepped back a bit due largely to real life events. I will say that although Cool Cat had some valid points in his arguements against the inclusion of material in articles about the disputed region, the way he went about making his point was unnecessarily aggressive, in my opinion. I also stand by telling him that he needs to change his opinion, after he stated (and I paraphrase) that he would be unable to negotiate a consensus on certain subject areas. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Fr</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">ncs2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 14:10, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've had enough of this. As Cool Cat's mentor I'm banning him from editing articles, templates and categories related to the kurds. He may still edit related discussion pages. This ban is initially to run for one week, to be made permanent subject to the agreement of the other two mentors. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 05:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>While I agree, the best way for Coolcat to stay out of trouble is to edit other articles, I think he made a valid point when he nominated this particular category for deletion. And now people are voting keep based on his involvement rather than the merits or demerits of the category itself (which is in my opinion even more disruptive -- bad, bad!). The thing is the category is vague. Should London be considered a Kurdish inhabited region? And what kind of precedent will it set? American inhabited region, German inhabited region, French inhabited region?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I think Coolcat was right to nominate such a vague category and I don't think banning him for it is the right thing to do.

<dd>The nomination of Category:Kurdish inhabited region was the action that prompted me to start this discussion here, but the disruption has been on-going on pages such as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category_talk%7EKurdistan_3da2.html" title="Category talk:Kurdistan">Category talk:Kurdistan</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBatman%2C_Turkey_dc5e.html" title="Talk:Batman, Turkey">Talk:Batman, Turkey</a> for some time. He has removed <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdistan_cd6f.html" title="Category:Kurdistan">Category:Kurdistan</a> from many article (awhile ago...) and has been rather clear about his intent to oppose all efforts at categorizing Kurdish articles. Given his history, I would think a ban on Kurdish-related editing an apt remedy. An hour ago I left a note on his talk page and he screamed at me. I don't see him as willing to work with others on this subject. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 10:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is an ongoing concern, and I think a valid one, that Cool Cat permits his edits on such issues to be influenced too strongly by his sympathies with Turkish nationalism. He repeatedly attempts to promote the removal of categories, templates and content related to an ethnicity that, while not having a single national entity of its own, is significant enough to be treated seriously by an encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Editors who complain about his activities and his attitude thus have a solid basis upon which to do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is for this reason that I announced the one-week ban.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">User:MacGyverMagic</a> is also one of Cool Cat's mentors, and although in this case I have acted alone I do not intend to take actions with which any of my fellow mentors disagree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In view of MacGyverMagic's opposition, I rescind the ban pending further discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for documenting these other activities; the scope of the issue is greater than I was aware (and I now understand the restaurant references).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I disagree with <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a>'s judgment on many of the Kurd-issues here, it is his attitude that is most troublesome. In his response below I see no sign that he sees any validity to the objections others have raised -- he appears to be simply digging in his heels. If no action is taken on this issue, what's to stop him from continuing to obstruct efforts involving Kurds in the future? Presumably this whole incident will have been noted by a variety of people, but I don't expect many to involve themselves in the issue (which I would welcome).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that banning someone is a serious step and should not be taken lightly. I will avoid editing any of the Kurd articles and categories against consensus. If a clear direction on an appropriate course to take on Kurdish categorization comes out of this whole dispute I'll be pleased. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 09:31, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As unfortunate and tragic the boys death is, wikipedia is not a memorial and the incident has no significance to the city to be on the article.

<p>It is quite pathetic when one has to defend himself to his mentor... I'll list the articles, categories, and templates I have placed for deletion below. I am going to include ones Tony Sidaway did not include as well.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out the reason why we do not do polls for deletion. All deletion processes are a concensus gathering process. However on occasions disruptive behaviour such as <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVote_Stacking_ad3b.html" title="Wikipedia:Vote Stacking">Vote Stacking</a> do happen.</p>
<p>Hence I will explain all of the deletion votes I started or participated. I will try to be brief for all of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Article was originaly talking about two countries that have supposively existed. One only lasted 2 years while another lasted less than 6 months. The article(s) barely occupy a paragraph and had two sections I believe.</li>
<li>Article at a point was comparing the british goverment with saddam as "the british goverment gassed the kurds".</li>
<li>I was in contact with Tony on IRC about this deletion, I do not recall the details but he did not say or imply such a deletion would be disruptive.</li>
<li>During the vfd the articles quality was improved sligtly</li>
<li>Perhaps article is much suitable to be a section on an article with the title "Modern History of the Kurds" as article cant grow much even when inflated with lists of cabinate members.</li>

<ul>
<li>When I placed this article up for deleteion it was talking about an insignificant restourant which two kurds supposively had been shot. At the time the article barely could be considered a stub. After the deletion article was slightly inproved and renamed. It became a historicaly significant incident and hence became article worthy as an incident rather than info about the restourant.</li>
<li>I discussed the possible afd of this article with Tony Sidaway on IRC and he said it was pretty useless and that he said it wouldnt probably survive a deletion.</li>
<li>The result of my Afd is a better article with a better title.</li>
<li>This article should be a section at "Modern history of the Kurds" as article is too short and cant grow as the incident was quite minor and all details have been presented.</li>

<li>There was a case of vote stacking over 14 people were notified of this afd of which all but one voted favorably to the advertisier (<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">user:Bertilvidet</a>) with <b>keep</b>. My complaint about a vote stacking generated milimal response and no action.</li>
<li>Article currently gives a short intoduction to kurdish history which is a copy of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> and a number of articles. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> is not oversized and we do have a <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a> if we are to talk about the kurds.

<li>If we had a sensable deletion process this article would have been deleted.

<li>It is a strange article. I believe this article is nothing but pusedo science and promotes racisim.

BUT etnicity is a cultural concept not genetic. Genetic would be race and last time I checked Kurds were just an ethnic minority.</li>

<li>While a <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdish_politicians_9907.html" title="Category:Kurdish politicians">Category:Kurdish politicians</a> may be approporate.

Tagging a Kurd in Iraq and Turkey under the same category would be problematic and confusing.

<dd>On at least one matter of fact I must correct Cool Cat.

I told him at 2007 UTC on March 1, 2006, that, as with all deletion candidates I edit, "I don't think it stands a snowball's chance in hell of being deleted." I had told him at 2000, "the case is obviously notable.

<dl>
<dd>I actualy interprted that as the article has a chance to survive as much as a snowball in hell. In any case my nomination was for a non-notable restourant. Overal the nomination improved the article, not disrupt. For instance it was renamed as it was not about this random restourant. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 16:03, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I would just like to say that I <i>support</i> Cool Cat on this matter.

<dd>I've little opinion of the conjecture of a reincarnated Davenbelle, but there is a qualm in this editor's behavior. As per the above edvidence, this editor's initial confrontation with me conflicted over a userpage misunderstanding. This is a archived discussion on my talkpage which can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MegamanZero/Archive_4#User:Megaman_Zero_and_his_forged_award_.28Transfered_from_WP:AN.2FI.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MegamanZero/Archive_4#User:Megaman_Zero_and_his_forged_award_.28Transfered_from_WP:AN.2FI.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. After the I refuted the accusation, said editor took to being my shadow, which I noted after a number of appearences in locations across the encyclopedia which were in direct contact to my usertalk page (he has it consistently watchlisted you see). I made a final verification of this after he made a spell check on my talkpage, confirming he sees almost every comment posted there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=51830369&amp;oldid=51830030" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=51830369&amp;oldid=51830030" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> This has been prevelant ever since the allegation on AN/I, but I never gave it much heed and it didn't bother me, so I let it alone. There were no subsequent direct confrontations after this incident, so I assumed good faith, and didn't have a valid complaint anyway, since, despite his occasional trolling, Moby makes excellent contributions to article space, not to mention ground-breaking work. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nathaniel_Philbrick&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32455933" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nathaniel_Philbrick&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32455933" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> Proceeding that incident, I took his talkpage off my watchlist and went about other things.

<dd>During some article expansion, I ran into two disruptive editors (<tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">BIG</tt> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBIG_680e.html" title="User talk:BIG">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BIG_1cb4.html" title="Special:Contributions/BIG">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_BIG_8920.html" title="Special:Blockip/BIG">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) and <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">70.231.130.128</tt> (<span class="plainlinks">talk <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.231.130.128_58c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.231.130.128">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_70.231.130.128_ba4f.html" title="Special:Blockip/70.231.130.128">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>)) on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Talk%7EColonel_%28Mega_Man%29_f171.html" title="Talk:Colonel (Mega Man)">Talk:Colonel (Mega Man)</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/d/Talk%7ERidge_Racer_d957.html" title="Talk:Ridge Racer">Ridge Racer</a> during which said editors introduced/removed content from article space without any sources and any factually correct rebuttals. I made many reverts, for which I was subsquently blocked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Megaman_Zero" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Megaman_Zero" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, but respected due to the fact one must accept the consequences of his actions regarding the violation, despite the fact I was correct. I questioned the point of the blocks due to the fact, neither admistrator had taken the discussion on the talkpages into account and how each of the blocks were issued large timeframes after said violation (The first block occured 24 hours after the edit war was nullified and the page protected; the second several hours later, and after I had reverted myself to reach an comprimise). This incited a more active response from the editor, who had merely been watching my talkpage and contributions to this point. Druing the timeframe of my second block, He posted a note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51201500" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51201500" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> on William's talkpage (Another one of my elaborate plans to take the wiki by storm) concerning an established contributor engaging in vandalism. I had extreme difficulty believing this post when I first saw it. I posted a reply rearding this shortly afterward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWilliam_M._Connolley&amp;diff=51251680&amp;oldid=51248034" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWilliam_M._Connolley&amp;diff=51251680&amp;oldid=51248034" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> detailing my surprise at this bad-faith attempt to descend me into scurtuniy. William percieved this as a personal attack and threatened to block me shortly afterwards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=51252984&amp;oldid=51246690" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=51252984&amp;oldid=51246690" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. It certainly wasns't intended as a personal attack, but I removed the comment as I don't believe personal attacks accepteble on anyone. I complied and altered my comment as I deemed necessary [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51251680" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51251680" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, after which William decided to block me anyway for being insolent. Not too much of a problem, since it was bedtime anyway.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The editor in question persisted. After a clearly confused william asked how it was relevant, Moby replied I circumvented my block and I was still up to something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51300278" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51300278" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> (I was still plotting my master scheme, you know) and that I should still be punished. Now expasperated, I made another note on the talkpage and explained the situation in full. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51324897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51324897" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> which defused the matter. Around the ensuing timeframe, he proceeded to conflict in the Kurd-nonsense with Cool Cat, who was subsquently blocked. I'm aware that Cool Cat has a aggressive viewpoint on this subject and has encountered much opposition on this before, so I didn't comment on the matter, although it was quite obvious to the informed Moby didn't report the rfar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52123059" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52123059" rel="nofollow">violation</a> in good faith. I took note of this after seeing his replies to various editors on subject on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, which gave me great cause for concern on his intent:</dd>

Before I accepted the nomination, I made note that I was being closely survallianced by Moby and I had no doubt a opposition would arise.

<dd>I stress that its not obtuse to believe Moby <i>may</i> be Davenbelle, as I'm still utterly baffled as to how a new user can simply migrate to a userpage, search the history extensively, and blow an ensuing argument about a misunderstanding out of porportion. It also strikes one as odd when a user immediately engages in long-standing conflict about aftermentioned article and makes reverts unusual for one so new. However, despite the sockkery or not, it needs to be known this editor has engaged in trolling and many contributions have been verified to be unwelcome at this encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 16:23, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: While I believe that CoolCat hasn't looked especially open to compromise, it is unfair to declare that all of these actions are "disruptive" - it is unfortunate that he changed his mind about a compromise category but changing your mind should always be allowed. There is no general consensus about ethnic-geography categories. Indeed, these Kurdish examples seem to be the sole example of the type; presumably because most people find the idea of an ill-defined ethnic-geography category a bad idea. I am open to the idea if implemented properly, but the three ethnic-geography categories CoolCat has nominated were all, quite simply, dire. They had POV issues. They were poorly defined. The most recent one even had a grammatically incorrect name! I do not believe it is disruptive to nominate for deletion something that, in the reasonable opinions of many well-respected Wikipedians (and there are many who agreed with CoolCat - see the votes), does not belong on Wikipedia. CoolCat has not been mass-deleting Kurdish-related articles. He has not been attempting deletions of neutral, generally accepted, Kurdish categories. He has made a <i>contentious</i> attempt to expunge ethnic-geography cross-over categories, but these have widespread opposition from many sources so I don't think that it is genuinely <i>disruptive</i>. Nobody should be forced to compromise on the issue of ethnic-geography categories, since many Wikipedians reasonably disagree strongly with their creation - failure to agree on a compromise isn't necessarily a sign of disruption if you honestly believe (especially with something as "binary" in nature as a category) that something is a harmful or damaging idea. The fact that many of his nominations were speedied is an indication that he isn't being entirely disruptive, perhaps the restaurant and genetics AfDs were the closest to that mark. The thing that seems to be the real problem is that CoolCat isn't making a secret of his personal views. While sometimes he edits in a way that shows he is actually being a "Good Wikipedian" and going against personal preference in the interests of the encyclopedia (e.g. with the Kurdish terrorist category) when he is making a positive, useful contribution that seems "in tune" with his views, he looks like a disruptive POV-monger. Which in turn makes people vote against him unthinkingly... It would be better, perhaps, if he kept some of these topics at arm's length and merely brought these instances to the attention of Wikipedians known to be neutral on the Kurdistan question, to allow them to decide whether to make a deletion request or not. I simply can not believe that anybody would have cut any slack to Category:Hispanic inhabited region for instance: it would have been wiped off the face of the 'pedia without any second thoughts; however, the fact that it is CoolCat and the Kurds has meant that this category has a surprising number of keep votes. However, whether CoolCat wants to take this degree of extra care (and restrict his editing accordingly) in cases which are fundamentally non-disruptive should really be for CoolCat to decide, not any of us. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 22:06, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>He seems to have located my RfA conviniantly. It his his 84th edit. He also makes a very professional edit by incrementing the oppose counter. Its something often oldies fail to notice</li>
<li>We have not edited any articles in common meaning he did not know me at all.</li>
<li>He participated in a total of 2 RfA aside from my own. One for Megaman Zero (as oppose) and another for Khoikhoi (support). Both are figures I know. He is definately not a frequent voter.</li>

<li><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">User:Davenbelle</a> gave User:Megaman_Zero the award.</li>

<li>It is possible that he could have learnt about the existance of the RfAr from my 3rd rfa nomination as I have mentioned it there. However a key question is why did he tell this to Aucaman. He has no edits in comon with Aucaman. Nor was he involved with anything related to the kurds.</li>

<dd>Too long, indeed -- however I felt obliged to read it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> is making this false allegation in order to divert attention from the issue of his behavior and, it would seem, in order to entangle me in his arbitration case.

While the factual details -- who has edited what, for example -- of his accusation appear to be accurate (I've not checked), his spin and interpretation are entirely self-serving.</dd>
<dd>I believe I first encountered <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> on the first CFD of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdistan_cd6f.html" title="Category:Kurdistan">Category:Kurdistan</a> and did not like his obvious intent of limiting Kurdish content on Wikipedia. I have used Wikipedia as a reference for years and its greatest problem is inconsistent accuracy of information and it is the behavior of editors such as <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> that is responsible for this.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a>'s implied accusation (which he makes explicit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52623332" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52623332" rel="nofollow">here</a>) can easily be explained by the fact that articles and users he refers to are all related; they involve Kurds or they involve him. He expresses concern that my edits are too "professional" for one so "new" -- as if this were the only wiki in the world.</dd>
<dd>I would add again that he does not appear to be interested seeking a consensus. He efforts here only serve to make the editing environment hostile.</dd>

<dd>Interesting argument. What wiki do you normaly work for? Tonikaku, I may have been wrong on Amask's case but that has nothing to do with your case. Amask has participated in only two votes and one or two articles. Since the nonsense I had to deal with davenbelle, I had been somewhat jumpy... Lets consider your statistics.
<ul>
<li>You have participated in a total of 3 rfas, the first one you have ever voted was my rfa and you voted oppose, just like davenbelle. After Coincidentaly the other two rfas are people who I know about. Of that MegamanZero is the person that told Davenbelle to stop stalking (See <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavenbelle_99bb.html" title="User talk:Davenbelle">User Talk:Davenbelle</a>). The other RfA you participated was for Khoikhoi who at the time in dispute with me. Lets call all that circumstential evidence and discard them.</li>
<li>You have participated in a total of 8 deletion votes. 5 of them opposing me, 2 of them opposing megamanzero. So thats 7 out of 8 deletion votes we have in common. Again lets call that circumstential evidence and discard it.</li>
<li>There is this hole case of you and megaman zero. You were complaining about something megaman zero recieved from davenbelle. MegamanZero at a point modifed the bycycle award to an exceptional newbie award long ago at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=35684873&amp;oldid=35633692" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMegaman_Zero&amp;diff=35684873&amp;oldid=35633692" rel="nofollow">10:50, 18 January 2006</a>. I Had to dig through the userpage history to discover the actual modification of the award and I knew what I was looking for.
<ol>
<li>So we have an award given to MegamanZero by davenbelle.</li>
<li>We have MegamanZero warning davenbelle to stop stalking me on a much later date. (a motive for davenbelle to seek "revenge") as MegamanZero and I had been close and still are close.</li>
<li>We have megaman zero modifying the given award in 12 january (hey he can its his userpage)</li>
<li>We have you detecting and "correcting" it on 25 february.</li>
<li>We know you never met megamanzero on any article, meaning you didnt know him.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>So among 3,999,382 registered users, you found Megaman Zero at random. You also discovered "forgery" of an award on his userpage which required me to load a dozen diffs even though I knew what I was looking for.</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<dd>The part where you say "hell there was a Kurdish president" as if thats enough for the Kurds and they don't need anything else because they had a president. You probably visited Turkey for a month and you're talking from that experience I've lived there for years and I've seen how many Kurdish politicians or artists can be successful in Turkey. <a href="../../../y/i/l/Yilmaz_Guney_64c2.html" title="Yilmaz Guney">Yilmaz Guney</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyla_Zana_6b46.html" title="Leyla Zana">Leyla Zana</a> and <a href="../../../u/g/u/Ugur_Mumcu_ad0f.html" title="Ugur Mumcu">Ugur Mumcu</a> some of those who were killed or jailed because they were Kurdish. Oh, you more likely to come out to be a MHP Turk then a Kurd with comments like those. I am free to criticise you on a comment because your later on actions are pretty aggressive on Kurdish articles. I can remind you when you've made those comments if you think I've made them up. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 01:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>FYI, I visited turkey for over two years and I was in the SE region. I am not affiliated with any political party in Turkey or outside.

I find that it is fascinating for a member of the ethic minority supposively discriminated to be elected as president. If you are offended by that I cant quite help you.</dd>

<p>I suppose I can understand people not commenting much on the evidence presented, as it's hardly short and simple. However I think Cool Cat deserves it to at least be assessed. I'm not at all familiar with this dispute, or the history of either editors editing. There is probably far more to this than I've had time to look at (although I have tried!), so I certainly don't feel confident enough to take any specific action. However, the evidence presented by Cool Cat with regard to "<i>weather or not <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">User:Moby Dick</a> is stalking me.</i>" and "<i>weather or not <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">User:Moby Dick</a> is a <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">User:Davenbelle</a></i>" does seem fairly convincing. It is a shame that for technical reasons the checkuser was inconclusive, so it can't be verified that way. There does seem to be far too many co-incidences listed above to suggest Moby Dick is a new user that had nothing to do with Cool Cat before registering, and does seem to be paying just that bit too much attention to his actions.</p>
<p>I also note that as Moby Dick as stated a desire to 'to be rid of' Cool Cat, and I can't imagine Cool Cat wanting Moby Dick to stay around him, I suggest that both users take each others pages off their watchlists, don't check each others contribs, and don't make any effort to interact with each other (and actively try and leave article disputes to other editors if you come across each other that way). Outside of this situation a quick glance at contribs suggests very different interests, so there should be plenty of editing to get on with away from each other.</p>
<p>Please note by me saying this I am not commenting on Cool Cat's behaviour with relation to the Kurdish related disputes. I don't know enough about that, however he came here with a request for admin review on this specific issue and I feel it should be addressed one way or the other. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 09:19, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Moby Dick is someone with a previous grudge against Cool Cat.</li>
<li>I don't know how likely that makes it that Moby Dick is Davenbelle. Pretty likely, I guess, but I wouldn't undertake to say. But I suggest that Moby Dick needs to avoid Cool Cat from now on, or he may find himself in ArbCom trouble in his own right, quite apart from the Davenbelle question. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:56, 19 May 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>I am fine with this suggestion but under the circumstances I feel checkuser data of User:Moby Dick should be kept longer than a month (of course concealed from the general public as per privacy reasons). User:Moby Dick, weather or not he is Davenbelle, now knows how to evade detection.</dd>
<dd>I guess The matter has gotten me quite paranoid, but I'd see this as a wise precation. What do you think?</dd>

<p>I have already stated that I am <i>not</i> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">User:Davenbelle</a>'s sockpuppet. And I am hardly stalking <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a>. I believe I first noticed him on the CFD for category Kurdistan and took a dim view of his attempt to minimise Kurdish related material. I feel that the Kurds deserve to be fairly presented on Wikipedia. I have looked at his history and this is how I learned of his arbitration case and users like Davenbelle. I also noticed <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">User:Megaman Zero</a> on both of their talk pages.</p>
<p>This whole discussion is supposed to be about his disruption of Kurdish issues and I believe that his accusations are merely an attempt to change the subject. Since I reported this, he been all over my editing, showing up on pages I've just edited and badgering me (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANationalist_Movement_Party&amp;diff=53402654&amp;oldid=53301203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANationalist_Movement_Party&amp;diff=53402654&amp;oldid=53301203" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>)). He has been hyper-aggressive in all of his talk towards me - I could easily make a counter argument that he is stalking me.</p>
<p>What I want out of this process is a clear path to proceed on towards a consensus on the various Kurd issues. He does not seek a consensus, he seeks his way. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 07:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The title of this sub section is "back to the stalking sock/question", and hence I am under the impression you are trying to change the subject.</dd>
<dd>My "hyper-aggressive" tone in question is only demanding sources for the 'contraversial' section you have restored. I am not condoning ruzgar in any way but in order to restore a section on an article, you should have a basis I suppose?</dd>
<dd>As for the 'stalking' argument, hardly. I monitor many articles related to Turkey, Kurds, Armenian Genocide, etc... especialy high profile articles such as politics related ones. I noticed a revert war on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Movement_Party_2a32.html" title="Nationalist Movement Party">Nationalist Movement Party</a> (I have a script for that). I was suprised to find you as the other party revert waring. Thats one way to seek a consensus... more like force it. What caught my attention most was the false <i>rv vandalism</i> claim by ruzgar. I am not willing to stop monitoring articles I had been monitoring for months just because you have started editing them. My topics of interest currently is limited to Star Trek, Kurds, Turkey, various anime... surely its not all that much...</dd>

<p>The stalking question and the unanswered question of whether Moby Dick is Davenbelle are quite important here. In <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Coolcat%2C_Davenbelle_and_Stereotek_6f6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Coolcat, Davenbelle and Stereotek">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Coolcat,_Davenbelle_and_Stereotek</a>, the following remedy was passed:</p>

If subsequent proceedings which involve Cool Cat show that he has been hounded by them, substantial penalties may be imposed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Passed 6-0</dd>
</dl>
<p>If Moby Dick is performing substantially the same function as were Davenbelle, Stereotek and (to some extent) Fadix prior to the arbitration case, then his behavior is of a kind that is clearly described as problematic by the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>If Moby Dick is Davenbelle himself (and I think there is a very strong circumstantial case for this) then substantial penalties are merited.</p>
<p>As a corollary, Moby Dick merits a strong administrative warning, which I now issue in my capacities as a sysop on English Wikipedia and Cool Cat's mentor.</p>
<p>I warn you to keep away, as much as is reasonably possible, from articles, talk pages and other pages edited by Cool Cat. There is substantial evidence that you are following a pattern of stalking or harassing behavior towards Cool Cat, similar to that described in the arbitration case. Should you continue on your current course, <b>substantial remedial action</b> may be necessary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:31, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a participant in the ArbCom case against Coolcat, I would like to comment on this. The first thing that should be mentioned is that Tony Sidaway should read the decision of the ArbCom again, and accept the fact that any penalties can only be issued as a consequence of "<b>subsequent proceedings</b>", that find that I, Davenbelle or Fadix has done anything that is not according to policy. The ArbCom decision doesn't give him any right to use his adminship and mentorship, to harass and issue "warnings" to any user that oppose the POV editing that the ArbCom mentioned that Cool Cat had engaged in, and perhaps still might be engaging in. Sidaway has no right to issue any "administrive warnings", and demands that editors such as Moby (or any other editors) should not edit any articles that Cool Cat is interested in. If he believe that Moby or other editors do something wrong by opposing Cool Cat's editing in some specific articles, then he should start an RfC or an RfAr against them instead of engaging in any such threatening behavior. Tony Sidaway should accept the fact that he is Cool Cat's mentor, and not the mentor of any editor that might oppose Cool Cat's POV editing. He doesn't have any special authority over any editor, except Cool Cat, and he should stop pretending that he has that. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 15:42, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your participation wasn't voluntary on the arbcom case last time I checked.</dd>
<dd>Is it pov to suggest that a census determining ethnicity hasn't been preformed in Turkey or is it pov to remove pictures of corpses from <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a>. Thats the entirity of my edits in articles related to Kurds, Turkey, Armenians that one can vaguley start argue about the controversial nature... I also "disrupted" categorisation efforts by gathering concensus (regardless of the number of politicaly motivated <i>keep</i> votes) that over a half of the categories were inaproporate.</dd>
<dd>Lets assume I was indeed pov pushing for the sake of argument. What did MegamanZero do to deserve Moby Dick's special care?</dd>
<dd>Arbcom desicions on occasions have had direct impact on policy. Behaviour arbcom found inaproporate will still be inaproporate weather or not if arbcom has a ruling spesificaly against a person. <i>Constantly nit-picking is always a violation of required courtesy</i> and hence falls under <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">harassment</a>.</dd>

<dd>Where do I claim that I volunteered to participate in the ArbCom case? You should stop making such false and irrelevant claims. I have no opinion on the specific matters that you have been disagreeing with other editors such as Moby Dick, because I don't know the details of these disagreements. What I do know however, is that the ArbCom found that you have a history of POV editing in articles re Kurds and the Turkish state in general, and I should be surprised if you have changed your ways and ended your violations of NPOV. The fact that you are getting yourself intro trouble and POV disagreements when editing the same articles that the ArbCom declared that you have been POV editing on, just make it more obvious that you continue your POV editing, to promote your pro-Turkish government/anti-Kurdish POV.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your claims that editors that is opposing your editing, which you have a history of POV editing on should stalk you, harass you or whatever, then that is something the ArbCom should make a decision about. There is nothing in policy that support that a admin can block anyone, just because such allegations has been made. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 22:27, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My inclination, along with Tony Sidaway, is that there is strong circumstantial evidence that Davebelle and Moby Dick are the same editor. I have reviewed the evidence posted and have discussed this matter with one other editor and I see a preponderance of evidence that indicates that not only has Moby Dick wikistalked <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a>, but <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">User:MegamanZero</a> as well, and that Moby Dick is a sockpuppet of Davenbelle.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 09:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sharp drop at 5:00 UTC (13:00 bali time). Looks like a lunch break given its afternoon</li>
<li>14:30-16:30 UTC (22:30-24:30 bali time) appears to be the time where lowest number of edits are observed. Not too early to sleep</li>

<dd>This is ridicules. It doesn't prove anything regarding time zone, and of course absolutely noting regarding the identity of the editor. I remember that you have also accused me of being Davenbelle (and Fadix) and even demanded that it should be investigated in connection with the ArbCom case. Some months ago I was actually editing from + 8 <a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu_City_3bc2.html" title="Cebu City">Cebu City</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> in my case) so according to your logic you should now have a strong case that <i>I</i> am Davenbelle. Or, even better Cool Cat, maybe you should just accept the fact that every editor that oppose you is not the sockpuppet of somebody else. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 22:43, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not really. The statistics are based on the percentage of total edits. In order to have a "spike" you would have to make hundereds of edits at the exact 10 minute span... That would still not reduce your other "spikes".</dd>
<dd>Besides why are you trying to get involved in a case in an attempt to disrupt my efforts to present evidece given this case does not involve you in any way? What would you consider as "stalking"?</dd>

<p>Back in March I nominated <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Hayday_9062.html" title="Darren Hayday">Darren Hayday</a> for deletion. The person in question wasn't impressed by his page being nominated for deletion and after accusing me of everything from bad faith, to pushing a homosexual agenda on Wikipedia and targeting him because he's a straight Conservative he eventually apologised and agreed for the page to be userfied to <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayday_Darren_Hayday_8239.html" title="User:Hayday/Darren Hayday">User:Hayday/Darren Hayday</a>. Had he not done so I very much suspect consensus in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Darren_Hayday_fd20.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darren Hayday">the afd debate</a> would have been delete or userfy anyway.</p>
<p>On 25 April Mr Hayday mentioned on <a href="../../../h/a/y/User_talk%7EHayday_9104.html" title="User talk:Hayday">his talk page</a> that he has no plans to add a page for himself anytime soon. However I have noticed the page is back, created on 8 May, and a new user, Sky1066 (<a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky1066_4329.html" title="User talk:Sky1066">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sky1066_1e43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sky1066">contribs</a>) is only interested in the same subject that Mr Hayday was previously: i.e. Darren Hayday.</p>
<p>What is the feeling regarding this page? Does it achieve notability criteria? If not, can someone else nominate it for deletion? I'm not going to, as I don't want to go through the rigmarole of accusations and vandalism that I did last time. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Fr</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">ncs2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 23:51, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I certainly think him to be a non-notable personnage (neither his candidacy in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_local_elections%2C_2003_c0b9.html" title="UK local elections, 2003">UK local elections, 2003</a> nor his election to be mayor of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Wycombe_d0ea.html" title="High Wycombe">High Wycombe</a>, IMHO, necessarily conveys notability), and I certainly don't think any reasonable person could impute bad faith to Francs' nominating it for deletion, even in view of the history betwixt Hayday and him. I'm confident, though, that an AfD would not generate a consensus for deletion (in fact, I highly doubt the disposition would be any other than <i>no consensus; hence, keep by default</i>), and so I'm disinclined to AfD the article. Certainly there are traces of POV in the article, and much of it is, in any case, unencyclopedic (e.g., that Hayday's wedding ceremony was samll), and one should certainly watch edits carefully lest unsourced POV should be inserted; I don't see any superior course of action. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:58, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

If what you say is the case my next project will be producing pages for the mayors of Aylesbury (my home town), most of the more recent ones I know on first-name terms. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Fr</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">ncs2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 10:47, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There have been so many mayors, and their equivalents, of cities of similar or larger size all over the world and throughout history that a single one is not notable unless it is an enormous city or through some other circumstance. Also, mayors often serve for just one or two years, limiting their notability (some serve four or five year terms, though). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know High Wycombe. It's a reasonably pretty market town. I don't think the "if we added articles for all present, past and future mayors of towns of similar size, we'd have an encyclopedia the size of Saturn" argument makes much sense. We have an article about <i>this</i> politician about whom a reasonable amount of verifiable information is available. His father and great uncle were notable Labour politicians, the latter being a SDF member who was present at the historic meeting that created the LRC. He's an elected councillor and the mayor of the town, which means that he represents his town in ceremonial capacity at all important social and political events. Why would we want to delete it?

<dd>Colon cleansing, at least with their methods, is pretty dangerous. They have you swallow clay, sometimes specified as bentonite clay, which absorbs water any liquid it encounters in the stomach or bowels. The clay increases greatly in size and can cause a bowel obstruction (this is why you should take fiber with a lot of water, so that it does not expand too much in the instestines). If it does not come out, surgery may be necessary. Even if it does come out on its own, you may have very painful intestinal spasms as a result of the intestines trying to unclog itself. The "mucoid plaque" that people expel, and what colon cleansers give as proof that it works, is actually the clay itself. It retains the shape of the instestines, so people think that the material had built up on the intestinal walls like the colon cleansers claim. Finally, mucoid plaque has never been found during surgery or autopsies, despite unreferenced claims to the contrary. Wikipedia should not say that instestinal cleansing works for ethical, legal and accuracy reasons. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is at AfD now. I do gastroenterology and I'd highly recommend sprotection until the AfD is complete. You don't want someone fasting and eating clay by themselves based on what they read here -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 11:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looking at Google, I feel it is important that (provided the consensus or general view remains that this is a health fraud and A Bad Thing) the first line of the article continues to state that it is a fraud. The reason is that otherwise the person seeking information who uses Google will see that WP reports that "it is claimed to be blah blah". They are likely to read it as an indication that the condition exists - IE take it as support. There is actually some benefit to having such articles, and Tearlach's original was pretty good and IMO balanced and his justification or rationale for it correct. But if the price of having it there is that someone who I cannot believe is not an interested party can repeatedly force us to defend it from use as advertising, then perhaps we'll have to do without it. I propose that there should be a low threshold for sprotecting such articles. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 17:18, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
