<p>You should never block an IP indefinitely, and Scottfisher is not a banned user.

<dd>Unless another administrator chooses to unblock him, I consider him to be banned, as the block has not been removed by anyone else, but <i>has</i> been reviewed by several administrators. The user has also been e-mailing administrators asking to be unblocked (see his talk page), and none have been willing to do so. If you feel my blocking of him was in error, I encourage you to review the case (I posted links to the discussions in question on his user page), and you feel feel unblocking is in order, feel free to do so, and the case can be placed on RfC or RfArb. I have endeavoured to be open and communicative to the administrative community with my actions in this case, and if others wish to re-examine the issue, I take no offense at that. As far as an indefinite block on an IP, <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html#Anonymous_and_open_proxies" title="WP:Block">Blocking policy</a> states: <i>Administrators are permitted and encouraged to IP-block anonymous proxies indefinitely</i>, so there <i>are</i> cases where indefinite blocks on IP's are appropriate. Whether this IP is an open proxy is not something I'm technically proficient enough to address, but evidence has suggested that this IP has only been used by Scottfisher, and therefore I don't feel as bad blocking it. I also noted on the IP's talk page why it was blocked, and encouraged any anonymous contributors that were not Scottfisher to feel free to use the e-mail function to contact me. As far as it being a govt IP, Pigsonthewings mentioned it's connected with Oak Ridge Labaratories. Personally, I'm doubtful that collateral damage will be an issue. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 04:25, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just received this via email:</p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have repeatedly deleted false and misleading information on our company from the article for 1.800.VENDING. You have repeatedly put the information back on. A lawsuit will be filed in U.S. District Court, District of Utah during the second week in December against Wikipedia and The Wikimedia Foundation. If Wikipedia takes responsibility for your actions as an administrator no legal action will be taken against you personally. If they indicate that they have given you authority to make decisions independent of their company and attempt to place the blame on you we will have no choice but to subpoena your contact information from Wikipedia and file a suit against you directly.</p>
<p>Wikipedia (and/or you personally) are responsible for the false and misleading statments made against our company. It is not our responsibility to sort through the statements to guide you in what is accurate and what is not. We have deleted the information. You have overidden the deletion which make you liable for the information. I would recommend that you delete the entire article. A suit for damages will still be filed against Wikipedia/Wikimedia but no action will be taken against you directly.</p>
<p>Please email any response to the email address listed below.</p>

He was asked to comment for his reasons for removing the text before a block was implemented.

<dd>Here's a possible solution: Since most of the critical info is on their previous business, Turnkey Vending, move that info to a separate article, but still include links and a brief explanation in the <a href="../../../1/2E/8/1.800.Vending_96f7.html" title="1.800.Vending">1.800.Vending</a> article. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 20:24, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Someday Wikipedia contributors will be sued personally for their actions on Wikipedia, whether or not such suits have a valid foundation. I hope that day is not today and that the contributor is not GraemeL, but Wikipedia has become too successful to ignore the fact that some people and organizations will attempt to use the legal process to manipulate what is written here. Sigh. The sadder truth is that the Wikimedia Foundation, if it relies on its previous position as a forum provider rather than an information provider, would neccesary claim that they are not responsible for what is written here and such lawsuits would tend to fall on the contributors personally. On the plus side, since truth is an absolute defense against libel in the US, adherence to NPOV and other content policies should allow for a fairly strong defense in general. (P.S. I am not commenting on and have not considered the merits of this particular case.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:17, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having a look at the article, I agree that we need more on what the company sells, how big it is, etc rather than what laws they may or may not have broken. Reducing the size of the critical section would therefore take back the suggestion that the article is biased against the company, which even if every sentence is worded NPOV, the overall tone of the article is not great. It attacks the company in too much detail without giving in similar detail precisely what they do. In this case, I would suggest that the other company is split off as above and we ask Mr Marsh for information about his company. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 21:52, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like some clarification from a lawyer here. Truth is an absolute defense. If someone (maliciously or negligently) posts libellous falsehoods, they might (quite rightly) be liable in law (perhaps a warning to this effect should be placed at the bottom of the edit window). But where would an admin stand who reverted a deletion of the liable, or worse still protected the libellous version? Could the admin be held liable in law, what if he or she acted negligently (not checking the edit history)? And to complicate matters, what law governs? Florida, law of the injured party, law of the admin's location? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 23:21, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, what a tangled web this weaves... what law applies depends on two factors:
<dl>
<dd>First, the law of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflicts_of_law.html" title="Conflicts of law">conflicts of law</a> followed in Utah. Some states apply the law of the place where the "wrong" occurred (either in Florida, or in the home state of the admin doing the reversion/protecting at issue) or in the state where the "injury" occurred (which, for things posted on the internet, could be anywhere), and some states just apply their own law no matter what. Utah appears to follow the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law (see <i>Jeffs v. Stubbs</i>, No. 960454 (Utah 1998)), which would use a balancing test to determine which contacts with which states were most significant, which would probably designate Florida as the place of choice.</dd>
<dd>Second, will a Utah court constitutionally be able to exercise jurisdiction over this case? For internet defamation cases in particular, courts apply the "<i>Zippo</i>" test, which examines what type of website the material is posted on, and the level of control exercised by the owner over posting. Wikipedia is fully interactive, but sells very little (certainly the purpose of the site is not to sell goods for a profit). I think the expectant plaintiff in this case is confusing the role of administrator with an employed agent of Wikipedia (the latter would likely make Wikipedia liable, and would allow the plaintiff to extract the admin's contact info from Wikipedia). However, admins are <i>not</i> agents of Wikipedia - they have no power to bind Wikipedia to anything, and have no power that is not accorded to them by their fellow editors (who are also unpaid, and can be anyone). If history is to be any guide, this Utah case is likely to meet swift dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction over any of the defendants.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's the best opinion I can render without doing any particularly intensive legal research.

<dd>Having looked at <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a>'s userpage it appears he is located in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. This would presumably make things even more complicated as it would need to involve international coordination? I believe that English law is very different to US law when it comes to Libel, and that Scottish law is similar to English law in this regard - would this come into play? <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 03:04, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As someone who used to receive multiple legal threats per day on a near-daily basis, I wouldn't worry about any legal threats that don't come from an actual, honest-to-Bob lawyer.

<p>It seems that the numbers people are always quick to cite as being "consensus" on RFA, AFD, etc, were originally added by <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> about how ridiculous our definition of "consensus" is. His exact words are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I added the numbers as part of a series of edits meant to point out how bizarre the definitions of consensus used on Wikipedia really were. I am doubly appalled to find out that people are actually citing these numbers as The One True Official Meaning of consensus; I am triply appalled when I realize that this is probably because my description of the weird definitions was dead on.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Instead of being reverted, since his additions were never discussed, they remained. Now, attempts to remove them until being discussed are being halted, only by <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a>, who is going against all the discussion on the talk page and the opinions of at least 5 others.</p>
<p>I believe that the supermajority numbers for RFA, AFD, RM, if they do indeed exist, should be detailed at RFA, AFD, RM, and not on a page about consensus. This only makes people think consensus = supermajority. Policy information about RFA, AFD, and RM belong on their respective policy pages, not on a different policy page.</p>

<p>This user above likes to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personally attack</a> <a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">Lbmixpro</a> and myself just for telling him to stop trying to insult others intelligence. Here are some examples of his bad deeds:</p>
<p>1. <i><b>His signature</b></i> - First off his signature is offensive. His signiture is&#160;:</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/h/e/User%7EIheartWWF_67cc.html" title="User:IheartWWF">IheartWWF<sup>wwf (wrestling for gays)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>2. <i><b>First Conflict</b></i> - He first insults Lbmixpro as an anon user on the talk page of the <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> article claiming of his low intelligance level and his knowledge of nothing. Which just isn't true. He is a great and respected user.</p>
<p>3. <i><b>My response to this conflict</b></i> - His IP address is 168.243.84.113. See his talk page for the message I left the IP address. I got involved here because Lbmixpro was gaining stress because of him and I was trying to help out a bit.</p>
<p>4. <i><b>Second Conflict with Lbmixpro and me</b></i> - Now I'm no genius but it looks like the anon user above created the IheartWWF account also. He left a very rude message to Lbmixpro on his <a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro">talk page</a>.</p>
<p>I am just now reporting this to someone. He obviously created this account just to vandalize and/or make personal attacks to other users. IheartWWf and 168.243.84.113 should both have a permanent block. There is no room on Wikipedia for a person that just likes to make a fuss. Please can anyone do anything about this? <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316">User:SWD316</a> I also just recently discovered his editing to the <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> as another anon, 213.55.89.8.

<dd>Maybe he's been spending too much time on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> articles.&#160;;) Seriously though, this is a tough one because ZM is basically a good editor that seems to have this ironclad belief that everything is a conspiracy (here and outside of Wikipedia). It seems to me like it's a case of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracism.html" title="Conspiracism">conspiracism</a>. The fact that his opinions have been opposed by the vast majority of editors and that he's been blocked for his disruption probably only solidify his convictions. I do think that when his behavior reaches the point of making accusations and personal attacks against editors, additional dispute resolution steps are necessary. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:33, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I am on probation for <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> and related articles and have temporarily voluntarily refrained from editing them since Jimbo Wales said via email he was going to look into the issue. I accept that many editors of some articles disagree with me on content but the recent incident on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> was a case of the majority censoring the <i>existence</i> of a dispute, in my interpretation. I can agree to disagree as far as content is concerned but wikipedia's NPOV policy generally requires signifying the existence of a dispute by adding the {npov} template to the disputed article which is why I was so flabbergasted and got so riled up at the repeated removal of the {npov} template. And I am still waiting for someone to explain how my past comments were "personal attacks" exactly but I plan to move forward regardless. If you feel I have violated wikipedia policy then by all means file a request for arbitration (or explain your specific concerns to me directly). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 07:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While I don't particularly care for Simon's way of putting it, he does make a good point. There has been considerable criticism against having the next Arbitration Committee appointed rather than elected, because many people don't like <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BackRoomDecision" class="extiw" title="meatball:BackRoomDecision">BackRoomDecisions</a> and fear that this may appoint a candidate with friends in the right places in favor of a more capable one. It also seems that public faith in the ArbCom has been dropping, and faith would likely be improved by having a fair election. Finally, neither Jimbo nor the ArbCom have (to my knowledge) been willing to comment on this situation, or give reasons for their not wanting an election. I must say I find this troubling. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:35, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not haveing an endorsements/dissendorsements page is a decision that predates Jimbo's announcement. I assume that people will find way around this.

<dd>I'm sorry but there seems to be a fair bit of confusion and of course this is my fault. My suggestion that the methods of creating arbcom members needs to change does not in any way have anything to do with appointing a cabal, and in fact my motivation is primarily the opposite, in the sense that I feel that one of the major problems with last year's process is that only one type of user was favored in the election, which is famous users who are well-connected politically in the community (i.e. a cabal!).</dd>

<dd>Now, we ended up with absolutely excellent arbitrators of course but the committee needs to grow, and we need to consider the dangers of having a committee which is too scared of popular votes. There's a delicate balance which needs to be struck between judicial independence and community feedback and control.

<li>As Geni said, discussion regarding endorsements and disendorsements dates all the way back to the 2004 election, after which more-or-less everyone concluded doing it again was an inherently stupid idea - which is why it was explicetely stated that none would be created this year. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 18:20, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but that is missing my point. I agree that (dis)endorsements are a bad idea. However, I also think that refusing to hold elections and not bothering to inform the community <i>why</i>, is a bad idea.

<li>Yes. The elections are cancelled, for reasons unknown.

<li>See, that is already more information than was previously available. Does the community vote on each individual candidate, or on the group? And what will happen if a candidate gets insufficient support, does Jimbo have spare candidates? Do we get to know in advance who they are? Does he start with 15 candidates for 12 seats? Or do we get an ArbCom with less people? Wouldn't it be easier to have Jimbo handpick e.g. 18 candidates and install the 12 that get the most community support? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:00, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He is very much in the wrong. These page moves and forks are out of order. Firstly, to say that the Church of England is not catholic is POV (and, in my opinion, demonstrably wrong). Secondly, to say that there is a need to disambiguate between two things which are actually the same thing is false. Thirdly, why do we need to have "England" in the title? I am still searching for this other city called Salisbury that has a cathedral. Fourthly, it is certainly some people's opinion that the Reformation, in legal terms, actually was a non-event. It was only Henry VIII working out he had certain rights, and making Parliament tell everyone that (well, that was <i>his</i> POV, anyway). This whole thing is so full of PoV and potential misunderstanding that a debate should have been held first.

He was less than civil in the <a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html#dioceses" title="User talk:Duncharris">only talk interaction</a> he's had so far. Duncharris and myself have both tried to talk to him. Maybe someone else should try? If he ignores us, then yes, I think we should revert his changes. If anything else, it would set REALLY bad precedent if we let a new user make a massive # of moves (I believe he's over 40 now) without discussing it anywhere first. And yes I agree with Sam, this isn't a cut and dry case.

<dd>I agree with Sean that it's highly inappropriate to make these changes without prior discussion. I find, though, that I'm getting confused by the whole thing. For example, I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bessarion&amp;diff=29362166&amp;oldid=28207373" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bessarion&amp;diff=29362166&amp;oldid=28207373" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on <a href="../../../b/e/s/User_talk%7EBessarion_2cb6.html" title="User talk:Bessarion">Bessarion's talk page</a> saying that "we only disambiguate when we have to (such as for the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Liverpool_a751.html" title="Bishop of Liverpool">Bishop of Liverpool</a>, because there are simultaneously CofE and Catholic Bishops of Liverpool", but when I clicked on <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Liverpool_a751.html" title="Bishop of Liverpool">Bishop of Liverpool</a>, I was taken straight to the page on the Anglican Bishop, with no mention of or link to the (Roman) Catholic Bishop. I don't know if there <i>is</i> an article on him or not. Also, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bangor%2C_Wales_%28Catholic%29_fcf9.html" title="Bishop of Bangor, Wales (Catholic)">Bishop of Bangor, Wales (Catholic)</a> is now redirecting to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bangor_aba0.html" title="Bishop of Bangor">Bishop of Bangor</a>, which is an article about the Anglican office, belonging to the category "Anglican bishops by diocese".</dd>
<dd>I also agree with Sam that it's POV to say that the Church of England is not catholic. I don't personally use the term "Roman Catholic", partly because the Catholic Church doesn't officially call her self "Roman Catholic" (note that we have a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church_82ad.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>, not a Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church), and partly because it excludes Eastern Catholics (e.g. Byzantine Rite) who are in union with the pope. However, I have no objection when <i>others</i> say "Roman Catholic", and I'm quite happy to go along with Wikipedia policy. However, I think all the articles about bishops should make it very clear (near the top of the article, though not necessarily in the title) whether it's a (Roman) Catholic or and Anglican bishop. I'd support undoing the moves, and, where necessarily, making the article clearer. If Bessarion wants them moved, let's have a proper discussion first. (And by the way, shouldn't the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bangor%2C_Wales_%28Catholic%29_fcf9.html" title="Bishop of Bangor, Wales (Catholic)">Bishop of Bangor, Wales (Catholic)</a> be deleted rather than redirected to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bangor_aba0.html" title="Bishop of Bangor">Bishop of Bangor</a>?) <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:33, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of these edits are counter-intuitive. Bessarion (<a href="../../../b/e/s/User_talk%7EBessarion_2cb6.html" title="User talk:Bessarion">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bessarion_ccca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bessarion">contribs</a>) seems to be creating seperate Anglican/Catholic pages for every bishop in England and Wales. In most instances, there is no modern Catholic bishop in that see, so the mediaeval history of the see (before the creation of an indepenent Church of England) is seperated from its modern history. If there are two or more bishops of different churches in the same see, then it is appropriate to disambiguate. However, the man who was Catholic bishop of a diocese at the time of the split with Rome, would, in many cases, be the Anglican bishop after it: the lucky fellow gets two Wikipedia pages. The approach of this user is simply wrong, and is a clear case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 13:11, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit at a loss to know what to do about the persistent vandalism of <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagrationi.html" title="Bagrationi">Bagrationi</a> - see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bagrationi&amp;limit=150&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bagrationi&amp;limit=150&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of that article. It's the work of a Georgian ultranationalist, <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">User:Levzur</a>, who the Arbitration Committee members may recall from an (uncompleted) arbitration last year. He appears to be unhappy with the current version of the article and has evidently decided that if he can't impose his version, he will blank it, vandalise it or move it to a nonsense page name. As his user account is blocked for an extensive period, he's exploiting his ISP's proxy server to avoid blocks.</p>
<p>This has been going on now for several weeks. We can't protect the article indefinitely, obviously; there's little point in blocking individual IP addresses, as he will simply log on again and get another; we could block his ISP's /16 but that would cause collateral damage to other users; other than having a lot of people watching the article and reverting when it gets hit, is there anything more that we can do?</p>
<p>This sort of thing really highlights why we need to be able to block individual users or IPs from editing individual articles. If it were possible, I'd simply block 213.157.0.0/16 from blocking <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagrationi.html" title="Bagrationi">Bagrationi</a>, and that would put an end to it. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a similar problem going on on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article.

<li>The content which is being removed: "I left because of a user called Pigsonthewing. If he frustrates you too, my heart goes out to you." is clearly not constructive and helps create a hostile atmosphere. IMO there's a good case for removing it, although Pigsonwings probably shouldn't do it himself. - 82.172.14.108 13:24, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Two administrators have already intervened to stop the removal of that content (one by protected the page for almost two months, the other by reverting it multiple times), so if there were a good case for removing it, you'd think they'd have done it.

<dd>Well, then it should also be noted that it isn't strictly true... Leonig Mig has NOT left, he just changed user names. Another significant fact not mentioned here is that this situation is the mirror image of a previous dispute where Leonig Mig kept removing a statement about himself from Pigsonthewing's user page. Neither action (posting negative comments about another user and removing such comments from someone else's user page) is particularly helpful, but am I the only one finding it odd that in both cases there were official complaints filed about Pigsonthewing's actions... and not Leonig Mig's essentially identical behaviour? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 09:52, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't think this is a good case for protection of the userpage of Leonard Mig--such unconstructive statements, particularly from departed editors who have decided not to continue contributing, cannot be intended to further the task of writing the encyclopedia.

<dd>Removing content from others' user pages is generally frowned upon, unless it is a blatant personal attack. Leonig Mig is simply stating his reason for leaving. Others have done the same thing — when Redwolf24 left for a little while, he posted on his user page why he left; RickK did the same. The only difference is Leonig Mig's reason for leaving is a user, not an issue or an abstract "them". POTW, if a user pissed you off to such an extent that you decided to leave the project, wouldn't you appreciate the right to state calmly on your own user page that you left because of them? I know I would. Please just leave his user page alone and move on. We need to be building an encyclopedia here, not revert-warring over a user page that (comparatively) very few people will see. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">H</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a><a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">rmione</a><b><a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHermione1980_21b0.html" title="User talk:Hermione1980">1980</a></b> 12:54, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But I think it's a disputable point whether it gives an objectively true reason to anyone who reads it. I've no doubt that Leonig Mig was upset, but it seems open to interpretation whether he was unreasonably hassled, or had a hissy fit because he wouldn't accept that all his work needed editing to conform to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. If that was the case, why did Leonig Mig create another account and continue to provide edits? Why not remain with the Leonig Mig account? Most likely answer: because Pigsonthewing harassed him until he simply could not stand log in. Pigsonthewing habitually skirts <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> (often gaming the system) to get his POV on edits.</dd>
<dd>Besides, when a user leaves, I think it's highly disrespectful to subsequently edit their userpage because you disagree with why they left. If you believe it to be an attack, get an admin to make the change for you (assuming they can be convinced), don't do it yourself. Locke Cole 20:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It would be a valid reason if there were any long-term vandalism going on. Before today, the IP had 3 edits, 1 of them good. Just one of those 3 was in last 6 months. Today, the IP vandalized 3 pages, and restored one of them back to its original state. So what we have here is an IP vandalizing 1 page two weeks ago and 2 pages today.

<dd>I've unblocked because I don't think the IP was warned sufficiently and there's no evidence this is a long-term "problem"; the IP is a shared school IP.

<dd>For clearly long-term vandals, even from shared IPs (not AOL-level of "sharing" but, say, a middle school), I don't even bother with warning because their talk page is already flooded with warnings.

<p>Perhaps we can have a somewhat neutral party look at this? This is by far the most vandalized article on Wikipedia. Two things cause damage to our reputation - having a vandalized article, and preventing editing. In the case of this article, which someone estimated to be in a vandalized state 8% of the time, I say the vandalism damages our reputation far more than preventing the "wiki way". You may note that all of these are in the <i>last 24 hours</i>, so there's somewhat of a <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_war.html" title="Wheel war">wheel war</a> going on. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 17:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Constant vandalism and reversion of that vandalism <i>does</i> prevent productive editing when it reaches the level of the Bush article. There's usually hundreds of edits per day to that article, the vast majority of which are vandalism or reverts.

<dd>I would opine that <i>strictly</i> speaking Everyking's remarks do fall within those permitted by the ruling (full text at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_3_84a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 3">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 3</a>); talk pages of an RfArb would fall within the criteria listed.</dd>
<dd>I suspect that this sort of commentary isn't what the ArbCom intended to allow Everyking to engage in, but I can't and won't try to read minds. I might suggest that Everyking could more helpfully contribute to the arbitration by actually presenting evidence to support Xed's claims rather than arguing with Snowspinner on a talk page.</dd>
<dd>A request for clarification at RFArb would provide a definitive answer as well as giving the ArbCom members an opportunity–should they so desire–to clarify their intent. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:50, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps this is another point that should be clarified with the ArbCom.

That the discussion of Everyking's actions was actually started by another editor shouldn't bar him from posting.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, Everyking's response above seems technically over the line of the ArbCom remedy—he is editorializing about Snowspinner's actions in a forum that is <i>not</i> prescribed by the remedy.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I think everyone here would be happiest of we could all get a quiet night's sleep, and any further discussion of this matter (that is, clarifications of what is and is not covered under the remedy) be taken to WP:RFArb.

<p>Ha, I was holding my breath when I clicked the edit button...pleasantly surprised...anyway, I think everybody already knows what I think about the ArbCom decision, and about Snowspinner's complaint here by extension. Let's hope Jimbo repeals at least part of my restrictions—those of you who are critical of me should hope for that too, because nobody knows when they're gonna get stuck in a position where they're in trouble for holding a dissenting view about something, and it's better for all of us if we can be comfortable about our discussions.

<dd>I think you can rest assured that arbcom is not bound by precedents, but rather it actually considers the situation at hand. But also, rest assured that no other soul will face an arbitration for expressing dissenting views here incivilly, as long as they don't express dissenting views here <i>incivilly</i>. I, for one, have no qualms about dissenting here, and plenty of others have been able to do so without ending up before arbcom. Now, I think this thread has probably outlived it's usefulness. <small>Isn't there an encyclopedia somewhere around here...?</small> <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:00, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The complicating factor is that it was basically determined that the ruling wasn't about incivility. I apologized for incivility in the past and hadn't done it in a good while. Actually the ruling was about the ArbCom's view that my views were "ignorant" (they say I didn't read evidence, which is untrue), and their view (or at least Raul's view) that my views were not "rational" enough for me to have a right to make them heard. Which is really kinda scary, because if my views are crazy all of us must be crazy—broadly speaking, I don't think we differ on very many points here, just a few particularly contentious issues. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:09, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Same difference. Replace my "incivility" with your "ignorance" and read it again. This isn't the place to be disputing, or really even discussion, the arbcom case.

<dd>It's a violation of the spirit, not sure about the letter. That said, I think your response deals with the problem conclusively, and no action is needed as yet: <i>"I'm not sure there's basis to say that the committee is biased in favor of me - the bulk of the evidence presented against me was by John Gohde, who's evidence mostly consisted of personal attacks. Netoholic managed to scrounge up some edits to other people's user pages... Lir had a block to complain about... there was a bit of stuff in the Anthony case... but nobody has ever assembled a body of evidence of abusive behavior on my part. The only block-related evidence I can find that's been submitted was by Lir. You have caught yourself in a Catch-22 - nobody submits evidence against me because the arbcom has never been willing to sanction me, and they've been unwilling to sanction me because nobody has presented them with a shred of evidence.

I have previously investigated and verified that Jason is in fact using sockpuppets; however, his use of sockpuppets is not clearly a violation of policy. Jason emailed me to complain about this. This is, in my opinion, an inappropriate block, as indefinite blocks for IPs for any reason other than open proxy are completely against the blocking policy.</p>
<p>Jason has admitted the use of sockpuppets but as of yet his use of sockpuppets has not violated policy (see his <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJason_Gastrich_3b68.html" title="User talk:Jason Gastrich">talk page</a> for further discussion). Further, he has agreed not to use sockpuppets anymore, and we should take him on his word on this issue. Jason is, as far as I can tell, a POV pusher and something of an edit warrior, but neither of these things is enough for Jason to have earned a life ban from Wikipedia, and especially without public comment or even the slightest bit of attention to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a>. That this punishment was imposed without even any public comment (that I can find) makes it that much more reprehensible.</p>
<p>I have had Jason's main IP unblocked and will be checking to see if Karmafist has blocked any of Jason's other IPs. I would strongly advise Karmafist (if he's even remotely interested in keeping his adminship) to leave Jason alone henceforth, and to try a lot harder at following blocking policy. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 06:33, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you say you had it unblocked it sounds like I'm your sock, or a cabalmeister&#160;;-) but point is I warned Karma on his talk page. Well, both of them screwed up, both probably learned their lesson (karmafist hasn't gotten back to me yet). Although Karma messed up and he's an admin, I think we shouldn't treat him too badly, both were in the wrong and I believe Karma was in his mind trying to do what's best. I don't think he's done anything remotely close to as bad as the 6 or 7 users who were forcedly desysopped. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle3_b4f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle3"><font color="gray">Attention Washingtonians!</font></a> 06:38, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>any admin who has no clear idea of the difference of the job of an admin and the job of the arbcom <b>should not be an admin</b> in the first place. Everybody makes mistakes, but it is necessary to recognize them, and apologize where necessary. If Karmafist doesn't publicly recognize that an admin may not unilaterally permaban editors (as opposed to throw-away accounts), I say he turned rogue. I'm sorry, but what is it with all the vigilantism in the face of policy, recently? We can <i>change</i> policy if we feel it necessary that admins can permablock users, but we'll have to change it <i>first</i> and permaban <i>later</i>. I am not calling for the "defrocking" of anybody who in the heat of the moment permablocks an account (it is easily enough reverted, no harm done). I <i>do</i> call for the defrocking of anyone who does that, and afterwards refuses to admit it was a mistake. So yeah, let's wait for karma's statement. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:57, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've permablocked an editor. No one complained (well one person sort of complained but that didn't go very far and the person blocked complained to the point of createing a webpage about how evil we all were). I think the person tried to appeal to jimbo but I don't belive it worked out.

<ul>
<li>I think the main problem is that at times, people are confused as to what policy really is. For instance, admins do on occasion permablock users (e.g. trolls, or legal threateners). So I think that DAB's vision on the situation is overly harsh. The mistakes here seem to be 1) indefinitely blocking an IP address that is not an open proxy, and 2) forgetting that sockpuppets are legal if they're not abused. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:58, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>am I being overly harsh? I insist that it is important that admins feel obliged to exemplary behaviour, and that implies regard for both spirit and letter of policy. Admins have a lot of leeway for sane judgement, but there is <i>policy</i>, which no admin should thwart knowingly. Specifically, there is the 'disruption' clause, and I am in full agreement that admins should be allowed to intelligently interpret "disruption", and I fully expect that different admins may come to different conclusions. That is not the problem at all. It is my understanding that we may block indefinitely:
<ul>
<li>open proxies</li>
<li>throwaway vandal accounts</li>
<li>impersonators</li>
<li>socks of arbcom- or Jimbo-banned users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that's it. Not for vandalism, not for trolling, not for personal attacks, and not for being stupid or for being a jerk. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother to block trolls 24h at a time for 3RR, either [see further up on this page]. Extremely annoying people may be blocked by admins, as <i>ultima ratio</i> for <b>one month</b>. I'm sorry, that's simply what <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_69c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking">Wikipedia:Blocking</a> says, and I marvel that I should be required to spell this out to my fellow admins. Any admin permablocking editors for reasons other than those mentioned above is outside policy, should reduce the block to one month at most, and should admit that they have made a mistake. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:52, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think Karmafist has "forgotten" anything, he's quite capable of quoting policy until the cows come home. He is, not to put too fine a point on it, drunk with power. There's a really unhealthy tendency among many admins to see bending the rules and allowing exceptions for other admins, not as something to be done rarely when common sense absolutely dictates it, but as something to be done as a matter of course. He has banned another user (<a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Pigsonthewing</a>) basically for continuing to annoy him while there's an RfA outstanding - an RfA in which <i>he is himself the main complainant</i> (the block was revoked and reimposed by <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> shortly afterwards, following offline discussion with Karmafist). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Karmafist#Sorry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Karmafist#Sorry" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details. Karmafist has unsuccessfully applied twice now to be a mediator, and his notion of "mediation" is to decide which side of an argument is the right one, and clobber the other side into submission - not a definition of mediation I recognise (and I've worked with professional mediators). He is now applying to join the arbitration committee, presumably with the intention of applying the same sense of fair play and sticking to policy. Frankly, as someone who has watched his spat with Pigsonthewing from the sidelines, this has made me feel there ought to be an easier way of removing admin powers from users, and Karmafist ought to be first in line. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 14:50, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If the remark about offline (?) discussion is meant to imply something about my role, I wish you'd spell it out. I undid Karmafist's block of Pigsonthewing because I know (from many a thread on this noticeboard) that they're in conflict and then I blocked POTW for harrassing several editors—I'd just been reading some of his edits. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:40, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

One of the cornerstones of justice is transparency, and conducting this sort of business on IRC does not give me any confidence that it is being done fairly. Talk pages (including this one) are there for a purpose - if there's a reason for blocking someone, as <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> says below, it needs to be discussed and done in public and somewhere where there is a permanent record, not on IRC. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 12:44, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

To Brumburger: Rhetoric is a fine thing, but do you really take it to be the norm that issues involving a third party <i>are</i> discussed on talk pages? I believe wiki e-mail is used extensively for that. Sorry I didn't realize that IRC was referred to as being "offline", it seems a curious usage. Anyway, yes, I needed to speak with Karmafist in Real Time, and quickly, to discuss his block of POTW, ask his reasons, and tell him, as the blocking admin, that I meant to unblock. IMO that's courtesy, and avoidance of block wars. If secrecy rather than speed had been my object, I would hardly have put a note on Karmafist's talkpage and then used the main channel of #wikipedia, with its 200 lurkers and nobody knows how many loggers. There <i>is</i> wiki e-mail, after all.

<li>If you believe so, please open an RFC on Karmafist and cite evidence and diffs of his repeated abuse of admin powers.

<li>Radiant, Brumburger gives his opinion, and is being fully on-topic to the case at hand. To ask im to open a full-blown rfc or shut up is legalistic and unconstructive. I tend to agree with Brumburger's take, although not necessarily as clear-cut as he makes it. There is a problem with "tough gun" admins, and Karmafist is close to the line, if not across it. There is a balance to be kept: on one hand, we don't want admins who block first and ask questions later (if at all), as autocrats, but on the other hand, we don't want endless indulgence to the point of ridicule either. This board is precisely the place where we exchange opinions about whether the balance is kept, or tilting. Karmafist now has a few opinions here that he may be too close to the line, and he is free take them into consideration -- or not. If the problem gets worse, or if Karamfist takes a confrontational rather than a conciliatory course in the face of criticism, of course the natural continuation of this discussion will be on an rfc. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:43, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I didn't write "...or shut up", please don't put words in my mouth. Brumburger just said that Karmafist should have his adminship revoked, which is a serious matter and certainly grounds a "full-blown" RFC.

And Tearlach, what you're talking about is exactly one of the problems that i'm talking about below, and I ultimately did it to prove a point mostly; POTW has done this hundreds of times throughout his wiki-career, and what's happened? Nothing. He continues to intimidate and kick others while they're down, yet he has whined and complained to this page time and time again when the same thing is percieved to have been done to him. You can see on that page that at the advice of Tony Sidaway I stopped, and what happened? Nothing. The harrassment only intensified. However, he does this because he knows there's no retribution for his actions, just like his time at USENET.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Like I said below, someone had to step in and be proactive in stopping POTW's rampage. Fortunately, since yesterday it looks like i'm not alone anymore. Unfortunately, it took what is being perceived by some people above as an IAR -- despite what Tearlach might think, this situation has brought me anything but joy, but this is my responsibility as an Admin and a Wikipedian. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 23:58, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What rampage? The only "rampage" I can see was when you began provoking him. Until this started, POTW has always struck me an editor who was predominantly rational, and mostly got into conflicts with editors who were doing something fairly egregious anyway.</dd>

<p>This is typical of what's wrong nowadays with Wikipedia in my opinion -- people flying off the handle without knowing what's going on or not doing anything with full well knowledge of what's going on.</p>
<p>First off, I never blocked <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">user:Jason Gastrich</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Karmafist&amp;page=User%3AJason+Gastrich" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Karmafist&amp;page=User%3AJason+Gastrich" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, I blocked the accounts here now seeing that Kelly Martin convinced Jason not to use them anymore.</p>
<p>He misunderstood as a newbie, fearing that his contreversial status outside Wikipedia would make him a target, thus necessitating the need for sockpuppets. I told him that sockpuppetry would only make things worse for him and said they sockpuppets aren't acceptable under this situation, but since he was new, it was a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> situation and he could continue to edit under that name since he didn't understand that before. At some point in the future, he may feel the need to use those sockpuppets again, and my goal was to assist him going cold turkey on socks if he saw himself in that position in the future.</p>
<p>I'll put any other discussion on discussion of my views on sockpuppets at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia_talk%7ESock_puppet_f0d9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Sock puppet">Wikipedia talk:Sock puppet</a> to save space here, but needless to say, in my opinion, sockpuppets are never acceptable under any circumstance other than personal threats towards the original user, such as in the case of <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonig_Mig_2d3d.html" title="User:Leonig Mig">Leonig Mig</a></p>
<p>Who, speaking of which, was driven from his primary user account of fear from that user account by continuous abuse from <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Pigsonthewing</a>. Was this behavior reprimanded? No. This is in my opinion the largest of his policy violations, but definately not the only one. Yet, despite an rfc and weeks of an rfar, POTW continues his casual edit wars and talk page abuse unabated. Thumbing his nose at the arbcom and not even responding to his rfar since he sees them as powerless. Unfortunately, so far he's been right.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made a template to use in cases where he had badmouthed me elsewhere(he badmouths just about anyone who disagrees with him in any way), and he basically tried to sabotage even that. That was the last straw. I had not blocked him time and time again because of the rfar, waiting for the arbcom to do something to stem his behavior. However, my faith in the arbcom's unwillingness to do anything despite over 100 pieces of evidence showing his behavior had diminished to the point where I felt that I was the only person left who would do what is necessary to curb his behavior.</p>
<p>I respect Kelly Martin and a few of the other arbcommers i've met individually, but as a whole, right now the arbcom itself as a whole is impotent and overworked. Something needs to be done about this endemic problem, and I often feel like i'm the only one who's willing to sacrifice their reputation in order to do it.</p>
<p>Feel free to martyr me if you'd like. I'd gladly give up my adminship if I could help users like Leonig Mig can edit free from fear of intimidators like Pigsonthewing or make users like Jason Bauder out there know that there is a force out there that will help you if you feel like you're being assaulted by a "cabal". However, as long as i'm an admin, I'll do what I need to do in order to make sure what needs to be done regarding problem users is done. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 18:56, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You actually blocked my IP address. I use the same IP address for Jason Gastrich and any socks. When I tried to post/edit with User:Jason Gastrich, I was forbidden.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Karmafist brought this issue to this very page on Nov. 22. If you read up, you'll see that two administrators essentially told her she shouldn't ban me. She apparently didn't care what they thought or said.</p>
<p>It certainly was opinion when you said, "in my opinion, sockpuppets are never acceptable under any circumstance other than personal threats". This certainly isn't what the Wiki rules say about sockpuppets. The rules mention several valid reasons for their usage.</p>
<p>When you banned my IP, I was in the middle of seeking a 3rd party admin to discuss my future use of socks. The discussion can be seen on my talk page. In fact, I have left it there and I've been waiting. It seems that your opinion on this subject doesn't match Wiki's rules and it also seems that I was using them correctly.</p>
<p>At any rate, it would be wise to apologize for the hasty/unnecessary ban and seek ammends with the others you've offended. I haven't been using sockpuppets lately because I'd like to get the consensus on my/their usage. I'd like to follow the rules concerning them, but I don't feel that you're a good representative of (at least in this case and the ban, which is all I know of you) Wiki policy.--<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 23:02, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>And yet you know full well you tried to astroturf the vote in the deletion of the "Jason Gastrich" page. Or what's called "meatpuppets" here I understand. That's why there were so many one off comments and votes, most not even bothering to create an account. Most <b>also</b> showed up at an incorrect page because you broadcast an erroneous link in your little mailing didn't you? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<p>I agree with Geni and Radiant that there are occasions where we can use our common sense on certain editors. Ignore all Rules is there when we're trying to make things better, and of course some people do abuse IAR, but don't just have the arbcom do everything that may be controversial. There's a clause in the blocking policy (oh, we DID edit the policy afterall) stating some editors are just so bad that none of the 670 admins will bother to unblock. Of course, this is abusable on low-profile editors, but on editors like BigDaddy777 and <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowwarrior1977_bac3.html" title="User:Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a> and to some extent, <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>, this has been handy. -Ril- did finally get unblocked, and got better, which is a good thing. BigDaddy pissed off pretty much everyone, and had it coming with all the things he did wrong, a monkey could see he wasn't helping us out. Rainbowwarrior1977 also kept within the rules, but he was annoying a lot of editors, and that's when I blocked him indefinitely (I later talked to him through e-mail, he admitted he was trolling). If someone's misblocking, then undo the block, talk to them about it. But don't tell everyone to not get rid of obvious trolls and to wait for the arbcom to sort everything out. They do enough and they're overworked enough. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle3_b4f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle3"><font color="gray">Attention Washingtonians!</font></a> 02:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should not, I repeat, <b>should not</b> have a "can't block until ArbComm tells me to" blocking policy. It is simply detrimental to Wikipedia. I do not believe in "shoot first, ask questions later" as something that admins should use, but it is simply necessary in cases of obvious abuse. That's what this page's for, to review those kinds of things. If I recall correctly, {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} reads, "This user has been blocked indefinitely from editing Wikipedia, per <b>ruling of administrators</b>, Jimbo Wales and/<b>or</b> the Arbitration committee." The ArbComm might ask us to have some common sense, as they <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rainbowwarrior1977_bc96.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rainbowwarrior1977">have already</a>. Besides, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a bureaucracy</a>, and having to go through one for every single egregious offense of Wikipedia policy is simply giving too much respect to vandals, trolls and malactors, while slapping in the face those who are here to write an encyclopedia and who actually need the support to continue doing what they need to do.

<dd>I very much agree with what you say. We just need to make that clear in policy, and have some mechanism of review to prevent abuse (partisan blocking by involved admins over escalating content disputes). We could call it "indefinite community bans", and do a subpage of AN dedicated to them, where admins are required to list their blocks, and their reasons, so we can easily check which users at a given moment are "banned on basis of common sense". Unblocking admins can give <i>their</i> reasons, and only if there is no consensus among admins does it need to be taken to a more bureaucratic level. Yes, common sense should come first. We just need a way to keep things in the open, so every case isn't dragged here with shouts of admin abuse. But note that blocks for one month are almost never issued: it's either a couple of days, or indefinite. For practical purposes, a month's ban is pretty much identical to an indefinite ban, because any self-respecting pov-pusher will be back with a sock army long before the month is over. In clear [common sense] cases, I would just block for a month. if the user is back after a month, and hasn't reformed, it's cheap to block him for another month. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 07:44, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This sounds like a good idea to me. One way to make it less controversial might be if admins put up an initial block for just a couple of days to stop ongoing disruption and then inform the blocked user and the noticeboard (or subpage as you suggest) of intent to extend it to an indefinite block. That leaves a window for commentary if anyone disagrees with the action. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:red">T</span></a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CBDunkerson_ea5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:green">C</span></a></sub> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:blue">@</span></a></sup> 10:41, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Our <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brockville%2C_Ontario_2038.html" title="Brockville, Ontario">Brockville, Ontario</a> article is undergoing a (rather tame, really) vandalism attack eminating from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_University_935c.html" title="Queen's University">Queen's University</a> in Canada. It's not a big deal, and several editors have the problem well under control. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brockville%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29713879" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brockville%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29713879" rel="nofollow">This edit</a>, however, goes some way to explaining the cause - that editor insinuates that the vandalism is at the instigation of a professor. The pattern of the vandalism (changing statistics to wildly incorrect values) would tend to support, circumstantially, that assertion. This isn't the first time I've seen a similar claim (I forget the previous instance, but I believe it was a college in the US), and I was wondering of those among you who have better understanding of tertiary education in North America might have some ideas about how we might deal with such institutionalised miscreancy. I can't help but wonder whether the same ethics codes that proscribe plagiarism and cheating would also take a rather dim view of an academic organising a concerted assault on what is, after all, an educational charity.</p>
<p>I'm not, really, suggesting we fire off a blazing complaint to said body's ethics committee (we don't really have enough evidence, and that, at least in this case, would be severe overreaction), but vandalising Wikipedia articles to prove that it can be done is rather akin to pushing old ladies over in the street to prove how fragile their bones are.</p>
<p>Can anyone think of a (constructive, ideally) way we can persuade this institution to regard Wikipedia as something to protect, rather than victimise?</p>
<p>(Can I ask, incidentally, that other admins <i>not</i> protect the page: better they try to prove their point on that article, where they can be noticed and reverted, than force them off into other articles.)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It has came to our attention* that our article on Brockville, Ontario ** "was briefly mentioned in a political sciences lecture in Queen's university on November 29th as an example of how wikipedia can be tampered with, and therefore is not a scholarly source for citing purposes." and is now a target of vandalism, originating from your IP addresses***.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We are assuming that the vandals are some of your students attempting to 'prove the point'. We don't know if your lecturer encouraged students to actively vandalise Wiki, but we would appreciate it if you could kindly inform him or her that Wikipedia is not only a source cited in many academic publications****, but that he can observe how efficently we deal with vandalism by seeing that all falsified information entered into this article is removed within few minutes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, we would appreciate it if you could inform the individuals engaged in vandalising our site that their behaviour is not acceptable and goes against any recongnized codes of academic conduct, as their actions are unethical and causing harm to the society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We invite all of your faculty and students interesting in Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia in the world, to familiarize themselves with how we work**** and ask questions*****.</dd>

It appears that an editor wanted to move it to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a> (small "t"), but that is currently a protected redirect.

<dd>If you're talking about me: I ignored that because I did not see that. I did not look at the article(s) or at the talk page(s) before I moved the page, I only looked at the edit histories. The full history of the page was at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Terror_a2ec.html" title="American Terror">American Terror</a>, therefore that is where the article should be.

<dd>Agreed. Maintaining the integrity of the page history is highest priority, as otherwise we can get in hot soup over copyrights.

<p>This user created a page advertising a product and website. After I asked them (politely I thought) not to, they created a page of abuse obviously aimed at me (which I deleted - you can probably deduce from my delete log which page it was). I'm signing off now, so cannot continue to monitor - could someone keep an eye on this user please? They might be persistent, as I notice that they have just <i>recreated</i> the advertisement page which I originally deleted. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 17:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
