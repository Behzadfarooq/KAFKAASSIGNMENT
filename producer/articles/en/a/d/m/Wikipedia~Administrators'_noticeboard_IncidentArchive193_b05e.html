<p>I'm not <i>sure</i> what a "Sicilian haircut" is, though it does sound like a threat of physical violence to me. Also, I don't think it's acceptable per <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> to call other users "nasty little trolls". So, what can be done? We've been going round and round with ArbCom on Giano for months, but no remedy ever sticks, and Giano just keeps on being Giano week after week.

<dl>
<dd>Damned if I can tell you what to do. The <i>last</i> thing I want to do is go near the Giano mess; I duck and cover whenever I see another thread. About all I have gleaned from the edges of it is that Giano and Ideogram have been being assholes towards each other for at least the last few weeks, and probably longer. I don't know who started it. It's possible that Ideogram really is a nasty little troll; it may be that Giano is an abrasive dick. It's even possible that both of those things are true.</dd>

<dd>I wish they'd both stop it, though. If there's an ongoing ArbCom case(?), I would be just tickled pink if someone could request an injunction that puts all of the involved parties on a very short-leashed WP:CIV and WP:NPA probation for the duration of this case. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I agree with Catchpole, and would add a suggestion that people also refrain from using template warnings on the pages of established users, as Ideogram did yesterday. It's rude and provocative. We know that Giano is an established user. Without wanting to be sarcastic, I think we can assume that he is aware that there are some administrators who will block for real or imagined "personal attacks". Also, I fail to see how the "Sicilian haircut" reference (and I don't know what it means either) could be taken as a threat of physical violence. Giano is not one of my buddies; nor are the people that he's in dispute with. But I've observed a lot simply through having certain pages on my watchlist. His huge crime at the moment seems to be that he's continuing to squabble with people who are continuing to squabble with him. Everytime someone provokes him, he responds. I've yet to see one person who genuinely wants to be left alone by Giano, but who is being constantly harassed by him. I have seen some rather bitter remarks made against the ArbCom, but (a) Giano has some reason for having resentment, and (b) when I vote people into the Arbitration Committee, I expect them to be among the best Wikipedians, which means that they should be able to cope with an occasional snide remark, even if they feel it's unjustified. And the ArbCom members <i>do</i> seem to be able to avoid rising to the bait. Show me one single person who is <i>genuinely</i> trying to edit Wikipedia articles peacefully, and who is being prevented from doing so by Giano, and I promise I'll block Giano myself. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 23:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very good points, ML, though your arithmetic is off: Giano doesn't respond every time someone provokes him, he responds about every fifth time. It would certainly be better if he didn't respond at all. For Ideogram versus Giano, it might be interesting to glance at say the last 100 edits of both users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Ideogram" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Ideogram" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Giano_II" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Giano_II" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Note especially the last edit by Ideogram (at this moment) where he follows Giano to a page he (Giano) has just created and obviously hasn't polished yet, and (Ideogram) copyedits it.

To help Wikipedia, to please Giano? You be the judge. Giano is a user he (Ideogram) has stated needs to learn to edit Ideogram's way or <b>leave</b>, along with the other problem users branded as Giano's friends--me, Geogre, Ghirlandajo, Irpen.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Newyorkbrad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103910953" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Newyorkbrad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103910953" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (Ghirlandajo actually already left a month ago.)

<dd>Sicilian haircut - I think it refers to the slashing of the face with a blade - it could be the throat - I vaguely remember an italian with a blade offering to do it to me when we had a gentleman's disagreement about something. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 23:32, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To get you <i>hair cut</i> is slang for shooting the top of someone's head off, I assume this is a variation on this. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 23:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gee, my take on it was that a Sicilian haircut was one where the aim of the "haircutter" was about 6 inches too low, getting your throat instead of your hair "by accident". Curiously, searching on Google or Yahoo provides no information. Wiktionary doesn't have an entry but perhaps they don't do slang over there. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 23:42, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gee, yes, if that isn't curious, I don't know what is. But why would the non-existence of the term (which I invented myself, and even I don't know what it means) stop a storm of speculation about cut throats and slashings across the face? Hey, I've got one, just as likely: I think Giano was getting his heritage haircut confused with a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_waxing.html" title="Brazilian waxing">Brazilian waxing</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC).

<dd>Possibly, "Sicilian haircut" isn't inherently menacing, but, when the immediate context of that enigmatic remark is: "I think you are such a nasty little troll" and that he should get said 'haircut' on "your cone shaped little head", we can perhaps understand why the above users have so foolishly and mistakenly assumed incivility, personal attacks and bad faith. The clear fact is, any other user would be blocked (or at least universally criticised) for this, regardless of the context or the excuses. And as long as experienced users make light of it, it will continue, and those who feel angry about that inconsistency will vent their utter contempt. I submit it is time to say 'enough', and excuse it no longer.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:32, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To echo Doc above, the fact that we allow users to get away with such comments, the fact that users do not care whether or not it is incivil, and the fact that the <i>community</i> is completely oblivious to such a comment being a personal attack, is shocking. We should not, and do not, tolerate such attitudes towards others; we are supposed to be a friendly and welcoming place, and that trend has slipped away. As long as we allow this to continue, we will only be further denigrated into a cesspool of hate. Let me remind you all that this is an encyclopedia. We are supposed to be helping each other to expand this place, not fightint with each other about minor issues occuring on the side. —<b><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="orange">P</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">ilotguy</a> <small><a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy">push to talk</a></small></b> 03:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, for gods sake let this drop. Giano has gone back to editing in his areas, and the broader dispute is, for the most part, seemingly over. There is no pressing need for Cyde (or, for that matter, anyone involved in the recent disputes) to have anything to do with him on-wiki unless they have some as yet undiscovered interest in architecture.

<li>Ideogram, you are on thin ice. Giano is a great contributor but has a tendency to rise to the bait when trolled. As far as I can tell, you started this - and it looks as if it was pretty deliberate. Giano can be rude and obnoxious, but I don't see him setting out to be rude and obnoxious unless provoked. Solution: do not provoke him.

<p>Maybe I can have the last word instead? I used to comment on all this sort of stuff, but a few weeks ago something snapped mentally, and I just mostly ignore it now. I engaged Giano as an editor, talked to him about a few articles, and he kindly came up with some new articles. Absolutely no problem working with him. I found all this much more satisfying than the endless repeating cycles of sniping and gnashing of teeth and wailing. My feeling is that this has all become a bit of a sideshow - Wikipedia is quietly being written in the background while people bicker over stuff like this. So I'm going to go back to the articles, article discussions, content policies, content policy discussions, and ignore (as far as possible) the user disputes. Unless they are both persistent (the case here) and serious (not the case here), ignoring them is best. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Editor A calls editor B an "asshole". Editor B snaps back. Then Cyde comes here indigantly asking what can be done about editor B. He doesn't mention editor A. And so its been going on for months... I agree with Rebecca above, particularly the part about Cyde not involving himself with this dispute. Giano has stated over and over again that he want's to let all this drop and get back to editing, and that he'll only defend himself when attacked. He's been as good as his word. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 17:25, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I want to bring to attention the user User:Booze broads and bullets. The user has a track record of uploading copyrighted material (images, text copied verbatim from websites, etc.) to WP. I'm not sure how long ago the user has been doing this but the earliest on his/her talk page is July 2006. The user has been warned several times on his/her talk page and has been generally (completely) unresponsive. The user has also uploaded copyrighted images without sources, fair use rationales and often uses inappropriate tags (logo for a photo of a person). In addition, the user also consistently removed AfD tags from articles he/she edits even though the AfD articles have not finished yet. His two latest, most blatant ones are in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Kamison_77a5.html" title="Magic Kamison">Magic Kamison</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Twins_c307.html" title="Super Twins">Super Twins</a>. In the latter case, the user removed the AfD tag twice, the second time after his previous vandalism was reverted. User has also vandalized several articles (including <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sana_Maulit_Muli_4ee8.html" title="Sana Maulit Muli">Sana Maulit Muli</a>) by changing numbers in the article <i>repeatedly</i> even after his vandalisms were reverted. Honestly, I don't know what exactly to do with the user but I can honestly claim that we do not need uncooperative, unprocedural editors such as these on wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 20:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This controversy predates my becoming active here, but I have now read the entire history of this matter, which I find exceedingly sad and disturbing. Sourcing, important as it is, is only one of the issues. There is also the matter of whether this article can ever be anything other than an attack page against a non-notable person, subject to immediate deletion in any event. It can't, and therefore, inviting an attempt at re-creation to be followed by further discussion represents an invitation to drama while serving no useful purpose. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:15, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the snopes article is a reliable source. Also, the website that has his sex offender info is obviously reliable, but that can only be used to confirm minor details on his page. Another source would be the news article about the state of ohio sex offender's office getting too much traffic to his sex offender page they were considering shutting the service down. The problem with that link is the page was taken down, but from my reading of WP:RS websites that go down can still be used as reliable sources as long as you state they are no longer working. So no, I don't see a sourcing issue with Mr. Peppers. The other issues are what we should focus on. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Can someone with more clout than I have contact Batelco and tell them that access to WP will be blocked unless they police their users? We've blocked whole schools for continuing abuse. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of the devs preferably should contact Batelco to get them to start sending XFF headers. Outside of that, no, we should never, ever intentionally block entire countries. This happened accidentally about a month and a half ago when the entire country of <a href="../../../q/a/t/Qatar.html" title="Qatar">Qatar</a> was blocked for a couple of hours; disregarding the PR backlash (which was not insignificant), it simply shouldn't happen because it doesn't help the encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 01:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not so sure - Sable232 is a well-established good-faith user who specialises in this kind of article, and there's what looks like a pretty clear case earlier in the article history where he successfully headed off some sneaky vandalism. He may have some genuine basis thinking he's dealing with another vandal, but it's hard for us to just take his word for it when he's done nothing to substantiate it - just edit warred - and any vandalism is not obvious. On that basis, I can't see anyone undoing this block. It would have helped a lot if there had been discussion on the talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the link is at <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> against vanity pages, and that's really just getting back to the fact that no <i>interested</i> party (employee, consultant, child, spouse, survivor) should be writing a biography or corporate profile. Essentially, violation of this principle is not a blocking offense by any means, if it's an article. If it appears to be an organized campaign (which is often the case when a person is <i>hired</i> to mess with us), then we block to <i>prevent</i> future disruption of our policies. Needless to say, we are victimized by employees pretty regularly despite our wariness. So many people chase the vandals that we're missing some of the sneaky self-promotion. At this point, Wikipedia's Alexa rank means Google page rank boosts, and therefore our articles are money. Since we don't accept pay, we're not going to start offering free advertising. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My user page has been vandalized several times today. I am fairly certain that the vandalism is being conducted by puppets of BWCNY since a few days ago I launched an RfC on him. He claimed to be taking a break but shortly after the RfC and subsequent announcement of a break, my User Page has become semi-regularly vandalized. BWCNY has also made some comments that seem to allude to the fact that even though the user is on break, they knew about the vandalism on my user page. The following users have received UWs from myself, but I wanted to know how to check to see if it is not one in the same:</p>

<p>I was just going to make a post about him myself. I am an admin, but I've been involved in the situation before, so I want another impartial admin to take a look. Nkras was indefinitely blocked earlier and unblocked by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa Knott</a> who gave him a second chance but has declined to get involved this time. The indefinite block was for repeatedly reposting a deleted POV fork <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">Traditional marriage</a> at various titles, and making comments to the effect that he will never accept a "consensus" that defines marriage differently than the biblical definition he prefers. Although some of his opponents stuck up for him after the indefinite block, saying it was too harsh, Nkras has never retracted his effective threat to continue POV pushing, and has in fact continued the behavior, "teaming up" with <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">User:rbj</a> to continue trying to cleanse the lead of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> of mentions of marriage other than man-woman marriage, and has effectively recreated <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">Traditional marriage</a> at Marriage (Judeo-Christian). Not to mention his consistent incivility and frequent personal attacks. In my opinion, we should return his indefinite block, as nothing that led to the block has really changed. Anyone wanting to investigate should note that he blanks his talk page, and much of the history is buried in the blanked <i>archive</i> of his talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing that out. The questions I still have are:
<ul>
<li>Is there a way to deal with the sockpuppets <i>en masse</i> (IP range ban&#160;?) or do they have to be dealt one-by-one&#160;?</li>
<li>Can edits by these sockpuppets be undone without fear of violating the 3RR rule, under the <i>"Reverting actions performed by banned users."</i> - or do we have first have to wait for the checkuser results in each case?</li>

<p>He's not making any effort to be subtle. As far as I've seen, every one of the socks has showed up out of nowhere and proceeded to make virtually the same series of POV edits with identical edit summaries. When it's that blatantly obvious, I'd go ahead and (a) revert the edit with an edit summary indicating that you are reverting edits by a sockpuppet of a banned user; (b) report the sock to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> with the diff that demonstrates why it's obviously a sock of an indef'd user; and (c) add the new sock to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> for official confirmation. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 22:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

There is also a similar story in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shasta_Groene_7576.html" title="Shasta Groene">Shasta Groene</a> where the date of birth is listed only in a passing mention of the births section of a newspaper, which is borderline acceptable at best as it shows the difficulty of obtaining any sort of a date of birth put forward to the media. Once again the AFD debate in that article was no consensus. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 16:03, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would like to see a clear policy statement on dates of birth. My reading of the BLP is that they are included where "widely available" to the public. I would hazard to say that if I can find a suject's birthdate within 90 seconds using google it is "widely available". If the subject isn't notable they shouldn't be in Wikipedia in the first place. I will note that the dates of birth for both <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara_Borden_4b09.html" title="Kara Borden">Kara Borden</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shasta_Groene_7576.html" title="Shasta Groene">Shasta Groene</a> have been in their articles since 2005, without complaint. They were not put there by me in 2005 but by other users. The couple of pro-censorship editors first tried to take town both articles on grounds of "notability", only to be shot down by the majority-noteability is not temporary. The concern about dates of birth on Wikipedia is identity theft. Where the date of birth of a subject is readily available to anyone in the world with internet access that concern is moot. We had a vote on this in the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn_Hornbeck_acad.html" title="Shawn Hornbeck">Shawn Hornbeck</a> discussion and these handfull of censors were voted down by the consensus. I will abide by whatever decision Wikipedia makes though it seems absurd to me to censor birthdates readily available on google. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommypowell_dce8.html" title="User:Tommypowell">Tommypowell</a> 20:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the course of a run-of-the-mill content debate at <a href="../../../j/o/n/Talk%7EJonathan_Corrigan_Wells_6166.html" title="Talk:Jonathan Corrigan Wells">Talk:Jonathan Corrigan Wells</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">User:Schlafly</a> started making personal attacks, and with 24 hours has expanded the incivility offsite to his blog. Specifically, a reminder to him about WP:NPA and the need to follow policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASchlafly&amp;diff=105598781&amp;oldid=105454339" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASchlafly&amp;diff=105598781&amp;oldid=105454339" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> resulted in: <a href="http://spinstop.com/buzz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://spinstop.com/buzz/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>This sort of behavior by Schlafly has gone on many months now; he's resorted to personal attacks directed at the editors of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>-related articles, and me in particular, on his blog a number of times previously: <a href="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-07.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-07.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-08.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-08.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-10.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://spinstop.com/buzz/2006-10.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> In the past this was easy enough to ignore since he clearly ignoring policy and coming off crankish, and tended to attack and then disappear for a several weeks. But the number, tone, and frequency of attacks by him at Wikipedia is increasing.</p>
<p>I'm done trying to show him the benefit of following policy, and I'm certain that normal DR channels like RFC would be a waste of time with him, but someone else may yet think they can salvage this situation by having a word with him about civility and resolving conflicts, not expanding them or fanning the flames. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 21:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Typing this I just noticed his last edit was May 2006, so probably already banned, but the page (pages?) he created still exists. I think an admin, possibly with knowledge in the indian community, needs to look at this user and created pages and possibly clean up anything left. May be the wrong place to put this but hopefully it gets moved to the right direction.</p>

<p>A few days ago I brought here the case of <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenio76_582a.html" title="User:Benio76">Benio76</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenio76_bcd9.html" title="User talk:Benio76">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Benio76_ca6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Benio76">contribs</a>), who had been blocked as a sock-puppet of <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierd_19c8.html" title="User:Olivierd">Olivierd</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/i/User_talk%7EOlivierd_f1fe.html" title="User talk:Olivierd">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Olivierd_d651.html" title="Special:Contributions/Olivierd">contribs</a>), but who had provided evidence that she wasn't his sock-puppet; after the comments here, and consultation with the original blocking admin, I unblocked Benio76. Since then, the other account accused of being Olivierd's sock-puppet, <a href="../../../z/e/l/User%7EZelig33_a84a.html" title="User:Zelig33">Zelig33</a> (<a href="../../../z/e/l/User_talk%7EZelig33_3be1.html" title="User talk:Zelig33">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zelig33_2f44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zelig33">contribs</a>), has been unblocked by <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">MacGyverMagic</a> as not sharing IP addresses with the other two. Olivierd remains blocked for using sock-puppets; now that his supposed sock-puppets have been cleared of the charge, he's asking (reasonably) to be unblocked too. I'm about to unblock him, but I thought that I'd explain what I'm doing here in case anyone thinks that I'm wrong.</p>
<p>I should add that, while I don't have any worries about Benio76's future behaviour (and I don't know anything about Zelig33), Olivierd's User page does suggest that an eye needs to be kept on him — but it's nothing for which he could be blocked, much less indefinitely. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how I missed it, but when I was leaving an explanation of the unblock at Olivierd's page, I found an earlier refusal to unblock by User:WinHunter, with the reason: "Checkuser block is final". This was before Olivierd had mentioned the unblocking of his supposed sock-puppets; I take it that Checkuser blocks aren't literally final, and that my unblock was warranted. I'm sorry to have trodden, however lightly, on WinHunter's toes, though. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:12, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what an "official" reply would be, but I'd be honest. I'd just say that you don't know, but to ignore the warning if they really didn't do it, but state a block will be an inevitability if it proceeds to vandalise. You can just tell them to create an account and remember not to let others use it if they would like to edit, and that would solve all problems. We're not exactly responsible for others' using other IP addresses, and there's no other option is there? Perhaps we can check if it's a shared account, like a school? --Dayn 14:22, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is a block of an alleged sock account directed against the account or against the alleged sockpuppeteer?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrater_Xyzzy_9687.html" title="User talk:Frater Xyzzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frater_Xyzzy_83ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frater Xyzzy">contribs</a>) was misidentified as my sock. His account was blocked but he continued to edit without logging in (i.e. as an IP).

<p>I don't believe this is fair, since it is my understanding that the initial block was never directed against him as an individual, but rather directed at me to prevent me from using the account as an alleged sockpuppeteer. As a distinct individual from me, he was never blocked for any reason. This is why I ask, in such a case, was the original block directed at him as an individual, and if it was not, is it fair to re-block him for "evading" a block which was never directed at him as an individual and which thus was never intended to apply to him? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 17:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have experienced an issue lately with the wikipedian <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> who deleted an article with no notice (simply cleared it out and redirected the page). I reverted the page back to the old version so that potential reviewers of the conflict would be seeing more than just a redirect arrow, and was summarily smacked with the "red Hand" on my <a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThomasmallen_c63a.html" title="User talk:Thomasmallen">user talk page</a>, accusing me of vandalizing per the 3RR rule...</p>
<p>After looking around <a href="../../../m/a/d/User_talk%7EMadchester_1a84.html" title="User talk:Madchester">Madchester's talk page</a>, I realize that this problem has arisen many times before (cases in which Madchester deleted information, etc.) Granted, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddy_Curry_Line_3dbf.html" title="Eddy Curry Line">the article that was deleted</a> was fairly trivial, but it's the conduct and not the deletion that bothers me.</p>

Madchester was correct to redirect it, and he explained on Thomasmallen's talk page why this was the right course of action. Thomasmallen, you received the "red Hand" because you reverted the page three times and were in danger of a 3RR violation. This warning is a common courtesy to try to help you avoid a block.

<dd>So let me get this straight: I can't revert it (but he can). I can't revert it and make changes to improve it, as I had done (categories, etc) without being threatened with a block.

<dd>Nobody said that (at least not that I can see) and looking at it the warning was a bit premature as I only saw 2 reverts... that said, neither of you would be allowed to revert more than 3 times in an edit conflict, so this is not a case of "he can, you can't". That said, the aritcle before it was redirected appeared to go against our policies against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, it was <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>, and cited no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. It also was not clear why this is in any way an important concept deserving of a standalone article, so my opinion is that the redirect should stand at this time. That said, there is a talkpage for the article that you could discuss your concerns on as well as present any evidence why you feel this shouldn't redirect to <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddy_Curry_4d42.html" title="Eddy Curry">Eddy Curry</a>. Beyond that you could request a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_Comment_14d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for Comment">Wikipedia:Request for Comment</a> so other editors could get involved and weigh in on this.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is no policy of "give new articles a chance". An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and have a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notable</a> subject from the beginning. If you can't do that, create an article in a sandbox first. When you are getting in a revert war, the <i>wrong</i> thing to do is revert one more time. That accomplishes nothing. Since the burden of proof is on the person who wishes to make an addition, you should have gone to his talk page and tried to convince him why this should be a separate article. —<a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies">Dgies</a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sup> 21:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Despite repeated warnings in the past and filing of a complaint before</b>, the attackes have been escalated by <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> to personal insults, even threatening using one of our real life affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting our views (myself, like some other targets of <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a>, post under our real full names, unlike my courageous attacker), and threats or actions which expose such Wikipedia editors as myself to political, religious or other persecution by government, my employer or any others -- all of which contradicts Wiki policy of civility <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> and no personal attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. At the same time <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> is a self-professed liar -- "Do you want to know why I ended up here; I have lied" (in bold, 03:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan" rel="nofollow">[49]</a></p>
<p>Here are the latest examples of Fadix's insults, such as of racial and ethnic character, by clearly trying to show self-professed superiority of one nation over another:</p>
<p>"all indicators such as average national IQ (Armenia having the highest in the immediate region), regardless of the fact that intellectuals are leaving the country clearly show that on average, Armenian scholars are much more credible. When the comparison is made between a Diaspora average scholar with an Azeri scholar, then, sorry to say Adil, you are off the mark. And your arguments just support my point, your childishtic “the rich rich Diaspora.”" Fad (ix) 19:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stepanakert#Vararakn" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stepanakert#Vararakn" rel="nofollow">[50]</a></p>
<p>Then a barrage of personal attacks and insults:</p>
<p>"your stupid intimidations"</p>
<p>"Your psychosis"</p>
<p>"your delusions"</p>
<p>Then a happy comment that his attacks and insults have not gone unnoticed and are irritating:</p>
<p>"I guess I got a sensible nerve there."</p>
<p>(all of the above from Fad (ix) 01:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></p>
<p>Also, here's the "legacy" of user Fadix: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Fadix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Fadix" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>I request that this be put to an end, as user Fadix is having a detrimental effect on the Wiki community and the health of the discussions. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 02:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pardon me but may I ask if the policies are just to threaten the Muslims's pages? When some Christians or some Islam-hatered people have their user pages full of stuff then everybody forgets what is policy. There are many many user pages fully based on Christianity, Zionism and Islam-hatered, but nobody will object, why? because wikipedian personally dont dislike that. When I write something only and only about my religion and my point of view of suppression, then come people with full equipments and policies.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A page on wikipedia can not be banned just because the truth is bitter, or some people dont agree this to be true. For instace, there are hundreds of atheist wikipedians on the site, but then can simply blank the pages advocating the existence of God, infact they have to tolerate them even then dont agree with that and think that to be stupidity to believe in God, right? But in contrast, Why would american wikipedians like the content on wikipedia about Islam which they personally dislike or think that to be bitter? All the international peace organizations like Amnesty International and even UN opposed the War on Iraq and the killing of Afghanis, but just because most of wikipedians and internet users come from American Background in domination so why would they accept this to be a fact? Any opinion or observation which clashes with the American Patriotism that is slashed with the thing called "Wikipedia Policies".? And even that would be so, I did not name any other party in my poem except my own, i.e. Muslims. Being killed by who? I did not mention that is to be judged by the reader 'neutrally'. right?</p>
<p>I would ask in the context of my poem, to Wikipedians who keep on refering me about Policy thingy,</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you hear first that Osama bin laden is terrorist?</li>
<li>Where did you hear first that there is an org called Alqaedah?</li>
<li>Where did you hear first the yelling about terrorism terrorism.....&#160;?</li>
<li>Where did you come to know about Islamic fundamentalism?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is called American Media and government. And most of you just follow that but dont admit it, why? because it will violate your patriotism and Policies, right? I dont buy this.</p>
<p>The articles on wikipedia work like this:</p>
<p>This world is a jungle, and whatever the King of Jungle says, other animals start speaking about that just because of the fear and influence of the King. And there is an organization in the jungle, called Wikipedia which takes the chirping and peeping of the majority of animals to be a fact. That King of Jungle is currently America.</p>
<p>I dont accept somethings just because everyone is telling about that, I look for the originator or that disinformation. Simple is that.</p>
<p>And now go immediately blank my user page or even ban it. I give a damn to biased Policy threats, and only care about fair use of the weapon called 'Policy'. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualEye_6b62.html" title="User:VirtualEye">VirtualEye</a> 04:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no interest in wheel warring, and will not specifically object to an unblock.

<dd>I oppose an unblock. Users who suddenly cry "I'll stop vandalizing" when they're indef-blocked don't impress me. And the use of a sock account to evade a block is particularly troublesome. The user needs a timeout, at the least. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to wheel-war either, but I am not swayed by Friday's argument. Users who wait until they're indef-blocked before they have a deathbed conversion are all too common and I don't find them even a little bit credible. I won't beat <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbaro.html" title="Barbaro">the dead horse</a> any longer, but that's my opinion. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 21:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In that case (since there is no risk of wheel warrning), I am unblocking. This, since I did not find the objections persuasive (these being mostly limited to generalizations which come across as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" title="WP:NOT">excessively bureaucratic</a>.

<dd>While he absolutely should not have re-added it once it became obvious that you were not amused (as Doug has noted in his comment to him), in my opinion it was pretty clearly an attempt at a satirical joke; perhaps some thicker skin/assumption of good faith would alleviate similar problems in the future?

<dd>Other users or new users, absolutely agree with you and if you had posted it, I may not have even reverted it. But his talk page and NBGPWS block log as well as his extensive history of personal attacks, disruption and baiting leaves a very short leash. Two requests to cease followed by 2 repostings are certainly enough for anyone, let alone someone with his history. JzG has left two warnings in the last week for his baiting of a different user. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 07:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Grahame King deleted two weeks of discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105399446" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105399446" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> at February 3th. <b>This is the incident</b> reported here.</p>
<p><b>And now, some background:</b></p>
<p>Grahame King made another deletion at January 29th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104118637" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104118637" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> too, and he was warned by an administrator (User:Proto) about that kind of behaviour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=104816109&amp;oldid=104282082" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=104816109&amp;oldid=104282082" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>.</p>
<p>The deleted text is about a RfC (accepted by GrahameKing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103687072" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103687072" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>) we should have in the immediate future. Once I presented the preliminary paperwork for the RfC in January , GrahameKing made his first deletion of a discussion.</p>
<p>I still presume good faith, so I suggest a talk with this User.</p>
<p>The guy seems to be worried about the discussion being present at Google, because he says that the content is "defamatory" (it is not, because it is sourced).</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>As I'm unsure who I should address this too, I'll just state the problem. While I was searching for an article on Lunar Eclipses for my niece, I came across some foul language on the Reference page of this article. It seems someone has went in and did some editing of their own. I wasn't sure if you were aware of it or not, I figured I should at least report it. Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

<dd>Jat78 you are telling untruths. Why did you remove my dispute tags without discussion on the page?. That is againt Wiki policy. You are also abusing your position as Vandal patrol.

<dd>Why are you shouting. Stay cool.I am not concerned with reputations but only the facts. I want to ensure articles are unbiased and contain Neutral Points Of View. Your article on Jat clearly contains points of views, but I am not concerned with those. I am only concerned with those concerning Nabha, Jind and Patiala. These are not Jat Kingdoms and have never been so. They are Sikh Kingdoms, and I have provided several verifiable sources to back that up on the Patiala page. Nabha, Jind and Patiala wre one of the 12 Sikh Misls (Phulkian), an undisputed fact. To claim they were part of some pseudo Jat Confedracy exists only in your mind friend. You still have not answered why you removed the dispute tag without discussion, as that is againt wiki principles?

<dd>Hi, I am willing to have a reasonable discussion, and I even put dispute tags on the Jat article, however <a href="../../../j/a/t/User%7EJat78_4ff5.html" title="User:Jat78">Jat78</a> removed them without discussion. I think we need some sort of third party arbitration over the issue of Patiala, Nabha and Jind at the <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jat.html" title="Jat">Jat</a> article. These should not be listed as Jat Kingdoms, but as Sikh Kingdoms. There is some propaganda of a murky sort going on here that wiki editors are unaware of, but I am knowlegable in this field (or so I am told&#160;:p).

<li>Funny, I see Radiant as being engaged in an effort to simply force his view of the project on everything, regardless of whether consensus exists or not. Whether I agree with your (or his) intents here is irrelevant - those seeking the change have not made even the slightest bit of effort to gain consensus, and that's a major problem. Unless consensus is being abandoned along with everything else here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's interesting, as I would describe Radiant's efforts as moving in exactly the opposite direction, increasing the redunancy and complexity of the rule base, coupled with an obsessively bureaucratic attitude that strikes me as surprising and disappointing. Further, the comments here alone demonstrate an unhelpful personalization of this conflict on the part of both parties. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 06:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And there we have the problem: I am quite willing to discuss this, but Jeff is more interested in making derogatory remarks than in actual discussion, as should be obvious from his comments here.

<li>You've said that you want to distance yourself from your past at Encyclopedia Dramatica, but ironically your edit patterns with respect to this issue are quite similar to those associated with ED. For instance, making allegations about the issue but not substantiating them, denying facts because "you don't see them that way", persistenyl attacking the people who disagree with you, and forum shopping are all indicative of wikidrama.

<p>Part of the problem is that editing and getting change to happen on policy and guideline pages is so slow. That is as it should be, but something does need to be done about the complexity of the existing set of pages. If anything, I would suggest that Radiant (and maybe jeff if he wants to) draws up an overall plan, and identifies key pages that need working on, and more discussion. Maybe we could even set up a way to have a permanent&#160;!vote disucssion page for policies and guidelines, so it is clearer at a glance how consensus is changing from one month to the next. People who read the page and talk page and agree to it, can 'sign up' to it, and those that have concerns can address them. If people later feel the page has changed, they can come back and recast their&#160;!vote. Kind of like an indefinite, open-ended RfC on the consensus status of the page, with subsections for specific changes. The talk page would be used for discussing changes to wording, and things like that. Keeping the&#160;!vote disucssions open indefinitely would avoid a small group coming along and changing things, but would make clear if consensus really is changing. Would anything like this work, or would it go too much against the spirit of 'voting is evil'? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That might not hurt, but you've reached the crux of the argument - consensus. I'm not opposed at all to the slow burn of the way policies/guidelines evolve, because it assures us that consensus is being reached. It's why I originally reverted the change, and continue to implore Radiant to actually discuss this on the talk page, which he's failed to do. If there's no consensus for such a change, we shouldn't be making it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We have RFC/Policy and we have the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">WP:VPP</a>. The main problem appears to be that Jeff is working under a different definition of "consensus" than most of us; his definition appears to boil down to "if he disagrees with something, there can not be a consensus". Similarly, he has the habit of citing "consensus can change" if he wants to ignore precedent, and claiming "we need consensus for changes to the long-standing version" if he likes the precedent.</li>
<li>The WP:BIO/WP:MUSIC issue boils down to Jeff making a sweeping change to a page stable for over a month, and demanding consensus from the people who disagree with his change, because he claims there was no consensus for the stable version. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The WP:BIO/WP:MUSIC issue boils down to w.marsh making a sweeping change to a page stable for years, and not discussing it on the talk page. It's worth noting that, even though w.marsh disagreed with my reversion, he didn't revert back. Many have agreed that we need consensus for such a massive change, only one person is ignoring consensus in order to implement a preferred version. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Jpgordon's check on 4 Feb may not have gone far enough back. UninvitedCompany ran a check in January (posted at RFAR/Starwood <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_Workshop_34b8.html#Motion_for_CheckUser_made_by_User:BostonMA" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop">here</a>. JeffersonAnderson has admitted that he and Frater worked at the same employer, which uses a proxy/firewall for internet connections, and that he joined Wikipedia to help Frater in a dispute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Starwood/Workshop&amp;diff=101665264&amp;oldid=101664785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Starwood/Workshop&amp;diff=101665264&amp;oldid=101664785" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>. They both edited several of the same AfD's, so it is possible this is at least a case of meatpuppetry. Frater now claims to have moved to Seattle. There is more evidence, and I am 49% convinced that Frater and Anderson are related to further sockpuppetry by Hanuman Das and Ekajati as described at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_Workshop_34b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_Evidence_c6f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Evidence</a>.

<li>I really need to make a template explaining to people what a negative Checkuser results shows. When it says "No IP evidence" it means exactly that: there the editors in question have not used the same or closely related IP within the period under examination. It means, "no, checkuser does not prove sockpuppetry". It does not in any way disprove sockpuppetry. Checkuser is a useful tool for <i>proving</i> sockpuppetry. Not the opposite. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 04:53, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Technical means are a supplement to the decision process, they're not conclusive. What you've got is an IP address, you have no indication of what is behind that address. I happen to know that the address that I'm on at the moment has some 300,000 possible people behind it, the argument that Jefferson and Frater have used in the past. Equally the IP gateway that I'm behind is located some 200 miles away from my present location and provides service to the entire UK. My home IP address is located about 10 miles from my current geographic location and I could edit from it within about 20 minutes of leaving work.</dd>
<dd>Equally it is possible to work through two geographically discrete IP addresses from the same physical location. In the space of about 10 metres I have choices of the address visible through this edit and several other systems, one of which would give me an address on a different continent and 8 times zones away.</dd>
<dd>It depends on how the Secure Managed Interfaces are configured as to how much information you can get from them about what's behind.</dd>
<dd>The point is, a technical check supports other evidence, which is why the SSP case emphasises behaviour and style.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, as soon he was unblocked, various IP's started spamming the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibitions_in_Sikhism_9325.html" title="Prohibitions in Sikhism">Prohibitions in Sikhism</a> article resulting in the article getting locked. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be reasonable with this rather emotional fellow. See conversation on above page and also my page.

<p>Hi, I am having real problems with a Vandal or a group of Vandals who keep deleting, reverting and changing things on the article. The things they keep deleting are refrences and verifiable facts. Please can someone help. I do not know how to follow the three revert rule, as I am not that proficient with wikipedia. Please help.--<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">Sikh-history</a> 14:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you need to go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>. Don't bother reverting the page until you get it semi-protected. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 14:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I fully protected the page from editing for 48 hours to allow some discussion to occur here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see it has been fully protected. In anticipation of your next question, you will not be able to edit it until it has been unprotected, even though I know you feel the wrong version has been protected. What you are supposed to do now is try to engage the other parties in a discussion on the article talk page and reach an agreement on the contents of the page. However, my guess is the anon ip's will not discuss. If that proves to be the case, you can ask for the page to be semi-protected and at least the anon ip's will not be able to edit war with you. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 14:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's always <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" rel="nofollow">the wrong version</a>... Just an FYI, semi-protection is only to stop ongoing pure vandalism to an article from many IPs. It should <b>never</b> be used in an edit war between a registered editor and IPs because doing is basically just penalizing one side of an edit war. The idea of protection is to make both sides step back and discuss changes before making changes. On another note, I've started a discussion on this at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EProhibitions_in_Sikhism_33f0.html" title="Talk:Prohibitions in Sikhism">Talk:Prohibitions in Sikhism</a> if anyone cares to participate.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
