<dd>Though not an admin, I think I can answer this one. The comment could be construed as a personal attack. It doesn't read like a reasoned argument. My advice is try to keep things <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>, you're more likely to be listened to.

<dd>Mallanox, he's actually asking about the removal of the comment, not the actual comment. He should not have removed the content since it was at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, not his user page (where he would have been able to freely remove material). <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 01:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unless I'm missing something here, absolutely unjustified.

<p>I removed the entry that seemed to me mere trolling by Ideogram. The user has occasionally posted trolling messages to different Wikipedia projectspace pages in the past and was reprimanded for that. I apologize if I should not have done it but his entries added nothing to the discussion but were aimed at inflaming matters. I removed them only one time and once he persisted with restoring his inflammatory comments, I desisted and did not remove them again. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have removed off-topic comments milder than this from article talk pages, so I know what you mean.

<dd>OK, you say I am biased.

<p>If admins uninvolved in the current argument decide one or more of you are trolling, then they may do something about it.

<dd>That's what I've been trying to say all along. Irpen et. al. take it upon themselves to label me a "troll" and remove my comments, thereby assuming that they speak for the community as a whole.

I am adding more information here to help long term scrutiny and to help you with your assessments of the ongoing status compared to the past. I am also presenting this in order for other editors on the NLP article to have their say.</p>
<p>Investigating the archives has shown some more evidence of meatpuppetry and involved editors with possible COIs - who may still be editing on the article.</p>
<p>The anonymous editor (58.178.141.147 - also using various other numbers) seems to me to have been the most argumentative in editing and uncivil in editsummaries – calling for blocks on the article and in edit summaries – and restoring argumentative phrasing and debate into the article. There seems to be 2 possibilities. It could be that 58.178.141.147 is the previous NLP editor User FT2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FT2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FT2" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The approach is the same according to a brief search: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FFT2&amp;diff=59597349&amp;oldid=59594394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FFT2&amp;diff=59597349&amp;oldid=59594394" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The user is editing by presenting lists of non-conclusive articles, obscuring science views, and adding or restoring very argumentative phrasing into the article. It seems certain to me that the editor 58.178.141.147 is as non-neutral as FT2 in relation to the NLP article. ...remove (false) personal attack... The information I posted previously on ANI shows they are registered in the same town and are part of the same NLP provider registry. I'll inform you of any other possible past-present editors who seem to have COI or ongoing meatpuppetry issues.</p>
<p>Considering the nature of NLP it would seem to be fairly impossible to stop all meatpuppetry from NLP licensed providers. Instead it would seem to me to be more constructive to provide a situation where editors of all views can simply get along constructively and to verbally discourage meatpuppetry/sockpuppetry and COI problems. Mediation using a neutral mediator would also be an option that I am very much open to. I may suggest this to the other editors soon.</p>
<p>There is some evidence of agreement on the talkpage and userpages - that there is an ongoing determination to get the article into a balanced NPOV shape and deal with problems long term eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<p>Hello user 58.178.111.5. I am not trolling or meatpuppeting and am discouraging both of those activities by working to calm any conflict and provide admin with information about the status of the article. I've been reporting both problems and positive points and admin will be able to go to the article to make their own assessments and encourage the article and proceedings towards a better state.</p>
<p>With respect to your message of consensus - Comaze seems to have just given me the benefit of the doubt on my talkpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=103497777&amp;oldid=103365551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=103497777&amp;oldid=103365551" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Considering the obvious COI issues and the need to get along - I believe that to be a constructive attitude and I encourage it as editors of obviously different views we need to get along. There is much NPOV based summarizing to do. I have received encouragement from admin over the last few notifications and had recent encouragement from Woohookitty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> to keep working calmly and civilly towards a properly summarized article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 00:37, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

While all matters outside Wikipedia are beyond our purview, there is a possibility of this behavior represents some a cabalist-style desire to "infiltrate" Wikipedia (especially in order to propagate their point of view) and potentially to stalk and harass users.

<dd>It would be helpful to know the (explicit) Wikipedia rules are these editors violating as a result of their posts on PakHub. The comments of Nadirali and Unre4L on the website don't sound like they intend to stalk and harass. (I didn't see Szhaider there, BTW.) Unre4L and Nadirali were arguing with other members, who seemed more extreme.

<dd>I fear that the collective beliefs of these members of PakHub is entirely shaping the work of those who are editing Wikipedia - by which I mean the various edit wars, disruption and insulting commentaries that have resulted in Nadirali, Unre4L, Szhaider and Siddiqui being blocked from editing. I'm specifically concerned with Nadirali's comments, insults and insinuations. I'll be happy to take your advice (Fred) - I just wanted to make sure through this report that the activities of these guys are known to admins and other users as well as kept a close eye on. I was a little alarmed about the fact that these guys are so intensely discussing Wikipedia business there, insulting me and others and importing the agenda of PakHub into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 02:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't give a hoot about who is doing what - these gentlemen can play the fool all they want on web forums across the world. My concern is solely limited to how these happenings off-Wiki are creating problems for the stable growth of Wikipedia and its reputation. I don't personally care for them "expressing frustration" anywhere but here, using off-Wiki opportunities to attack Wikipedians like me. If they want to criticize Wikipedia, there are far more respectable ways to do so. I don't like these forum debates by people who seem to represent all that is opposite of an ideal Wikipedian. I'm sorry, I won't defend anybody who tries to do this, but Baka is right to the extent that we don't know who many of these guys are, except for Nadirali and Unre4L. I'm very concerned about the latter two and at the uncertain prospect of sleeper accounts. All this is a bloody waste of time and energy (I wonder how much Britannica has to worry about these blogs and forums) but we have to do something about it. Its foolish for these gentlemen to think that Wikipedians will sit on their hands about this. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 03:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recommend everyone re-reads the statements of principle in the RfArb on MONGO that just finished<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Principles" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Principles" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>; I think it is indicative that "Participation in a website which spoofs or criticizes Wikipedia is not an actionable offense in itself." Note that we are encourage to keep a close eye on these individials:"Users, especially administrators, who are associated, or suspected of association, with sites which are hypercritical of Wikipedia can expect their Wikipedia activities as well as their activities on the hypercritical website, to be closely monitored." (Though I am not sure that the things I have seen qualify as 'hypercritical'.)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, that specific quote of the ArbCom ruling does not settle the case. As I've repeatedly said above, the problem is not their criticism of Wikipedia at another, unconnected site, but the nature of their personal attacks against Wikipedia users (by way of 1 specific ref, racial/religious slurs, defamation of Wikipedia users and administrators and the importing of PakHub objectives into their editing on WP. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 15:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While that is certainly troubling, I do not think that I can agree with you, Nirav, that there is some definite way forward. The discussion in the past about occasions such as this has left us with no clear precedent. Taking your concerns one by one: a. the specific slurs - I presume <i>kaffirs</i> is what you mean - can hardly be acted upon as long as they are not used in the course of editing on WP itself. b. The specific statements about admins as being biased is again, something that can hardly be acted upon; suppose, for example, this was an IRC discussion, and you happened to be in the same channel. Would we be compelled to take action then? If so, then a lot of IRC discussion would have to be cleaned up. c. The importing of these objectives: well, it wont be the first time that a group of nationalist users collude in acting on articles of interest. This time at least the encyclopaedia is warned.</dd>
<dd>Which brings me to my general point: we are more than justified in watching these guys very carefully now. We can drop the assumption of editing in good faith pretty soon if they have indicated their agenda fairly clearly. That is the action we can take: to ensure that their on-wiki behaviour is even more effectively and speedily policed given we now know their motives and organisations. I think that's the spirit of the ArbCom decisions, and anything further would be WP overreaching. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 16:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am in agreement with you on the second para of your comments. On the first para, I didn't necessarily mean the "kaffir" remark, because I know its too general. While such general comments do give us an indication of the nature of these gentlemen, I only mean the stuff that's directly pertinent to Wikipedia and Wikipedians - take two quotes specifically (apart from the one naming me and one suggesting the existence of a troll sleeper account)</dd>

<dd>Unre4L is repeating what he has been hollering on his user page and various article talkpages, about Indians "ripping off" Pakistan's history. This is not only his view but the goal of PakHub. And the off-hand, derogatory reference to Jews not having <i>"any say" in Islam articles, unless constructive</i>. I cannot imagine a more ridiculous statement to make - who is he or anybody else to judge the "constructiveness" of Jewish editors, and at the same time accuse Indian editors of pinning Pakistani editors down and rip Pakistan's history off. I can draw a lot of conclusions about this guy's editing purpose.</dd>

<dd>Now I read this, I know immediately that these gentlemen are not fitting the quite lax criteria of being productive Wikipedians. Nadirali's hallucinations only signal future disruptive editing. No doubt, we musn't take drastic action and the policy is not clear-cut, but its clear that the way these gentlemen think, write and edit are harbringers of future trouble. Thus, the community must in some way, send a very strong message to them about this. They can do what they please at PakHub, IRC or any other place on the internet - but this point should be made crystal-clear to them. In order to disregard these warning signs, we must know for sure that they will not import this behavior onto Wikpedia. Unfortunately, both Nadirali and Unre4L have carried their PakHub agenda onto Wikipedia. Finally, one someone's expression of frustration or desire to blow-off steam is to be respected, it must at least not include conspiracy theories and vituperation against Wikipedia editors and the way WP works. I'm just glad we could have a productive discussion on this, as it will at least let these folks know that we know and are taking this issue seriously. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 17:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The last sentence is ungrammatical, to be sure, but what it means is that Jewish editors usually don't edit Islam-related articles (in Unre4L's opinion), and if they do, they usually have constructive things to say.

<dd>Further to this, it should be noted that the pipetext in the articles in question typically consists of the <i>last</i> three letters of the call sign; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Radio_Stations_b292.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations">Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations</a> has done this in categories where all articles begin with the same letter (i.e. W or K in a radio category), in order to make the category page appear more cleanly sorted.

<p>A short while ago Justin Forbes (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustin_Forbes_c41e.html" title="User talk:Justin Forbes">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justin_Forbes_289b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justin Forbes">contribs</a>) edited the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Template%7EHome_video_593e.html" title="Template:Home video">Template:Home video</a> page to change <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD-Video_7963.html" title="DVD-Video">DVD-Video</a> to <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>, and added the {{homevid}} tempate to the DVD article. Both of these edits were done with no edit summary. I reverted these (given that the homevid template is for video formats, not video media, e.g. VCD but not Compact Disc) and out of curiosity looked at the user's contributions. What I've seen there can only be described as a strange pattern of borderline vandalism that might be fact-checking. Or vandalism. It's very, very subtle. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sirius&amp;diff=103400416&amp;oldid=103393710" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sirius&amp;diff=103400416&amp;oldid=103393710" rel="nofollow">Case in point</a>.</p>
<p>Now were this normal vandalism I'd report this to AIV in a heartbeat, but much of this is borderline. (Some of it legitimate too, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103395818" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103395818" rel="nofollow">their edit</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">Cat</a>) I don't know if you can really call this guy a "blatant" vandal, but there's definitely something very, very hinky going on here. Distinctly not in line with what Wikipedia is all about, and probably bannable. I just don't know if it's an AIV thing or not. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 04:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

He exhibits the same short fuse, use of caps when he's angry. Also, he is editing the same subject areas that Vesa/Projects did.

<dd>I checked more of the pages altered and it looks as though most of them are OK.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I think I see what's happening. The bot leaves the first instance of a "year|year in music" it finds on a page, and then changes the later ones it thinks are duplicates. The problem arises when the article has mentions of later recordings of a song from different years. Removing the duplicate links is OK, but the bot needs to learn to differentiate between years. <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhyaduck_99ff.html" title="User:Whyaduck">Whyaduck</a> 01:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More precisely- the bot is in fact recognizing different years, but the "year|year in music" links are being converted to simple "year" links when the "year|year in music" is immediately preceded by a "month, date" link. I haven't seen any cases of simple "month" links, so I don't know if they cause an alteration or not. <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhyaduck_99ff.html" title="User:Whyaduck">Whyaduck</a> 02:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea why the piped links are breaking the readers preferences, though. Is it only when the piped link and a linked month/day are adjacent? That's the only difference I can see between those pages where the bot removed unique "year in music" links and those where it left some of them alone. But I might be overlooking something, as I don't have any clear idea how all this stuff works. I'm just trying to figure out how to set up unique links to "year in music" pages so they won't be removed for misbehaving in the future. <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhyaduck_99ff.html" title="User:Whyaduck">Whyaduck</a> 13:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the bot removes piped links to "years in music" only from full dates. Try to change date format in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">your preferences</a> and note the difference between <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_music.html" title="2005 in music">2005</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogers_106b.html" title="User:Jogers">Jogers</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/g/User_talk%7EJogers_9401.html" title="User talk:Jogers">talk</a>) 14:03, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So basically, lone links just to a year in music are preserved, but when you have a day and a month given, it is converted into a normal year wikilink so that it does not break user preferences. 'Years in music' links will be left alone if there is no attached day and month. I see now that this is explained in <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia%7EPiped_link_ad60.html#Use" title="Wikipedia:Piped link">Wikipedia:Piped_link#Use</a>, which specifically states that piped links to years in music or years in sports should not be used in conjunction when a day and month are given next to it in order to preserve user preferences. I will be unblocking the bot now unless there are any objections, then. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 15:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A consensus has been reached in a meatpuppet investigation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/BenBurch#.5B.5BUser:BenBurch.5D.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/BenBurch#.5B.5BUser:BenBurch.5D.5D" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The consensus is that the two users in question have formed a meatpuppet relationship that is abusive to other Wikipedia editors. It was successfully used to bait another Wikipedia editor into violating policy to the extent that he was permablocked; and they are still tormenting him on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BryanFromPalatine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BryanFromPalatine" rel="nofollow">Talk page</a> while he appeals the block. They should receive the same punishment: permablocks.</p>
<p>In the alternative, in his previous "NBGPWS" incarnation, FAAFA received a one-month block; this block should be longer. BenBurch's previous block was one day; this block should be longer. And they should be permanently blocked from editing the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a> article due to their ongoing violations of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (particularly <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>), <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.</p>

I think it's obvious that this makes Ideogram the last person who should take it on himself to remove Giano's posts (with edit summaries like "Remove rant"]). I'd rather not speak to him on the issue myself, as I believe he has plenty of hostility for me also. Perhaps somebody entirely neutral would like to suggest to him that these removals are not appropriate? Possibly they're intended to make a point about Irpen's removal of one comment of Ideogram's, as discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=103491708#Removal_of_comments_on_talk_pages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=103491708#Removal_of_comments_on_talk_pages" rel="nofollow">above</a>. I wish Irpen hadn't done that (sigh), but he did it once, as far as I know; and all who have commented above find that Irpen removed a highly uncivil personal attack by Ideogram. By contrast, Ideogram's own removals and attacks are large-scale, ongoing, and getting worse and worse. Now I'm not one to block for personal attacks, but could somebody try to talk him down from his trolling high or something? Please take a look at the thread above; does it look to you like Ideogram is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point? It would be a real relief if it could be stopped. Preferably without any blocking, because I suspect that Ideogram is <i>trying</i> to get blocked, as part of the charming point he's making. Note that it's many hours since Giano edited. This is not some kind of battle or quarrel, it's a pure monologue.

<p>Please, this situation continues to make me sad, as there have been continual misunderstandings and hurt feelings about it. Take a moment and consider that Bishonen is posting here because she wants other opinions on the matter and therefor we can only assume that she has good intentions, after all she has not acted unilaterally as some admins should have. Also, I feel that while some of Ideogram's comments are regrettable, he or she has been misunderstood on more than a few occasions. I would ask both sides to remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and attempt to <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAM_9e2a.html" title="WP:NAM">stay cool</a> in a heated and divisive situation. Please realize that there is a wide spectrum of views on the depth and nature of the situation and therefore a similarly diverse number of opinions how to fix it. Above all else, remember we're all here to work to improve this encyclopedia, and treat others with respect.

<p>To be honest I've come across Giano before and haven't found him/her to be nice at all - that's putting it rather mildly to be frank. I'm not surprised that Ideogram has said what he has, though my advice to him is just to ignore any comments by other users he finds to be blatantly annoying. I just want this opinion of mine to be noted, but don't wish to be contacted further on the issue, so please don't message my talk page about it. I've been told off Wiki that Giano has a few friends here who can make life on Wikipedia very difficult for me if they wish, so I don't want to get involved. That's my personal opinion, and as I said I don't wish for any messages regarding this - any I get will be ignored. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 01:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The edits to <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_Portable_9564.html" title="PlayStation Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> seem fine to me; he seems to be calmly arguing that dwelling on firmware-related minutiae clutters the article. If this is "emblematic" of his behaviour, then he has probably done nothing wrong.

<p>He has done nothing of the sort, and his "complaint" - that it makes the article harder to read - is groundless. He has even refused to allow descriptions of changes made to the firmware over time in the firmware SECTION. He is deliberately trying to make it a less informative article than it could be, for reasons unknown, except that he seems to feel some ownership of the article as it currently sits; he never makes improvements, just sits around reverting. His accusations that I used a sockpuppet are base lies and I demand an apology.<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 21:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) Sorry, but the issue of whether to include certain facts about the firmware is a content dispute and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the administrators. For this matter you should pursue <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> such as mediation or RFC. With respect to the sockpuppet accusations, if it can be shown that <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakuSage_8583.html" title="User:ZakuSage">User:ZakuSage</a> has made them negligently or in bad faith, then this may be a violation of Wikipedia's policies on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>. (On the other hand, if he is correct and you have been using a sockpuppet to evade a block, to engage in edit warring, to attack a user, or to otherwise disrupt Wikipedia, then you will be blocked.)

<p>Please reconsider the extended block. Extending blocks based on people venting on their talk pages after a block is a pernicious form of admin abuse - yes, they're being uncivil, but it's their talk page, they've just been blocked, and expecting them not to vent some is unreasonable. Unless it crosses the line from mild personal attack into serious attack or personal threats of some sort, giving people a little slack calms the situation in the long term. The basic block was appropriate, though.</p>

<li>Having looked at the relevant articles, the core claim (that the Mail, and other newspapers, identified the men as implicated in the murder) is not libellous, as they certainly did so. However, the case never went to trial, it appears, nor did anything at all come of it after the initial burst of coverage, at least that I can detect. This probably deserves only a limited mention in the article, but, again, I think this primarily on general editorial principles rather than with regard to BLP. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 19:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A quick summary of the issue: <i>The Mail</i> published three articles stating that various individuals were allegedly connected to a murder (the Mirror's article which i saw does not). The articles do not show up in the online archives for the paper, it's possible that they were retracted or names removed. There needs to be some discussion as to whether or not these articles are appropriate for use, but where and how? Can we quote from the articles on a talk page, discuss the content of the articles w/o mentioning any names, etc., some advice is needed.—<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">eric</a> 19:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>To David Klein, administrators, or to whomever is the gatekeeper of the Webster University Wikipage:</b></p>
<p>I have been building the Webster University page for the past year or so. I am also an alumnus of the institution, holding a Masters Degree. I have put in countless hours of work/research into building the page. I have built approximately 2/3rds of the Webster University page, and built most of the sections.</p>
<p>However, someone is constantly going behind me and making trivial changes. Changes that effect the content. It appears to be the same one or two individuals each time.... reverting.</p>
<p>Under the 'Notable Graduates' section, the above suspected editor adds his own person opinion under one of the entries (Dr. Debra Peppers). (<b>side note:</b> It's interesting that he believes that his detailed summaries are allowable, while at the same time, he is deleting other summaries on the grounds that there should be no summaries).</p>
<p>I have tried to stick with facts, particularly in the Notable graduates section, as well as throughout the rest of the article. In fact, I have gone out of my way to avoid that kind of opinionated partisan commentary. It's annoying to have someone come behind me to throw in their own personal partisan opinion.</p>
<p>My purpose for the work is to improve the wiki profile of the institution....and to show how good the University is. The partisan stuff was and is the furthest thing from my mind. Why someone would want to bring that kind of spirit to a University page is beyond me. It is especially annoying to have my work edited by someone who is probably not affiliated with the University.....not a graduate, etc...and probably not even from the local area.</p>
<p>The above editor has also made several other unnecessary changes. Some of the entries in the 'Notable graduates' section need some explanation in order to convey why that particular person is notable. So from time to time I have to add a few lines of detail (i'm just a detail oriented person). I have modeled my work on other University wikipages. Many of those pages have the same occasional summaries regarding graduates...and all of those pages look great. And with no overzealous editing. I have spent countless hours researching the people affiliated with the University....first identifying those who are notable graduates and determining if they should be on the list, etc. That all takes time and patience. So it's aggravating to deal with the overzealous editing of the work I have put in. Adding a few links here and there, &amp; changing grammer is one thing, but this person is affecting content and image.</p>
<p>I am not claiming to own the page.... (and I don't want to own it or control it). However, I have put in quite a bit of time in the process of building it up. And I would like to continue.</p>
<p>Can we lock this person out (of the Webster U. wiki) for 6 months while I finish building up this page? I still had some work to do...however, if I have to constantly deal with the overzealous editing...then I will unfortunately have to end my work now....leaving a half finished project.</p>
<p>Or can I obtain temporary control of the page so that I can deal with issues without contacting an admin every time there is a vandal?</p>
<p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<dd>Taking a quick look at activity on the page, I don't see any actual discussion with the editor in question. This would appear to be a content dispute, and the first place that should be taken is to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Talk%7EWebster_University_9135.html" title="Talk:Webster University">article talk page</a> for discussion of the changes and the importance of the information being considered. You could also take it to <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidkevin_dd87.html" title="User talk:Davidkevin">User talk:Davidkevin</a> and engage the editor directly. It doesn't look like anything that needs page protection at this point, from my look - better to discuss it further with the editor at this point. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 07:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I went to look at the page, and noticed that much of it was written in the style of a University publication (fitting with the editor's admission that his purpose is "to show how good the University is", but belying the claim: "The partisan stuff was and is the furthest thing from my mind". Further investigation uncovered the fact that most of the articloe was simply cut-and-pasted from the University's Web pages, which were all lavelled with a copyright notice.

<p>On one hand, RCS has badly over-reacted to the block and used unacceptable language in the process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RCS&amp;diff=102237752&amp;oldid=102193904" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RCS&amp;diff=102237752&amp;oldid=102193904" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>. On the other hand, and in defense of RCS, the block came 48 hours after the fact, by which time discussion on the talk page to resolve the dispute had started.

<p>This is a constant barrage of abuse which I <b>tried</b> to rise above.

<p>I then suspect that it is possible then that he didn’t want to engage in the discussion and clarification route that I was going down and was going down and preferred the edit war so he left this rant. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-12-02_IRA_%27Volunteer%27_usage&amp;diff=103838894&amp;oldid=102323570" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-12-02_IRA_%27Volunteer%27_usage&amp;diff=103838894&amp;oldid=102323570" rel="nofollow">here</a>] Now forgive me if I am wrong but is that not just the opposite of what happened?] Anyway the admin on the page he posted that blocked me for three hours - shouldn’t action be the other way around?</p>

<dd>I would not say it is a racial insult- as the two sides in Northern Ireland where the term is more commonly used are both of the same race. The article you link to does not indicate it is a racial insult either.

<dd>I think indefinite is a little much, to be honest. That ArbCom decision does not sanction indef blocks, and I'm even more cautious since we can't find the pages that the user linked on (or did I read that incorrectly?). I'd say unless we can find the deleted subpages, and unless the material on those subpages are "linking to or importing material which harasses other users", the user should be unblocked. If the subpages can be found, but it's not tantamount to harassing, perhaps a 24hr block and warning would be more appropriate? —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 21:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really see anything that would suggest bad faith by K37. Aren't ED links blacklisted, anyway? I don't see how the user could get around the meta blacklist, so an immediate indefinite block was a tad harsh. I would suggest a simple unblocking for now. Whatever use a warning would have had if the user did somehow manage to avoid the blacklist has already been made clear by the fact that they were blocked.. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 21:41, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note Steve block's quote on 20:31, 26 January 2007: "I suggest people start looking at all the articles Netkinetic mentions and start merging them. I'd suggest Netkinetic has a look at WT:COMIC#Notability, where we discussed cleaning up the articles in such a manner." It was Steve block who encourage "people" (I'm a person) to "look" at these articles and "start merging them". I did not do this...I added an innoculous "merge" tag with an "original research" tag after reviewing the above conversation at WP:COMIC#Notability. I agree with it, and to confirm <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> that I'm not <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> towards a particular article, I tagged the article in question (above) along with others I've created, including <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_%28Al_Pratt%29_1e23.html" title="Atom (Al Pratt)">Atom (Al Pratt)</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molly_Mayne_184d.html" title="Molly Mayne">Molly Mayne</a>. I noted said actions in the discussion without taking ANY action EXCEPT placing these tags in all articles I was aware of that failed to comply with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I am in FULL support of these policy being implemented in accordance with what this policy explicitly states: "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." A handful of editors wish to apply this principal only to articles they do not like, rather than applying it even-handedly. This is the real issue. I'm NOT <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and do not appreciate the accusation when evidence shows that I have in fact tagged articles I myself have created it along with others. When adding tags (without changing the articles), these persistent editors remove said tags without explaining why the article(s) in question are the "exception" to the above policy at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. That said, it is left into your hands. Wikiprojects Comics needs a complete overhaul, although I find both jc37 and Chris do a good job by and large. There needs to be a true adherence towards policies, not only when it is convenient and conducive to selectively apply said policies. My approach at different stages admittedly wasn't the best. However it does illustrate a certain bias allowed by a few.<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetkinetic_8528.html" title="User:Netkinetic">Netkinetic</a> | <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetkinetic_284c.html" title="User talk:Netkinetic">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Netkinetic_b16a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Netkinetic">C</a> / <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Netkinetic_2d16.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Netkinetic">@</a> 23:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That quote was part of a larger section that was discussing gaming the system and disruption. It wasn't meant literally, but rather sardonically. It's not that people want to apply this to articles they don't like, it's that people want to try and work out how to apply it. If you'd just stop, listen and engage with people we could perhaps work to a consensus on when and how to apply it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 00:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Several users pointed out to him that his changes contradict the naming conventions but he persists with his edits and refuses to discuss. I tried to <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShao_607b.html#Revert_warring" title="User talk:Shao">reason with him at his talk</a> and warned him that persistence with revert warring leads to blocks. He ignored each and every of my warnings and went on with revert warring. He just reverted the articles again. This is plain silly as the whole issue is about city names and whether they should comply with <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>.</p>
<p>I do not request him blocked, but someone please relay to him that such disruptions are not tolerated. Please do not wack him with too heavy, though, at least this time.
