<p>Yet another kid using Wikipedia as a free file host. 30 Images, and only images as user's contributions. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malherbp_253c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malherbp">Special:Contributions/Malherbp</a> Is there another way I could take care of this, aside from nominating all the images under CSD (which there really isn't a criteria for) or IFD them all or bring it here or apply for admin and delete them myself (which seems the lengthy of the solutions)? Or is just posting this here probably the best method?

<p>I want to nominate Fly like a Raven for AfD, because it's an unreleased album, with little or no cited information about it. However, it's fully protected due to recent vandalism involving fanmade album art. Could an administrator fill out the AfD for me on the article, thus circumventing the protection, or if not, remove the protection so it can be AfD'd? After 10 days of full protection, I think it's ready to go back to editing, not that it belongs here anyway. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 09:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have two problems and I think the best way to describe them is to just say what I saw:</p>
<ol>
<li>On my watch list I saw the article <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu.html" title="Flu">Flu</a> was changed.</li>
<li>Going to it I saw it was changed from being a redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">Influenza</a> to being a redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza_%28Flu%29_fb0a.html" title="Influenza (Flu)">Influenza (Flu)</a>.</li>
<li>Then I saw <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">Influenza</a> had been moved to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza_%28Flu%29_fb0a.html" title="Influenza (Flu)">Influenza (Flu)</a> and they were both marked as supposed to being on my watchlist but they weren't so problem one is my watchlist is ommiting the two articles <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">Influenza</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza_%28Flu%29_fb0a.html" title="Influenza (Flu)">Influenza (Flu)</a> for some unknown reason.</li>
<li>I looked at the history and <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKunz506_c35f.html" title="User talk:Kunz506">User talk:Kunz506</a> made the moves, and has made other inappropriate moves and is a new account.

<dd>How someone treats that comment by me would be subjective, I just noted that that would be a typical response from a typical troll. I've not made personal attacks against anyone, just noted that Malber's response would be what a "typical troll" would normally respond with.

<dd>I don't see it as a personal attack, but some people do.

<dd>I don't like this block.The 'trolling' on Chacor's talk page is a very unfair description.A misguided NPA template isn't necessarily trolling, particularly as he was arbitrarily labelled a 'troll' in the first place.Troll is a perjorative term and should only be applied to those who clearly exist just to make trouble - this is not the case with Malber, who may be misguided and wrong at times, and can behave badly, but is not a troll. Malber didn't recieve a single warning with regards to his conduct, you just blocked him (when already involved in a dispute with him).Please consider undoing the block. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 16:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>(cross-posted from Malber's talk with minor updating) Although I disagreed very strongly with Malber's position in the discussion at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html#Malber.27s_age_question" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship#Malber's age question</a>, I believe this is a problematic block. In particular, as Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington suggests above, he was involved in an active dispute with Malber at the time and should not have been the blocking administrator. While the weight of opinion in the discussion on the "age question" was against the question continuing to be asked, it can hardly be said that Malber's continuing the dialog was inherently disruptive, and while some of Malber's comments (particularly the suggest that Sir Nicholas should be desysopped) displayed a far from exemplary degree of civility, I saw nothing going so far as to warrant a block. I would support lifting the block, although I would also strongly suggest that the matter be dropped at that point. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nobody has mentioned the fact that Malber has at least once reverted an RfA to reinclude the age question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Asterion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95723024" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Asterion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95723024" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Malber, by his own admission asks a question regardless of whether he will be&#160;!voting on the RfA and has stated <i><b>there is a perception outside of Wikipedia that it is run by adolescents with too much time on their hands</b></i>. I certainly think the age question is a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and despite being asked to stop by other users (ignoring comments on his talk page) he continued to disrupt Wikipedia by asking this question.

<p>Yes! I am a member of AMA. Thank you and I appologize if my comment on Mongo's talk page set off bells. Cplot would like an RfC for his "unjust" block. To pass the RfC he needs a second nomination and would like to be unblocked so he may second the nomination and voice his opinion on this subject. However, because he has avoided a block by using another account (far away from the trouble), I would suggest (if possible) that access be granted but for ONLY his user page and the RfC. (Remaining status quo, or not allowing for an RfC because there may not be enough votes, because cplot could voice his vote, would not really be fair for cplot.) (Furthermore, comments on Cplot et All. could be gathered in one venue and would probably help the situation!) --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 22:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you Tom, we appreciate this concern. But, we still believe an RfC would be justified seeing as we both see that there may have been an unjustified "block" from the begining.

<dd>As a note, the most recent sockpuppet attack on the Village Pump was 03:55, 21 December 2006, almost exactly 5 hours after CyclePat's plea that we unban this valuable user because he will certainly only edit to defend himself via RFC (of course, not an RFC on his own conduct - no no - an RFC on the person he has instigated a harassment campaign against.)

<dd>CyclePat, please review the evidence that you have as well as the evidence on the Cplot sockpuppet page.It is overwhelming.Further, it no longer has anything to do with MONGO as at least 5 admins have stepped up and blocked his sockpuppets and support the ban.They have begun to delete and salt his talk pages.His original block is of no consequence and your continued pursuit of this is a waste of time as there is no remedy.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 14:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My original post that started this thread was not an objection to CyclePat's advocacy in principle, just his choice of forum (MONGO's talkpage) and what appeared to be taunting in the post and in the edit summary.

<dd>Just to a slight correction of <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> here. It is only <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Cplot_1aac.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Cplot">2 checkuser requests confirmed</a> and those don't involve any edits by Cplot because Cplot has been blocked. So the only conclusions we can draw from the two confirmations is that the sockpuppets are connected: but connected to whom? At least one of the sockspuppets in the Cplot list is actually a sockpuppet of Tbeatty according to our checkuser probe, so there seems to be problems on both sides. I don't think we should be so afriad of Cplot that we try to stop an RfC. --USHLS, NSA, CIA,... but mostly BS 23:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

FWIW, I would prefer a community ban over restricted editing. Eternal Equinox at least tried to improve articles. Ottawaman, on the other hand, has shown a singular focus on smearing Michael Ignatieff. Some of his accounts have even been used for vandalism (eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83754145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83754145" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>). I don't believe his contributions this far justify allowing him to edit at all and I don't think that he will honor any restrictions anyway. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 22:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</blockquote>

<p>Canuckster (that's what the e-mail says) has sent me three e-mails first requesting that Sarah not go through with the ISP report because "the report would hurt other innocent people more than me and that I don't think this restriction on filing a report applies to me."

<p>Neutralizer/Ottawaman and I have reached an agreement that he will stop now and honour the community ban. He has also promised that he won't migrate again and restart abusing other Wikimedia projects. In return, I have agreed not to send a report to his ISP or take the matter any further. He understands that if he breaks this agreement, I will send the report to Bell Sympatico without any further warnings. I hope everyone is okay with this agreement as a resolution.<br />
Ottawaman has apologised profusely and as a sign of good faith, he has identified another sockpuppet which we hadn't found. He also wants us to know that he asked Wikinews people he was friendly with to try to help him here on ANI. So, Wikinewsies, if you do come, it's not necessary.<br />
Thankyou everyone for helping with blocking, reverting, tagging, supporting the ban etc. I'm really grateful for all the help everyone gave. I truly hope this is now resolved and that we all (Ottawaman, included) have a peaceful Christmas.&#160;:) <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 16:15, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The wiki process is part of all of Wikipedia, and the notion of taking offense when one's contributions are removed for good cause is foreign to that process. That's a core value you'll never get around, no matter how long and hard you try. There's much room for debate—about how much certain comments really undermine the purpose of the desk, for example—but that's not the approach you're taking. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 03:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both of these diffs should never have happened - THB, you say that the wiki process permits us to remove comments, but I'd suggest that in the case of your two edits here, you're disrupting wikipedia process by doing the fundamental wrong of changing the meaning of anther user's comments to suit your point of view.OK - removing other peoples' comments can be OK in exceptional circumstances, but never changing the meaning of them - it's important that you understand this fundamental idea.How can we get a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a> if people can g around changing eachothers' comments? <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 07:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice consensus. I am requesting that the talk pages and archives be restored and locked. This was an attempt to pre-empt arbitration and it looks like it worked. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das'</a> status on wikipedia is not material. If he/she wants to leave that is his/her choice. However, this user has been involved in a protracted dispute that has involved numerous other editors, and the content of the user's talk page is pertinent to the discussion. After the arbitration - if it is even accepted - I think the page should only then be blanked. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 01:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The user has plenty of edits in other areas, and it would seem that the focus of the dispute lies in the article of the arbitration case anyway so I don't see how his talk page is relevant. <small>Oh, and I'm not an arbcom clerk, in response to Newyorkbrad, but just one of many volunteers who try to help out.</small> <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 02:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I am the editor who removed the "speedy" tags from the user's talk page, so perhaps a comment from me will be useful.First, I don't think that there is a <i>significant</i> amount of evidence that would be unavailable to parties to the arbitration.There are two principle editors on one side of the arbitration.The user who has left Wikipedia, and a user who is associated with numerous links.Although the users collaborated, I think the issues in arbitration are quite different between them.Long and short, I did not remove the "speedy" tags because I feared deletion of evidence.(Of course, I did not file the arbcom case, so I do not pretend to be speaking for anyone else -- others may disagree).</dd>

<dd>Having explained that I was not worried about loss of evidence, I feel a need to explain my motivations.At the time that I removed the "speedy" tags, I was unaware that the user was intending to leave Wikipedia.I was sensitized to seeing the speedy tag on his talk page from a previous interaction.On a previous occassion, the user had a puppetmaster tag on his user page. My understanding is that before a user or talk page is speedied, the deleting admin should check to see if a) the page has been editted by other users, and b) whether there are warnings on the page that ought to be preserved.For better or worse, it appeared to me that the admin who deleted his page on that occasion did not notice that this user had first deleted his warning tag, and then added the speedy tag.I understand that in such situations, users may "lose their cool".Further, the user made a declaration that he would not use sockpuppets.At that point I thought it appropriate to let the matter drop.However, I <i>was</i> sensitized, and worried that we were seeing a repeat.When I learned that the user planned to leave Wikipedia, I had no interest in preventing his pages from being deleted.</dd>

<p>You're probably right. As long as someone can resurrect the talk pages if it becomes an issue later, I don't foresee it being necessary unless it gets really protracted.

<p>I have a proposal that I believe addresses <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:right_to_vanish">m:right to vanish</a> and the need for evidence for the RfArb. I suggest that the talk page and archives be undeleted and then moved to an appropriate sub page(s), eliminating all redirects created in the process. (no suggestion as to where they should be moved to - but if the RfArb case was taken on then a sub page of the case page would be appropriate). When the RfArb is finished or if it is rejected then the pages get moved back to their original position and redeleted. The purpose of the move is to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and honour the right to vanish. The username would no longer be associated with the content of the pages, any more than any other comments he has made on other talk pages would be. The purpose of re-moving the pages to their original position and then re-deleting them would be to have them availiable for revival in the right spot in the event that the retirement was not permanent. All these actions could be performed by any of the sysopped RfArb clerks, or if that idea is rejected, I would be happy to take them on myself as long as someone notifies me of the outcome of the case. I would have his talk page and user page on watch, looking for signs of editing (ie other users questioning edits) and a note in the RfArb case to be notified of the close or rejection of the case.

<dd>I suggest leaving the situation at status quo for now (i.e. deleted).Evidence of Hanuman's bad behavior toward others (if such evidence exists) will be mainly on their talk pages, the mediation pages associated with the case, and the articles themselves.Assuming Hanuman's talk page contains evidence of other editors' bad behavior toward him, it can be restored or examined by the arbitrators if the case is accepted. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hanuman may be only tangentally involved in this case. My concern is that we are accepting all this at face value when in the past there have been users who have used Right to Vanish to game their situation. We also don't want to start expecting Arbitrators to be the gatherers of facts in a case. We need to let involved parties find their evidence to present where ever they can find it, and not tie their hands in building their case. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 13:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, user talk pages are quite frequently deleted.The argument that a user's warnings and history of problems needs to remain visible only applies if they don't stay vanished.(I used to be more hard line on this, but I have come to really dislike the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlet_letter.html" title="Scarlet letter">scarlet letter</a> mentality that some folks have.)In this particular case the talk pages will probably be undeleted if the case is accepted.I'm not convinced they are needed in order to make a case <i>for</i> acceptance. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we have to distinguish between a vandal's talk page full of nothing but warnings and unproductive messages (which we can delete without a second thought), and that of a long time user who has had much discussion about articles and other productive Wikipedia issues over many months (which is the case here).The history of the page has value to the project (and since he used page move archiving, so do his talk page archives). It's about having the history, the top page can be blanked and protected (this is not about the removing warnings issue or anything like that) <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 17:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please pardon my ignorance, but doesn't <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> being a meta-directive, trump en.wikipedia concerns? I've read through the meta page and the meatball page linked from it, and IMO you are treading on very treacherous ground here. The ability to vanish is listed as a "right", not a privilege. In my opinion, it should not be conditional in any way. Perhaps mediawiki foundation needs to clarify the talk page issue on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a>, but with it being ambiguous, and with talk page deletion having been done for other users recently (e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArs_Scriptor_4357.html" title="User:Ars Scriptor">User:Ars Scriptor</a>), it would seem to me that if you are going to undelete H.D.'s talk page, you'd need to undelete every other vanished user's talk page for consistency.</p>
<p>In any case, as someone also involved in the issue, I don't think H.D.'s talk pages are significant in any way to the arbitration request. He was occasionally quite rude - on other people's talk pages. His edit history is still available, and I beleive the contention is that he kept restoring links after other editor's deleted them. I also believe that both sides believed that they were in the right, i.e. it was not a case of intentional vandalism. Anything that was said to him on his talk page about the situation is most likely also brought up on one of the meditation pages. And <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> has been keeping "files" on her user subpages about all of her percieved "enemies", so she should be able to answer precisely what information might be needed from H.D.'s talk page. (Interestingly enough, <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmy12_3046.html" title="User:Timmy12">Timmy12</a> keeps "files" on his "enemies" in the very same way as <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> does). It seems like perhaps some people want to go on a fishing expedition on a user who decided that his involvement in Mattisse's manipulations was a waste of his time. That doesn't seem right to me.</p>
<p>Finally, please do kick this up to the MetaWiki level. I would like to know definitively what exactly <i>I</i> could expect if in the future I should want to avail myself of the Right to vanish. Currently, based on observation, I believe that I could expect to have all my user space pages deleted, including talk pages and archives. If this is not the case, I think Mediawiki Foundation should be clear and explicit about it on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a>. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 18:23, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the concern is harrassment of HD after he leaves, then <b>blank and protect</b> his talk page.Nobody can leave messages, but the history is still available if people need to review discussions or other information (whether to provide diffs for an arbitration, or for other constructive purposes).If HD believes that there is information in the history which compromises his privacy, then by all means he should ask an admin to delete the appropriate revisions of the page. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The page&#160;:<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> describes removal of personal information (real name, address, political views etc.) that are pretty far short of deleting an entire set of user and talk pages on request, that are of interest in an ongoing dispute and that don't all contain personal information.It also explicitly says info is deleted "provided it is not needed for administrative reasons (which are generally limited to dealing with site misuse issues)" (IMO that would include an arb case, if there's a legitimate need for the material).</p>
<p>I have some knowledge of the former contents of HD's talk page and don't remember any personal material on it but (from what I saw) it also wasn't obvious there was important evidence on it.I don't see a compelling reason to undelete the page at the moment, though that may change if the arb case progresses.I think Matisse should work this out with the Arb clerks, as Thatcher131 suggested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95020253#Clerk_notes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95020253#Clerk_notes" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. They can undelete it or grant private and/or redacted access to Matisse as appropriate.To Matisse: try leaving Thatcher131 a talk message or sending an email (you can send email through the "email this user" link at <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">User:Thatcher131</a>).</p>
<p>IMO, HD is not the most important participant in that dispute.<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 10:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The whole thing about deleting user talk pages (and talk pages in general) is that they also consist of <i>other</i> people's contributions. If I have a long and involved and productive discussion with someone on their talk page, I don't want that discussion to vanish with that person. I want my contributions, which might contain important material on my thoughts on certain issues, to be preserved somewhere. Should I really have to keep a list of all the user talk pages I've edited and then 'rescue' my edits if the page gets deleted? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are (at least) two valid issues here. On the one hand the possible usefulness of previous comments by the user and/or others and on the other hand the possibly embarrassing comments of the user and/or others. Historically on user talk pages the balance of those two possibilities has always tipped in favor of the individual user. For instance, users are allowed to blank messages left for them... archiving is favored, but not required. That, of course, makes it more difficult to locate past conversations... requiring a search of the history instead of just browsing the page/subpage. We have a speedy deletion criteria allowing 'user subpages' to be deleted upon request... which is described as including things like 'User talk:Username/Archive 1'. The 'right to vanish' deletion is just another aspect of this. All of these things make it more difficult to access past comments when there are legitimate reasons to do so... but I think that's preferable to keeping things users don't want in their user-space. If a user has done something they are embarrassed about we allow them to delete it... we can still get it back if we have to, but there should be no reason for it to be publicly available (even if just in the history). Ditto nasty or embarrassing things said <i>to</i> the user... people shouldn't be able to drag those up to harass them elsewhere. If we want to retain comments made to user talk pages then that needs a systematic change to a number of Wikipedia policies, but I think it is better to just proceed with the understanding that comments on user talk pages are potentially more ephemeral than anything else on Wikipedia. If it is really of long term importance move it to an article or project space talk page. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Deleting a page is nothing like archiving or blanking. With archiving or blanking, the contribs are still found in the commenter's own contribs and in the page history, and do not need an admin request. With deletion, the contribs simply disappear unless the user keeps a separate list of users they have talked to (a list which would otherwise be in the contribs) and then if the user is experienced enough to know they can be restored at all they can ask an admin. Also, if Right to vanish allowed someone to simply request deletion of the user talk page, that would not simply be "ephemeral", that would be instantaneous. This case is a somewhat good example, where there is apparently an active Arbcom case that could be related to comments on the talk page. If you want to delete the talk page of a <i>banned</i> or <i>permanently vanished</i> user after a year, that may be okay, but that's not what your interpretation of a right to vanish would mean. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, what do you mean we should just accept that user talk page comments would be more ephemeral? With everything else on Wikipedia, comments are permanent except for deleted articles where the comments are not relevant to creating or having a legitimate article. Should I simply not talk on other user's talk pages? Or should I duplicate every comment I leave on a separate page of my own, thus defeating the purpose of deleting those comments in the first place and demonstrating even more clearly that those comments are not his to delete? If the vanishing user has a comment he wants to get rid of, that comment could possibly be arranged to be removed. If someone <i>else</i> leaves a somehow embarassing comment, the vanishing user has no right over it; if appropriate it can be deleted under a no personal attacks policy, which applies anywhere. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What's more, it would even be legal to simply copy his talk page entirely and save it somewhere else; his comments are under the GFDL. If user talk pages were to be ephemeral, one could and should simply keep a separate record of all conversations—but that's the purpose of the original talk page in the first place! —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree entirely with Centrx's points. I also have to admit that it took me over a year to realise that my contribs to deleted pages were not appearing in my contributions list. I was partially misled by the availability (now withdrawn) of a tool to list a user's edits to deleted pages. Now, instead, I watchlist every page I edit, make regular updates to an off-line copy of my contributions list, look for redlinks in a list of pages on my watchlist, and compare my current contributions list to my offline list to find what contributions have disappeared. If the edit summary indicated a long essay or comment, I might try and retrieve it through an admin, but trying to explain all this would be rather tedious to say the least. This is also why I avoid trying to improve articles at AfD, or contributing to the talk pages of said articles, until the AfD is over. Writing on something attached to something that then gets deleted feels rather inefficient. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um... ok. When a comment I've made gets deleted, if I even notice, I shrug and go on with what I was doing. In the extreme hypothetical that I absolutely had to get it back for some reason I know it can always be undeleted so... seems less than crucial to me. In short, I don't see alot of value in having every past comment easily and immediately available... just doesn't seem important. That balanced against, 'annoy people by making stuff they want to get rid of readily available to everyone'... seems like a clear case for allowing deletion. You two apparently place ALOT more value on 'easily available records', but... can you point to a case where it has been more than hypothetically important? When have we <i>ever</i> 'needed' some edit and it has just been terribly difficult to get it back? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's just the general prinicple of the thing. I don't normally delete things that I have written, and I like to keep track of what I have said and done. It would seem courteous to allow people to keep copies of what they have written, or at least to make it much clearer that their contribs list is not complete. I would have no problems with such pages being deleted if I could in general, at any time, see a list of my deleted contribs (the reason it is not done at the moment, I think, is because the way it was set up, anyone could see anyone's deleted contribs - that would not be a problem if viewing was restricted to the user only - similar to how only the user can see their watchlist). My contribs are what I wrote, so what is the problem in letting me access them, even if only to make a copy before they are re-deleted? I realise that this system can be abused by those wanting to paste back in deleted content that should be kept off Wikipedia, but most POV-pushers do this anyway, and are stopped by the normal means. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:38, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And a more specific point. Edits to the blurbs of category pages (the bits at the top) are deleted when categories are renamed, as categories are not moved like article pages are, but are deleted and a new page made. These are not 'ephemeral' talk page edits, but are integral parts of the encyclopedia where contribution history is, if not completely lost, made far more difficult to track down (and nearly impossible if the deleting admin does not mention the CfD page or date), though using "what links here" for the deleted category or the newly created category usually works in tracking down the debate and the deleted page where the contributions history is "kept". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I have gone back to user talk pages to find out about some situation where a user was blocked, etc. There have been several times where I went back to another user's talk page to retrieve my own words and put them on <a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_Meta-writing_ca08.html" title="User talk:Centrx/Meta-writing">User talk:Centrx/Meta-writing</a>. This is then used for personal reference, for future essay and guideline material, and for having easy access to best-of-breed responses to {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}} requests, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/OTRS" class="extiw" title="m:OTRS">m:OTRS</a> queries, etc. If I forget to copy the writing when I comment, these are accessed by looking through my own contribs; I do not otherwise keep a list of every talk page I've commented on or remember the exact username of someone. Anyway, this is just one practical example; there are thousands upon thousands of people, commenting on things over the course of years, on Wikipedia. We have the general principles so we don't need to take a survey of everyone's all possible uses for old talk page comments. A user does not own his userspace; we let him retract some things if he wants to vanish, but we do not let him retract article contributions or discussion comments—and article and policy discussion do happen in the user talk space; the only comments it might make sense to allow him to retract are comments that never really belonged on Wikipedia in the first place; none of this means he has control over other users' comments. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 08:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ideally, yes, deletion should remove the page from active view at the previous location, while allowing reasonable access of various kinds.One kind: admin access.We have that.Another kind: access to my *own* contributions.Let me give an example where I personally find this irritating... prod deletions.If you prod an article and then it gets deleted, it vanishes from your contributions history so you may not even see that it was successfully prodded, etc.I find that irritating.At the very least, it would be nice if it showed up in a non-viewable way as an existing contribution in the contribution history, despite having been deleted.Oversight-deletion might have be used more aggressively, though, if that were the case.(Oversight-deletion makes it so even admins can't see it.)--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I wonder if there is a open bug request on this thing about people being able to see their own contributions to deleted pages?</dd>
<dd>About the 'prod' thing, if the only edit the prodding process needs is to the article page, then you are stuck, unless you can be bothered to make a link to the page on your user page and wait for it to turn red. But that defeats the whole purpose of streamlining the prodding process to a single edit. I don't think I've ever had a deleted article watchlisted - does the watchlist tell people that a watchlisted article has been deleted? Or even if someone recreates it? My experience of this kind of thing, incidentially, was trying to find a page I had tagged as copyvio. That page and the record in my contributions that I had made the effort to tag a copyvio, had vanished. I was most upset!&#160;:-) Ditto for those people that do lots of db (speedy deletion) tagging.</dd>
<dd>As for recording the prod in your contributions list, a workaround for now would be to, immediately after adding the prod template, to edit (say) a user page where you list your prods, add the title of the prodded article, and in the edit summary put "list prodded article: <a href="../../../e/x/a/Example.html" title="Example">Example</a>". Then the two edit summaries are right next to each other in the contributions list. If the prodded article is deleted, the template addition edit vanishes, but the other edit (the one I decribed above) remains and the blue link turns red. A record remains in your contributions list, and it all feels so <i>organised</i>! <small>I've just finished adding a translation request, and I'm awestruck by efficiency and organisation at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_3d5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation">Wikipedia:Translation</a>.</small> But still, being able to view these sorts of edits to articles that later get deleted would be best and easiest (for the user). I wonder whether it is feasible and how much priority the developers would give this sort of thing? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:47, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ceyockey, thanks for your conscientiousness, but blocking vandalism-only accounts is No Big Deal. Any account that does nothing to help build the encyclopedia should be briskly blocked indefinitely, and there's no need to post the block for review. (In fact, the noticeboard would be overwhelmed if it were practice to do that.) Those accounts have no value, they're no kind of start for the user in case s/he later wants to contribute constructively; the thing to do in that event is create a new account. It's blocks of accounts that have made useful edits, or at least attempts at useful edits, that need posting. (Plus, as Merzbow says, this is an obvious username block in any case.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC).

<p>I'll agree that when I've done this in the past it's been after many warnings and previous blocks.I don't see how it violates policy.Arguably there are suggestions of underage drug use here, which in my view makes it appropriate to at least <i>discuss</i> whether responsible adults should be informed.We're not Big Brother or even Big Babysitter.Yet - at the risk of another bad pun - I've got something of an urge to nip this in the bud. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 00:43, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um ... you've done this before? I'd like to see a broader discussion of whether that's appropriate because I have serious qualms about it. In the interim, having scanned this user's contributions (and it's possible I might have missed something or some edits have been deleted), I didn't see any reference to drug use except for a mediocre pun on someone's (a 1959 graduate's) name. There's a combination of school-spirit edits and mild vandalism edits (e.g., changing the words of the school song, denouncing the quality of the magazine). Maybe I'm missing something, but the idea that someone should call a user's employer or (as here) school to report something like this, with who-knows-what real-world consequences, strikes me as completely unwarranted. I will admit that on a quick check, I didn't find a specific policy on the matter. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:58, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Abuse reports to ISPs are permitted by policy; where the ISP is a school or corporate network, a report to the responsible administrators is the correct action. (I've done a few myself.) However, abuse reports are only warranted where there is no other way of preventing continued disruption; this situation doesn't rise to that level. This needs to go through the normal channels before such a thing is ever considered: counsel, warn, block, block longer, block indef, ban, abuse-report. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 03:43, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

If the user is not using corporate/school resources to do so, then it isn't a matter for concern by school/work officials, and reporting it to them would be a very, very bad idea, not to mention far outside policy (and subject to sanction, if it rose to the RFAR level). <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:17, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well your edit summary of "vandal revert" appears out of line, the addition most certainly wasn't vandalism. The statement seems pretty accurate in the context of the policy, but personally I don't care for the wording particularly no in the prominent position in the policy, so I've reverted again. I guess some discussion on the talk page of the policy would be good as to (a) if it is needed since it seems to follow from the rest of the policy anyway or (b) how and where such a statement should appear in the policy. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 09:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Guys, this debate could go on until the cows come home.The fact is, verifiable sources are one of the 3 pillars of wikipedia.If as a group, the editors in this debate believe that failing to meet one of the 3 pillars is not criteria for deletion, there's not much I can say further.The point of a PROD is to see if there is objection to deletion.I have no hard feelings about anyone removing any of my prods and I believe I am inline with the policies of the project.Failing someone citing an arbcom decision, I am through discussing this topic. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 15:44, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you truly believe an article should be deleted due to lack of sourcing, when someone deprods an article you should AFD it. But if you're just going to ignore the article after prodding it I'm quite certain that's disruption to make a point. The best way forward to be to actually finalise something, and not toss it aside because you think everyone else is wrong. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 15:59, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Simple solution to a discussion that can go on for a long time: if a prod is removed, AfD the article. If enough AfD are defeated, the nominator either learns and stops or starts to get blocked for trolling/pointing/etc.; if his AfD go through he is proven right.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Their was a lengthy dsicussion about it, as stated above.The result was very unclear.There is no clear policy for or against, and the vandalism text is ambuguous.

<p>I can tell you in this case, I am ending the conversation on my talk page for efficiency reasons.If the debate is about PROD tagging articles based on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a> policy, that debate should be discussed in a place where it can be archived in relation to the policy.As for my conduct, I see that I ruffled some feathers with a run of PROD tags and so I'm backing off from it.I'm not backing off because I think I'm wrong, but when you hit a bunch of opposition sometimes it's best to let things cool off.Part of backing off is that I don't want to have a circular discussion on my talk page, this noticeboard and the policy talk page.There is no new evidence to discuss, if anything we're debating policy wording and that discussion has been started on the appropriate page.Please respect my request Chacor, I am more than happy to debate the subject with you on the policy talk page.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 03:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll add my two cents because I have recently become involved in disputes with Alan.ca. It appears to me that he is fairly new to Wikipedia and is not yet clear on Wikipedia policies and guidelines and how people interact on Wikipedia. This is leading to numerous unnecessary disputes with other editors. Having said that, I have looked at the edits that Chacor has cited as evidence of threats and harassment, and I do not agree that they constitute threats or harassment.In fact, in these cases, Alan.ca has been civil. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:21, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guys, lets chill before we start having an "accusation" fight. The block has been reviewed, there <i>appears</i> to be concensus to overturn it, and it has been overturned by Alex. Ghirla, no comment on whether your strong stance about IRC is correct or not, but one thing I will definitively state is ANI is not the medium to complain about it with any favourable result - which I presume is what you want. Nothing will be achieved here by arguing over the merits of IRC, especially given I can personally assure you, from Wizardrydragon's mouth, that he did not <i>request</i> that a block be placed. Lets all let it go before someone says something they regret, and this ends up at the top of the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">DR</a> chain - we all know how time-consuming that can be, and that inhibits everyone's <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">main aim, to write an encyclopaedia</a>. And before you ask, no, this action was not requested from anyone on IRC - I'm not even on IRC presently.

<p>I do agree that this block was misplaced. Irpen should have received a npa template at best, I don't think a block was needed. It is Ghirla who made most of the WP:CIV offences which led to the WP:PAIN discussion, where Irpen just overreacted somewhat - but not as much as to warrant a 48h block (IMHO), especially of an editor who is really quite civil usually and just lost his cool trying to defend a friend. I agree with Wizard that there is no need to discuss it further, if anything needs more comments, it's <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard_ca1f.html#Ghirlandajo_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" title="Wikipedia:Personal attack intervention noticeboard">the PAIN discussion</a>, but not this one.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 02:05, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was <b>way</b> across the line (the block).I went through, and I couldn't see any "personal attack."I couldn't even see any "incivility" on WP:PAIN.I don't think a template would have been appropriate either.All I saw was Irpen making people argue, and that's no crime.N.b. "You're making me argue" is not the same as "you are insulting me."A template would have only served as a provocation, and part of the substance of the complaint was "I will place a template and see how he responds."To me, that looks dangerously like, "I'll poke him with a stick and see if I can make him bite me."Templates don't make people nice.Their unreasoning and the way they clobber the rest of the page, as well as the way that they announce that some Higher Power has determined that Thou Hast Sinned, is enough to make even a reasonable and mellow person snarl.Very bad block.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have recently been editing a very, very arcane article that, I came to realize, used to be the #1 hangout for a rather notorious, now-banned user who focused a huge amount of energy and ill-will defending his extremely POV version.Recently, three new users with very similar names were created practically at the same time and appeared at this article.They, as well as a fourth user (an anon ISP), seem remarkably familiar with this obscure topic, right down to the obscure references.They have only been active on the talk page so far, but they are subtly (and almost overly-civilly) pushing the same POV (e.g. "don't bother checking that reference, I'm sure it's correct" and the like).Another user has already made the (so far uncountered) claim that they are probably all socks of the banned user.What's the procedure here?I am being vague because if this is a non-issue I don't want to attract attention to it, and I don't want to just accuse the users of being socks, although it seems very likely the three new accounts are one person.I can give specifics if necessary.Nothing "bad" has happened so far but I figured I would be a bit proactive. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 06:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi I've been trying to contribute towards the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> article but I have an Administraor who won't let me contrubute anything. His name is Guinnog and he wouldn't even let me put a map of the British Isles in the article or let me write under a map that Northern Ireland is a part of the UK. All he ever does is revert my stuff and tell me off for apparently not getting "enough consensus" when he's the only one who's even minds about what I want to contribute and there's no one else saying anything to apparently get enough "consensus" from, and if I try to contribute again he threatens to block me and has blocked me before for just wanting to contribute. I think it's basically that he likes the article a certain way and won't let others contribute and change it. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomethingoranother_1921.html" title="User:Somethingoranother">Somethingoranother</a> 08:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not a whole bunch of people it's one administrator and his friend who just won't let me contribute at all. I've discussed everything on the Discussion page and made compromises but simple won't let me do anything. I've tried to contribute many times now but he just reverts them and they're only the most minor of contributes. I mean am I not allowed to contribute here? He says I need consensus from othere users but how am I meant to get consensus when he's the only one who even cares about me contributing as others haven't said anything about it and don't care. I've contibuted to many articles over the past year and I've never once had anyone showing this kind of threatening behavior, and the contributes I've made to other pages were far more changing. It's to the point of being ridiculous now where he just totally dominates the article and uses his administrator powers to block those who dare to contribute towards the article. I really just don't get it anymore, please help me. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomethingoranother_1921.html" title="User:Somethingoranother">Somethingoranother</a> 09:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So adding a picture of the British Isles was wrong was it? I think you'll find that's not against wiki rules so why bring it up? Also those 3RR where simple contributes which should never have been reverted and he only reverted them because they didn't fit his point of view. I thought wiki had a NPOV policy? That's not what I've seen so far.

<p>I only tried to add part of UK in 2 places, hardly every mention of Northern Ireland, but I'm not allowed to even contribute anything. As soon as I do it gets reverted and I get threatened with being blocked. Besides I thought Administrators would be helping me out not trying to back up the idea that I'm not allowed to contribute anything because basically the page now belongs to him. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomethingoranother_1921.html" title="User:Somethingoranother">Somethingoranother</a> 09:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Multiple people seem to agree that you're doing the wrong thing for the article here.It's not just Guinnog; look at the article history, you had four separate people revert you.</dd>
<dd>If multiple experienced editors, including an administrator, are telling you that there's something wrong with the contributions you want to make, you need to take a step back and listen to what they're trying to tell you.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a bulletin board for anyone to post anything they want.We're an encyclopedia; we have content standards and community consensus discussions on how to best present information, all of which you have to abide by to participate in the project.It's bizarre to think that you could get to do what just you want to by coming here and complaining.</dd>
<dd>If you believe they've all got the wrong idea for what belongs in the article, take the discussion to the article talk page.If you have a new idea for something to add, which isn't just re-doing the controversial things, and you think it is consistent with Wikipedia policy, then feel free to add it to the article.If it's ok it will stay.If someone disagrees and it turns out to be controversial, then you need to justify why you've got the right idea on the talk page and get at least some of the other people who edit that article to agree with you.</dd>
<dd>If you're really interested in contributing, please take the time to engage in the community discussions that serve as our quality control process.If you don't understand why they're objecting, please ask them.If they were to just revert you out of spite and refuse to talk to you on the article talk page or your or their talk pages, THEN that would be the time to come ask an administrator for help, or if you couldn't find one perhaps ask on ANI.Asking now is really not good.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 10:44, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>George, I appreciate your taking taking the time to explain our policies to this user. I tried very hard to be patient and to helpthem, but it seems my efforts were unappreciated. It may well be that this user will need another block as they continue to controversially insert a non-consensus pro-British POV into Ireland-related articles, and I was somewhat perturbed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ireland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95946840" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ireland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95946840" rel="nofollow">their last edit</a> and signs that the editor is adding incivility to their other problematic attributes. Can I ask others to keep an eye on this, as I think it would look better if someone other than me enacted their next block, should another one be necessary. Thanks a lot, --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 17:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The gamers from the Games Plus LAN (66.93.251.112/28) are having a hard time with challenges to their edits. The latest round started with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_vortex_eb36.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The vortex">this AfD</a>, which prompted a series of bad-faith edits from the IP range culminating in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JonHarder&amp;diff=95662592&amp;oldid=95648756" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JonHarder&amp;diff=95662592&amp;oldid=95648756" rel="nofollow">this threat</a> and the block of 66.93.251.117 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.93.251.117.html" title="User talk:66.93.251.117">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.93.251.117_c42b.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.93.251.117">contribs</a>).

Since my edits tend to just inflame the group (probably really one individual), I think it would be better if someone with the extra tools to deal with a couple of problems and the reaction likely to follow.</p>

<li>IGames was created by copying www.igames.org/About.asp and it needs to be db-copyvio'd</li>

</ul>
<p>I sincerely apologize for dragging this here, but I think it is in the best interest of Wikipedia for me not to annoy this editor directly since it has started to spill over into other unrelated articles. I'll probably get significant backlash just for bringing it up. I welcome any feedback about how I could have handled this situation more gracefully.

<p>Judging by this editor's contribs and general tone, he is definitely an abusive trolling sockpuppet of somebody.

<p>User <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> added (what I consider to be) an inappropriate message in an AfD. Not only is he soliciting votes for an AfD which he has a personal interest in - he is advising a certain vote that meets his own POV. IMHO this is vote stacking and probably some other WP violation too. I delted the message, and he resposted it. Will an admin please take a look and do what he/she thinks is needed?
