<p>The vote that made a 3RR rule violation a blockable offense (<a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_20b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement">Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement</a>) was conducted between 14 Nov and 25 Nov, 2004. At the time of the vote, the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> text linked several instances of "revert" in the text to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a>, as its definition of "revert". This article was therefore, in effect, an extension of the 3RR policy. It defines "revert" for the purposes of 3RR. At the time of the vote, this article, in turn, was a redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_revert_a_page_to_an_earlier_version_2f85.html" title="Wikipedia:How to revert a page to an earlier version">Wikipedia:How to revert a page to an earlier version</a> which describes the process for rolling an article back to a prior state in its edit history, either through the "reversion" process available to normal editors, or through the "rollback" feature available to administrators. Since January 2005, a small number of editors have removed this redirect from <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> and have started to edit this article. In effect, they are extending the definition of "revert", and therefore the application of the 3RR, without those extensions going through any form of consensus formation.</p>
<p>People have been referring to this article for evidence that "partial reverts" and "complex reverts" are part of the meaning of "revert" for the purposes of the 3RR policy. However this is highly misleading, because that is not the definition given by <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> at the time 3RR was approved.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose that</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> be made an official policy, with changes going through the usual process for gaining policy consensus, OR (in the meanwhile, AND)</li>

<p>I completely agree with #1 and I agree in principle with #2. Since the 3 <b>Revert</b> Rule is offical policy, it only stands to reason that we have an official definition of Revert.

<p>A reminder to all admins to use extra care when speedy deleting. There have been incidents recently where an anon has repeatedly inappropriately nominated a page for speedy deletion as a "hoax" (which is not one of the speedy criteria in any case), ignoring all suggestions to take it to VfD, and has actually succeeded in getting it deleted twice. The page in question does not in fact appear to be a hoax at all (a minor musical genre with an odd name). <b>Remember to check page history</b>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 18:00, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happens if you enter "User:xxx" instead of "xxx" in the block field? This came up twice today.

I wasn't sure what happened, so I blocked him indefinitely. Checking the block log, I saw that <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">User:Refdoc</a> had blocked User:User:Jesus H. Christ III. I thought this was a mistake, a block of a nonexistent user, but saw that a little later there were two autoblocks deriving from this block.

<li>I haven't tested it, but apparently the software only really "looks" at the part after the last colon, to get the username.

</ul>
<p>"Can someone create a username like User:User:xxx?" Nope. I just tried, and it complained that the user name was invalid. Because of this, MediaWiki should either</p>
<ol>
<li>Give an error if you try to block User:User:xxx, or</li>
<li>Treat it as a block of User:xxx.</li>

<dd>Thanks for checking that. So it looks like MediaWiki treats a block of User:User:xxx as a block of User:xxx. It will show up in the block log and IP block list as a block of User:User:xxx, a broken (red) link regardless if the user has actually created a user page. Also, if one wants to see all the blocks for User:xxx and puts that in the field, the blocks for User:User:xxx won't show up. That's my understanding. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 07:17, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you've got it. One workaround is to view the block log at 500 entries per page and then use your browser's search function to search on the username itself (for instance, search for SWAdair instead of User:SWAdair). That will catch all instances of that username, whether it is preceeded by User: or User:User: <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:35, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Did we ever decide what to do with these? I looked up <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASAP_9310.html" title="ASAP">ASAP</a> today and found it was pending deletion. Checking the history, it looks like it was nominated early for transwikiing to Wiktionary, then improved a bit, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ASAP" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:ASAP">transwikied</a>, and marked for speedy deletion. As I understand it, transwikiing is not a criterion for speedy deletion; they are supposed to go through VfD like other articles. Am I mistaken? — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 03:14, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe you're right. Since I had been active in deleting the transwikied articles I've started going through <a href="../../../p/e/n/Category%7EPending_deletions_30f4.html" title="Category:Pending deletions">Category:Pending deletions</a> looking for others like <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASAP_9310.html" title="ASAP">ASAP</a> that were marked Pending but haven't yet been through VfD.

<li>The last step at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:transwiki">meta:transwiki</a> is to delete the left-behind version of the article. Unlike regular deletion, transwiki does not destroy history - the article can always be recovered in the same form from the alternate wikiproject. Therefore, it is considered a reversible decision. If I transwiki an article to Wiktionary and it turns out to be controversial, the next editor (whether he/she is an admin or not) can bring the article back. Since anyone can reverse the decision, I believe that neither VfD nor the speedy deletion criteria need to apply. The article has not been deleted from MediaWiki. It has merely been moved within MediaWiki. Now like any other pagemove, if you suspect that it might be controversial, it is simple courtesy to discuss it first. That might involve a VfD nomination for discussion by the community but it's not required. The decision to nominate or not is one we've traditionally left to the discretion of the admin cleaning up that last step in the transwiki process. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:32, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is what I thought, and indeed what I was acting upon until the discussions at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html#Deletion_at_the_end_of_transwiki" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_deletion#Deletion_at_the_end_of_transwiki</a> made me pause. The continued discussion at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:transwiki">m:Talk:transwiki</a> still seems unsure, with some good points on both sides of the issue. Has that discussion been carried on elsewhere and settled definitively? IANAL, and I've not read the statutes, so I will defer to the judgement of those who have the time and knowledge to sift through the fine print. With the issue apparently not yet determined to a large degree one way or the other, I'm unsure of exactly what the requirements are. I understand your viewpoint (above) and was acting on that belief in the past. Now... I dunno. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:54, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I started the discussion at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html#Deletion_at_the_end_of_transwiki" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_deletion#Deletion_at_the_end_of_transwiki</a> to try to gain "official" recognition of the process as I understood it. No one took the opportunity to dispute that interpretation so I believe that it now has a little bit more precedent. Other than that, the discussion just sort of petered out. I am continuing to act on that interpretation. The discussion at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:transwiki">m:Talk:transwiki</a> has been focusing more on whether the mechanics of the transwiki process are sufficient - do we have a legal obligation to preserve the tracability of every edit or is it sufficient to preserve the simple fact that Author A contributed something to the article. That remains an open question. Short of getting sued and having a judge render an actual decision, I don't know that we will ever definitively answer it. We all agree that it would be better if the MediaWiki capabilities were expanded a bit so we wouldn't have to worry about the question. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></li>

<li>Thanks, Rossami. I'm still confused, though; I don't really understand the whole transwiki process well. I looked at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:transwiki">meta:transwiki</a>, and it looks to me that step 6 of the example (transwikiing from English to French) is to list the original on VfD. That aside, I am not certain I understand how one would bring the article back. One, because if the original is deleted, later editors would not know that the article had been transwikied. But two, can you show me how, if <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASAP_9310.html" title="ASAP">ASAP</a> were deleted, one would recover the article/history from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ASAP" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:ASAP">wiktionary:ASAP</a>?

<ul>
<li>You have several good questions. The problem with the last step of the process described at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:transwiki">meta:transwiki</a> is that none of the other MediaWiki projects make the distinctions we do between VfD, CSD, IfD, TfD, etc. They haven't become large enough or busy enough to need them. I don't spend a huge amount of time on the other projects but my understanding is that most of them quickly delete transwiki'd articles without a lot of formal discussion - more like our CSD process than VfD. But you could certainly interpret it either way. You also asked how to bring an article back. If you want to reverse a transwiki decision, you simply transwiki the article in reverse. That means copy-paste the article (and its Talk page) back from Wiktionary to Wikipedia. Since the Wiktionary article's talk page holds the old Wikipedia article's contributor log, when you move it back to Wikipedia, you will have re-established the contribution history (as a pasted list on the new Wikipedia article's talk page). Admittedly, you won't have the tracability of every edit (see comment above) but you will know everyone who contributed to the article. Lastly, you are correct that future reader/editors may not realize that their article was transwiki'd out of Wikipedia. That's a known failing of the process and has led to at least one call that we should instead leave behind a cross-wiki redirect. The objection to the cross-wiki redirect boils down to the fact that it won't show up on "what links here" and therefore is hard to keep current if/when someone moves the page in the receiving project. For example, if someone moved <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ASAP" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:ASAP">Wiktionary:ASAP</a> to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/A.S.A.P." class="extiw" title="wiktionary:A.S.A.P.">Wiktionary:A.S.A.P.</a>, there are no triggers or ticklers to help the Wiktionary team go back to update the links that are in Wikipedia. There are several proposals to fix that weakness but none have been implemented yet (that I know of). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:50, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your patience, Rossami. I still am unclear though; I am not sure if I am misunderstanding matters. Are we looking at the same part of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:Transwiki">Meta:Transwiki</a>? I'm looking at the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki#Example" class="extiw" title="meta:Transwiki">example</a>, which concerns a French article written on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="w:">en:</a>, to be transwikied to <a href="../../../../fr/index.html" class="extiw" title="fr:">fr:</a>. I'm not sure I understand how it could be interpreted either way—Step 6 clearly states: "Then the Lorraine article at the English Wikipedia can be listed on Votes for deletion", with "Votes for deletion" linking to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. The last step, step 10, applies to the article in the "Transwiki:" space on the <i>receiving</i> wiki, and only applies if the receiving wiki already had an article with the title and so that article in the transwiki space has to be cut-and-pasted into the already-existing article. If not, the "transwiki" article is simply moved into the article namespace, and no deletion is necessary. Am I misunderstanding this? And I apologize for my lack of comprehension, but can you actually point me to the page where the list of contributors on Wiktionary? You mentioned it would be on the talk page, but <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:ASAP" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Talk:ASAP">wiktionary:Talk:ASAP</a> does not seem to exist. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 04:19, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a confusing topic, made worse because some of the relevant pages have not been kept current. In <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:transwiki">meta:transwiki</a>, I have always relied on the plain wording in the paragraph <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki#Transfer_from_main_to_transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">Transfer from main to transwiki</a> which reads <tt>"The original page may be deleted as soon as it has been moved to the transwiki area."</tt> Step 6 in the example does mention Wikipedia's VfD but that example has been around since before the split between VfD and CSD. Back then, we listed everything on the VfD page and could speedily unlist the CSD-equivalents.</dd>
<dd>The requirement to preserve history is in the paragraph headed <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki#Page_history" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">Page history</a>. An example of where it was done correctly is at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wikistress" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:Wikistress">m:Talk:Wikistress</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASAP_9310.html" title="ASAP">ASAP</a> is a difficult example. Looking at the history of the two articles (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=ASAP&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=ASAP&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASAP&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASAP&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), the Wiktionary article pre-dated the Wikipedia article and at the time of the "transwiki" included most (arguably all) of the relevant content. <a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPoccilScript_b6fd.html" title="User:PoccilScript">PoccilScript</a> added the tag that he/she believed it had already been moved to Wiktionary's inbound transwiki queue. It's up to the Wiktionary team to decide if and when to integrate the article from the transwiki queue into their article space. Since the Wiktionary article already has most (arguably all) the relevant content, they may well decide to leave their article as is and to allow the Wikipedia version to languish at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transwiki:ASAP" class="extiw" title="wikt:transwiki:ASAP">wikt:transwiki:ASAP</a>. To complicate it further, I'm not actually sure that this particular article really was transwiki'd. That may have been an assumption based on looking at the current state of the two articles. Or someone could have followed the process incorrectly. I wish I had a better answer for this example. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:47, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rossami, I appreciate you explaining this all to me. I understand now, and I think I will leave it up to others to figure out how to handle this transwiki business in general. In this specific case, I think I will remove the {{<a href="../../../p/e/n/Template%7EPendingdeletion_4f4b.html" title="Template:Pendingdeletion">pendingdeletion</a>}} notice and place it on VfD.

Because they were users with only one account, they we not sockpuppets (of course, we had no idea whether they were or not). As is often our practice, their votes were not counted. Unaware of this custom, and the reasons behind it, many of them were understandably irate. In the interests of diplomacy and newcomer education, I created a template, {{newvoter}}, that can be posted on the talk page of newcomers that create accounts and head directly in to vote. Here is the current version of this template. Of course, and input would be very valuable, but I think that it would be best if the template were kept brief.</p>

<dd>I disagree; the coloured box suggests that it's not just some indivudual having a go at the new User, but something related to Wikipedia policy. Also, plain-text templates tend to merge into the surrounding material (that's especially noticeable in articles, though). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:49, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>A sockpuppet is also a friend or forum mate of an existing account, who comes to Wikipedia for the <i>sole purpose</i> of making a vote or statement in concurrence with said existing account. Happens sometimes on VfD. The reason is that it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between one user creating a dozen accounts, and one user bringing in a dozen friends for a single vote. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:22, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure what is and isn't allowed on User pages; <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_pages_766f.html" title="Wikipedia:User pages">Wikipedia:User pages</a> is a bit sparse. I ask because of <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslamist_0c12.html" title="User:Islamist">Islamist</a> (<a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslamist_3e0d.html" title="User talk:Islamist">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Islamist_4a24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Islamist">contribs</a>). he's been engaged in revert wars, pushing a very clear PoV, and I and other editors have had occasion to warn him about his abusive edit summaries. His retaliation takes the form of a User page in which he lists editors who, he claims, "have displayed hostility, made biased edits and have reverted edits in an abusive way". Is this all part of the rough and tumble, does it come under 'no personal attacks', or what? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 15:43, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support allowing almost anything on User pages, <b>except</b> personal attacks. I think it crosses the line when a user starts posting against other Wikipedia editors. In the case of <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslamist_0c12.html" title="User:Islamist">User:Islamist</a>, I think it's inappropriate to list user under the description: "<i>The following editors have displayed hostility, made biased edits and have reverted edits in an abusive way</i>". This is a personal attack against the listed users and shouldn't be tolerated in any namepsace. I will request that Islamist remove that section. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:24, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with the list is that it's disruptive and almost certainly can be classified as a personal attack. I have high tolerance for attacks against policy or anything outside of Wikipedia. If an editor wants to make their User page a rant against <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, they should be allowed. However, it's not appropriate when an editor utilizes his User page to accuse other editors of "displaying hostility" and reverting edits in an "abusive way". This makes it very difficult for other users to interact with him, especially since there is already a great deal of tension. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 12:00, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I want to move page A to page B. But page B already exists and redirects to A. Do I copy the contents verbatim or is there another method which appends the page history?</li>
<li>A non admin asked me to delete some of his temp pages and some bad uploads. Do I have to list it in VFD/IFD or can I delete it on the fly? &#160;<font color="#0082B8">=<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nichalp_0509.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nichalp">contribs</a>)=</font> 08:56, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>With regards to your first question, you should never copy-and-paste. Does B have any history or was it created as the redirect? If the latter, then any user with an account (that's not too new) can move A to B (over the redirect). If it has a history, then B must be deleted; then move A to B. If a non-administrator wishes to do this, he must list it at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">Requested moves</a>. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:16, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As for the second question, I'd say probably yes, you can delete it, but be careful. There was a recent episode where a user didn't like what was going on in an article. So he blanked it, then moved the article to Testttttttttttttt and then to Testttttttttttt, edited it to say "delete delete delete", then asked an administrator to delete it as his test. The administrator fell for it and tried to delete it, but fortunately it had a long history with block-compression and so couldn't be deleted. The admin put up a {{<a href="../../../p/e/n/Template%7EPendingdeletion_4f4b.html" title="Template:Pendingdeletion">pendingdeletion</a>}} notice but luckily a couple other administrators noticed what happened, and the article was moved back. Moral: check if it has a history, and check "what links here" to see if any redirects point to it. Images I'm not so sure about: I think it might depend on why he wants the images removed. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:27, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Notice this is even harder to undo, so be careful.</li>
<li>If the user requesting deletion is the only one who ever edited it (i.e. he is the only one on the history, even if it has lots of entries), as is probably the case for a user temp page, you can delete it (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> criteria G7 and/or U1). In fact, I did it on a temp page of mine yesterday (created to test a bug workaround on <a href="../../../m/n/_/Template%7EMn_a928.html" title="Template:Mn">Template:mn</a>, edited until it worked, then tagged as {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}).</li>

<p>It might just be me, but I've noticed an increase in the number of incidents of 'double vandalism' recently. That is to say an anon vandalises a page and a minute later a different anon vandalises the same page. It could be coincidence, but given the timing I suspect it may be vandals working in tandem. There is not much to be done, except to keep an eye out for when the previous edit also by an anon, and be aware that a simple rollback may not be enough to fix a vandalised page. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:51, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This sort of thing should not be encouraged, or WP will be the new geocities before we know it. Even an established user who doing this would be out of line.

<dd>Agreed. This can't be allowed. One small group doing this is harmless, but allowing it means we would quickly have hundreds, then thousands of groups doing this. That would <i>not</i> be harmless, as it would suck up significant bandwidth and server resources. Wikipedia is a public resource, but it's a public resource with a purpose, and alumni pages do not fall within the purpose. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 17:09, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also agreed. Give them some time to receive and respond to the messages; if they don't knock it off after that, I think the best course of action would be to delete all the pages and replace them with a notice of why they were deleted—and an offer to help move the material to Wikicities or whatever site they think appropriate. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 17:56, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive4_dd02.html" title="Edit section: Wikipedia is not a travel guide.

Or is it?</span></h3>
<p>All right, people, I need some policy-related help, please. I was always under impression that 1)&#160;Wikipedia, being an encyclopedia, does not cover purely travel-related topics, nor does it allow links to travel sites of non-encyclopedic nature; and 2)&#160;no commercial links (spam) are allowed in the External link sections of the articles.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I (and other users) was persistently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yekaterinburg&amp;diff=12589197&amp;oldid=12566814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yekaterinburg&amp;diff=12589197&amp;oldid=12566814" rel="nofollow">removing a link</a> (also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yekaterinburg&amp;diff=12718064&amp;oldid=12589197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yekaterinburg&amp;diff=12718064&amp;oldid=12589197" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sverdlovsk_Oblast&amp;diff=12517584&amp;oldid=12265219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sverdlovsk_Oblast&amp;diff=12517584&amp;oldid=12265219" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sverdlovsk_Oblast&amp;diff=12555558&amp;oldid=12520892" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sverdlovsk_Oblast&amp;diff=12555558&amp;oldid=12520892" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) to a certain website that offers little more than information on accomodation in Yekaterinburg. My reasoning was that the link leads to a commercial website with non-encyclopedic information. The discussion can be viewed <a href="../../../v/i/c/User_talk%7EVic-vic_8a21.html" title="User talk:Vic-vic">here</a> and <a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html#Yekaterinburg" title="User talk:Ezhiki">here</a> (I apologize that most of it is in Russian—that's the language the user adding the link preferred to use; I will gladly translate it if necessary).</p>
<p>While it looks that the user eventually agreed with my reasoning, I noticed that his link is also present in a number of other articles (e.g., <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>). I was going to remove it as well and issue the user his final warning before starting blocking him, but I then noticed that Barcelona article has a link to Barcelona Restaurants' site, and that link was there for quite a while. To me, that would also fall under "commercial, non-encyclopedic category", but I really want to make sure I am correct in my assumption. The policy regarding external links is kind of vague, and it calls mostly for admin's good judgment when deciding what's spam and what's useful. I would guess if the "accomodations" link is spam, then the "restaurants" link would also be. If it's not spam, then what are the grounds for keeping it?</p>

<dd>I just removed this link and one advertising accomodation from the Barcelona page. Also noticed a categories mess there.

<dd>Thanks. I went ahead and cleaned <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> as well. I would still appreciate a clarification on the policy—what kind of links are considered commercial, travel-related, and non-encyclopedic, and what kinds are acceptable.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus amurensis)</a> 16:45, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that there's much written policy on this. In the absense of one, I would just consider the needs of the reader. If you think a reader looking for encyclopedic information on the topic would find the link relevant and interesting, it's good. If it would only appeal to people looking for a specific service (as opposed to people looking for general information <i>about</i> that type of service) then it's probably bad. We do have one rule that's fairly well-established: don't link to a site if it is just one of a large number of commercial sites providing similar services. Doing so would be advertising that particular website. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 17:46, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks—that's pretty much how I looked at it, too. It's just that I was astonished to discover multitudes of commercial and somewhat commercial links all around Wikipedia after I looked at this issue a little closer; in fact, I was astonished so much that I started to question if my understanding of how the links should be handled is correct (hence this post). Thanks again for your confirmation; now I know that I was doing the right thing.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus amurensis)</a> 17:53, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely. To me these are all examples of spam linking, whether they are well intentioned or not. Why? Because we really want the information added to Wikipedia under a free license, not encourage readers to be lead off-site. I've recently removed a pile of hotel and restaurant guide links from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, and a host of photo blogs from <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a> (but they will all be back within the month).</dd>
<dd>The question is not 'is the site commercial' so much as is this external link of more benefit to Wikipedia and its readers, or the owner of the site linked to. So we really should link <a href="http://www.amazon.com" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com</a> from the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> article, but not from every article that describes or references a book.</dd>
<dd>External collections of photographs are equally as difficult. A lot of the time they are just rubbish, but when the external photographs are really good, it is tempting to think that the reader of the Wikipedia article would like to see some better photographs of Egyptian pyramids or the like. However if we banned the link, and instead encourage the contributor to add some photographs under a free license, Wikipedia and its readers benefit more and the contributor can include a link back to their other photos on the image description page. This is an area of policy that could do with some firming up.</dd>
<dd>On a similar note, I wouldn't mind some input on the question of linking to 3rd party Wikis at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#External_links_to_3rd_party_Wikis" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#External_links_to_3rd_party_Wikis</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 18:39, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since Wikipedia isn't primarilly an image collection, I'd argue that really good image galleries should definitely be allowed as external links. We should never use external links as a substitute for our own content, but we should certainly use external links to <i>supplement</i> what we have. Wikipedia isn't primarilly in the business of making image galleries, so sites that do host excellent image galleries are perfect candidates for external links. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 20:27, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am posting to protest the decision made by <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> when closing this VfD debate. In this VfD, there were four votes for delete, two votes for keep, and one non-vote by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">User:RickK</a>, the nominator, in which he proposed the possibility of a merge, but did not vote (this is both mine and Mindspillage's interpretation of RickK's comments). This resulted in a 2/3 majority concluding that the article should be deleted. Mindspillage turned it into a Merge and Redirect instead, despite no one actually voting for this position and only one person even suggesting it. When I asked her why on her talkpage, she responsed by saying that she found no consensus to delete (See her response on <a href="../../../i/n/d/User_talk%7EIndrian_e457.html" title="User talk:Indrian">User talk:Indrian</a>). I realize that not all admins agree on what exactly constitutes consensus, but this is the first time I have ever seen a 2/3 majority to delete called a lack of consensus. I would like this decision reviewed and respectfully propose that a clear consensus to delete was actually achieved. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:14, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the record: I'd be very hesitant to delete with 2/3. Majority alone is not consensus—no one would promote an admin with a tally of (4/2/1), for example. As mentioned on Indrian's talk page, I would have kept for no consensus, but not liking to leave messes around for others to clean up I went ahead and merged it myself, as I've seen done in other similar cases. I won't delete this; as I am a newly-minted admin yet, if you do, please explain to me why. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 22:03, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without reviewing the content at all, I will comment on the procedure. 2/3 is generally considered to be the minimum level of "concensus" necessary for deletion on VfD but we deliberately allow the deciding admin considerable discretion in the interpretation and identification of concensus. Remember that "Votes for deletion" is not really about "voting" at all. The comments are as important and often more important than the strict vote cast. A vote can be 10 to 1 against but if that last vote presents a fact-based argument supported by policy which invalidates the arguments presented by the previous delete voters, the deciding admin can override the strict vote count. Further, if the article changes during the discussion period (which we encourage), the deciding admin is granted great latitude to evaluate the comments in context of the varying versions. The deciding admin is encouraged (but not required) to show his/her work as the decision is made. This is, of course, a lot more important when exercising an override.</p>
<p>If any user disagrees with the decision rendered by a deciding admin, the usual approach is to use <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Votes for undeletion</a> if the decision was "delete" or, if the decision was any variation of "keep", to wait a while then politely re-nominate the article for deletion. We don't generally encourage appeals on this page. It's just not set up for it. A <i>pattern</i> of abuse should be dealt with through the RfC process.</p>
<p>As a last process comment, the decision to "merge" is one which any editor can make or revert. It is not necessarily a binding decision of the VfD process. Having made the call that the decision is a "keep" in any form, the deciding admin immediately choose to act as an ordinary editor and <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> in creating the redirect. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:23, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you admittedly did not read the materials, I feel the need to educate you on one point. She did not say the result of the debate was no consensus, she said the result of the debate was merge and redirect. She chose to ignore all the votes, keep or delete, and proclaim the suggestion by RickK to be the result of the debate. One person's comment versus six people's votes. That is a gross subversion of the VfD process whether the article were kept or not. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:00, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>For what it's worth, I think Hinckley's wife is notable, albeit perhaps only marginally, and I'd have voted to keep if I'd known about the debate. So I suppose that would've saved the article. I feel a little bit guilty.

<li>That is a ridiculous proposition. There was probably someone else out there who would have voted delete, thus countering your phantom vote here.

<li>Well, some people are of the opinion that a VfD is really just an informal sort of consensus building process, rather than a real <i>vote</i>. I disagree with that school of thought, but if one did agree with it, I think it would make sense to consider opinions after the fact as well. But all right, it's not such a big deal. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:24, 29 Apr 2005
<ul>
<li>Yes, that is not such a big deal. What bothers me most is that the article should have been kept as is for lack of consensus or deleted because a majority wanted it gone. Instead, <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> declared the official result of the vote as Merge and Redirect, which was coutner to every vote, keep and delete alike. Sure, she could have merged it afterwords as any user could, but she created an official result on the VfD page that was not supported by any voter. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:31, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You know, I do not think there are all that many organization in the world that would consider needing an 80% vote to do anything. Probably because that would almost inevitably result in nothing of importance ever being done. Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy, but it is should not be a dictatorship subject to the whims of individual administrators either. I think the admins need to get together and make a policy on what exactly constitutes a consensus. Whether that is 50%, or 66%, or 75%, or even 80% is not important as long as there is a consistent standard. The current system allows any admin with a personal agenda on an article up for VfD to track the debate closely and then move in and delcare no consensus when other admins who were impartial would consider that a consensus had been reached. This works the other way too, as an admin could also strongly dislike an article and make sure to move in and delete it with 66% consensus. Sure, there is the undelete procedure or the possibility of nominating the article again, but that just puts us back on the same roller coaster for another ride. Any judicial system needs to be based on consistency and finality. The VfD process as it stands accords neither. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:13, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adding my own two cents, I think that a vote of exactly 2:1 for deletion is not consensus to delete, and I think Mindspillage's decision to merge and redirect, as per RickK's suggestion, was a wise one. The separate article on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marjorie_Pay_Hinckley_5587.html" title="Marjorie Pay Hinckley">Marjorie Pay Hinckley</a> is gone, and some potentially useful information which used to reside there has now been added to another article. If someone feels that information is non-notable, they are free to delete it from the Hinckley article; they can also list the redirect for deletion. Frankly I think the Hinckley article is improved by the addition of the information on his wife. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 23:15, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think 6 votes where several different opinions are presented is really enough to make either a keep or a delete decision. Just one more vote would've swayed the numbers considerably. Merging is a compromise. There's no seperate article about the wife anymore, while info is contained elsewhere and free for editing and discussion by anyone else. Making the decision to merge is a freedom Mindspillage has as (s)he closed the debate. Why is merging so bad even if it wasn't suggested at all? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:26, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Six (and a half) votes is far to few for a real consensus to emerge, and the redirect and merge balances the desire to lose the page with the wish to keep the information. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 10:17, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mindspillage used her common sense. Three cheers for that! Filiocht is exactly right -- the page was deleted, effectively, but the info was kept. A great result.

<p>Once again: how do you infer <i>The result of the debate was merge and redirect.</i> from 1 <b>merge</b>, 2 <b>keeps</b> and 4 <b>deletes</b>. This is a wrong decision and should be recognized as such, what's the big deal with that?

<ul>
<li>It was the wrong decision from your POV, it was a good one from mine. As you say, we are all human, so we are all different. In real life, where consensus is not forthcoming, compromise sometimes has to do. There it is, and one just has to ask onself "In the greater scheme of things, does it really matter?" I just looked out the window here and it appears that the world is still turning, which is maybe an answer of sorts.

<li>If that is the substance of your disagreement, Ejrrjs, I will change the page to say the result was "keep (no consensus)", and add a little note to say that I have merged it. (Technically, the "result" of a VfD leaves the closer at liberty to interpret the comments—which are not strictly votes—according to discretion and good sense.) Which will change absolutely nothing of any consequence, take a minute or two, and slightly inflate my edit count. In fact, I have now done so. Does this settle the matter? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 15:16, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li>My two cents: In my mind, there were only 7 votes -- not enough to effectively judge that there was a consensus to delete.

<ul>
<li>Again, a process comment. Low vote count does not automatically invalidate the discussion and does not automatically indicate a failure to reach concensus. I have closed some at a mere 2:1 including my own opinion. Wikipedia is not an exercise in democracy and we are all encouraged <i>not</i> to vote on everything. If you glance at a VfD discussion and agree with the direction of the decision, you are not expected to chime in with a "me too" vote. In fact, we actively discourage it. A lack of votes <i>may</i> mean that the vote went unnoticed but with all the announcements and with the number of experienced people who actively monitor the full VfD page, it is generally reasonable to assume that silence implied agreement. This has been often discussed at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion</a> and can be found in many of the archive pages.

<dd>I have a process comment as well, though I'm dipping my foot in late in the game. There is a reason why <i>delete</i> is the only action that is admin-only: because deleting a page is a fairly severe and final action (though undeletion is possible by another admin). Only admins (which I'm not) have the knowledge and experience to judge whether an article should truly be deleted, while other editors are free to do any non-delete vote closing. While a VfD isn't strictly a vote, you should still vote because the vote closers read the comments of the voters. I agree with Rossami; a single vote (<i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i>) can mean more than other votes if the comments are valid or mention something that the other voters didn't consider. This can include a single vote by you, Ejrrjs. Yes, consensus is important, but that doesn't necessarily mean vote counting. I remember closing a particular VfD that had many people (including me) voting delete on an article, but the original author requesting a <i>userfy</i>. Since the article itself was valid (but made redundant by a more concise section in another article), I userfied the article. Did I go against consensus? Perhaps. But vote closers are supposed to use their own discretion and judgement along with the votes and comments made in the actual VfD. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:52, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do people think about using this as a {{test}} template for new/anon editors that are making repeated POV edits? I know I've typed it on to a few talk pages recently, it also points out a useful policy that new editors may not be aware of that as far as I know isn't covered on any of the test templates:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia has a strong <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, if you wish to make controversial edits please discuss them on the articles talk page.

<dd>Like {{<a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3RR_aefa.html" title="Template:3RR">3RR</a>}} (I only thought of checking for that after I found myself repeatedly saying things of this kind), this sort of thing has to be used with care. Simple vandalism is easily identified, but why 3RR violations and POV material insertion are not allowed is harder to communicate.</dd>
<dd>This template could be useful for the very clear-cut cases ("George W. Bush is an imperialist mass murderer") that nobody should be expected to get away with, but then again, you can file this under simple vandalism as well, as it's clearly done in bad faith.</dd>

Technically it's not possible to tell when an account was registered, but it is possible to tell when the user last logged in/out, which may be good enough in this case.

<p>A couple of pages on my watchlist were recently vandalized. In addition to fixing the vandalism, I started to check the user's contribution list and reviewed their other edits for vandalism. So far, they have mostly been anonymous IPs with a pattern of returning to commit vandalism every few months. As a notice to future reader/editors doing the same thing, I've started adding a notice on the anon user page saying how far I took my investigation. My hypothesis is that if we can flag where the last investigation ended, the future investigator can start from there and won't have so much rework.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm using a variation of this notice. Is there a better template already out there? If not, can anyone help me improve this wording? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 15:50, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It occasionally happens to me, too, but about half of my deletions go through without problems.

If the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a> request times out (i.e., the servers are so slow that they can't perform the request within some reasonable time, which itself is probably defined by the MediaWiki software or its configuration), the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database_transaction.html" title="Database transaction">transaction</a> is cancelled and you get an error message.

<dd>A wild guess, but databases are often limited by hard disk I/O. On the first try you probably succed in getting most of the needed database structures into RAM cache on the DB server (but the transaction doesn't quite make it in time). On the second try the needed DB structures (or most of it) are already in the RAM cache and the transaction finishes quickly. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 08:13, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I remind people when they delete pages (e.g. from VfD) to <i>please</i> hit "What links here", and check for things that point to the page you're deleting? Redirects to it need to be deleted as well (we've had a flock of redirects to VfD'd entries on RfD recently), and it would be good to check for dangling links in articles as well.

<li>I've suggested that a dangling redirect pointing to a VfD'd article should be valid candidate for speedy deletion over on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_0059.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<ul>
<li>They're <i>already</i> speedyable. The point is that it's a lot more work if the person doing the VfD doesn't do them when they do the page; someone else has to find them, and (probably) list them on RfD to get them deleted. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:09, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>So once again (see, e.g <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#User:SummerFR" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#User:SummerFR</a>) we are having problems with POV-pushers coming in as anons from DHCP pools, which make it a lot of work to deal with them (and there's always the issue that a range block might impact innocents). So here's a suggestion: add another flag to articles which, when set, allows them to be edited only from logged-in accounts. We would set this flag only on articles which are the target of POV-pushers, and they'd be then forced to sign up for an account, which we could block. (Yes, they can sign up for another account, but that's still a certain amount of work, and we already have sock-puppets to deal with.) Yes, yes, I know this is a change to our policy of allowing people to edit without logging in, but it's a minimal change. Also, you can think of it as being a milder form of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_8080.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection">Wikipedia:Protection</a> - and like protecting, we can always clear it after a while, once the problem editor has given up. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

Specifically, the site <a href="http://language.school-explorer.com" class="external free" title="http://language.school-explorer.com" rel="nofollow">http://language.school-explorer.com</a> appears to be using our content as hidden text in java code, so that it shows up in google searches but not on the page.</p>
<p>When the user emailed the site to complain, they responded by trying to blank the Wikipedia article! (See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zuni_language&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zuni_language&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of <a href="../../../z/u/n/Zuni_language.html" title="Zuni language">Zuni language</a>.) Between their blatently abusive use of our content, and their attempt to respond by blanking <i>our</i> article, this is something we should not allow. This is a bit more egregious than your typical non-compliance case, IMO</p>
<p>Also, we need to create a good system for GFDL enforcement.

<p>I might add that this article is listed on my website, stating that it is freeware to be used and not abused with a link to the Wiki article and referencing GDFL and gnu.org, so copyright infringement is a stretch. However, whatever language school explorer is doing is abusive according to GFDL, and is dangerous for intellectual property rights all across the web. I have contacted Google twice in the past week in regard to this issue and they are usually very consciencious taking action towards those spamming the search engines and using hidden text. I think that perhaps a word from Jimbo would carry more weight. It may not be java code. It could be an ROR format where only the robots can find their text pages. That is purely speculation since searches for their ror.xml and articles.xml still bring up the home page (without a 404 error). <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> May 15, 2005, 18:14 CST, I think.

<p>In regard to the comments made above thus far, I would like to summarize: It doesn't matter how school-explorer is doing what they are doing. The point is that Wikipedia articles are freeware but school-explorer is restricting access to the information while using it for self-promotion with profit as an objective. Mirror sites are for profit, they have click-through ads everywhere, but they do not limit access to the information they promote via search or webpage content. School-explorer limits access to the information they advertise to provide and because it is freeware that is this information, they are blantantly non-compliant according to GFDL standards. Freeware is no longer free. It is unethical, maybe criminal, definitely non-compliant, and I cannot emphasize enough the precedent this may set across the web in regard to intellectual property rights if it is allowed to go unchecked. School-explorer could fix the problem by simply putting the text on their pages with the proper references, but have yet to do so. Maybe administrators should deluge Google with complaints expressing these very sentiments. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 01:43, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

Does someone have the contact information for the infringer? If you have the correct legal address and those violation letters have been sent I could probably get a follow up letter from a law firm sent and I'd also be willing to do the legwork to sue on behalf of the Foundation if it came to that. Copyright law says I can sue in my jurisdiction. Costs alone for them to defend a suit like that would mean they would likely fold quickly. Since they are infringing multiple copyrights, they could be sued from every jurisdiction if need be. Filing fees for a small claims lawsuit are about $60, which the Foundation could easily afford. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 20:54, May 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, I'll have to research this more. It may have been wishful thinking that I can sue them here. It's also possible I'd have to sue in district or circuit court, with slightly higher fees, but that's not a big deal. Perhaps someone in the Netherlands can call the below number and/or dig in more to find their real location.

<dd>I wrote jacques at w-e-c.nl . I sent him a copy of the GFDL non-compliance letter, but this letter does not fully address the situation, i.e. using Wiki articles as hidden text, so I had to add a postscript explaining that hidden text is unacceptable (which it is according to Google, et.al.). They may have the correct references on the hidden text, but this is still non-compliant.

<dd>I haven't seen any credits thus far. I think that GFDL complaince means that access to the information cannot be limited. The "text" is not visible while they are using it, and the access is limited. Thus, it is not free. My interpretation is that this is non-complaint. I also wrote to Jimbo about this some time ago. Thus far, I am the only one to suffer and I'm doubting that Wiki really wants to do anything about this and my efforts are futile. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 22:02, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The credits are in the copy that's cached on Google. IANAL, but I'm not sure about your argument about "access to the information cannot be limited .. The "text" is not visible while they are using it". Just because a site has some GFDL content on <i>some</i> pages doesn't mean that the GFDL rules apply to <i>all</i> their pages. GFDL rules probably only apply to pages that have GFDL content. Yes, it's really sneaky that the same URL (seemingly) returns different results depending on who's asking for it, but then again, plenty of sites do this (try looking at a page on a pay site when you don't have an account). I do think Wikipedians care, but it's not clear that we have any legal standing here - I thihk Google are the ones who ought to be really concerned, because if they let this hack stand, soon everyone will be using it. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:28, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to disagree. I think GFDL rules apply for educational resources and information. If you search for Zuni language and follow the school-explorer link there is entirely nothing about Zuni resources or information, nothing is offered in the way of instruction, plus it is a for-profit site. When I joined Wiki I expected to be edited, but I did not expect that the activity by language school would be tolerated.

<dd>Ah. Let me try to put it more directly. There's a good chance that Wikipedia <i>has no legal way to stop them</i>. I am not an intellectual property lawyer, so I can't say for sure, but that's my knowledgeable amateur first take (if in fact they are doing what I have guessed (above) that they are doing). Iff it's true that Wikipedia has no legal recourse with them, you can berate the Wikipedia community all you like, but it can't do what it has no legal grounds to do. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:23, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you can't "pull" any contributions you have already made.

<dd>Well, after what I have seen, I'm willing to take my chances with whatever legal grounds exist. I certainly have nothing more to offer Wiki. Hitting the "save" button is, as you infer, a legal contract. Legal contracts work two ways, at least. If you assert GFDL complaince, it is expected, as is its enforcement. If I expect enforcement when I hit the save button... well, you figure it out.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 01:12, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still don't seem to be clear - let me try this another way. Your comments ("GFDL .. enforcement") seem to indicate a belief that language.school-explorer.com is violating the GFDL. However, if LSE is <b>not</b> in fact violating the GFDL, what exactly do you expect Wikipedia to do, and on what legal grounds? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:54, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are perfectly clear. Maybe I'm not clear. They are in violation. That is clear from my interpretation of the rules. I don't see how they can <b>not</b> be. However, It wouldn't be worth it for Wiki to pursue it on legal grounds. Maybe someone from Wiki with some clout has contacted Google, but I wouldn't know it. That may help. Maybe LSE has permission from WIKI to do it. I wouldn't know that either. One very essential point of the rules is that the text not be changed (don't know that it has, but don't know that it hasn't, it's hidden). Even more essential is the part that use is maintained for informational and educational purposes. If you search for "zuni language", "zuni worldview", or "zuni world view", you get three different descriptions, all verbatim from Wiki, but the source page of LSE has no info on zuni. It is not on their language menu. They don't offer any resources for instruction. There is not one single reference to the language on the supposed "Zuni" page, which is a file in their "/info/" folder. It doesn't take rocket science to see the violation. I'm through here. <i>Finis</i>. I am going to concentrate on persisting with Google. The others will follow if Google takes a position. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 11:10, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>School-explorer has changed their cache page from the article on /Zuni_language to the article on the /Zuni. They do reference Wikipedia on the cache page.

<dd>What he is trying to say is that all images uploaded to the english wikipedia must be under the GFDL. If you want your image to only be licensed under fx a creative commons license you can't upload it here, but can upload it to the commons and have a choice of a free license (I don't know if this is official policy, but that's what is it trying to say). I agree that the current wording can be read the wrong way.</dd>

<p>I know admins are not an elite group, but they do represent a considerable amount of experience and dedication. This is just to inform people that I want Wikipedia to accept a general policy that BC and AD represent a Christian Point of View and should be used only when they are appropriate, that is, in the context of expressing or providing an account of a Christian point of view. In other contexts, I argue that they violate our NPOV policy and we should use BCE and CE instead.

There does seem to be a load-related component to the preview problem (i.e. it's worse when the servers are loaded) but I suspect it's a separate bug, just one that is also more likely when the system is loaded. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:35, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. The thing to do when it happens is to hit preview before trying to submit again. That usually works - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoM_3601.html" title="User:SoM">SoM</a> 20:10, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text for <i>moving</i> a page says, "WARNING! This can be a drastic and unexpected change". Apart from the fact that it isn't nearly that bad (since it leaves a redirect and can be reverted by any experienced user) this warning, among others, is deterring newbies from performing page moves. Would it be a reasonable suggestion to reword it somewhat? I'm trying to educate n00bs in general on moving and merging, since some of them tend to VfD things instead and that doesn't seem right. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 21:09, May 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Moving isn't considered harmful, but it is drastic. On the whole, I'd rather the warning stayed, in my experience new people moving when they shouldn't are more of a problem than them not moving when they should. Making the warning about copy+paste moves twice the size would have my support though. Also, having a move tab for new users and not-logged-ins with an explanation about moving and warning against copy+paste moving would be useful. What's more, it should be doable with only light hackery of the skin files I think? --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 21:15, 2005 May 23 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One thing that may need to be enlarged is the "check for double-redirects" bit. I don't know how many times I've come across a page move (the moving of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time (magazine)</a> comes to mind) and people haven't bothered to fix double redirects. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a>∴<a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 00:16, May 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If a A redirects to B, and B in turn is a redirect to C, you have a double redirect. The problem is that the software only redirects once, so if you go A, then you only get as far as B, not C.

<p><a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a> has taken his deletion principles poll <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_Survey_44dc.html" title="User:Neutrality/Survey">back into his userspace</a> in order to retain editorial control. Since this poll is a private poll which is not editable by the community (at Neutrality's behest), I think that advertising it prominently on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> is inappropriate. I therefore request that it be replaced on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> by some other <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_surveys_7ea5.html" title="Wikipedia:Current surveys">survey</a> or simply deleted. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_68a5.html" title="User:Lupin">Lupin</a> 03:48, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I second Lupin's request. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a> had been asked to userfy his private "Deletion principals poll" because it was his own private poll, being conducted contrary to the overwhelming consensus of the community. (See Straw poll regarding Deletion principles poll.) He did, but left <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> pointing at the Wikipedia:Schools/Deletion principles poll, where there was a redirect to his user space. When the redirect was replaced with a note warning people that they were leaving Wikispace and entering <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a>'s individual userspace, and a link to actually go to Neutrality's poll in his user space, Neutrality edited <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> Surveys section to go directly to his user page. I believe that both of Neutrality's actions have the effect of disguising the fact that the poll resides on his user page, and not in Wiki space. This is misleading, and therefore, especially inappropriate. I make the same request that <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_68a5.html" title="User:Lupin">User:Lupin</a> did above; remove the improper reference to this poll from the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> page.

<p>As an experiment, I've created <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> ("<a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>") as an attempt at a slimmed-down version of <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EViP_a50a.html" title="WP:ViP">WP:ViP</a> for getting quick administrator intervention against vandals. The problem that caused me try this is that on the whole, administrators rarely read <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>, and it regularly grows so large that it's a major hassle to add things to. I hope that with a simple, archive-cruft free page the reporting of vandals and the handling of those reports will be easier for both reporters and vandals. Admins: Please add <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> to your watchlist and check it regularly. I think that with a simple interface, and given that we have nearly 500 administrators, we should be able to get the latency between reporting of vandals and blocking (when necessary) down to 10-15 minutes, which would be a huge improvement over the current state of affairs. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

<li>Shouldn't we add at least some info on what the vandal did? Finding the offending edit may otherwise be quite hard. Not as wordy as VIP. A few words should suffice.

<p>I don't think this is quite in the remit of an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RfC</a> yet, but I have noticed a user <i>(I use the term as there don't seem to be (m)any article edits as opposed to lots of talk page edits)</i> making comments and then some minutes later deleting those comments. They have not replied to myself or others on their talk page, indeed they requested their talk page to be deleted. Sometimes the added/deleted edit is a fair comment to the discussion, many times it is not, including occasions where another editor has replied to their comment after which they have deleted that leaving the follow-on comment without a context. I haven't reverted (ie re-inserted) these edits as yet but would seek comments from others first ... --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 11:16, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ok. so your/this user's intent is to "withdraw from wikipedia"a dn is removing all still-visible comments and attributions. In many ways this is why I was trying to keep this in the non-identifiable realm in that posing the question "Is a 'live' talk page mandatory for becoming a registered user?". In this particular case, of course, the removal of what is visible does not remove any of the comments nor attributions from the database and all can easily be located from the history of those pages, indeed it could be argued that <i>removing</i> them actually makes them more obvious as there will be two edits in the history not the one. Generally speaking though, it must be inherently wrong in the nature of a collaborative effort to subsequently remove ones comments and input, especially where someone else has responded to those comments or input. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 09:23, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reverted where the user removed votes he had cast on matters that have already been closed (VfDs, for example). I left a note on his talk page and suggested that in those cases, he replace his signature in the vote with [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RightToVanish This user has vanished], but leave the date and time stamp intact. I agree that the extra edits call more attention to his disappearance, but remember that this applies only on Wikipedia. Our content, often including user and talk pages, is mirrored by a large number of websites. Removing his signature will create a higher profile here on Wikipedia, but greatly reduce the overall profile. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 10:22, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Deleting comments and signatures can affect the readability of surrounding discussion. Anyone has the right to remove their email address from WIkipedia and their userpage in case they want to leave, but comments - once made - should remain to protect the validity of the discussion they were posted in. If everyone does this, some discussions just really wouldn't make sense anymore. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:42, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. I'd say comments already made on talk pages are not part of RightToVanish.

<p>Seeing as this glorious compendium is rapidly becoming a standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom, it seems that the ability to access it easily from any connected browser would be te most vastly useful contribution to society since the towel. For the most part the current site does the job, but what if you're on a Treo or WiFi enabled PDA? These are the hoopiest gadgets since the digital watch, and using them to access a PDA browser optimized Wikipedia would make them the closest thing to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy since, well, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! Any chance of the collective Wikipedia community being a squeaky enough wheel in the MediaWiki dev group to make this happen? I should think there's some crossover in the dev community between these two projects...</p>
<p>For that matter, I also feel that it would be only appropriate to post the words "Don't Panic" in large friendly letters on the splash page of this site, but that's another matter... Ganjuror 23:46, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, and my wife was just commenting on how writing for WP sounded a lot like writing for HHGG. Perhaps all that's really needed here is a minimal stylesheet that would suppress most of the links on the left in the standard stylesheet.

<p>I sometimes browse Wikipedia (and occasionally edit it) on my wireless-enabled <a href="../../../i/p/a/IPaq_ac2f.html" title="IPaq">iPaq</a> and find all but a few pages render adequately on my 480x640 screen (those that don't are the very graphic-intensive ones, which cause memory corruptions in Internet Explorer). For non-wireless PDAs, or for those with smaller screens, there is a downloadable version of Wikipedia in TomeRaider format, available at <a href="../../../t/o/m/Wikipedia%7ETomeRaider_database_7a82.html" title="Wikipedia:TomeRaider database">Wikipedia:TomeRaider database</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/TomeRaider_d915.html" title="TomeRaider">TomeRaider</a> isn't free software, but there is a crippled version available.
