<p>I do have to say that he is a knowledgable editor and has dedication. However, we have been having some issues lately. This would be an ordinary content dispute; however, SPUI has been uncivil (reverting with no discussion of templates, edit summaries, and various comments to users using profanity and references to body parts). Also, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war_dc02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war</a> has placed him on probation, I believe.</p>

<p>Really, this is two disputes here: regarding infoboxes and naming.

<dd>My understanding is that his probation applies to disruption and provocation, not colorful language. I wish SPUI would be more civil; I think we all do.

<dd>Maybe not even the arbcom thought a civility/NPA based remedy was a workable proposition...&#160;:/ Looks to me at first sight like a content dispute bordering on revert-warring, but then again there's no specific provision about that either.

<dl>
<dd>To clarify: 1) Neither civility nor edit warring were brought before us, and the case dealt with SPUI in a very limited way. The ruling is not at all a tacit approval of his other behaviors. 2) Under probation, he may be banned for disruption <i>of any kind</i>, at the discretion of an administrator. This can very plausibly include either incivility or edit warring, if an administrator deems him to be acting disruptively in that regard. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was in no way suggesting there was any "tacit approval". To clarify myself: my judgement is that his edit-warring and incivility is <i>not</i> particularly disruptive in these cases. But that's a sufficiently open-ended criterion that others must equally decide that for themselves. (Now, his signature I consider pretty WP:POINT-laden, but I don't think I'm entirely uninvolved or neutral on that, so won't be taking any action on it myself.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:24, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was no consensus to delete or remove the infobox, so SPUI worked on it. The consensus was for improvements as opposed to deletion. I'm not endorsing his particular improvements--I don't really care. But this is absolutely <i>not</i> a situation for admin intervention--you need to work this out with him and with other concerned editors. I'm sure if you found a way to include SPUI's visual improvements without losing any information that everyone would be fine with that. Look, this is a perfectly banal editing dispute; it has nothing to do with the arbcom ruling regarding SPUI, and you are asked to please stop bothering administrators about a non-administrative issue. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 03:12, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Editors have been banned for threatening to contact employers in the past, though, and I think contacting academic superiors falls along the same lines. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 18:00, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This behaviour is increasingly distressing. As I cannot find any edits of Colignatus' that are not either self promotion or personal attacks, despite several warnings, I've blocked him indefinitely. If he is able to demonstrate to me or any other admin that he will not engage in this behaviour further, he may be unblocked, but if the behaviour <i>does</i> continue after being unblocked, then I expect that he will be blocked again.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:48, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
Geachte heer Koot,

Ik zag dat u een block signaal op mijn user page heeft gezet.
Wonderlijk dat zoiets kan.

Maar, u studeert wiskunde aan de univ. van Utrecht. 

Twee punten dan:

(a) Wanneer u Richard Gill kent, moet u maar eens naar mij vragen.

(b) Wellicht wilt u mijn concept brief aan de hoogleraren van MIT en SIMS lezen, die ik
nu in arre moede op mijn talk page heb geplaatst. Wanneer Rspeer en anderen niet zo vol
onbegrip waren en mij wat tijd hadden gegund, dan had dit allemaal niet hoeven gebeuren. 

Met vriendelijke groet,

Thomas Cool / Thomas Colignatus

<p>I have just closed an AFD but subsequently discovered some irregularities. I've not had any sleep for quite a few hours more than is healthy, and I'm a new admin, so I'd appreciate some advice.

<dd>Hmm, I'm kind of torn as well. I think my suggestion is bring it to AfD, and link the previous afds. The article itself is close enough imo to the deleted versions that it *could* be speedied and protected and have the earth salted. That being said, a casual google search showed a washington post article from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000232.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000232.html" rel="nofollow">2005 12 10</a> exists that mentions him. I didn't look up the previous afds, though...so I don't know if stuff like that was already considered and discounted.</dd>

<dd>It looks like <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> deleted it again (having reviewed my synopsis), but the articles have been recreated <i>yet again</i> over night (rolls eyes).

I think this is <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a>'s way of retaliating against the Iranians who are in an edit war against <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a> on the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a> page.

This kid has been at it for months - reappearing every couple of weeks to post articles about a movie that he fantasizes he's directing and producing, with all his favorite Hollywood actors in it. That seems to be the beginning and end of what he has to contribute, and his repeated creation of deleted material is disruptive. I'm reluctant to just throw a long block at him, because he seems to have stopped for now, but I'm reluctant to do nothing, because Wikipedia isn't a playground, but a short block seems pointless.

<dd>Tawkerbot2 thought pages were being blanked because that's exactly what Wikipedia was showing.

When he was reverted, he reverted back. He took advantage of the fact that we didn't want to report a newcomer for 3RR violations, and kept on reverting, despite pleas and warnings. Once he even reverted 11 times in eighteen and a half hours, even though he was perfectly aware of the rule. His practice was to post a defence of his edit on the talk page, then to reinsert his edit, with "see talk page" in the edit summary, despite the objections of many other editors.</p>
<p>He was joined by a brand new editor, <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong"><tt class="userlinks">BelindaGong</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/e/l/User_talk%7EBelindaGong_f84e.html" title="User talk:BelindaGong">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BelindaGong_2da5.html" title="Special:Contributions/BelindaGong">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">logs</font></a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_BelindaGong_2adb.html" title="Special:Blockip/BelindaGong">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a></span>), who immediately started reverting to his versions, and arguing in favour of his edits on the talk pages. She followed him to other pages, and voted for whatever he voted for.

All four editors violated 3RR greatly over and above a possible accidental slip into four reverts. They were not reported at first as they were new. When they continued to revert after repeated warnings, they were reported. All four have been blocked, Giovanni, most frequently.</p>
<p>A checkuser found no evidence of sockpuppetry with MikaM and Kecik, although we still suspect there is a connection, even if they have different IP addresses, as they seem to have no purpose on Wikipedia other than to revert to Giovanni's version, and to give an appearance of consensus for his version on talk pages. In particular, MikaM uses the same language style. The checkuser established that Giovanni33 = BelindaGong. They were both blocked for 24 hours, as they had taken more than three reverts betwen them. The block was later increased to 48 hours. Giovanni later claimed that Belinda was his wife, "and therefore not a sockpuppet", even though they had <i>actively</i> pretended (in their messages to each other) not to know each other.</p>
<p>While Giovanni was "serving his block", another "brand new" user, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99"><tt class="userlinks">Freethinker99</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreethinker99_5091.html" title="User talk:Freethinker99">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freethinker99_e0a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freethinker99">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">logs</font></a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Freethinker99_0baf.html" title="Special:Blockip/Freethinker99">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a></span>) appeared. He came straight to the Christianity talk page, said he was new, but had read the talk page and agreed with Giovanni. He then reverted to Giovanni's version. Then Giovanni answered a question which had been posted to his talk page, forgetting that he was logged on as Freethinker.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> He changed it immediately,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giovanni33&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> but it was too late, as we had already seen it. He then claimed that he just happened to be at Freethinker's house, and was showing him how to edit Wikipedia, and that Freethinker had allowed him to answer a question on his talk page, from Freethinker's computer. The "Freethinker99" account was blocked, though not indefinitely. (The "BelindaGong" account was also not blocked indefinitely.)</p>
<p>This evening, yet another "brand new" editor, <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERTS_b316.html" title="User:RTS"><tt class="userlinks">RTS</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../r/t/s/User_talk%7ERTS_9737.html" title="User talk:RTS">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RTS_4276.html" title="Special:Contributions/RTS">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">logs</font></a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_RTS_3588.html" title="Special:Blockip/RTS">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a></span>) appeared on the Christianity page, and reverted to something which Giovanni had inserted, without consensus, on Tuesday, and which had been reverted by another user. (This was his third edit; his first two were to his user and talk pages.) He then, in Giovanni's style, defended it on the talk page, and reverted back, again, and again, and again. I warned him, before he had gone over the three reverts, although I was convinced he was a sockpuppet and didn't need to be told of the rules. I warned him again, rather than reporting him, <i>after</i> he had violated 3RR. I explained the rules fully, e.g. about partial reverts, etc. He just kept on reverting, in the style of Giovanni/Belinda. When he had reached seven reverts, I made a hasty report to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, without diffs, as I was going to dinner. He was blocked by another administrator for 3 hours, just to stop him for the moment; that gave me time to gather the evidence for the diffs, which I did.</p>
<p>Then, just as I was beginning to relax, <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENPOV77_69f0.html" title="User:NPOV77"><tt class="userlinks">NPOV77</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../n/p/o/User_talk%7ENPOV77_49e6.html" title="User talk:NPOV77">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NPOV77_2d33.html" title="Special:Contributions/NPOV77">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">logs</font></a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_NPOV77_ee04.html" title="Special:Blockip/NPOV77">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a></span>) reverted to RTS's (Giovanni's) version. I looked at his contributions, and saw that he also started today, and that this revert was his third edit, the first two being to his user and talk pages. I immediately blocked indefinitely as a sockpuppet. I had refrained from blocking BelindaGong, Freethinker99, and RTS when they arrived, because I was involved in that article, even though there was every indication of sockpuppetry. However, I know that admins do block <i>obvious</i> sockpuppets to pages they edit themselves — I've seen it happening for example with AD/CE wars — and there are just too many "brand new" users who appear, revert to Giovanni's version, argue for his version on the talk page, and otherwise show familiarity with Wikipedia. This is the first time I've ever blocked anyone from an article I was involved with, other than pure vandals, and if an admin undoes my block, I will accept that, and will not in anyway consider it to be "wheelwarring". My block was just a quick reaction to the beginning of another war.</p>
<p>I'd like some feedback, advice, and if possible, some active intervention. If I was wrong to block NPOV77, I will accept that meekly! I don't actually approve of IAR, but am not sure to what extent the "don't-block-someone-you're-in-dispute-with" policy applies when, <i><b>yet again</b></i> an obvious sockpuppet turns up after another one has been blocked. I think my quick reaction was partly a result of all the trouble I've had simply because I <i><b>didn't</b></i> block Belinda, Freethinker, and RTS on sight. If other admins say I was wrong, I promise I won't get belligerent. And I won't wheelwar.

<dd>Ann, I've semi-protected the page in case any others turn up. I'd say you were right to block given how obvious the sockpuppetry was.

<p>My (non-admin) opinion: Let's suppose for the sake of argument that all of these new users, as well as Giovanni, are telling the truth and are not sockpuppets <small>which is utter bullshit, but bear with me for a second</small>. By their own words, they are nevertheless clearly in the related category of <i>meatpuppets</i> and can thus be treated exactly like socks.

<p>Another (albeit non-admin) opinion: I think you were certainly in the right here.

<dd>The way I look at it, the blocks can come from the "involved" admin because, essentially, they are not blocks of new instance. If, let's say, some child were to set up 3 accounts and vote for himself/herself/itself on FAC and get blocked for that, then, when that child set up five new accounts to evade the blocks, they could each be blocked indefinitely. They're not being blocked indefinitely for new offenses, but for not serving out the original offense. Some people never figure it out.

<dd>This user was banned from Wikipedai by MusicalLinguist afte he made a single edit supporting my version after I was blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NPOV77" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NPOV77" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NPOV77</a> on the basis of being accussed of being a socketpuppet. When I saw him, I was sure he would be accused of being my socketpuppet, but I was suprised he was blocked right away without a user check (so much for assusming good faith). But what really suprised me was that not only was he accused of being a socketpuppet, not only was he blocked indefinitely, but he was NOT accused of being MY socketpuppet! Guess who got blamed? Giovanni33!! They must really hate Giovanni33 to keep smearing his name like this. I guess they go after him since he has been their biggest ideological threat to the dominated Christian POV. I also noticed that my version that he supported was NOT Giovanni33's version. It's interesting that they can ignore this fact, go way in the past to dig up Giovani's history looking for dirt (repeating their version of events), in order to try to paint Giovanni33 in this negative manner, and using this as a pretext to attack others who do not toe the Christian line. About attacking Giovanni33--it's the repetition propaganda effect: keep repeating something over and over at every chance you get, and sooner or later enough people will start to believe it. Even if they really believed that NPOV77 was Giovanni33 (but not me?), I still don't see how that justified the blocked to say nothing of being banned. Is Giovanni33 currently being blocked for some reason what would mean any socketpuppet of his would likewise be blocked? Or is the problem here just one of Giovanni33 not being a Christian editor, and any editor who agrees with him must be done away with? This seems to me to be a major violation of Wiki rules and a major problem with this article. <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERTS_b316.html" title="User:RTS">RTS</a> 16:45, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you'll check the history, you'll see that Giovanni33 <i>has</i> used sockpuppets relatively recently. I am not an administrator and don't have blocking powers, but if the administrators blocked you and/or NPOV77, they had good reason. It has nothing to do with attacking anyone and everything to do with the fact that Wikipedia policy has been violated in the past and has resulted in the complete disruption of this article. Gio's POV has never been an issue...what <i>has</i> been an issue has been his reverts to versions with little or no consensus and the utilization of sockpuppets in attempts to get around <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.

To my surprise, I see some similar nonsense going on in my absense. Well maybe it isn't nonsense given that it looks like my wikibreak/absense was seen as an opportunity to attack me while I was gone. How nice! I have not had enough time to see what has been goin on yet, but what I do see, I don't like. Its rather pathetic really. KMH03, why are you pushing these old lies? I don't have any socketpuppets! That is really old news, too. I won't repeat myself, again, nor should I have to, as this is rather old. Its interesting that no one wants to take me up on my offer to prove that BelindaGong is not me. I guess those who keep pushing these lies prefer to keep up the hoax so as to speculate and continue with the attempts to discredit me. I am sad to see that new users are still being attacked as well. Ill have to do some reading to see what is going on, but I was really hoping these nonsesne personal attacks against me would have stopped by now, as they did seem to calm down.

<dd>I see that Tom harison is involved in the accusations, against me, too, this time. And, ofcourse MusicalLinguist plastered the same socketpuppet allegations against me with all her characterizations as she usually does again. No suprise, there. Now I will have to track all this down and respond, as usual. Will it ever stop? Tom, I don't know if you really believe what you claim to believe, or you are just jumping on the bandwaggon intiated by MusicalLinguist, but you are wrong. I was away and am just now am coming back to read what amounts to more personal attacks against me.</dd>
<dd>Why do you think this user is connected to me? I looked at the history of the Christianity article and my edits and his are very different. Granted, IMHO his edits are much better than what stands now (which is just back to what it was before any of my changes--all my contributions have been stripped away, it seems--and without consensus), but his edits are missing many things that I incorporated. Also, the language is different, my quotes are removed, etc. It seems to be more refined and trimmed down. Acceptable but not what I wanted. Still, just because an editor happens not to follow a traditional Christian POV, is that reason to block him, bann him, and then accuse him of being connected to me? I'd really like to see an honest explanation for this. What really puzzles me is what did he do to get banned? And by MusicalLinguist, no less? This seems a rather serious violation of standard procedure. I would like to see the theory behind this course of action.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 08:22, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw that with RTS--3RR vio (funny name, don't you think STR?). But, NPOV77? He appears to be banned outright by your dearest friend MusicalLinguist, and yet, I do not see the reason for that. Certainly no 3RR that I can see. Am I wrong, or do you misspeak? Also, I still don't see what any of this has to do with Belinda or me.

<dd>Yes, I was wondering about the name.

<dd>No, I did not see you attacking me but clearly MusicalLinguist, Tom Harrision, and KM03 have all attacked me. Using someone in the context of a bad example is an attack. If you disagree, think about me going around and picking on something that you did once (maybe gave a wrong fact, something that makes you look bad), and then kept bringing it up as a negative example of what Str1977 did, explaining in detail all about YOU when the issue is something that has no connection to you. This is what others are doing with me still despite my protests.

<dd>Oh, so my name is being dragged through the mud once again just because I made a good example? How considerate--even though I have asked that this stop as I consider it a form of a personal attack on my reputation. Also, your excuse that I'm only being used as an example is not quite true. Clearly, I see you and others either allude indirectly or directly that I am connected with the violatating editor. This is not harmless speculation, either. Its an underhanded attack. Lastly, you are stating things as a fact, which I know is not true. You said, "Giovanni33 <i>has</i> used sockpuppets relatively recently." This is a lie. My wife, who shares my IP address used her own account, and she is not a socketpuppet. You may think that I am lying, but I've offered to prove otherwise, and yet no one wants this verified. Why? So you can keep repeating the lies under the cover of ignorance and the appearance of socketpuppetry that you can keep stating as a fact, even if only to use my name as an example?

<dd>Nice try to wiggle out of what is happening. RTS is bringing up his suprise that user NPOV77 who favored his version was banned and accused of being me--not him. Then you state as facts your opinion about my past socketpuppets, even though it has nothing to do with this situation. So you are in effect defending the use of my name, these past incidents, and then characterizing it as a fact, instead of saying something to the effect, "yes, its terrible that Giovanni33 is still being blamed for things based on speculation and other users, when he has been a very good editor, making lots of useful contributions, and its not fair to him to keep using his mistakes when he first started as a club to beat him with.' That would have been the right way to respond. What you did was pick up the club to take some swings yourself. Thanks! Also, again, you do not tell the truth: the version that RTS and then NPOV reverted to was NOT my version, not my POV. They are different. But, I know its essential to link me to them in order to justify the attacks against me, but even this connection is not justified. But, also its wrong: any new user who does not adopt a traditional, conservative Christian POV will be essentially driven away. This harms the article and Wikipeaida.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as I wake up much too early, and I come across this talk page..... I have to say that I saw a clear abuse of administrator power. First off, NPOV77's first edit was <b>not</b> a revert, it was work on his/her user page. The first page edit was indeed a revert, which is discussed often on pages, and it is possible that the person had read it, having looked at Wikipedia for a long time before ever actually contributing. This revert was on March 5th, and the only revert by that person. Str made a revert, then Musical Linguist did, then Str did again (RTS had been adding in information that Str has been trying to remove.....) then Musical Linguist did again, then Tom Harrison made a revert, then RTS made a revert, then Musical Linguist made her third revert (accusing RTS of making 6 reverts, which I shall look into, but it seems that he was putting different text in and not actually reverting to an older copy) then RTS reverts again, then Str reverts for a third time, and then RTS reverts for what I believe to be the third time, and Tom Harrison reverts for the third time in a day, and then NPOV77 comes in and reverts, followed by Latinus reverting...... who seems to be clearly not a sockpuppet, having well over 100 edits.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So we know that if NPOV77 is a sock puppet, it is to RTS, not Giovanni. If it were Giovanni's sock puppet, the revert wouldn't be against the rules at all. Indeed, It was at 15:44, March 5, 2006 that NPOV77 created their user page and at 15:47 that the revert was made, which does look very fishy, but possible innocence. Str reverted last at 13:53, and Tom Harrison reverted at 14:36.... This would be a 1hr8min break between this revert and the last, 1hr5min between when NPOV's account was likely created and this incident. So how fast does RTS respond? He reverted within 2 minutes of Tom, 2 minutes of Musical Linguist, and 4 minutes of Str. Such a long delay all of a sudden makes it hard to place the behavioral pattern on NPOV77, though I can certainly see a possibility with RTS being a pun on Str1977 as with the 77 repeating itself.</dd>

<dd>To the best of my knowledge, these precautions were not undertaken by MusicalLinguist, which makes it a very bad idea to ban an editor which may or may not be a sockpuppet. As an administrator, it would be very easy to have a checkuser see if the accounts were related. It is not illegal for a new user to have done that, even if they did know a lot. For all you know, it could have been a perfectly legitimate use of a sockpuppet by me, because you didn't check to see if the accounts were related to RTS or to me.</dd>

<dd>Sorry to contradict you, Tom, but assuming that NPOV77 = RTS, it wasn't that person's fourth revert, it was the ninth revert. RTS reverted eight times, and as soon as he was blocked, the brand-new user NPOV77 appeared and reverted to his last revert. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Was there a user check that confirmed they were the same person? My understanding was that no such user check was done as MusicalLinguist simply blocked that person indefinitely solely based on the fact that they supported the same version of the blocked person. Maybe he was a socket of the blocked person, but how can she assume the worst and then take this drastic against against the person based on making one revert? This seems descriminatory. For instance, if any new user reverted to her version after she just reverted 3 times, would she instantly bann the new user who just reverted to her version and then accuse herself of creating a socketpuppet to evade the 3RR rule? Ofcourse not. Also, I'm still not very happy that this is being used to attack ALL editors who do not adhere to the traditional Christian POV. I see that MusicalLinguist has copied and pasted the usual attacks against all editors. At least this time she removed reference to Sophia and TheShriek, but its not fair to all the other editors, including myself.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:21, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to clarify my position, because it may be a bit muddled... I believe that RTS <i>probably</i> did make NPOV77 as a sock puppet, but it is not certain, and at most a very temporary block pending on a checkuser IP check should have been in place. Simply blocking the user with only conjecture (even hearsay is absent) and not immediately taking the proper steps to make sure it isn't a mistake is something that could have the effect of preventing a NPOV view in the article, and perhaps in many other articles the user may have contributed to in the future. Certainly, I have seen a false accusation of RTS reverting, when he was putting up revised versions of new text that others simply reverted, based upon the stated objections of the reverters. It seems that there is a bit of a bias on the part of MusicalLyricist that needs special attention when she uses her administrative power in regards to the article.</dd>

<p>A couple of points:</p>
<p>To Giovanni33:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would I ban a new user who reverted to my version? I'm not sure what you mean by <i>my</i> version. I don't have a particular version. I have contributed very little new material to the article. Most of my edits have been grammatical, etc. or reverting a new, controversial edit which had been inserted without consensus. I have never <i>inserted</i> a pile of new stuff and insisted that it stay up despite the objections of others. You are the one who has been inserting entire paragraphs of new material, often inaccurate (Galileo was tortured, St Thomas Aquinas's teaching on transubstantiation was based on older, pagan religions with cannibalism), highly POV (despite Cyril's possible involvement in Hypatia's murder, he was later proclaimed a saint by the Catholic Church), and unproven but asserted (by you) as fact (Christianity grew out of "mystery religions"), plus efforts to link the evil deeds of nominal or lapsed Christians with Christianity itself (Hitler, etc.). So, no, I don't have "my own" version. I haven't taken large chunks of pro- or anti-Christian books and inserted their content into the articles. I have collaborated with the other editor, made suggestions, and done relatively little editing.</li>
<li>There were no newly-created (same month as the dispute) accounts that showed up to agree with Str1977, KHM03, Wesley, Tom harisson, me, and many others, or to revert to what you call "my" version, though, as I've said, I don't have my own version. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>The question is hypothetical, and you skirted it. But the point still stands and the answer to the rhetorical question is obvious: no, you would not ban a user who was new and reverted to your version. And, ofcourse you have a version--the one that Str1977 has. You will always revert to what he reverts to, and vote for what he votes for, etc. You even joked before that he and you are meatpuppets on his talk page once. The example you give of taking action against a user who inserts "true faith," constantly is not comparable to this situation because one is obviously a clear case of NPOV violation, which can be treated and vandalism, while the other is a legitimate content dispute that was split among editors, and it was a dispute that you were involved with. Yes, you banned outright, without even a warning indefnitely for making one revert. And he is still banned. Did you even bother to check if the IP you blocked forever is not a public IP address that will also affect others? The action is not one of an "obvious" socketpuppet. At most its a probable one, but that is just speculation, a guess. One must err on the side of caution and assume good faith when there are any room for doubt. In this case there is. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I knew that the question was hypothetical, and I did not skirt it. I pointed out that it has not happened that a newly-registered user reverted your edits. Str1977 and I do not "always" revert to each other and vote for what the other votes for. He edits many pages that I don't go near. (I know, as I sometimes look at his contributions to see if he's on line, particularly if I've recently sent him a message.) And he votes on those pages, generally to do with history. I vote on lots of Wikipedia project pages, and a few article talk pages that he doesn't go near. So despite my little joke on his talk page (which was actually saying that I realized from some of his recent edits that he was <i>not</i> my sockpuppet), nobody who looked at our contributions could say that my purpose on Wikipedia is to ensure that he gets what he wants, through helping out with votes and reverts, or that his purpose on Wikipedia is to ensure that <i>I</i> get what I want. We share the same POV on Christianity-related articles. We both edit <i>many</i> articles that have nothing to do with Christianity, and we generally don't even meet each other on such articles. A look at BelindaGong's contributions or Freethinker99's, and those of the <i>suspected</i> sockpuppets, show that their purpose on Wikipedia was to revert to what you wanted and to vote for what you wanted.</dd>

<dd>Concerning your point about the public IP address, you don't need to worry. I didn't block the IP address indefinitely. I blocked the account indefinitely (and immediately reported it here so that any administrator who disagreed could review and if necessary undo the block). <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The examples you cite about my editing are cherry-picking from all the articles where I've made hundreds of edits and these examples are not representative, nor even relevant here. Also, your characterizations of even these select handful of edits are not even accurate, if if you keep repeating them, and I have to keep correcting you (it does get boring). For examples my clear stance is that Galileo was threatenend with torture, shown the torture intruments that would be used unless he renounced himself and his work. I quoted a scholar who felt that his abuse, humiliation, house arrest, and overall treatment amounted to tourture--this was an attribution, not my own POV. When this wasnt clear I changed it myself. Where I was wrong, I quickly correct myself. Yet, you omit this fact and try to collect examples where I might have made a mistake and repeat that over and over. Clearly you are trying to bias others against me. I don't appreciate that. Similarly, my clear stance is that Christiaity may have been influenced by mystery cults. Regarding the Hitler article, when I arrived it never mentioned his religion at all--yet all other leaders, such as JFK, etc. their religion is mentioned. I found this ommission odd. It's POV to suppress a well established fact, that he was a life-long professed Christian. This is not an example of tryingn to link evil deeds with Christianity. That is your characterization. From my stance its about being honest, even if if it might offend the sensitivities of some Christians. Also, I never take large chunks of any books and put them in articles. The only time I take large chucks of anything is to quote them in arguments on the talk page to provide support for my claims. I use the talk pages more than the main articles because I believe in working with others and in the power of reason and argument, and NPOV. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact is, Giovanni, that you <i>did</i> insert into the article that Galileo was tortured, not that he was shown the instruments of torture. To say that you corrected it because it was unclear was misleading. You were reverted by another editor, and at least two editors told you that you had got your facts wrong. Regarding Hitler, you have on many occasions tried to insert things about Christian dictators, Christians carrying out massacres, as part of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a> article, (especially at end of January), even though it was repeatedly pointed out that the article was not called "Criticism of Christians", and the that stuff didn't belong there, especially when it was a question of nominal Christians, lapsed Christians, etc., unless you could show that it was Christianity that made Hitler etc. carry out their atrocities. Regarding the large chunks of books, I don't mean that you insert them verbatim, but you do rely very heavily on anti-Christian literature, take what it says at face value (even inaccuracies about Galileo being tortured), and insert large sections into articles based on what you have found in those books. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am not attacking any editor. I am stating the verified fact that you reverted way over the three-per-day limit when you were new; that we were kind and didn't report you for several of these violations but instead patiently explained the rules and begged you to stop; that we reported you when you continued and continued and continued in full awareness of the rules; that BelindaGong appeared on Wikipedia as a new user and immediately reverted to your version, started voting for whatever you voted for, defending your version on talk pages, and going massively over the 3RR despite our initial indulgence, explanations, and pleadings; that you both pretended not to know each other, although you were asked many times; that MikaM and Kecik appeared as new users and started reverting to your version and following you to different pages to revert for you and vote for whatever you wanted; that a checkuser established a link between you and Belinda; that when you were both blocked, Freethinker registered, said he was new but agreed with you, immediately reverted to your version (several times), then accidentally answered a question in your name while logged on as you, then claimed that he did, after all, know you and that you were at his place and he had allowed you to use his computer; that RTS appeared as a brand-new user and reverted (including partial reverts) <i>eight</i> times, most of which reverts were to material that you had inserted last week, even if partially modified; that I sent him some messages explaining the rules rather than reporing him immediately; that as soon as he was blocked, another newly-registered account (NPOV77) appeared and reverted to his last revert. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe you don't think it's attacking me but I do, as I've stated many times. To contstantly bring up a negative account of what I may have done when I was new, even though I have stopped, and even when there is no connection to me, has the same effect as a personal attack and is harassing in nature. This is esp. true when its only your characterization of these events, colored by your bias and interpreation of the facts that you know I disagree with. Its really boring me for me have to keep defending myself, stating my version of these events, esp. when they are not relevant to anything that is happening now. I ask that you get over this obsession with my past, my wife, and my friend who I introduced here. I tire of these arguments that I see as petty and uninteresting. I'd much rather spend my time on the bussiness at hand" making the best encylopedia in history. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid, Giovanni, that your earlier behaviour means that when new users turn up and revert to your version or vote for your preference, they will be suspected of being your sockpuppets or your meatpuppets. We weren't impressed when you said that Belinda was your wife, after the sockcheck results came through, and after you had pretended all along not to know her. Nor were we impressed when your friend (if he is a separate person) showed up and made his first article edit a revert to your version while you were blocked for edit-warring sockpuppetry. It's not an account of what you "may" have done: it's an account of what you did. And you did continue to violate 3RR, after your first block, even without sockpuppets. Str1977 and I very kindly said that we wouldn't report you (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=40689850&amp;oldid=40685315" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=40689850&amp;oldid=40685315" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40854406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Georg_Elser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=40854406" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). As for my obsession with your past, your wife, and your friend, most of my posting to Wikipeida have absolutely nothing to do with your history of edit warring. I don't bring it up except in response to the arrival of new suspected sockpuppets. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>A negative checkuser does not prove that someone is not a sockpuppet, as a single user can have access to different IP addresses. Other evidence can be used, such as your little slip up in forgetting to log off as Freethinker99, or (as in a case I remember) a user telling another user to look at his personal website, and giving the URL, then doing the same thing with another user under another name several months later, or excessive interest in the same articles combined with similarity of editing style. I don't actually expect that a checkuser would find a link between the two latest sockpuppets and you, as it seems you were away at the weekend (you've even said that), so you could have had access to an IP address that you had never used before. People who start reverting and voting as soon as they sign up are more likely to be accused of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have never accused SOPHIA of sockpuppetry. It is true that her POV is much closer to yours than to mine, but I do <i>not</i> suspect people of sockpuppetry simply because they don't share the Christian POV. SOPHIA's behaviour has been completely different from yours from the start. Her husband, TheShriek, was checked because he was one of SEVERAL new users who agreed with you and voted with you. Since one of those users was found to be a sockpuppet, the checkuser request was clearly justified, and we had no way of knowing beforehand which ones we should include and which ones we should exclude. I am fully satisfied that TheShriek is not a sockpuppet, and even deleted and partially restored his user page so that the sockpuppet accusation would not appear in the history of it. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The truth is that anyone who was not a Christian at the Christianity is given greater scrutiny; a usercheck is only one element, and that is why Sophia's husband was check out--even though he never did any reverting. All he did was stated his POV which clearly identified him as not being a fellow Christian--hence he was also targed with special interest. That is why Sophia was right to be indignant and left in protest. I'm glad she is back. You will also remember that earlier Sophia also stated that she felt ganged up on and bullied. This is also an accurate assessment of the objective atmosphere that exists for those who disagree with the dominant Christian POV. What I see that is that there is a clear tendency to be extra nice and friendly--to become friends--with those who share your POV, and you all work together to defend a certain POV, and view and treat those who don't as the "enemy." I find this type of dichotomy an unhealthy dyanamic that encourages an atmopshere of edit waring as opposed to one of collaboration.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Giovanni, since you obviously read my talk page, as well as messages I send people, and paste them on various pages to prove a point, you have no doubt read that SOPHIA later clarified that she had expressed herself badly, and that she had been trying to say that the fact of disagreeing with several editor who could all type faster than she could was scary when she was new. See <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_Archive08_525a.html#That_fateful_.22scary.22_quote" title="User talk:Musical Linguist/Archive08">here</a> if you need to refresh your memory. A sockpuppet tag was put on SOPHIA's husband's user page, though <i><b>not by any of the Christian editors on the Christianity article</b></i>, and as far as I know, that was why she was so indignant. I and Str1977 sent her several kind messages, and we both welcomed her back when she returned. I also used my admin powers to remove the sockpuppet allegation from the history of her husband's page, and I asked her to let me know if there was anything else I could do. It's convenient for you that SOPHIA made what she later called "that fateful scary quote", but the facts don't bear out your accusations. It's true that TheShriek didn't revert. But his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37002019" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37002019" rel="nofollow">eleventh edit</a> on Wikipedia was a vote for something that you wanted. (Something which BelindaGong also voted for.) It's perfectly acceptable to ask for a checkuser based on a lot of new editors voting for something that a particular editor wants. And that particular editor (yourself) was shown to be using sockpuppets, or, if they really are separate people, meatpuppets.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree entirely that non-Christian editors have been given greater scrutiny on the Christianity article. However, that's just because in this particular instance, several non-Christian editors behaved like sockpuppets, and that such suspicions were later confirmed. That meant that on the Christianity article, we now had a main contributor (non-Christian) who was known to have used sockpuppets. That makes us extra suspicious. On the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article, there is an editor User:Kdbuffalo]], who is known to have used sockpuppets, so a request was <i>very</i> quickly made for a check on <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaisinman_8c3e.html" title="User:Raisinman">User:Raisinman</a>, who was editing from athe same pro-Christian POV. (The request was made <i>much</i> quicker than the request for a check on your socks and suspected socks, by the way.) And when the check was positive, he was banned indefinitely. It simply didn't happen on the Christianity article that lots of newly registered accounts appeared and started voting for and reverting to a pro-Christian version, so your statement is highly misleading and unfair. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To King Vegita</p>
<ul>
<li>You are incorrect in saying that I <i>falsely</i> accused RTS of reverts. A partial revert also counts, and I did make it clear when I reported him <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:RTS" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">here</a> that some of the reverts were partial ones. I also, in the interest of complete fairness, made sure that <i>he</i> knew that partial reverts and different reverts could also count. Giovanni has often made partial reverts, by inserting <i>large</i> chunks of "mystery cults" stuff, to which other editors object, and then changing a few sentences and reinserting it.</li>
<li>I and others have in the past blocked obvious sockpuppets without a checkuser. For example, a few months ago, a new user inserted "It's the true faith" several times into the Christianity article. He/she was blocked for 3RR, and then another brand new user inserted "It's the true faith", and then another, and another, and another. I and another admin were blocking as fast as we could, often after – guess what? – '<i>one revert</i>, and eventually semiprotected the article. This went on for several days. I'd say we blocked dozens of them. And, for the record, I <i>agree</i> that Christianity is the true faith.</li>
<li>As regards my use of administrative powers in that article, my block of NPOV77 was the first instance, apart from the blocking of dozens of "true faith" sockpuppets.</li>
<li>As soon as was possible after the block of NPOV77, I reported it here for feedback, and was quite happy to accept criticism, and even the undoing of my block. I've also invited NPOV77 to try to convince me or others that he's not a sockpuppet.</li>
<li>I have seen other administrators blocking on sight when a brand new users reverts to the version of someone blocked for 3RR or sockpuppetry. I was aware all along that BelindaGong and Freethinker99 were connected to Giovanni, either as sockpuppets or as meatpuppets, and I also felt immediately that RTS was a sockpuppet, but I didn't block any of them on sight (or at all). I wasted large amounts of time patiently explaining the rules to Giovanni's suspected puppets, even though I was convinced they already knew them. I told them politely that they had violated 3RR, but that I wasn't going to report them. I begged them to stop. In fact, my reporting of Giovanni was the first 3RR report I ever made, and I had been on Wikipedia for ten months at that stage, and had often seen 3RR violated by people whose POV I opposed. There comes a stage when you just have to say, enough is enough. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>First, I shall reply to something you said to Giovanni, but should have said to me. Sure, a negative checkuser doesn't prove that it wasnt' a sockpuppet or meatpuppet, but it does strongly limit your ability to prove that he was. Certainly, a checkuser should be done in case you could silence everything by proving they're related accounts. To outright declare someone to be a sockpuppet as an official stance, Wikipedia (in the part about tagging as specifically being) says : "Note that this should only be done if the account has been shown beyond reasonable doubt to be a sock puppet of the user by one of the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>the user's own admission;</li>
<li>matching of IP addresses or similar strong technical evidence;</li>
<li>a ruling on Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>None of these three have happened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And even if it is a sockpuppet, it cannot be proven yet that it is RTS's sockpuppet. For example, as I have said, it could have been my sockpuppet for all you know. Should it have been, it would not have been used in violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a>. This argument should also answer the blocking "obvious" sockpuppets without a checkuser. This was a slightly probable sockpuppet, not an obvious one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I could also add in the Wikipedia policy "Do not call these users 'meatpuppets'; be civil."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Partial reverts do not seem to me worthy of being counted as full reverts, but I'll certainly accept that if you can show me the Wikipedia policy which states that partial reverts are counted as such.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you reported it here, and I am giving you criticism. Call me a bit of a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_libertarian.html" title="Civil libertarian">civil libertarian</a>, but I feel that accounts should be treated with the same "innocent until proven guilty" principle available in most democratic nations. Let us be sure that it is a sockpuppet.... certainly it doesn't hurt since you have more revert power anyways.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is a sockpuppet, then you shouldn't follow the wrong ways that other administrators act. Administrator status is given rather liberally remember.</dd>

<p>As an outsider I've two comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first sentence of this section claimed that JarlaxleArtemis was being blocked permanently. How could he make the comment above?</li>
<li>From my reading of the two arbitration discussions, JarlaxleArtemis doesn't deserve a permanent block. He should be given some more chances to repent. In particular, IMO the faults discussed in the second arb is less serious than that stated in the first arb. This is an evidence showing tht JarlaxleArtemis did try to behave, just not to the expected extent.</li>

<p>However, from the block log, I think RedWolf24 is more likely to have an agreement with JarlaxleArtemis, because an admin usually wouldn't lift a permanent block. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 07:20, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Until he has completed these requirements from November, the middle two in particular, perhaps he should not be editing. I appreciate the Linuxbeak has endeavored to mentor, and has done so after a remarkable show of forgiveness on his part. However JarlaxleArtemis appears to have ignored the process. Now that we've unravelled the case, it appears to not require ArbCom clarification. I suggest we move this thread to AN. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per that agreement, Jarlaxle is on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">probation</a>, which can be enforced by any uininvolved admin. If this is an enforcement problem, we need to get some admins to look at this. As well, he's put under mentors, who are given free reign to stop his disruption by necessary means; if the mentors have left or resigned, or forgotten him, then we need some new ones. If you think it is beyond that point, then what is probably needed is just some consensus on ANI to reban him without arbcom intervention. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:59, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jarlaxle is not a banned user per se.

<p>I have a point to question against Phroziac's act. Did you re-notify Jarlaxle about the previous-made agreement on unbanning and give him another fortnight or so of deadline before you reinstated the block? It would be unfair to Jarlaxle if he wasn't blocked in December for failing to comply with the agreement, did many rational things throughout the months, and <i>suddenly got blocked because he forgot to do something three months ago, without even giving him a prior notice</i>. Consider my comment void if anyone can show that Jarlaxle is given a 14-day period of notification before being blocked. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 12:03, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you re-read the statement that Linuxbeak wrote on his talk page in December, you can see Jarlaxle was told that if he did not complete the requirement in a week he would be blocked until he did. That is now a three month period of notice. You can also see that he selectively deleted that notice a month later, indicating he was aware of it.

Even after he has completed these requirements he may be blocked or banned totally or partially on account of violating parole by edit warring, etc. Lastly, he is now questioning some details about his parole, and disputing some of the allegations about his actions.

<p>There is a group of approximately a dozen editors who have prominently displayed Masonic membership logos on their user pages who are and have engaged in a pattern of widespread abuse and manipulation of Wikipedia Rules, Guidelines, and Spirit. The group refuses to allow information critical of their fraternity to appear on the Freemasonry page and related side pages. I request that Editors who admit to being members of the Freemasonry Fraternity(by their user pages or otherwise) not be permitted to edit Freemasonry related pages. Previously this same group of Editors have made arguements on Admin pages that various non-mason Editors who admitted on their user pages to being opposed to Freemasonary not be permitted to edit Freemasonry pages by blocking simply because their stated opposition to Freemasonry was a POV agenda. I ask for the same rational be applied to Freemason Editors - they have a POV agenda and they should thus be blocked from editing related pages.

<dd>UninvitedCompany has not responded to my inquiry into having the ban and reversions lifted. Both were inappropriate. My comments to user talk pages did not provide the URL to the outside site unless the user in question requested it, with one minor exception (person provided NPOV edit to page; when reverted, asked where it would be appropriate). Similarly, I have made substantive edits to the wiki. I was banned without warning and, as my user talk notes were not spam, without justification. Now, the power-tripping admin (see his talk page for complaints by others) does not reply to me? Absurd. --DansGhost 19:17, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(teleposted by Colin) I strongly disagree with Theresa and GT. When I, and surely others, issue vandalism warnings on people, the major factor on which I base which <a href="../../../t/t/_/WP%7ETT_b521.html" title="WP:TT">testx</a> (or NPA or whichever) to use is which ones they've had before, and how recently. I don't want to have to check their history to check that they haven't deleted any {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}}s in the past 24 hours before I post a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}}. The 'Removing warnings' and 'Talk page vandalism' parts of '<a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:VAND">Types of vandalism</a> should, in my opinion, be followed, at least for recent warnings. The answer to "why not check the history?" is "why should I waste my time for a vandal when policy dictates that I shouldn't have to?" --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 23:02, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with that line of thought is that vandals, by definition, don't follow policy. Policy says you shouldn't have to check their history, but it also says they shouldn't vandalize. I always look at their contributions page, and if I see that they've edited their talk page, I check the diffs. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are vandals and vandals. Vandals who care enough to remove warnings are relatively rare compared to the usual sort. I operate on the assumption that if an IP deletes warnings from his talk page, people do what I do - see it on their watchlist, roll them back and possibly send them {{wr}}. It would save a lot of time if everyone was able to count on recent warnings staying up there. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 23:16, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not "well aware" that hiddenStructure is harmful.

On <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Book_49d1.html" title="Template:Infobox Book">Template:Infobox Book</a>, you did not explain why you reverted. I explained whyI made the changes, so why is there a double-standard? It seems to me the only harmful revert warring is when the reasons for the reverts have gone unexplained.

<dd>Out of curiosity, I see David Levy's link to comments by Brion why he doesn't <i>like</i> hiddenStructure. I've also noticed comments on Brion's talk page that suggest he has as much disdain for QIF. I haven't seen anything here suggesting that either one has been "explicitly condemned" per se. Mind you, I'm rather looking for something from Brion saying "Never use this!" since the obvious conclusion here is that both sides are reading different subtleties into his statements so far.</dd>

<dd>Brion has indicated that both methods are "ugly," and that native support for conditionals would be preferable. He has <i><b>not</b></i> indicated that {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} is inherently harmful. In fact, he shot down the primary reason for avoiding its use (a belief that it adversely affected server performance). He <i><b>has</b></i>, however, cited several ways that the "hiddenStructure" CSS hack causes harm. It's been clearly demonstrated that it <b>breaks pages for some users</b> by generating nonstandard HTML code—something that {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} absolutely does not do.

<dd>So from that you imply that hiddenStructure is better than qif because it looks horrible in non-CSS browsers. I do not believe you defend a noble thought here. You only defend your outdated old stance, because you are unable to admit that qif is the better solution for now, because you have always said that metatemplates are bad. But you failed to prove that and nobody believes you, even Brion said the server load issue is a non-issue because there is no evidence. You are using this debate to hinder a viable solution because you are against templates anyway and you are opposing a Media-wiki built in conditional function. What the hell. When have you last time done something useful for this Encyclopedia? I can't remember. Your only goal seems to be to bind resources. Well then. Go for it. This is ridiculous. Let Neto have his hiddenStrucure on the templates or see what people say when he removes conditional things from the templates. We do not need to defend Wikipedia from him. The damage is obviously too little to be noticeable. We are just wasting our time here. That bladder needs to get bigger to burst. --Adrian Buehlmann 23:26, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I confess I've never understand why this debate generates so much heat. I use Lynx quite often and it negotiates hiddenStructure just fine. Sure, there's some excess data, but no worse than a normal template with missing parameters (a common occurence in the less heavily-traveled articles). I also confess that I've missed the statistics which demonstrated that Wikipedia was broken for a sizable fraction of the browsing public. This issue is surely not worth descent into a frothing rage. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see User:Locke Cole/Don't use hiddenStructure. And keep in mind, some screen reading software used by the disabled chokes on this stuff too. Also note the diff link to Brion's comment at the bottom of the page. And to be honest? The only heat here is coming from Netoholic. Everyone else seems to agree this is bad stuff, but he's revert warred over it (in defiance of his ArbCom ban) for the past two weeks. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 23:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't "choke" or "break pages". At worst, the reader sees some extra empty rows in an infobox, as Mackenseon said. As long as one follows the guidelines on <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:HiddenStructure</a> (to design your template with that in mind), there is no major problem. That point has been confirmed by lynx readers and one blind wikipedian that reviewed the material as well. If you want numbers, non-CSS browsers made up fewer than 0.04% of the hits on this website (as of Feb 2004, though I can't image that percentage has grown). -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 02:25, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Part of the attractiveness of Wikipedia is the community. <i>Yes</i>, Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and not Myspace etc. etc, but fact is, a feeling of belonging to a community makes people feel more welcome to stay and <i>write</i> that encyclopaedia. Some of the things which help generate that feeling are policies and guidelines on <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">how editors treat each other</a>, projects like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a>, and the ability to have a userpage to identify oneself to everyone else. What would distract us from writing an encyclopaedia more - the odd notice on someone's user page about what they're up to in real life, or policing other people's userpages for anything that looked unconstructive?</dd>
<dd>I don't believe Dick mentioned his campaign on his userspace to attract votes (what are the chances that someone would find it and live in his district anyway?), I think he listed it because part of the function of a user page is to tell people who you are, and he wanted to say 'I am a politician who runs in significant elections'. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 20:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a point of information, I would submit that my involvement in political campaigns is germane to my Wikipedia activities given that I spend a great deal of time working on politics-related entries. I want to make absolutely sure that I wear my biases on my sleeve, so that others can be as critical as need be when reviewing my edits. If I were really trying to get every reader of my talk page to my campaign website, I would have posted a link to it at the top of my page, right where I put the link to Kate's tool.

<dd>You think I've missed the point, but I think you've missed the wood in favour of a single tree. It's just one sentence in a single paragraph about what he does in real life. Many people post stuff about their personal life on their userpage, myself included (not so much as Dick, but then I haven't done as much interesting stuff as him). If you want people's userpages to contain nothing about their personal life, or even to have a limited amount on their personal life (perhaps a ratio of content about Wikipedia to other content?) then I have to say you're going to have to propose an actual policy. Singling out a single sentence on a single userpage won't do any good. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 22:16, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not advocating anything other than he remove the spamlink to his own personal political campaign. The rest of the page is fine. If the hand has a splinter, we pull it out, no.

<dd>No, but if the hand rests on a cane I do not take an axe to it. (Come on everyone, join in and break the Guiness World Record for most wood-based metaphors in a single thread.) I have examined <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, extensively. The policy, like all policies, applies not when I think it should, but when it's best for the encyclopaedia. Antagonising a well-established editor over a single sentence on his userpage is not good for the encyclopaedia. Like I said, if you don't want to see a single non-Wikipedia-related thing on any userpage, propose a specific policy on it, because Dick is far from the only one and there seems to be no reason to single him out. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 00:01, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the link can be described in any way as spam... if you come across it that means you are reading a four-paragraph biography of this individual. Presumably this means you have some interest in finding out about him. How in that context could the link be described as spam? Basically, I see no problem with users having a short biography on their userpages; there's no reason for Wikipedians to be faceless. What is important is that the encyclopedia comes first (that is, that the site not become a place primarily for social networking) and that userpage content create a fruitful and collegial editing atmosphere that allows for cooperation rather than sabotaging the spirit of wikilove. I would say that the material in this case is fine. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 02:56, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's very different to link to one's place of employment and altogether a whole different thing to post links and information about the fact that they are running for political office.

<p>If he's not using his user page to promote his campaign, then he should have no problem removing the external link (which is the only part I think can be justifiably requested be removed).

<p>I wonder if this whole thing has caused more people to see his "campaign" than if it had been left alone. By drawing this large-scale attention to his user page and campaign website, it has done more for the visibility of his campaign than the original link ever would. Maybe DickClarkMises and MONGO are in political cahoots... ;-) But seriously, Johntex makes a good point above.

<p>It's policy...userpages follow the same rules as article space. If this webspam was in article space we would usually remove it for being what it is. One thousand edits or ten thousand edits makes no difference to me. I have over 12,000 edits and not anywhere on my userpage is one userbox, one piece of POV information about my politics, my religion, my biases. I link articles I started, a few images given to me and few tasks I have to do. Blatant spam advertising of this nature, in which an editor is using his loaned userpage, that is the property of the Wikipedia Foundation, to promote his own political campaign is: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not what Wikipedia is all about</a>. Now maybe this is going on in other userpaces and I didn't know about it...so I take it as an eye opener...a very disappointing one at that.

Links to outside content are often very useful for providing further information, no less so in userspace than in article space. Further, in light of this being a collaborative effort to build an encyclopedia, part of the purpose of userspace is to allow fellow editors to learn more about each other. DickClarkMises introduces information about himself in a way that is nonconfrontational, friendly, and unlikely to be intrusive for people that are not seeking out the information. Acting as if he is disregarding basic Wikipedia policy is fairly absurd, and conflating this with the userbox issue is even more so. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:18, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if we were treating userspace like article space, I still don't see the issue with this particular link. If someone wrote an article about a notable political figure with a line about how that political figure is currently running for a particular office, and they linked to a statement by the candidate saying that he's running for the office, wouldn't that just be citing sources? -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 12:47, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Samuel here, the link is nonintrusive, and Dick Clark is not using the userpage as a soapbox. Several people have links to their personal webpages on their userpage, including commercial links.

<dd>There were some strong feelings, there. I hope that in time this will come to be regarded as a basis in the application of commonsense on Wikipedia. I hope future policy will take the opportunity to rule that the encyclopedia always comes first. No where in policy does it dictate that that editors are entitled to the freedom of userspace resources, offensive or not. As for the talk of following the spirit and not the letter, that is currently not an option. This leads to the conveyance of policy in one's own favor, and it must be followed to the letter whenever possible.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 11:34, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't even begin to understand what you mean there. Policy was created for the sole purpose of benefitting the encyclopedia and dictating the main goal of the site.

<dd>The infallibleness of policy pertains solely to its following when it interferes with the well-being of commonsense. It does not apply to the stability of constructing an coup out whenever one feels it is necessary. As for my alleged accusation of you and IAR, could you please show me that? I do not see it. As I recall, policy is to be followed to the letter whenever possible as by the encyclopiac intent. It should always be adhered to, unless for instance Jimbo or consensus decides to declare the policy changed. I can appreciate that some parties may want to undergo links and personal information in order to resolve their biased differences with one another, but I don't see why this should affect the following of dictated policy. Those who are not interested in the true purpose of an user page know who they are and should probably refrain from potentially provocative subjects in times such as this. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 13:34, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you and I are simply going to have to agree to disagree on this - clearly we just approach the idea of policy from different angles. Regarding IAR, I know you didn't bring it up, I brought it up pre-emptively as it's a very tricky thing to invoke properly, so I was making it clear that I wasn't arguing that it should be applied here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 16:38, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
