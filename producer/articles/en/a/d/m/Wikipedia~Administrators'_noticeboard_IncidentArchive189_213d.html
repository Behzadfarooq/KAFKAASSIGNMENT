<p>To be honest with you, I had no idea of the history between me and Hildanknight, but I've done some digging and it seems he was a fervent Esperanzan who I've had some interaction with <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EEsperanza_Archive_Jan_2007_a200.html#Trouble_viewing_earlier_versions_of_WP:EA" title="Wikipedia talk:Esperanza/Archive Jan 2007">here</a> - I said that the idea of a wikiorganisation's members giving up their right to determine consensus among themselves to an elected seven member council was "a fucking stupid idea" in response to something Ed said (who I am on good terms with). Hildanknight seems to have taken it as a personal attack on all Experanzans everywhere, and pursued me ever since wherever he finds me, saying that I value truth above civility, that I'm the most incivil person ever to have walked the wiki, and that I'm anti-Muslim, none of which are true. I didn't really think much of it until he started leaving mean comments on my talkpage, taunting me because my RfA failed. Which is outright nasty, as I'm sure you will agree. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 12:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I did not say that <i>you</i> were anti-Muslim, and I certainly never said that you were "the most incivil person ever to have walked the wiki". I did make a comment that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Dev920&amp;diff=102902868&amp;oldid=102882239" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Dev920&amp;diff=102902868&amp;oldid=102882239" rel="nofollow">"Dev920 stated that civility is less important than truth"</a> (I recall you saying something to that effect, but if I'm mistaken, I'll apologise). I did not "pursue [you] ever since wherever [I find you]" - I regularly lurk on RFA, but only vote if I know the candidate. I opposed because of your incivility (both the "f***ing stupid idea" comment and other examples others pointed out) and willingness to engage in people politics (nominating Esperanza for deletion and setting up the Conservatives project).</dd>

<dd>I'd say that saying "Whew!

Basically all i want to know is what stuff from my old user page i am allowed on my new userpage, as everybody seems to have different interpritations of the rules.</li>

<p>P.S. I have not user hate speach, or promoted nuclear war on Iran on the page, as some guy claimed. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_Johnson_VC_79e4.html" title="User:Boris Johnson VC">Boris Johnson VC</a> 15:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first block was unfair - you are engaged in a content dispute, neither of you particularly covering yourself in glory, but you're the one with the block button so you block him. No, that's not right. And the extension - accusing you of being paranoid is rude, and warrants a warning, but not a further 48 hour unblock. I am going to unblock in a few minutes unless I see a really good reason not to (or you choose to unblock first). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 13:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'll partially endorse <i>why</i> he was blocked, but you probably shouldn't have blocked him yourself. It was clear-cut enough, such that a request for any other admin to take a look could still have resulted in a block. However, I <i>will not</i> endorse any immediate unblock without input from more admins - that just makes it look like wheel-warring. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">Chacor</a> 13:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Pedantically, wheel warring would be if Brenneman then re-blocked. I'll refrain from unblocking but really do think he ought to be. I don't even think what he did particularly justified a 48 hour block, given the aggressive tone of Aaron's initial message on DLX's talk page. I do note that DLX described the edit as vandalism and it had no explanation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=104028537&amp;oldid=103492122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=104028537&amp;oldid=103492122" rel="nofollow">when it had</a>), but Aaron applying the block feels hinky. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 13:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you're probably right... No one can be <i>sure</i> that I'm unfussed over the reversion, can they? I mean, I know I'm not, but it's the Seize-Her's wife dictum, isn't it? By the way, I don't expect my admin actions to be sancrosect, so if anyone wants to unblock don't feel the need to pass it by me. I'd only note that I have already put on this user's talk that <i>"I'[d] lift the block if you'll recant the attacks and demonstrate some understanding of why there is a problem here."</i> and I still believe that would be a positive outcome. But it's late and I'm off like prawns in the sun...<br />

<p>This strikes me as a problematic block of a long-term productive user to begin with, and in any event it appears the blocked user accepts that his comments should have been more moderate, so I would endorse immediate unblocking. I also think it might have been appropriate for the blocking admin to bring the matter to the noticeboard before extending the block. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's only one three hour block on Xandar's record and that wasn't very recent. So unless the IP was active during that time it would be difficult to establish a case for sockpuppetry. Try <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> if you haven't been there already. The allegation of block evasion by Hkelkar is more substantial. Could you present a circumstantial case with specific evidence? Due to the time lapse checkuser isn't a likely option. The dispute at this article shouldn't have continued this long. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 23:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the contribs of Xandar and 212.140.128.142 clearly suggest they're the same person. The only edits these accounts have made in recent days are to Goa Inquisition, and both accounts share the same attitude towards the "hate speech" in the article. However, I don't think there's any policy violation, since he's avoided 3RR--so it would be hard to say there's abusive sockpuppetry going on. The problem is more that his (alleged) use of the IP contributes to the sniping and distrust on the page.</p>
<p>As for Rumple, I don't have an opinion myself whether he's evading a ban or not, but the matter was discussed previously <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive185_cae5.html#User:Rumpelstiltskin223" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive185">here</a>.

<p>By the way, WP:SSP isn't very useful right now, in my opinion, because of the tremendous backlog. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have evidence to suspect that banned user <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Hkelkar</a> is trolling again through either sock or meatpuppetry. This defence forum [<a href="http://www.indiandefenceforum.com/index.php?topic=3265.msg50650" class="external text" title="http://www.indiandefenceforum.com/index.php?topic=3265.msg50650" rel="nofollow">thread</a>] shows a user trying to recruit meatpuppets to engage in edit wars. If you look at the forum he provides clear instructions of how to edit on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Why do I suspect Hkelkar? Simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>He calls genocities History of Pakistan a "hate site".This is the accusation Hkelkar threw at me for visiting that same "hate site" when he was here on wikipedia.</li>

Not only that but his edit patterns resemble that of Hkelkar.</p>
<p>This member on the forum stated he wrote the christians in Pakistan article in "retaliation" of Pakistani users edits on the Christians in India article.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Rumpelstilskin223 is either Hkelkar or a meatpuppet following his instructions and doing his work for him.</p>

<p>Rumpelstilskin223 is already suspected of being Hkelkar's sockpuppet as many admins and users have concluded with solid evidence.Rumpelstilskin223 even removed a suspected sockpuppet tag from his userpage to avoid suspicion if you look at the history of his userpage.What's more is that he "hasn't" launched many personal attacks as Hkelkar did,which is actually not true.He attacked user:Szhaider in Urdu.<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali نادرالی</a></p>

<li>Coelacan's userpage is fine. So he has quotes on it. Some people quote politicians, some quote Mother Teresa, Coelacan quotes other Wikipedians. That the quote is something the Wikipedian might wish s/he had not originally written is beside the point. It certainly is not a violation of any rules. Janusvulcan would do well to spend his or her time making constructive edits, rather than monitoring other users' pages.

I believe in one case, at least for the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_Cylinder_33a6.html" title="Cyrus Cylinder">Cyrus Cylinder</a> (which is also section part of <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> article), he has been conducting his <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">own research</a> and posting it on Wikipedia, with links to his website as references. This has been used in number of articles and also number of times even in disputes for the Cyrus Cylinder article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103821860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103821860" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>I first discussed this by saying his articles on his websites are not academic and are only merely his own opinions (the articles are hardly use any referencing). When I tried to remind him that he is breaking number of policies also including <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, he claimed on my talk page that since he is "<b>the only one capable of actually reading the text.</b>" (referring to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Persian_243e.html" title="Old Persian">Old Persian</a> presumably) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rayis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103840539" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rayis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103840539" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and expert on the topic, his edits are valid. This validates the fact that he is, in a way, claiming the article as his own (<a href="../../../o/o/a/WP%7EOOA_f359.html" title="WP:OOA">WP:OOA</a>), and he keeps rolling back to his own version for his own research which he believes is scholarly accepted.</p>
<p>The problem is that when a scholar has already made up his own mind as for this article (Cyrus Cylinder), he chooses certain references over others just to back up his own theory (not a generally accepted one). Jona in this case has gone as far as using a book on completely different matter (Zoroastrianism) to argue that the religions of Iranian people were not monotheistic at the time, therefore this effects how tolerant Cyrus may have been to the people of his empire! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103825213" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103825213" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.</p>
<p>This shows how an expert may treat an article as an essay full of his ideas. I think it is very important for admins to decide whether its fine for a scholar to do this on Wikipedia and decide on what to do in this case. Not to forget, this is also self promotion in this case as he keeps using his personal website as reference.

<dd>I do agree that Jona shouldn't have used his own website as a source (it isn't true that he is reverting at the moment - I have done it once, though). However, as far as I can see, he has mostly cited other scholars and documents and not his own research. The fact that Zoroastrianism was hardly monotheist was certainly relevant for the article. I would also like to point out that Rayis and Surena have an obvious nationalistic bias, as Iranians who regard themselves as the descendants of Cyrus and consequently want to promote their patriotic view of history (hence it's somewhat strange that *they* are the ones talking about self-aggrandizing). I don't know abouth Khoikhoi, but he does seem to be involved in Iranian-related issues as well, so his opinion might not be neutral either. Unsurpisingly, Rayis and Surena have shown absolutely no proof (in terms of citations) that their point of view is the "mainstream academic" one and that Jona's view is the "odd" one. --194.145.161.226 18:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assume good faith, you are generalizing anyone who may be Iranian or has anything to do with Iranian articles on Wikipedia is "not neutral"? I have never stated anywhere that I believe I am a descendant of Cyrus, or I am patriotic, or in fact that I am Iranian. Therefore this is all your assumptions. What I have stated above is my point of view of things with little or no assumptions about Jona, for all I know he is a well respectable scholar as I have stated many times before. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayis_0f35.html" title="User:Rayis">Rayis</a> 18:30, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh please. All of you guys are not patriotic? Your interest in Cyrus' cylinder is purely theoretical? Let's be frank for a frigging second. And as for what your assumptions about Jona have been: after Surena declared to Jona that "you have some against Iranians, which all your angers and hatreds have been projected into that article" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=104356858&amp;oldid=104353734" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=104356858&amp;oldid=104353734" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, thus basically accusing him of being some kind of a pathological hater of Iranians (LOL), you echoed "Exactly, I agree" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=104360222&amp;oldid=104357682" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cyrus_cylinder&amp;diff=104360222&amp;oldid=104357682" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Also, you have somewhat misrepresented Jona's behaviour even in the above post, as anyone who reads the linked posts should see, but I am leaving this to anyone who wants to investigate the issue. (There has been no response so far, presumably for a good reason.) To start with, you don't mention that he has basically yielded the article to you, as he has stated on its talk page (I quote: "I have sort of agreed with Rayis that he would revise the article, and I will leave it at this."), and he has been silent since then. As for me, I quit, or else I risk spending evening after evening arguing with you people (I tend to spend too much time on such "discussions", once I've let it go, and it's bad for my health). --194.145.161.226 19:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to ask you to stop making this a nationalist matter which it is not about. I clearly had an assumption about this matter and I thought it might be against the Wikipedia policy. Only after discussing it with an administrator (Khoikhoi) and seeing Surena's comments on the talk page, I felt I should post about it here. If you believe it is grounded in false assumptions, that is fine, you have expressed your opinions, but I think it is fair to say let others comment now and for god knows how many times, stop your uncivil comments calling editors nationalists. I am sure Jona would be professional enough not to see this as a personal matter and understand our concerns, in any case its up to admins to decide what to do about this --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayis_0f35.html" title="User:Rayis">Rayis</a> 22:19, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but citing one's website does <i>not</i> automatically amount to "self-promotion" (read the article about it), and claiming that it does in this case is an accusation - especially in the context of the above-mentioned claims that Jona had "angers and hatreds for Iranians" or something like that on the talk page of <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_cylinder.html" title="Cyrus cylinder">Cyrus cylinder</a>. Now, the *relevant* section in our case is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Citing oneself</a>, which is NOT always forbidden. Whether and to what extent it is appropriate in this particular case can be debated upon, and as I stated, I think he had better avoid it, as the relevant info can be based on other sources. However, your interpretation of his edits as self-promotion, as well as your use of the admin noticeboard in this case, are pure aggression and I have tried to explain the motivation behind that aggression here. While the lack of understanding of WP:NOR etc., also on the part of experts, is a serious problem, I also think that preventing nationalist bias is a higher-level priority. And this is my last post about this, because otherwise I am going to end up giving endless speeches.--194.145.161.226 19:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...can some uninvolved admins please look into this ongoing dispute regarding <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and the guidelines they point to - <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in particular? In December, a change was made without any discussion or consensus anywhere regarding what's viewed by some as the "central criterion" at WP:N, downgrading a bunch of long-standing criteria in the specific guidelines in the process. I've had limited time lately to pay attention to the minutiae on the actual project pages until this past week, when I noticed it, left a comment at the various talk pages, and ultimately reverted the changes, looking for further discussion on the talk pages. This has not gone well, with a few editors (most notably <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant_6053.html" title="User:Radiant">Radiant</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant_3c24.html" title="User talk:Radiant">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Radiant_9a98.html" title="Special:Contributions/Radiant">contribs</a>), who's tendentious editing at WP-space pages has amped up as of late) putting the changes back, almost universally without talk page discussion or demonstration of consensus, and a number of people opposing the changes at the talk pages of the individual guidelines beyond myself - this isn't a one man crusade. This, especially Radiant's continued disruptive editing and accusations, is getting tiring, and when people start removing disputed section tags, all it's doing is escalating an already heated conflict. I don't care what side people take, but I'd like some uninvolved people to get involved before this goes completely over the top, which is close to the point I'm at. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps it would help if you stopped throwing spurious accusations around. I note that you are misstating the situation by implying this is a conflict between you and me - for instance, on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, it is a conflict between you on the one side, and me, Recury, Satori Son, Ben Aveling, and W.Marsh on the other. It is quite beyond me how you can claim that this implies a consensus on your side, when you appear to be alone in your view. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Others have actually made statements and discussion, you've simply disrupted things, not to mention your complete disregard for the facts regarding what's happening in the dispute. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Like Radiant!'s post, this disagreement seems like a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Village pump</a> issue, not an admin issue.

<dd>It's much easier to point out the three pages in question, there's plenty of evidence there as opposed to me taking 5 minutes to load diffs into the window. It's become an administrative dispute because there's been plenty of discussion and it's mostly one person creating the issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The one person being you, of course, and you try to drive off the people who disagree with you by calling them tendentious editors.

<li>I want to be in the party too! Of course this does not belong here, but since it is, the primary notability criterion is the best statement we have to date of what constitutes an encyclopaedically notable subject; it also has the merit of being capable of being objectively interpreted (or at least more so than counting the number of people who say "<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>" in a debate). More to the point, having a guideline that says <i>foo</i> means a subject is notable when an article can satisfy <i>foo</i> without having any independent sources, is a recipe for endless conflict. If we <i>start</i> from the premise that all articles need sources and move on from there to the things which are either additive (so we don't get a directory of whatever) or indicative of the likely existence of sources, then that's a consistent and reasonable approach, in a way that implying that a band is notable if it sets foot over a national border is not (I have toured internationally with my choir, we are not notable). Jeff, you hope this will be "dealt with" - it might well be, but not necessarily the way you would prefer. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Talking about accusations, 99% of what he says is INCORRECT. For ex, he accused me (as usual) of distorting biomedical research and I asked him to provide examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=92669190&amp;oldid=92571210" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=92669190&amp;oldid=92571210" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and he provided me with a link of an edit that WAS NOT mine.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=93817008&amp;oldid=93769617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=93817008&amp;oldid=93769617" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> More such examples can be provided.</p>
<p>Now, some of these are recurring personal attacks and I think that requires admin attention, rather than RfC. He even admits that his behavior is wrong but blames all this on me by saying: "If you do not like people being nasty to you, then you could consider that they are only behaving towards you the same way you are behaving towards them." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALukas19&amp;diff=103376831&amp;oldid=103374891" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALukas19&amp;diff=103376831&amp;oldid=103374891" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> He was warned before about personal attacks (see the PAIN report link)</p>
<p>He also removed my option from RfC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FSociety%2C_law%2C_and_sex&amp;diff=103477527&amp;oldid=103475229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FSociety%2C_law%2C_and_sex&amp;diff=103477527&amp;oldid=103475229" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> so his behavior may be called harassment. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukas19_cfbd.html" title="User:Lukas19">Lukas19</a> 00:22, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've checked out Wobble's edit history and it's extremely counterproductive. All he seems to do is accuse other editors of racism and remove anything he disagrees with on the grounds that it's racist. Many articles have lost a lot of rich content because he wont allow view points he disagrees with to be included always using the excuse that something or other is racist. He contributes nothing to the encyclopedia. All he does is remove things so that only his view on things is seen Itsokay</p>
<p>Upon a second review of Lukas19's edit history, it seems he does have a history of persistent POV pushing on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White people</a> article (as pointed out by various users on that article's talk page).

<p>Hello, the <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">User talk:Derex</a> page is being used by its user to conduct a rather bizarre personal smear campaign against myself. Whenever, I try to engage him in a discussion and respond to his accusations he deletes my posts and threatens me not to return to his talk page or else he'll have me banned. I would be happy to stay away from this individual as I very much dislike him, but he has conducted research into 6 and 7 year old posts I made on a previous website and posted them on his user page in some weird attempt to discredit my work here at Wikipedia. Frankly, I find this all rather disturbing. He is entitled to his opinions and I am entitled to mine, so long as we do not put our opinions into the articles we write. To do what he is doing smacks of McCarthism or a witch hunt and needs to be quickly knocked down and knocked down hard.

It's absolutely filled with innuendo and leading phrases. See this edit I just made for a good example. I used to think the facts were ok, but just a little overly-spun. However, I started factchecking another article by this author, and in at least 5 cases the refs did not actually say what the article said. It also has very serious WP:OR problems; it's an embarassment this made it to the main page. I think this thing needs to go before a peer review or something. Derex 23:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yet Rumpelstiltskin was aware, long before these edits, that this behavior is uncalled for; see Lemongoat's talk page here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lemongoat&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100837785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lemongoat&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100837785" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is this behavior very hypocritical and in violation of rules, but it seriously obstructs the record of his warnings and issues of criticism. This behavior should not be tolerated. I think, in light of numerous warnings against this behavior, and the fact that he knew that it is wrong to remove warnings, admin action against him is called for. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 01:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey guys. I'm glad that you're on top of this (don't forget the next rerun at 8:30 EST), but I have one request to make. When you're blocking people, please be careful of what you write in as the reason. Writing in "colbert idiocy" or "colbert crapflooder" not only encourages them, it makes you look immature. Just write in "colbert vandalism" and move on. It's much more mature, and it makes us look a lot better.</dd>

<p>As usual, I've cited <i>all</i> my words. Tons of difflinks are on those pages. I would expand Tankred's expanation with that, that T's report on me was also deleted under that "Remove frivolous and vengeful requests on established users" summary. But T doubled that report again, on here, this page, this time successfully. First three blocks were due content diputes. Or, can I call it a dispute, when T did nothing, but simply reverted my edits as "vandalism". Isn't it so familiar when a content dispute occurs? After 3rd block, I'd be intrested who could hold him/herself back, and keep the NPA policy? I wrote down my opinion abt T (can be read above), and several times again since that (also can be read above), and I still keep them, since I found,seen and brought a lot of evidents wich are strengthening it. T's books are unreachable, and in Slovak with some excepts. Mines are in English, and on line mainly. Maybe it's a bit hard to him to understand, that if greens are written in an article, deleting them are not vandalism, but the improvement of the article.

For my last block, since there was no discuss abt it: I thought and think, those refs are only for the "restricting the usage of the Slovak language" line, not all that paragraph, since all of them are right after the "language" word. See? Content dispute. Thankfully WP:PAIN and WP:RFI were deleted, but T can not stop, and now he uses this page for WP:Block my opponent in content dispute. And T's addicted to me, his contrib list clearly shows, that he's not intrsted in anything else, but reverting me and somehow forcing me out of en WP, in wich he partially succeeded. I don't have time for this crap day-by-day, and I edit much fewer than before, and those are all as logged out.

<p>B: Denying pan-slavism and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_revival.html" title="National revival">national revivals</a> as a serious (main) factor and blaiming only H's nat.revival is an awesomly common thing amongst serbian/slovak radicals, and commonly, blaiming H for everything. No, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-slavism.html" title="Pan-slavism">Pan-slavism</a> caused serious ethnic tensions and lead to the magyarization policies, and ethnic clashes also. I've cited them many times before (<i>english</i>, <i>online</i> refs mainly, not Slovak books), but they were simply deleted as „vandalism”. As all my other edits. And I still can not understand, why do they think, that I deny magyarization or such things??? LOL no, but simply, it played <i>one</i> role, not the only, and not even the main one, but an important supporting act. Stating this means, that you're a radical natonalist blablabla... see my talkpage for the perfect expressions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:VinceB" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:VinceB" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:VinceB/Blabla1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:VinceB/Blabla1" rel="nofollow">archive</a> (oh, now I reveaed, why did I gave the name of the archive <i>"blabla"</i>&#160;:-) ) But other roles are prohibited, "m" is the main and only, so history falsifing is flourishing here. (in fact most of the not so frequent themes are also usually in poor or acceptable condition - for example articles related to PR and communications, and marketing...pff..- , so no wonder, why these unintresting - or lowly intrested - topic like this where I edit can be in the hands op political expressions instead of reality.) And the biggest LOL is removing nonsense and far-right writers "opinions" are vandalism. Well OK, than David Irving or Ernst Zünder, orr other err..."notable historians"...should be used in the articles related to Jews or the Holocaust. LOL. And depressing in the same time.

<dd>I am not sure I understand what you are talking about. My post here concerns your personal attacks against me and your unwillingness to remove them. As to all your previous blocks, you have never been blocked for engaging in a content dispute, but for sock puppetry, vandalism, personal attacks, disruptive edits, and edit warring. Your last block came after you vandalized a citation from an academic journal published in English, not in Slovak. Please, do not try to divert attention from the topic. As I wrote on your talk page, I would accept your apology if you remove your personal attacks. Since you are evidently not willing to do that, I am asking here for help. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETankred_25cb.html" title="User:Tankred">Tankred</a> 00:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm saddened to list this rather sordid set of activities by admin <span id="ChrisGriswold" class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">ChrisGriswold</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a></span>), a usually diligent and forthright admin.</p>
<p>Over the past week Chris had taken it upon himself to run off an individual who used the apparently fictitious username, <span id="Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III" class="plainlinks">Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III&#160;(talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III_d093.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dr. Stephen J.

Chris has claimed, among other things that the username was an imposter of a real, notable person -- it isn't -- and made this the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III" rel="nofollow">basis of his perma-block</a>. He later unilaterally claimed this user to be banned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[69]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dr._Stephen_J._Krune_III&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> -- although as had no basis for such an action either, nor did he have "widespread community support" for such a ban, as required by <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a>: "<i>Community bans must be supported by a strong consensus and should never be enacted based on agreement between a handful of admins or users."</i> Further, he did not bother to post his activity to the Noticeboard for review.</p>
<p>All of his actions are contrary to explicit policy requirements, and were pointed out as such. He has aimed to eliminate any "evidence" by blanking the Talk page of the user, where discussions about the individual and his activities were held, and selectively removing the extensive comments from his own talk page, without archiving:</p>

<p>Finally, he has supported, and effectively misled, recent editor <span id="Acalamari" class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcalamari_769f.html" title="User talk:Acalamari">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Acalamari_7bc9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Acalamari">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a></span>) in committing sweeping talk page vandalism -- prompting her to delete dozens of legitimate comments from numerous talk pages and archives, under the pretext that these were comments left by the IP of "Krune":</p>

</ul>
<p>Now I agree that the "Krune" persona was unusual and <i>some</i> of his various Talk page comments verged on trollery; however he was not a vandal, and leaving an odd comment or two in Talk is not a banning offense. In this matter, Chris's use of the admin powers has stepped over the line into pure censorship; and his actions have caused at least one new user to have a grave misunderstanding about how Wikipedia works. The Krune talk page needs to be un-blanked and unprotected; and the account "unbanned", until such time that the actual process for banning is followed, if it is deemed appropriate. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 20:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC) -</p>

<dd><s>I am the user who actually removed the messages.</s> I've read everything that Krune wrote using that IP. Insults to other users, racist and sexist comments, questioning the gender of real people, and also rudeness about an article's subject do not belong on talk pages. On top of that, in the history of his IP's talk page, I read that he threatened to sue Wikipedia and its users if he continued to receive warnings about trolling and vandalism. Also, he vandalized a user page with that IP, calling that user he vandalized a jerk. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 21:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know exactly. Maybe the difference is that a block is temporary, as is an indefinite block (an indefinite block means a block that is not definite), while a ban is a block that won't ever be lifted. That's my understanding anyway. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 22:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>[Edit conflict] Blocks and bans are different. A block is a technical means of stopping a single account from editing Wikipedia. A ban is a community initiative to stop a person from editing Wikipedia under <b>any</b> account.

A ban can only be placed by action of Jimbo, ArbCom or widespread community support. Chris is confused that he does not have authority to enact a ban on his own, and the failure to recognize this limitation is the heart of the matter. He likely doesn't have support to enact a perma-block, either. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 22:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for acknowledging your misunderstanding. Perhaps you'll also realize that, as pointed out at <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> that you should not be enacting a block as a <i>punitive measure</i> -- which is what you appear to have done. You have yet to provide a valid policy basis for a permanent block of the IP; you claimed "Username is name of Webspace CEO; pending confirmation" was your reasoning -- which has been demonstrated to be incorrect. Please note, under Disruption: <i>"Blocks for general incivility are controversial; "cool-down" blocks are very controversial. Consider whether a 1-hour block will result in 2 months' drama</i>"; it would be also helpful to look at <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Controversial_blocks" title="WP:BLOCK">Controversial Blocks</a> to understand why I'm bring up my concerns.</li>

Then he's monitored the page to remove anything which while entirely factual, such cited information as his former party association, he now feels 'disparages' his character? and we're punishing an editor who is working to restore as much fully cited information as possible?

<p>I first became involved when I saw the user <i>LarryDarby</i> blank the page <i>Larry Darby</i> from the Recent Changes link. I restored the page, he blanked it again, and he claimed libel based on the page as it existed prior to my first edit. Upon looking at the page in more detail, I relized that there were severe BLP issues and began sourcing the statements I could and deleting the ones I could not. LarryDarby and I continued to discuss the allegations of libel and I suggested that he participate in fixing the article rather than deleting it. I posted a complaint to BLP. Eventually, he requested that the page be cleared through OTRS, Shanel cleared it, and I fully supported this action on both their parts. Shanel encouraged me to rebuild the article, and I indicated that I would be happy to but would wait a few days for everything to calm down.</p>
<p>After a few days, I attempted to rebuild a version of the article that (I'm quoting myself) (1) has a little more substance, (2) captures the controversy, (3) does not disparage the subject, and (4) stays neutral on the contested issues while still presenting them. I did not think it was complete, but I did think I achieved my goals, especially with regard to NPOV. LarryDarby seemed to be ok with my version too. I consider this important for BLP reasons.</p>
<p>Some other users raised concerns about two of my sources. I feel these concerns were valid (not necesarrily right, but valid); however the way they were addressed was not. The content debate centered around whether, if Larry Darby posts an opinion to Wikipedia, we can say that Larry Darby said something and cite the post. I found myself in a situation where there were three editors working on a page in a revert war, which I agree should not have happened in the first place. They each reverted the page twice, leaving their version with me at the 3RR cap. I attempted to discuss the content dispute on the talk page, but found that I got no response to my talk page postings unless I reverted the page also.</p>
<p>The "unsourced" statements have now been sourced, so I consider that issue closed. Although, I do think that we should have that debate at some point. I suggest everyone cool it and see how the page develops.</p>

<dd>This is a very problematic situation. Here we have a living person who has apparently made some semi-Holocaust denying claims (semi as far as the spectrum of deniers goes) which have been picked up widely. Many of the cites in the article are from Jewish-run publications, a certainly understandable thing. And since Holocaust-denying is such a sensational thing, everyone else picks up on it too. Sensationalism sells. The problem here is that this person is 50 YEARS OLD but his bio by-and-large only covers controversies. The overall effect is thus a bit of a smear. At the same time, the subject may feel he has not been able to adequately tell his own side of the story in the controversies - there is a lack of enough press reports about his side. I beleive these sorts of bios fail on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I just do not think a fair bio is made of person that gives two sentences to his background and most of the rest to controversies. Yuser31415 is right. This may be a case for simply stepping in and deleting and salting, or inviting OFFICE involvement. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 04:22, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to point out that according to his OWN edits, he chose to focus his own rewrites on the same issues, but took a defensive 'people who hate me (Jews and the Marxist uber-cabal) are out to get me' attitude in the telling. If anything, other editors have worked AWAY from POV towards NPOV. I believe they've succeeded grandly. They cited everything in there, and tehy've done it well. The fact that it does NOT FAIL NPOV is exactly why he's flipping out, screaming accusations of conspiracy and cabalism. That said, I'm again going to ask that we notify the people who do this for a living, and let them sort this out. Everyone (me too) seems to agree wikipedia's better off without this guy.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 04:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the concern about citing Jewish publications calling him anti-semetic and have said so on the talk page previously. I have been trying to make it more NPOV, but I have been treading lightly because I seem to get one side or the other mad at me no matter what I do. (I think someone once said that's a good thing) I do think too much time is spent on allegations of anti-semitism and neo-nazism for the length of the article. --<a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a> 05:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This refer to the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_smoking.html" title="Passive smoking">Passive smoking</a> article. Recently, user BlowingSmoke has been making several POV changes to this article, going as far as falsifying a quotation to support his change. Suddenly, today, the passage BlowingSmoke was challenging has been completely deleted by "<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModeration_c445.html" title="User:Moderation">Moderation</a>". The impression given by the choice of this name is that the change originates with some official wikipedia moderator. Actually, this is a newly created user, whose only action so far has been to remove the passage which challenged by BlowingSmoke. I suspect BlowingSmoke and <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModeration_c445.html" title="User:Moderation">Moderation</a> may be one and the same user, or may be closely related, and the Moderation trick is yet another attempt by BlowingSmoke to force his POV text into the article, or, failing to do so, to have the whole passage removed altogether. This needs to be stopped, but I am at a loss of knowing how to deal with BlowingSmoke attacks against the article, which do not appear to be based on good faith, to say the least. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDessources_33f6.html" title="User:Dessources">Dessources</a> 12:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many thanks. Hope it produces the desired effect. I'll get back to you in case it doesn't. For the potential ambiguity created by the choice of name, Moderation has clearly acknowledged that he has no link to wikipedia, so this sorts out that part of my concern. Still, this name may mislead a number of newcomers to wikipedia, and this will remain an issue.</dd>

It was prodded almost 5 days ago, not edited for over a week before that, and today an IP editor rv'ed the article to a previous version (as his third edit, and first edit in over nine months), supposedly to remove the prod, but he misread the diffs in doing it.

<p>Thanks for the thorough job. I was asked by Guinnog to keep an eye on this user. He's been warned by me on his talk 3 times now, warnings that have been removed (which is fine) with not very nice claims of vandalism (not so fine). I started reviewing his contribs and he's been making less than satisfactory edits elsewhere such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vietnam_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104450773" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vietnam_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104450773" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Note, I think a indefinite block may be in order shortly if things don't change, but since it has been a month since his last 24 hour block, I only went with another 24 for now... the user does have some valuable contribs so it may be worth trying.

<dd>Above and beyond the British spelling crusade, the user's edits show a pattern of personal attacks, POV additions/removals of content at political articles, liberal and apparently random applications of the {{fact}} and {{Totally Disputed}} templates, and reverts and yet more reverts. It's difficult to find an edit that doesn't fall into one of these categories. The History tab shows lots of warnings and admonishments, always briskly removed by EnglishEfternamn with edit summaries like "rv vandalism, "rv harassment", "rm personal attacks". The user is not a Clueless Angry Newbie, but has been here since May 2006 and is unfortunately behaving progressively more angrily and more disruptively, despite much patience extended by other users. Lar and others have been very patient, and I agree that one can see a ban on the horizon if the pattern doesn't improve. A 24-hour block is moderate indeed. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I represent the supporters of Gloucester RFC on the Wikipedia site. We have been having trouble with somebody (or some people) constantly vandalising the entry for our club, in particular the "Stadium" part of the site.</p>
<p>There have been comments put onto the site which are bordering on libellous. I have posted one of the tamer comments that have been posted on the site over the last week below.</p>
<p>"In January 2007, the club announced plans to redevelop part of Kingsholm (previously known as The Shed). This is to enable the stadium to become all-seating. A miniscule number of alledged supporters do not want to see this happen, and a stillborn campaign "Save Our Shed" or "SOS" was begun."</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to block the users who repeatedly change the site, or put a block on the page?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_BenBurch_150c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/BenBurch">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/BenBurch</a> is a cesspit waiting to happen.

The substance of the dispute may be summarised as follows: We, the undersigned pots, feel that these, the named kettles, are unacceptably black. It has precisely no hope whatsoever of reaching a resolution of the problem, but stands a good chance of simply repeating all the same crap which is currently filling the talk pages of the various articles. Even if BenBurch were a problem, we're hardly likely to accept the judgement of someone claiming to be a member of the legal team of an opposing group. The very name Fairness And Accuracy For All positively screams the intent to engage in tendentious editing, but having a POV-warriors username does not in and of itself constitute a problem. These guys ate each other's guts, and that's never going to change as a result of an RfC.</p>
<p>Prize comment thus far: "A plague on both your houses". I couldn't agree more. Perhaps we could rustle up a cabal and simply close the thing as being utterly pointless.

<dd>I deleted the RFC, since it wasn't properly certified. There was no evidence presented that at least two people tried and failed to resolve the dispute, a necessary prerequisite for an RFC because of the focus in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> on preventing unnecessary conflict escalation.

<p>It's a good thing I noticed this. Go on my talk page, go on rocky marciano page, go under my history, I tried to reason to reason to reason with this man. He kept on putting words in my mouth, that's why I told him to watch out and not talk to me, in the beginning I never said those things. But he keeps on playing with all my articles, I can not possibly reply again over here, so go on my talk page, read it, go on rocky marciano talk page and my other history, you will know this guy is a sophisticated vandal. HE ERASES TONS AND TONS OF MESSAGES. I asked him not to talk to me in a kind way, how long and how much can somebody stand, I mean, he is driving me crazy, all of his accusations above, he is repeating time after time, in different rhetoric. I ASK FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL, HE IS AFTER ME, AFTER MY EDITS. Every time he edits something, he says he cleans up things, sure he does, cleans up whole articles and case in point... recently (check my history) he was after my Nino Valdez article, he put the date of october 7 1955, the date baker fought valdez, which is not true, IT WAS DECEMBER 7, go on boxrec.com or on any archives, that was the dacy, what did he do, put oct 7, i mean, i am trying to correct mistakes, what is he doing, again, you have to follow my talk page, rocky page and things i left on talk page for others, also i do not check emails every day, so give me up to 5 days to reply. BUT I NEED PROTECTION AGAINST MKIL, NOT ONLY THAT, HE CHANCES STORY, PUTS WORDS INTO MY MOTH, HAS PEOPLE DOING HIS EDITS FOR HIM, GIVING HIM PRAISE ON HIS PAGE (AND IT MAY BE HIM, FROM DIFFERENT IP). I mean, the story goes on and on and on, again, HE MAKES MISTAKES, HE EDITS THINGS OUT, HE PUTS HIS OWN STORY, HE NEEDS EVIDENCE FOR EVERYTHING, MEANING, EVEN FOR BREATHING. I TRIED FOR A LONG, LONG TIME TO REASON WITH THIS MAN, BUT NOTHING, ALL TO NO AVAIL! This particular individual has time, TONS OF TIME ON HIS HANDS, I do not, i have to type fast, lucky thing I noticed this reply here. MKIL SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH CERTAIN BIOGRAPHIES/ARTICLES, HE IS NOTHING BUT PROBLEM, he demands greatness link for Marciano, well in fact he is considered great by many, Check my page for link. (italian-american community e.g.). Then he puts some link under Marciano for some fake computer fight, i mean how can a computer call somebody great, we are talking here about historians. Whatever has been accepted as generally true in the world, part of correspondence of true, then it is true. He is challenging logic and common sense. I was asked by few people to watch over the rocky page back in november and december, i did not do it immediately, but I decided I will and people like mkil should not be allowed to destroy other people's good work. Not only that he destroys it but kills other people's time and effort and good will. And if I am out of line at times, he provoked me. He did not want to listen, he kept on leaving me dozens and dozens of messages on my talk page, putting words into my mouth and if something went astray gave me some wiki links and policy which have nothing to do with the situation or particular problem at hand. What else to say, read if you have time, mkil will waste your time too, BIG TIME! I did not want this situation to happen, go all the way over here, but what can I do. He simply wants things his way, that's all, i told others i do not want trouble, But I can not allow this to go on, i can not allow mkil to make so many mistakes, rewrite history!</p>

<p>Exactly, the 58 reply might very well be you, but later i said may be you, ok, or somebody you know, that is what i mean, also, he keeps on saying he wants to correct articles, but again HE HAS TIME, I DO NOT, and he must be stopped now, he has time to take every single word I ever said and make it his case., Again, I do not mind if they support mkil but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MKil#Re:User_talk:58.64.103.227" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MKil#Re:User_talk:58.64.103.227" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MKil#Re:User_talk:58.64.103.227</a> the person who left this left it 2 minutes after mkil reverted something, not next day, not next hour.

<p>I really don't know much about Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, but I have a hard time believing that all of our articles about it should be candidates for speedy deletion. One user seems to think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Goldendoggy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Goldendoggy" rel="nofollow">otherwise</a>. This would be a bear to revert one at a time. Could someone who knows if these requests are valid take a look, and possibly use an admin tool to fix them all at once if not.

<dd>I've reverted all the edits, mainly because he'd blank the articles whilst tagging them as "nonsense". He seems to be trying to set up a mass AfD for them now, so he's obviously read the comments on his talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 14:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the help. Who knows, I might make an argument for deletion on his mass AfD. I only noticed the edits because I saw an edit summary where he replaced the page, and the speedy reason was <i>db|nonsense <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon.html" title="Fanon">fanon</a></i>. I checked it because I was hoping there was another speedy argument that I didn't know about. Then I noticed that all the account's edits were made today and all of them were redirecting episode articles and/or nominating them for deletion. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 14:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure you got them all. It looks like there are still about 40 articles listed for speedy deletion, plus another 12 or so that were redirected. I'm going to start reverting these manually unless there's a reason why I shouldn't. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 15:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
