<p>Due to the fact that CheeseDreams has given her password to the general public and now no longer has access to her accounts, it appears that she is popping up as an anonymous user. The problem here is that I can't be sure that it's not someone impersonating her and just causing her general trouble. I would like propose that anyone who purports to be CheeseDreams have their material removed from Wikipedia unless it comes from CheeseDreams' approved account. I think this is only fair for those reading and responding to that person who claims to be CheeseDreams and for CheeseDreams herself (as she is possibly being impersonated).

<p>Just blocked User:Ampersand a la Carte-le-Fort for 24h for vandalism. Methinks this is a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../b/o/x/User%7EBox_of_Rice_9717.html" title="User:Box of Rice">User:Box of Rice</a>, who had been permanently blocked by <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero0000</a> two days ago. (That block didn't take though, because I had blocked BoR for 24h before.) If others agree that ACF is a sockpuppet of BoR, I think the ACF account should be blocked permanently. (Amongst other things, ACF recreated an article BoR had created (entitled "Cabbage Hit") after that article had been speedied as patent nonsense.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think both are reincarnations of Mr. Diaper (although he seems to have given up on the diaper business). Check out BoR's user page, his (and ACF's) stray posting of comments originally directed at him on other's talk pages, and both ACF's and BoR's repeated use of the "get a grip" phrase, which <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> first used on <a href="../../../s/u/d/User_talk%7ESud-Pol_f66a.html" title="User talk:Sud-Pol">User talk:Sud-Pol</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 10:47, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The more I see of the consequences of that decision, the more unfair it seems to me. For instance, the revert that EK got blocked over was because he added some material to NPOV the wording. An anon came by and just reverted him. He reverted back in his changes. Who was at fault here?

<dd>Indeed it is. Clearly, I reverted contrary to the ArbCom's clarification; my only excuse is that I didn't know about the clarification (I saw on the page that the case was being rejected, and I didn't follow it down the page to the clarification section). So I won't do that again. I would appeal to Jimbo, but my understanding is that doing so is considered to be pointless because Jimbo has no intention of overturning any ArbCom rulings. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:07, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, I don't feel Everyking has changed. The spirit of the ruling was to avoid him reverting Ashlee-related material, but he stuck to the letter of it and insisted on reverting Ashlee-related material because it wasn't in an Ashlee-related article. I don't think he's changed; it's apparent he still believes in following the letter instead of the spirit of the law; if he were left unfettered, I feel another edit war over Ashlee wouldn't be long in coming. Don't get me wrong, I know he's a good editor outside Ashlee stuff, but that does not change the fact that he has taken the attitude of entitlement to three reverts and practically every maximum theoretical boundary preventing him from getting into a revert war over Ashlee-related material. He can claim that attitude does not translate to action all he wants; anyone interested can review what occurred and decide for themselves.</dd>
<dd>I can understand the frustration that Everyking feels over not being able to revert Ashlee-related material even when it does little to no harm, but the idea of the ruling is for him to prove himself, not to allow him to continue his old ways. The correct approach would have been to go on IRC or somehow contact another editor to revert the edit. That is how it's supposed to work. Just because you are in the right does not give you an entitlement to take action that has clearly been outlawed. We don't argue for leniency with otherwise good editors (i.e. Slrubenstein) getting banned for violating the 3RR just because they were in the right. The same applies here. Everyking should just assume he is being placed on an extremely tight version of the 3RR and behave like how he would normally would. Then again, perhaps that's where this problem stems from. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:35, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I said before, I wouldn't have reverted if I'd know about the clarification.

<li>It is my opinion that any article which contains a link to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> or mentioning Ashlee Simpson, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Ashlee_Simpson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Ashlee_Simpson" rel="nofollow">(what links to Ashlee Simpson)</a> is an article "relating to Ashlee Simpson"; therefore falling within the articles covered by the revert limitation, if Everyking is editing with respect to that portion of an article which is concerned with Ashlee Simpson and in the opinion of an administrator reverting the article. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:44, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If Ashlee Simpson-related material is put into an article, it is to that extent related to Ashlee Simpson. That's the standard a rough consensus (with some queries) of the admins applied to CheeseDreams and Jesus/Christianity-related material - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 14:17, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We should <i>not</i> narrowly define "related to Ashlee Simpson," and it should be broadly interpreted by administrators. Everyking should be made nervous about getting anywhere near anything that could be considered Ashlee-related. The intent is to restrict him, not give him a change to win the game. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 15:40, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's precisely my thinking. This is an attempt to game the spirit of the ruling with an interpretation that I would think was beyond reasonable doubt - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 17:58, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I agree with David's, Epopts, and Fred's intrepretations, although I think Fred's explanation is the most clear. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 19:53, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The intent of the ruling, in my view, is to prevent the overzealous reversion of material relating to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>. Administrators should be capable of determining when such an action is taking place and act appropriately. -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grun</a><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">t</a> <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union"><font style="display: inline; background: #0000c0; font-size: 12pt; color: yellow;">&#160; ҈&#160;</font></a> 20:05, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think The Epopt's comment is quite telling: "Everyking should be made nervous about getting anywhere near anything that could be considered Ashlee-related." The spirit behind that is quite clear! <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:04, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The spirit of it is that we didn't think you could be trusted to edit rationally around Ashlee-related articles without great restriction. Remember that you are still entirely able to make your case for particular edits on talk pages. You also need to somehow not let yourself be goaded by others acting obnoxiously elsewhere, e.g. on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a> - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 14:40, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wasn't quite a disputed block per se - I don't dispute it was a 3RR vio. But although I like 3RR a lot, I don't tend to be a complete hardarse about the 24 hours and will almost always unblock if someone will admit they messed up, even if it's really soon after.</dd>

<dd>I do think Ambi was extremely silly to let herself be goaded into a 3RR violation, and do trust it won't happen again. There's all sorts of ways to point out a content-destroying conspiracist (my editorial opinion of the other guy's edits) without getting lured into a 3RR violation.</dd>

<dd>If I had known that one of the perks in being an Arbitrators was that I can break 3RR at will and enjoy a minimal punishment, I'd have run for the job. I'd like to point out that I have reported 3RR violations on this page against two Arbitrators and at least as many admins, and so far the track record is extremely poor. This policy is meaningless unless blocks are enforced without regard to Wikipedia "rank" and that they are not reversed without consulting the community here except in extreme cicumstances to keep the unblock from looking secretive. I do not like that a fellow Arbitrator of Ambi lifted this block, and I see it as clearly playing favorites. I'm just sure how else I should interpret it. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 16:55, 2005 Feb 28 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, the closest Ambi ever got to understanding any error was to (finally) add a terse pragraph to the talk page. Gerad made a very consious decission to (just) unblock Ambi because she is in the clique. The comment about "Ambi being goaded" is also hardly helpful and completely against the facts. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAberglas_88e9.html" title="User:Aberglas">Aberglas</a> 07:51, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC) aberglas</dd>

<li>I'd like to hear some explanation or rationale for the behaviour of Ambi and David Gerard in this episode. David says he unblocked Ambi because she expressed remorse, although I don't where that was. Is an expression of remorse in general a means of becoming unblocked? Was Geni's application of the 3RR incorrect? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:23, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In thinking about this a bit more, I'd like to make the following points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In general, administrators should not second-guess the application by other administrators of rules such as the 3RR. Even if one administrator would have been more lenient than another has been, he should refrain from stepping in and altering the penalty imposed by the administrator who made the decision concerning what penalty to apply -- for example, by shortening a block or lifting it entirely. Otherwise, people will play the administrators off against each other, like kids with parents. No administrator wants to be in the position of being thought of as the one who will "fix tickets" handed out by the others: an administrator who gains a reputation for "fixing tickets" will pretty soon find himself plagued with requests to do so, and will be accused of playing favorites when he fixes some tickets and not others. Other administrators will be reluctant to impose penalties, which involves some conflict and stress, if they know their penalties will be altered or cancelled by other administrators who are more friendly towards the offenders. The whole system will be perceived by non-administrators as corrupt, with penalties determined by "who you know" rather than objective factors. If an administrator imposes a penalty, other administrators should alter that penalty only if it is incorrect under the policies and rules that have been established.</li>
<li>In this particular case, the person who had her ticket "fixed" was an Arbitrator, and the person doing the "fixing" was another Arbitrator. This was very unfortunate. Especially given the extremely legalistic procedure and style that the ArbComm has adopted, the administrators should try to maintain themselves above reproach. They are in the position of "judging" other members and potentially imposing severe penalties -- severe anyway in the Wikipedia context. If an Arbitrator so forgets herself that she violates clear rules established by the consensus of the community, she should apologize and accept the penalty imposed. Certainly, the person "fixing" the penalty should not be another Arbitrator. Otherwise, the clear message to the rest of the community is that there is one set of rules for the community and a different set of rules for the Arbitrators.</li>
<li>I don't believe that David or Ambi thought of themselves as "above" the rules of the community -- rules that they are charged with interpreting and applying fairly. But the effect in this case, almost certainly without them intending it, was undoubtedly to undermine the community consensus, the other administrators, and the trust that the community has placed in them as Arbitrators. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:20, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>It should be noted that I leave a note on the talk page of every person I block under the 3RR suggesting that if they feel that the block was incorrect they can appeal to another admin or contact the mailing. In the end there is always the risk that a blocking admin will make a misstake. Some form of apeal is needed.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:37, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Geni, that seems like a good procedure. I am not arguing that administrators should "close ranks" and not reverse an erroneous decision by a colleague. That would be as bad as "second-guessing" a colleague. I am saying that if an administrator assumes responsibility for a case and imposes a penalty, the only person who should soften or alter that penalty is the administrator who imposed it, UNLESS the penalty oversteps or misinterprets the rules. No administrator should end a block or shorten it (or extend it for that matter) simply because he would have imposed a lighter or heavier penalty than the person who actually determined the penalty. Administrators should respect each other's decisions, and if they can't, then one of the administrators involved is not suited to be an administrator. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:45, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that this goes beyond simply the number of reverts. I believe that the manner in which Ambi acted was quite contrary to the spirit and letter of the Wikipedia rules. In particular:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambi reverted a substantial, well meant contribution. Cold reverting should be reserved for vandalism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ambi did not make any contribution to the talk page until she was threatened with baning. This was despite repeated requests to do so from aberglas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The actual excuse for the reverting was highly dubious. Certainly the article could be improved, but to just say "everything" about the carefully researched article was bad is not valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have added a summary of events to the beginning of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Talk%7ESydney_Hilton_bombing_54b7.html" title="Talk:Sydney Hilton bombing">Talk:Sydney Hilton bombing</a>. Please look at the tone of Ambi's few contributions to the Talk page. Please also look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sydney_Hilton_bombing&amp;oldid=10633915" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sydney_Hilton_bombing&amp;oldid=10633915" rel="nofollow">aberglas's contribution</a> that Ambi reverted -- not perfect but clearly substantial.</p>
<p>I also note that Ambi has indulged in this behaviour several times before. Usually the reverted users simply abandon Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If this sort of behaviour is sanctioned by Wikipedia Arbitrators, the Wikipedia will die.</p>
<p>(I am new to Wikipedia, have few friends here, and am unfamilia with procedures. I am learning far more than I ever wanted to know.)</p>

<dd>Perhaps instead you should exercise some judgment and discretion when reporting ban violations. Ask yourself: Did he try to reinsert the same old trivia into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>? (No.) Did he show the same extraordinarily uncooperative behavior on another page? (No.) Did he vandalize articles or attack other users? (No.) Did he blank his own userpage? (Yes.) Did he harm Wikipedia or any of its users in any way by doing so? (No.) So why did you report this instead of letting it go? Do you want to see him rehabilitated into a productive, cooperative editor, or do you just want him punished some more? —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 02:22, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry you feel bad. That wasn't my intent - I just wanted to express my opinion that not only was his edit minor and inconsequential, it could be viewed as a show of good-faith. In many legal systems, you must prove actual damages before you can be awarded relief. I think that's a fair way to do it. There is no damage here and little indication that Vfp15 will further evade his ban, so I don't believe his ban timer should be reset. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 02:28, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Strawman arguments, every one. All that matters is his breaching the 1 month editing ban set out by the Arbcom. I have provided the link to the rulings and the diffs. Vfp15 was aware of the ban and chose to ignore it. What gives you the right to ignore it, Mirv? Are arbcom rulings just not enforced anymore? Vfp15 has evaded his block, no-one has disputed that, and no-one has disputed the arbcom ruling so what is going on?

<p><i>The penalty for evading a ban is that the "ban timer" is automatically reset (no formal consideration is typically necessary). For example, if Fred is banned for ten days, but on the sixth day attempts to evade the ban, then the ban timer will be reset from four more days remaining to ten days remaining. If Fred doesn't subsequently evade his ban, he will be banned for a total of sixteen days.</i></p>
<p><i>Banned users are simply not authorized to edit Wikipedia.</i></p>
<p>Ho hum. Mirvs desire seems to be only to troll this valid request. I don't agree with mirvs assertion that arbcom rulings are optional, to be enforced with an air of whimsy.

<dd>Ho hum. Mrfixter's desire seems to be only to get a user reblocked for making three trivial edits sometime last week. He doesn't seem to understand the purpose of banning—removing users who aren't helping with the goal of building an encyclopedia. But what do you expect from someone whose contributions to the article space consist largely of joining others' revert wars. Vfp15's ban timer is extended, but the block on his account doesn't have to be extended unless someone decides to extend it. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 18:03, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> At 09:15, 14 Feb 2005 I noted in the discussion page that I would be making edits to this article to bring it in line with recent changes to the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_Australia_3807.html" title="Governor-General of Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> article, changes fully discussed and to which Adam was a party. Two weeks later at 17:01, 27 Feb 2005, in the absence of any discussion, I made those changes. I also noted that the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> article had changed to incorporate a new definition, one that included Australia. I therefore replaced the description of Australia as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> inter alia with <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>. Adam reverted this and made some other changes, which I thought strengthened the article and with which I did not disagree. However, as Australia is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, I left that in and added <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>. Adam then reverted this, noting on the discussion page that he disagreed and would keep on reverting it. I gave a statement of my reasons, and added it back in. Adam has reached four rvs in 24 hours, and although we have discussed the change, Adam has merely reiterated his opinion, rather than provide any research or attempt to rebut the points I raised. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 01:31, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

I haven't checked the edit history to see if it was Skyring who kept adding the material, but if so they should have been blocked for a 3RR violation. If they persist in adding untrue material, it will have to go to the ArbComm for more significant action, of course. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:12, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a simple trick, isn't it? Add crud to an article and get someone blocked for removing it. I'd suggest that this is anything but a <i>straightforward</i> 3RR breach and applaud TBSDY for reversing it. How would one define a body politic where the enforcement of the law to the letter is seen as more important than the establishment of the truth?

<dd>As to how to characterize the addition of the claim that Australia's a republic: this particular point is certainly a grey area, but it's also typical of the kind of edit wars we see in contentious situations. The difference here is that the truth/falsity is a little more apparent than in most of these disputes, but other than that, it's almost identical to all these others (which is also implicit in your comments about "pushing a .. POV"). I know that this whole issue of whether to be a republic or a constitutional monarchy is a very contentious one in Australia, and it may well be that the editor who's adding this claim has some genuine good-faith reason for believing it's true. It may be a grey case, but it certainly feels more like a standard content dispute than classic vandalism (which I characterize as "mindless destruction"). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:10, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR is quite clear. If you make four edits in a 24 hour period that can be characterized as "reverts" of the same article, then you have violated the rule and are subject to blocking. Reverts of persistent vandalism are not subject to the 3RR, but content disputes are not vandalism, and adding false information to an article in good faith is not vandalism. In the absense of some evidence to the contrary, one must assume good faith. The fact that someone won't listen to you does not mean they are operating in bad faith; it just means that you haven't been persuasive enough. It is no defense to the 3RR that the information being reverted is false. An administrator should not be expected to establish the truth or falsity of the text being reverted when applying the 3RR, and an editor should not suppose that he can engage in edit-warring, and that he can overstep the 3RR, because he is reverting edits that he considers false. If the information is indeed false, an editor should have no trouble to convince someone else of this and enlist his help in resolving the edit war. For example, he has the option of enlisting an administrator to protect the article in the state he regards as true, until the factual issue can be resolved on the Talk page. We could have a different 3RR than we have, one that would make an exception for reverting "false" information, as well as vandalism. We don't have that rule. Anybody who thinks we should have that rule instead of the one we actually have is free to propose it to the community and to try to gain consensus for it. Meanwhile, we have the 3RR that we have. Finally, an administrator should not reverse the decision of another administrator unless it is absolutely clear that the first administrator was incorrect and the situation is so urgent that there is no time for others to be consulted. In this case, BrokenSegue's interpretation of the 3RR was correct and even if TBSDY would have acted differently or had a different interpretation of the 3RR, he should not have undone the decision of another administrator, but should have sought community consensus on the correct course of action. The only thing more damaging to the community than edit wars is blocking wars between administrators, and they should be avoided at all costs, even more than edit wars. We are starting to see more blocking wars between administrators. If they continue, we should start to see administrators being desysopped. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:39, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm surprised to see that I am being accused of adding incorrect material. Has anyone actually read the discussion? I give my reasoning and sources - Australian sovereignty resides in the people and therefore according to the Wikipedia definition (and many other definitions, such as that used by the Oxford English Dictionary), Australia is indeed a republic, despite the presence of a powerless and symbolic monarch. Adam's latest claim is to say that the Queen is the head of state, when the actual situation is that the title is not defined in any constitutional documents or High Court judgement, and the only convention cited by Adam is that the Governor-General is the effective head of state. In fact it is currently a matter of considerable debate amongst constitutional scholars, and there is no consensus. It is a contentious issue. Adam has fallen to abusing me for pointing out facts that undermine his claims and I don't find his approach to debate to be particularly productive. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 08:29, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By that reasoning ("sovereignty resides in the people") the UK is a "republic" too - the English (later UK) Parliament has the power to remove the monarch and name a new one, and has had that power for centuries (see, for instance, the debate over Henry VIII's loyalty oath, which named Anne's children as his heirs - heck, they even had Charles I executed). But if you tried to claim that the UK is a republic, that would be silly. <i>Technically</i>, it's a constitutional monarchy, and the fact that Australia <i>has</i> a Governor-General is plenty of proof that the same is true there. So until the Australian Parliament formally changes things, and the G-G goes away, a CM it will technically remain - even though in practise it runs much as any republic would. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 12:39, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps this discussion belongs on the article's talk page not here, but in the case of the UK, Parliament is sovereign, not the people. Parliament can make changes to constitutional enactments without consulting the people, which is not the case in Australia. Also the big difference is that in the UK the executive power belongs to the monarch, whereas in Australia it is explicitly given to the Governor-General. The Queen's powers are merely the remnant prerogative powers such as legation and honours. No reserve powers. Again I make the point that using the Wikipedia definition as well as that of the Macquarie and Oxford English Dictionaries (and dozens of others), Australia is a republic. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 13:00, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> On reading Adam's additions to the article, I noticed that they were heavily skewed towards a point of view that was not supported by informed research. In particular, I objected to Adam's contention that there was a convention that the Queen was the head of state, especially when the only convention he cited supported an opposing point of view, that Australia had two heads of state. In fact the "two heads of state" view is common amongst constitutional scholars, and few express an unequivocal view that the Queen is the one and only head of state. I replaced "matter of convention" with "matter of contention" because that is the truth - the current debate is contentious and there is no consensus. Ensuing discussion with Adam demonstrated this fact in spades. Much to my dismay Adam preferred increasingly abusive language rather than presenting any solid research. He then withdrew entirely from discussion when it became apparent that he considered his own opinion to be all that mattered. He also seems to think that having access to friends who are administrators makes him immune from the 3RR. I hadn't actually intended to pull the trigger if he had been civil and provided some checkable sources to back up his opinion, but he has withdrawn from discussion, even though he has continued to edit the article. I take this step with some reluctance after what he acknowledged (in rather juvenile terms) was good warning. Adam is an excellent writer, and I would prefer he continue to edit this article, but I must insist that opinion be labelled as such instead of being presented as fact. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 02:48, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct that it was a change, but it was an insert. The word "contention" did not exist beforehand. It is a matter of fact that the question of who is head of state is contentious. For one thing, that's what Adam and I are debating, it's a matter of dispute in the wider community and it is especially a matter of vicious academic debate amongst constitutional scholars. As is apparent from the talk page, Adam and I were discussing the matter well past the time when I could have reported him, but when he became abusive and withdrew from the discussion I gave him a good twelve hours before I assumed that he wasn't intending to discuss the matter any further and reported him. Ironically, while I was cutting and pasting, he joined back in, but I didn't notice until too late. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 05:00, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me get this straight. I have reported Adam twice for clear breaches of the 3RR. The first time he was blocked for 12 hours and quickly unblocked by TBSDY. The second time he was blocked for 24 hours, and I was included despite not having breached the 3RR. Both of us were speedily unblocked. In the process, I cop considerable abuse from Adam:</p>

<li><i>“If you carry on with your carping bullshit I will retract it and we can go back to trench warfare.” 06:09, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>“You just can't help yourself with your childish and stupid insults, can you?” 02:11, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<p>As may be readily seen from the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Talk%7EGovernment_of_Australia_446e.html" title="Talk:Government of Australia">discussion page</a> I have consistently provided checkable sources, demonstrated Adam's logic to be incorrect, and refrained from retaliating in kind. Adam makes up material to suit himself, distorts what is presented and rarely produces anything in the way of checkable sources. When I show that he is incorrect, he ignores me. I don't mind talking things out, but I can do without the abuse when I am doing my honest best to provide solid, well-researched material. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> 18:51, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User behaviour is a matter for arbcom. There is a lot of preserdence for not blocking users who are ignorant of the 3RR. The user is new. There are no mentions on talki pages or edit summeries of the 3RR.

<dd>Yes, I'm new, but I had heard of the 3RR rule. However, I got confused by the time zone difference, and undid some vandalism 47 minutes before the 24 hours was up. However, I've just now actually read the 3RR rule, and I see that there is an exception for undoing simple vandalism. In this case advocates for a particular POV keep DELETING large amounts of information from the article, including most of the references. They don't discuss it on the talk page, they just delete it. Isn't that vandalism? Here's an example, showing vandalism that I reverted. Don't you agree that this is simple vandalism, the reversion of which should fall under the exception? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10634764&amp;oldid=10632744" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10634764&amp;oldid=10632744" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10634764&amp;oldid=10632744</a></dd>

<dd>As for Rhobite, well he just makes stuff up. On the discussion page I complained about these people deleting all those references, and he replied that it was because "link descriptions you used were unacceptably biased ('pro-death')". But I didn't. I never put such a description on any link or reference. He just made it up. Likewise, he now says that I "accuses nearly every other editor of vandalism or sabotage." But that is an exaggeration. When people DELETE factual information, I call it vandalism, because that's what it is. But when there are disagreements over changes that are made in good faith I discuss them on the Talk page. On the other hand, I've been repeatedly accused of "vandalism" for ADDING well-supported information and references that were missing from the article. For example, the first of my 4 reverts was in response to an anonymous revert to delete this entire body of work, over four successive revisions, which I had done to improve the article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10604498&amp;oldid=10600605" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10604498&amp;oldid=10600605" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10604498&amp;oldid=10600605</a>. That work added considerable information (including facts "favorable" to BOTH sides in this fight), corrected factual errors, and added links to many very useful references. But here's how the anonymous person described the change which undid it all: "(rv severe vandalism, should be reverted further soon)". Of course, Rhobite didn't complain about THAT person's poor manners, in calling me a vandal. That's all that anonymous user did: he removed all my work. Surely THAT also qualifies as "simple vandalism," which should not count toward the 3RR limit. But look how Rhobite described it to you, in his attempt to get me blocked:</dd>

<dd>Rhobite is "everyone?" He's the only one who accused me of a 3RR violation (and lied to support his accusation). As for the rest of your complaint, it doesn't even make any sense to me -- I haven't made anything into any kind of dilemma. Making an accurate, NPOV article is exactly what I've been trying to do. Maybe you need some coffee. Then click on those two "compare" links and tell me whether you disagree with me that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10634764&amp;oldid=10632744" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10634764&amp;oldid=10632744" rel="nofollow">first</a> of them was simple vandalism, and that removing all the changes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10604498&amp;oldid=10600605" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10604498&amp;oldid=10600605" rel="nofollow">second</a> of them was also simple vandalism.

<dd>Well, after reading the Wiki entry for "vandalism," I stand corrected. Since the real-life definition of vandalism is malicious destruction, I assumed that the Wiki definition would be similar, and that massive deletion of content would surely qualify. But it doesn't.

<p>Consensus on VfD was to delete <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="Index of topics in alternative medicine">Index of topics in alternative medicine</a> despite John Gohde's objections.

John Gohde reverted the redirect, I re-reverted it and protected the page. John Gohde then placed the following threat on my Talk page:</p>
<p><b>The index was deleted for bogus reasons.</b></p>
<p>Either the original index will be restored, or I will simply add a totally brand new index since Wikipedia policy, guidelines, and style guides state point blank that Lists are NOT redundant because of your stupid categories, that are just plain, wrong, incomplete, confusing, and next to impossible to use. Wikipedia, by current vfd on the Buddha Index is total farce.</p>
<p>I also have a private dictionary on alternative medicine on my website which happens to very be public. Wikipedia just likes to trash alternative medicine which happens to be used by half the planet while writing tons of trash articles like <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampons.html" title="Tampons">tampons</a>. You people without a life don't even realize that dozens and dozens of web sites are selling advertisement on mirror copies of Wikipedia.</p>

<li>There doesn't appear to be any mistake here. The four edits listed above are all reverts. Three of them are rollbacks - clearly reverts. The fourth (11:19, Feb 28, 2005, "This article is not a random grab-bag") is easily verifiable as a revert to 172's previous version from 10:59, Feb 28, 2005. 172, I think you should look over the diffs again. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 03:39, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So far no one else has bothered to exercise his responsibilities in a competent manner, that's way.

<dd>I looked into it, briefly, and it would seem that 172 was blocked for 3RRvio for edits to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Russia_9acb.html" title="History of Russia">History of Russia</a>. They were all reverts, but three were dealing with Napoleon and one with Stalin. So, as far as I understand, they are not four reverts, since one is unrelated with the other three. What's more, the first "revert" is not part of any edit war, but simply a factual correction of an anon edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10621833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10621833" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. The reoport of 3RRvio seems in bad faith to me, in the light of this. Protection of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>, which is pretty much unrelated with the history of Russia, is technically not a violation of the block, but blocked or unlocked, involved admins should not protect the pages themselves, but rather refer to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>. I would recommend that the page is unprotected, and if necessary relisted on RfP, after which the page can be re-protected by an uninvolved admin, if the request looks reasonable. (i.e. if a couple of people support the protection, I will protect it <i>blindly</i>, after waiting an unspecified time, without looking at the present version) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:58, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>look, 172 was edit-warring, and courting with the 3RR. The "may or may not have been a revert" edit is questionable, and therefore the block is arguable. <i>Of course</i> 172 should not unblock himself, but as long as he is only unblocking himself to state his case here (and not continuing any edit wars), he does not do much harm. The "first revert" of 20:10, 27 Feb 2005 on the other hand, that everybody keeps pointing to, is bullshit. I mean, the pointing is, not the edit itself. It is a completely unrelated, non-edit-warring, useful revert of an incorrect anon edit. If you want to argue 172's block, use the other 3.5 reverts, but not this one, otherwise your argument appears flawed and in bad faith. I will not unblock 172 because I have no wish to start a blocking war, and because I feel the four Napoleon-related edits can be argued to constitute a 3RRvio. My personal opinion is that 172 should just sit out his block, in contrition or in anger, and be back tomorrow, instead of causing further complications over at Global warming, but also that the 3RR rule is being abused as a tool for (instead of against) edit warring by the people reporting 172. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:51, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I'm a bit disappointed that so many admins fell for Silverback's trick of reporting an earlier revert of an incorrect anon edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=10645459&amp;oldid=10621833" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=10645459&amp;oldid=10621833" rel="nofollow">13:10, 27 Feb 2005</a> as a part of the emigration edit war. The fourth emigration-related edit was also clearly no reversion, but rather an attempt to compromise and find some middle ground. Apparently, no one has objected to my compromise; it has not been reverted or even questioned on talk so far. BTW, I have no intention to sit out anything; I make no apologies for removing original research b.s. from a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured article</a> repeatedly. After all, if we had as many contributors ensuring quality in our history articles as we have admins frantically patrolling this page (perhaps because they get off on playing policeman?), I wouldn't have had to make all the reversions myself. It's too bad that the impulse to write useful encyclopedia articles is not as strong as the one behind the fetishization and ritualization of the Wiki rules. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 14:33, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing in the three revert rule about factual corrections. Since your "factual corrrection" did not include a source to back it up I have no reason even to think it is such particularly since you used the roleback button rather than manualy reverting which has the advantage of allowing you to leave an edit comment (and according to the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napol%C3%A9on_I_of_France_2b98.html" title="Napoléon I of France">Napoléon I of France</a> article about half a million men did go missing whst killed them I don't know but hundreads of thousands is certianly an posible loss). You don't have to make all the revisions yourself you call for help. You presumerbly know the articles there must be at least one person you can call on to help (heck if all else fails throw it at the incerdents notice board). For ther record there are 2 maybe three people who watch this board. Long delays after 3RR requests are not popular and are not fair on either side. Finaly you have repeatedly accused me of not cheacking the diffs. I did and the history and I did direct comaprisons of your versions (there were four identicle ones). I have delt with a lot of accusations. Mostly true but enough false ones to keep me on my toes.

<dd>I needed to post a note explaining why personal theories/original research should be kept out of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Russia_9acb.html" title="History of Russia">History of Russia</a>-- a featured article. But I was running short of time, lacking the time to wait for someone else to correct the mistake (i.e. the block on my account). Maintaining high standards on an FA is especially pressing, as impressions of Wiki's credibility will be based heavily on it, and that weighed into my decision. Even so, I now regret being in a situation in which I'd decided to unblock myself, and, seeing the unnecessary hassle now, will not do so again in the future... It's now clear enough that the fetish cult around the rules has grown stronger than the impulse behind writing good articles; in the future I will better work around that reality, or not contribute to Wikipedia at all. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 19:54, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This could all have been avoidable if the involved parties stopped to talk instead of waging a rv war. A thought to consider: perhaps we should introcuce some obligatory dispute lessons for 3RR reverters. Seriously, 172, time is not the isssue here. Quick rv may be good against an anon vandal or n00bie, but they rarely lead to solution when dealing with a normal wikipedian who is - rightly or wrongly - certain of the correctness of his edit. I was dissapointed when Polish-Soviet War was protected because our dispute for over 2 weeks, but we managed to solve this via talk and vastly improved the article in the process. Try to draw a lesson from that. On other note, unblocking oneself sounds wrong to me, in case of unjust block, there is an IRC channel usually full of admins who should be able to judge the matter and unblock one quickly. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 11:57, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RickK does far more than his fair share of vandal blocking, which means that he gets more than his fair share of complaints. Many of these complaints, from the vandals he blocks, are both unjustified and abusive.

If you do find yourself blocked due to sharing an IP address with a vandal, e-mail an active sysop through the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Wikipedia%7EEmailing_users_69d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Emailing users">Wikipedia mail function</a>.

<dd>no, he is only supposed to block IPs which are the source of vandalism, and in cases of dialup IPs only for a short time (like 30 minutes). If his blocking pattern significantly deviates from this, you may collect evidence and file an RfC, but if it is only a matter of a few isolated cases, it would be better to talk to him directly and point out that his block caused collateral damage, or if he does not react, mail another sysop to have the IP unblocked. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:48, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I looked into it, briefly, and it would seem that 172 was blocked for 3RRvio for edits to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Russia_9acb.html" title="History of Russia">History of Russia</a>. They were all reverts, but three were dealing with Napoleon and one with Stalin. So, as far as I understand, they are not four reverts, since one is unrelated with the other three. What's more, the first "revert" is not part of any edit war, but simply a factual correction of an anon edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10621833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Russia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10621833" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. The reoport of 3RRvio seems in bad faith to me, in the light of this. Protection of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>, which is pretty much unrelated with the history of Russia, is technically not a violation of the block, but blocked or unlocked, involved admins should not protect the pages themselves, but rather refer to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>. I would recommend that the page is unprotected, and if necessary relisted on RfP, after which the page can be re-protected by an uninvolved admin, if the request looks reasonable.

<dd>Isn't the point of the 3RR to set an absolute threshold? Are you <i>allowed</i> three reverts, or are three reverts the <i>absolute most that will be tolerated</i>? I think arguments about whether a fourth revert was a revert or not are ridiculous - <i>especially</i> for an admin. Something like that might be tolerated for someone new to Wikipedia - experienced users should not be allowed three reverts. Two is plenty, except for vandalism, and there's no limit on reverts of vandalism. If you <b>choose</b> to break the rule, deal with the consequences like an adult.

<p>I have de-sysopped Geni, 172, Snowspinner, and Chris 73 because they indulged in a blocking war. All these power plays do is distract from the real issue: writing neutral and accurate articles. If they need help, they should ask for it, instead of taking matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>And yes *sigh* I know this is a two-edged sword that applies to myself as well. So I'm placing myself on report, and requesting the arbcom to review my actions.

<p>It came to my understanding that Ed just unsysoped 4 people on the english wikipedia.</p>
<p>This is not correct. Whatever the reason why he did it (rules for desysoping are not my concern), Ed was not allowed to do it.</p>
<p>First&#160;: desysoping should only be done by stewards, and only under strict community approval. In this case, Ed is not steward, so is not allowed to do so.</p>
<p>Second&#160;: Ed removed the status with his developer flag, directly in the database. This is again incorrect. Developers should not remove status to editors, unless there is an urgency. And given the names of the people unsysoped, I do not think there was an urgency.</p>
<p>Third&#160;: Jamesday indicated me that Ed is not a developer. Him having developer flag is a residue of old times (ah&#160;:-)). We try to give developer flag only to developers.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, I asked JamesDay to remove Ed developer flag. Consider it technical cleanup. Ed, I love you very much, you know that do you&#160;? But you are not really a developer, and definitly not a steward. I am sorry Ed.</p>
<p>I also asked JamesDay to restore sysop status to the 4 editors. It is to the community to decide if there is a reason to unsysop them or not. I stay involved here&#160;:)</p>

<dd>I understand that Ed's action was not intended to revert community opinion on who should be an admin, but as a <i>temporary</i> measure to <i>defuse</i> a situation that was getting out of hand, pending an arbcom temporary incunction. That does not answer all points raised by Anthere, but I do think considering it makes for a different outlook. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 21:17, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Thanks for the sisterly love, Anthere. I agree completely with your 1st and 3rd points, as well as your conclusion. I restored sysop status myself, as the log shows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Dab, you are also right: I meant my action purely as a means of defusing a blocking war. I had nothing permanent in mind, which is why I <b>immediately</b> placed myself on report; Snowspinner beat me to the correct noticeboard only by a matter of minutes (I would have started an RFA on myself if he hadn't). I WANTED comments, and got them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was unconsciously aligning myself with a conversation Raul and Snowspinner had about "shooting first and asking questions afterwards". And the situation was "exigent" (as Cecropia put it), if not an "emergency" (as Fred said on the mailing list).</dd>

<dd>As an temp-desysopped admin, i (naturally) think the desysopping was out of line. However, I can also see that Ed Poor was just trying to stop a block war, and that the desysopping was only temporarily. I blocked 172 only once, and had no intention of blocking 172 again. However i still think a block was justified. A regular non-admin user most likely would have to sit out his block, and we should not treat admins differently. Hence I think it was quite wrong for 172 to unblock himself, let alone five times. Additionally, 172 was on revert parole from his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_172_e438.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/172">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/172</a>. I'll keep an eye on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a> about the latest events. To Ed: Next time please think first before shooting. Contacting admins on their talk page also works. While I believe you had good intentions, I think you should not have done this. Please do not do such stunts again, and maybe remove your developer status if you are no longer a developer. Also, why did you just set your rights to (=sysop, steward, developer)? You are not listed on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards" class="extiw" title="meta:Stewards">meta:Stewards</a>, and Anthere says above that you are definitely not a steward. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 05:51, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't know about the other admins, but 172 was definitely abusing his admin priviledge, and gaming the legubriously slow arb process. Given that sysop powers are just a priviledge and opportunity to serve, desysopping is much less serious than blocking someone from editing. admins should not think their priviledges make them more important than anybody else.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:26, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that if you are Turk you are allowed to do unlimited reverts (<i>just because vandalism is the Turkish natural behavior?!</i>), but everybody else need to learn how to become a Turk. And <i>Wiki</i>pedia will soon become a <i>Turki</i>pedia.</p>
<p>No more Assiryan, Greek, Persian or Armenian subjects could be freely posted without approval from Turkic people. The principle of NPOV is now called TPOV (Turkish Point of View).</p>
<p>Just two examples: <a href="../../../s/a/f/Talk%7ESafavids_5084.html" title="Talk:Safavids">Talk:Safavids</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/g/Talk%7ENagorno-Karabakh_05f4.html" title="Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh">Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. I have to admit: Turkic people (<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">User:Tabib</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">User:Cantus</a>, etc.) are well organized. They have a lot of energy to promote their myths and propaganda. Seems, that they now have their own people among Administrators too. They are not as naïve as the rest of us. They are acting rude, but they win in each and every discussion! Too many of them, and just few of us...</p>
<p>As a result, the famous <b>Persian poet Nizami</b> became a Turkish poet, Troy became an ancient Turkish city, and so on and so on, and, finally, <i>Wiki</i>pedia became a <i>Turki</i>pedia, <i>The Free (<u>Turkish</u>) Encyclopedia</i> on-line!</p>

<dd>As is often the case, right action, wrong justification. The point of this account has been to follow around and harass RickK. And, let's face it, the troll in the username is kind of a dead giveaway. Have we ever had a good user with troll in the name? It seems about as likely as a good user with 88 in the name did during the Stormfront siege. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:35, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, we did have a good user with "troll" in their name.

<p>Absolutely against the blocking policy. While this person is following RickK around, he's making very helpful edits doing so. I see nothing which justifies a block of <i>any</i> length. If there is a problem, RickK, Wile E., and Snowspinner should not be above having to follow the procedure and file an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">RfC</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:55, 2005 Mar 3 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've encountered about a dozen edits by The Recycling Troll, all of them good. More to the point though, if someone is unhappy with the behavior of a user who is not simply a vandal, shouldn't they be starting an RfC, etc.? Being an admin should not make one judge and jury. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:12, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Was the procedure specified in <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> followed? That policy seems to allow for blocking of an account because of an offensive username, but only after a "rough consensus" has emerged that blocking is the correct course of action. Other, less drastic, courses of action are also possible, such as the admin changing the username, again after discussion and notice to the person affected. Did Wile E Heresiarch at least communicate with the user in question on his Talk page concerning his objections to the username, asking him to change his username, before blocking him? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:25, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I oppose blocking this user. His edits are good, regardless of their intent, he is polite, and if there are concerns about the username, let them be discussed on VfD.

<p>Ridiculous! "Troll" is not offensive in the least. Some admins need to get off their high horses. If he's making good edits, I don't care if he calls himself a troll.

<dd>Well, this is a sorry spectacle. Why am I not surprised to Guanaco, Netoholic, Sam Spade, and Everyking jumping on the bandwagon to defend a troll? Do you guys remember why Clockwork Troll changed his name? It was because other people thought he might be claiming to be a troll. Recycling Troll has no such qualms, of course.

<dd>Hey, guy, I'm not a troll. In fact, you and I are usually on the same "side" of a lot of debates, for what its worth. But I'm not seeing the policy under which you are planting your banner, here. You can't just unilaterally go blocking people because you don't like their username, you know. Or for any other reason, so far as I can tell, except outright vandalism, a 3RR violation, and maybe a few other very well-defined situations. That's why we have RfC, the ArbComm, and all that. No? I was just about to send you an email asking you to look at my edit history and see if I might look like admin material to your eyes, thinking you'd be a great person to have as a nominator.

<dd>Yes, I know you're not a troll; that's why I didn't mention your name. Sorry for the confusion.

Apollomelos also claimed I added things I did not to the gays in the holocaust page. Look, I admit to doing 2 things that are wrong: I committed the terrible sin of adding the "gay" template to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. I also deleted content on fvw's userpage several times in retaliation for him blocking me. That is it in terms of my "vandalism." I NEVER vandalized the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> page as Cody alleges. I want to clear my name against all of these false allegations.

<p><i>If I sleep for years with my dog, does that mean I'm a beastophile?</i>, his own remark aimed at ridiculing homosexuality. His behavior lacks any sense of credibility or civility. And I can cite numerous other examples including much more vulgar and obscene attacks. Also note that I never criticized him has a person, only his actions. Apollomelos 03:32, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cody has once again chosen to reply with more lies and accusations. First, I want to make a general point that I have a long history of substantive and helpful edits and new article additions, mitigating factors according to wikipedia policy. I created single-handedly the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hart_Ely_e1d4.html" title="John Hart Ely">John Hart Ely</a> article and totally rewrote the <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_White_e2ff.html" title="Byron White">Byron White</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_O._Douglas_e42d.html" title="William O. Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_v._California_7b86.html" title="Miller v. California">Miller v. California</a>, and numerous other articles. I rewrote the <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a> article too. Ask Skyler about this. For false accusations of Cody, look at the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/User:Noah_Peters" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/User:Noah_Peters" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/User:Noah_Peters</a>, where Cody totally falsely alleges that I am user:Abelincoln98, which is an outright lie. Also, Cody wrote in an edit summary that he was reverting "vandalism of ku klux klan member." This is also an outright lie and outright personal attack. For Cody's new charges, I have never denied, that I have other accounts. I never lied about having other accounts. In fact, I acknowledged these accounts when I asked for my user name to be changed. I never denied I am Apollomelos3, etc. My comment about bestiality occurred when we were considering whether the fact that Abraham Lincoln shared a bed with another man meant he was a homosexual. Cody is deliberately presenting this quote out of context to smear me. I have written those comments about various administrators, but all of these were in the context of specific debates in which they constituted appropriate responses. In one case, the user Boothy was criticizing me personally. I am not going to waste space here reconstructing the context in which all of the comments were made, but Cody is once again presenting these out of context. And I have criticized Cody, out of what I believe to be justified frustration after numerous personal attacks made by Cody. And in any case, I have a right to make criticisms like these, which were made on people's talk pages and express valid opinions. I admit to being frustrated when I wrote them, but this was out of disgust for the false charges leveled against me. Once again, I am trying to clear my name. I acknowledge two incidents of vandalism, but remember my voliminous positive contributions. The harsh treatment of administrators with persistent blocks has been unjustified compared to what I have actually done.</p>

<p>I still believe you are user Abelincoln98 and others. How can I trust you when you behave this way? You even pretended to be a “radical gay activist” on one of your sock puppets in what I believe was an attempt to stir up anti-gay sentiment on the Wiki. And Abelincoln98 has very similar edits including language usage. I do admit I was wrong in using the ku klux kan member phrase in a revert of your vandalism. It was an outburst of frustration after nearly two months of dealing with you and over a month since your “permanent” block by the arbitration committee which you continue to defy. At this point the <b>arbcom has stated the permanent block still stands</b>. I personally would not care if they allowed you to take part in the community once again under certain stipulations such as the prohibition of editing any gay-related articles. As you seem to have a problem with any articles dealing with homosexuality evident in your edits denying the gay men who were killed during the Holocaust and continual spread of the urban myth that gay pride parades have public sex, bestiality, etc. Apollomelos 18:26, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have requested that the arbcom review this suggestion: As this user Noah Peters does seem intent on returning to Wikipedia how about allowing him under the stipulation that he refrain from editing any sexuality-related articles? Perhaps this would seem adequate enough for him to stop his continued bad behavior? Just an idea. Apollomelos 18:41, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
