Water vapor is a <i>natural greenhouse gas</i> and an increase in atmospheric temperature caused by anthropogenic gases will lead to greater evaporation of water from the tropical sea surface, which could lead to an increase in the water vapor content of the troposphere. Whether the main impact is through heating due to trapping of infrared radiation or through harder-to-determine effects through cloud changes, it is a definite part of the <i>greenhouse gas</i> equation even though not under direct human control.</small></dd>

On 24 January 2005, I removed the link to the article Marco of Alexandria from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Egyptians_09e8.html" title="List of Egyptians">List of Egyptians</a>, as that article had just been deleted via VfD for non-notability. Since then, Marco of Alexandria has been re-added to the list at least fifteen times by Omar Filini, variously as a redlink, an external link, or as an unlinked name, sometimes to the "painters" section, sometimes to the "poets" section, usually to both. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 00:45, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was reading his user page, as (one might imagine) is appropriate. I happened to see a spoiler for Star Wars Episode III. This pissed me off. A lot. I have been avoiding spoilers for that movie for YEARS, and I don't appreciate being blindsided by one. I put the spoiler notice up so it wouldn't happen to other people. I suggested he might want to remove the spoiler, but as long as the spoiler was there, the warning was appropriate. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 01:41, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I disagree with this block. For one, you're not even sure the anon was John. If you were going to block anyone, block the anon (who also doesn't have the defense that he's protecting his user page).</dd>
<dd>As to whether anyone could be blocked for reverting their own page more than three times, I would say no. Our rule (no time to find the cite) is that people control their own user pages, and others should generally stay off them. (Of course, someone other than the page owner could definitely get a 3RR on such a page.)</dd>
<dd>Finally, about the spoiler: yes, I agree it's bad to have a spoiler without a warning. But I would say that the appropriate path is to take it up with the person directly first, and if they prove un-cooperative, go through the mediation/RFC process.

<dd>Lots of things are called vandalism... that doesn't make them vandalism. Again, I don't see how sticking a spoiler warning on a page with a spoiler is either "vandalism", "disruption", or a "big deal" in any way shape or form. Nor, frankly, has anyone offered any rationale why it is, other than these tautological arguments about "not editing another person's user page", and that happens regularly and appropriately. Note also that I didn't even remove the spoiler because I respect his right to have it on the page. I just informed others that there was a spoiler, a completely appopriate act. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 19:37, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In any event, I've received an email from John-1107. I'm not totally convinced that he's aware that he's done anything wrong. He may have a certain... "divergent view" of things than most people. Given the situation, I'm not sure blocking him for the 3RR is warranted, as he doesn't seem to even understand what the 3RR is, let alone the general concepts involved in editing the 'pedia. Given that, I'd ask Snowspinner to drop the block to 48 hours total, removing the 24 he stated was for the 3RR and leaving the 48 for general disruption (at his discretion of course, I have no opinion on that matter). If anyone is interested, I will forward them a copy of the email as an explanation of what I mean about his POV on reality. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 19:43, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On their own user space, people should be able to write a review with spoilers or opinions that might be considered POV in the article space. We give more freedom to users on how to maintain their user page. This is well known and many examples of that can be cited. Please see <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMINDBOMB_d594.html" title="User:MINDBOMB">User:MINDBOMB</a> as an example of anti-Islamic diatribe on his page. We usually do not edit war by deleting and inserting stuff on someone's user page without their permission, unless the page is grossly abusive. More troubling, however, was 3 days block by Snowspinner, who blocked him without even checking carefully that the 4th edit was not even a revert. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 20:22, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For anyone interested, Snowspinner blocked him again by giving this reason on the talk page: "I see your response to being unblocked was to rant about how your beliefs will not be removed and to delete Cyrius's comments again. Have a nice 48 hour block." However, Dante Alighieri unblocked him today (February 17th) and the incident Snowspinner refers to happened yesterday, February 16th or even earlier February 15th. There are no edits by John-1107 on February 17th. So not only Snowspinner did not apologize for his wrongful earlier block, he again blocked him by claiming something that is factually incorrect <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 23:05, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I corroborate Vsmiths complaint. I also note that JG has, rather recently, been warned (feb 7th), then banned for 8 hours <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive6_ed4f.html#User:JonGwynne" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive6">(feb 8th)</a>, then banned for 24 hours <a href="#User:JonGwynne_.28I.29" title="">(feb 16th)</a>. I therefore request a longer ban this time. Also, JG has taken to labelling his reverts as "not a revert", which is extremely bad form. At no time has he shown any contrition.

<dd>I can't block for more than 24 hours what ever happens (under the 3RR rule anyway). Personaly I make it 3.5 revets in total (and we don't reconise partial revets).

For example, he deleted the entire sections titled "1.1 Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism", "2 Manifestations of the new anti-Semitism", "2.1 False allegations", "2.2 Antisemitic cartoons" etc. from the article four times.

<p>My edits from 02:27–03:00, 17 Feb 2005 were just that — edits. They were not a reversion to any prior version. You seem to be saying that any edit of any kind to a page constitutes a "first revert" for purposes of the 3RR rule. That is a novel theory. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:58, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No it's pretty standard the whole complex revert thing appears to have gone way beyond the idea of preventing gameing of the system <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 05:03, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If that is the case then both <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> pages need to be modified substantially to clarify this. The latter page says a "revert" means going back to an earlier version, or undoing something. Apparently you are using a different definition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or perhaps there is a very broad definition of "undoing". For instance, if an article contains the word "interesting" and you edit it to "fascinating", then you have "undone" the work of whoever who originally wrote "interesting" (perhaps many months and versions ago) and this counts as the "first revert".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This means we have to distinguish carefully between edits that only add text without modifying ("undoing") one comma of existing text and edits that do modify existing text. Again, this requires substantial changes to both <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> pages. In the former case, there is a "three revert rule"; in the latter it is a "one edit, two reverts" rule.</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... I think that this is not such a good idea. I think we should take each offensive username as it comes through. Incidently, I permanently blocked SS-88 for making a threat against me (check my talk page).

<dd>For one thing, people can have 88 in their user name for perfectly normal reasons, such as being born in the year 1988. For another, it isn't really offensive per se, because hardly anybody actually knows what it's code for. Let them have these user names if they want, as that'll make them easier for us to identify and track any POV editing. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:13, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'll go one better. I will ban anyone who is being in-your-face about being a Nazi. This is not because they are a Nazi. This is because, just like User:Fuckmeuptheass would not be an effective editor regardless of his or her contributions, an admitted Nazi is going to be a perpetual troll by nature. Said person is not banned - but the account with "Heil Hitler" in the name most certainly is, as is the userpage full of Nazi symbols. Aside from offensiveness, doing so is an implicit threat against any editors who may be Jews, Catholics, or otherwise, and generally makes editing Wikipedia, well, harder. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:56, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Frogs. John05 is almost certainly the same person (or, as Dan suggests, it some sort of bet/competition), as they are deleting the same material. I don't get Philidias though - why add some real content, and then do the vandalism thing? Irritation that their changes were not 100% accepted? Who knows. But mass deletion of content like that is definitely borderline vandalism, even from someone who did contribute something. John05 is just a plain vandal, though - I left them a test3 message. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 22:10, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Explanation received by email:</p>
<pre>
 I am truly very sorry that I was editing the parts out.
 The reason I did it is because I too paragraphs and put
 it in my paper- bibliography paper of lorenzo de' medici.
 I know that I shouldn't do that, but I didn't think at that
 time it was plargarism, and the teacher said in class that shes
 punishing people for it.  I won't ever copy something again.
 Please if you can take the article down for 1 week, or put it
 the way I had it. She hasn't graded my paper yet.  Thanks for
 reading my email

<dd>Ah. Blast. Well, that certainly explains it. The thing is that even if we <i>did</i> change our copy of the page, because Google caches copies of pages, searching for the text they copied would probably hit on Google even if our copy has been updated.</dd>
<dd>I'm really sorry for them, but I'm afraid they are going to have to face the music. I'll leave them a note explaining the Google issue, and suggesting they go talk to their teacher right away - getting in front of it's probably better than letting her find it out. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:25, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's even worse than I realized before: Wikipedia content is copied by <i>lots</i> of sites, which <i>also</i> update their local copies rather slowly. And Google has indexed all them too. So, basically, they're stuck - if someone searches for the text this person used, they will find it, no matter what we do on the page here. Basically, this person is trying to put the milk back in the cow - can't be done.</dd>
<dd>I left notes explaining all this; you might want to email them a copy if they don't read it off their talk page. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:44, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have now exchanged several email messages with this person. He didn't understand the problem with mirrors until after the third message. After that he insisted that we should add a line to the article explaining that parts of it were contributed by him. This is of course unacceptable for many reasons. So there's nothing we can do to help him, and there's no reason we should -- he cheated and should take responsibility for it himself.</p>
<p>On a related note, could text removal or rewording for similar reasons be a common phenomenon on Wikipedia?</p>

<dd>Sure, no biggie. Interesting suggestion about this happening on other articles - something to keep in mind. Oh, FWIW, our miscreant could certainly truthfully claim to his teacher that he did contribute <i>some</i> text to the article - alas, just not the stuff he used in his paper! Of course, if the teacher looks at the history, they will certainly notice the student doing something odd to the contents... <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 23:26, 22 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User and I imagine sysop <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">Aloan</a> pulled the debate at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a> on moving this article to <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafari.html" title="Rastafari">Rastafari</a> after 4 days, whereas it should be 5. Much worse he claimed there was no consensus to move the article, though a simple count indicated 4 votes in favour of the move and one against. He also ignored the fact that there is a clear consensus with no opposition to removing the disambiguation page and redirecting <a href="../../../r/a/s/Ras_Tafari_0c0a.html" title="Ras Tafari">Ras Tafari</a> to <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haile_Selassie_fb29.html" title="Haile Selassie">Haile Selassie</a>. User:Guettarda, another of the ayes, directed me here. Please can we have a rapid solution to this, either accepting the present consensus or reputting the article on the Requested moves page. I did not put the article on the requested moves pages so that an administrator could ignore the consensus. I have written to ALoan, and await a reply. This is a highly sensitive subject because the title is offensive to Rasta believers, and because it is a debate about whether we use an white middle class outsiders terms to discuss a group that are anything but. I feel ALoan has been very brute in his approach to it, and please can an admin take a look, and ideally take over from ALoan. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:17, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, they're certainly not obviously visible to everyone, however: 1) if you click on "what links here" (for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Edge_of_darkness" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Edge_of_darkness" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> ) you will get "Edge of darkness is stupid!" which is certainly an odd thing to see when you are checking for internal links. 2) the original vandal knows they are there; maybe that doesn't matter, but I hate the idea of them having the satisfaction of creating a vandal page, even if it is only a redirect. Maybe that's a trivial reason. There might be other reasons I'm not thinking of. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 04:56, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lol, liar. You should note that the anon IP you blocked has been unjustly blocked as it later turned out for reverting an admin-contribution two times. It's so easy to forget parts of the truth, isn't it, James? Though, I shouldnt have participated in the edit war, I know, 'twas childish, very indeed. Anyway it is just so great James still cares about me. He's like a real father already. LOL no really, he's always there. But we should work on our relationship a bit. Soooooo.... fine. goodnight and thanks for that comment - it made me smile again, James. No, really. =) And drop a comment or two on my new user page (james knows what I mean). You must be happy too after having me caught acting stupid :) Cya145.254.135.170 00:18, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Comment</i>, I think in this case the anon had a better version of the page (less POV). However, I would urge both to take their differences to the talk page and discuss it there. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 00:47, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no preference. I merely reported it after seeing them revert <b>well over 3 times</b> - I had absolutely nothing to do with it (I never even read the edits mind you) and IMHO it was the right thing to do to report it or am I mistaken about what this page is for? I have absolutely no idea WTF he's refering to above either. Anyone with a pair of eyes can look through the history and see he wasn't "unjustly" blocked - EVEN IF someone were to think what he was saying had any truth then that should make him more aware of the rule and the consequences than anyone else. Today he reverted over 10 times, same with the person involved. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 01:49, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I blocked all the socks and the main account as imminent dangers - she basically gave away her password for plausible deniability. Cheers to Jguk for being on the ball.

<p>That isn't the reason I gave up my password - think about it; I knew that it would be quickly blocked (I had expected it to be more rapid, but obviously you are slower and less observant than I had given credit for).</p>
<p>I gave Rienzo my password for two reasons; firstly I had no further need for it - my other accounts are quite happily editing unnoticed, especially since they have a quite different IP being from 1/2 way accross the world; secondly, I thought it amusing to undermine Rienzo's continual use of sockpuppets with varations on the theme of "CheeseDreams", by giving him all of the said accounts, whilst I use.</p>
<p>I had planned for this event pretty much since the beginning - which is why I made all the sock puppets obvious, and using the same password - it saves me effort by having them all blocked when I release the password of just one of them. The only reason to continue CheeseDreams, is to tidy up loose ends. Everything is, surprisingly, going to plan, and apart from the fact that I am going to have to run last nights observations again today due to an inconvenient bird, and the fact that george's arm is in plaster so he can't do much typing, I'm quite happy with the situation.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am surprised you haven't worked any of this out, but then, if a fundamentalist had any intellect they would realise how fatally flawed fundamentalism is. Nethertheless, it amuses me watching you seeking to supress truth you are too frightened to face or attempt serious argument against. Rienzo just amuses me full-stop. I also find it amusing watching you seek to try to exert some kind of authority over me.</p>

<dd>Me, I'm not sure why moving pages should be a generally permitted action. The potential for abuse, as we've seen, far outweighs (at least on Wikipedia) any positive effects. Other than archiving (which can be done other ways), in what way is allowing (say) non-admins to move pages desirable? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 16:28, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Me too. With normal vandalism admins are at a distinct advantage over the vandal because of the rollback feature which allows us to undo with one click what a vandal took at least two. With page move vandalism the opposite is true, we have to delete the orginal page, move the page back then delete the redirect. We rally do need to tip the balance back in the good guys favour. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(The snott rake)</a> 18:31, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I favour the solution to make rollback work on page moves. The page would automatically be moved back and the redirect deleted.

<dd>Creating a redirect called A with the summary "A moved to B" is indistinguishable from moving page A to B.

<dl>
<dd>From the ArbCom ruling:
<dl>
<dd>2.2) For a period of one year, Everyking is prohibited from reverting articles relating to Ashlee Simpson except in cases of clear and obvious vandalism (as per definition at Wikipedia:Vandalism), with penalties as per the Wikipedia:Three revert rule. What constitutes a revert shall be left up to adminstrators' discretion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My reading of that is that you are prohibited from reverting any article in which Ashlee Simpson is referred to. This means no reverts to <a href="../../../2/0/0/History_of_SNL%7E2000-2010_0186.html" title="History of SNL:2000-2010">History of SNL:2000-2010</a>, no reverts to <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, and for that matter, no reverts to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_c089.html" title="Red Bull">Red Bull</a> (there used to be a "trivia" section stating that Ashlee Simpson liked Red Bull). On the other hand, you can revert <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> to your heart's content (within the limits of the 3RR, of course). --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 04:16, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I would emphatically reject such an interpretation.

<dd>I would say that the spirit of the ruling decrees that Everyking is prohibited from reverting articles which are directly related to Ashlee Simpson, as well as any Ashlee Simpson-related material in any articles which are not directly related to Ashlee Simpson.

<p>The parole is against reverting "articles related to Ashlee Simpson". As a matter of proper English construction that means that there needs to be a close relationship between the article topic and Ashlee Simpson. A mere mention of Simpson does not make an article "related" to Simpson. Just as a mention of, say, a trip by George W Bush to Europe would not make the George W Bush article Europe-related. If the ArbCom meant to say Everyking shouldn't revert <i>material</i> relating to Ashlee Simpson, then they should have come out and said it. But they didn't, they said reverting Ashlee Simpson-related <i>articles</i> - and the Community should, IMO, enforce what the ArbCom actually said, and nothing else, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 09:20, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where does the arbcom ruling say "closely related to Ashlee Simpson"? It says, "related to Ashlee Simpson", period. It's very clear what they meant, and your interpetation is not compatible with Everyking's parole. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 09:25, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be precise the Arbcom ruling was that Everyking is "...prohibited from reverting <i><b>articles</b></i> relating to Ashlee Simpson..." (my emphasis). If they had meant "material", they would have said it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whilst the ArbCom remedy is clearly restricted to "articles relating to Ashlee Simpson" and we shouldn't give this phrase a wider meaning than it does in everyday English, it is also clear that Everyking would be well-advised to think very carefully about reverting Ashlee Simpson material - perhaps even to the extent of not doing so, but leaving a message on the talk page to invite other readers to do so. The ArbCom noted that "Everyking, outside of edits concerning Ashlee Simpson, is generally considered by the community to be an excellent editor", and Everyking would do well to reflect on that, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 09:33, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) I think you're splitting hairs regarding "articles relating to Ashlee Simpson": an article which includes information specifically referring to Ashlee Simpson automatically and immediately by the inclusion of said information becomes an article relating to Ashlee Simpson (as compared to, as Everyking tried to fudge it with his <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> example, merely having Ashlee Simpson as part of its category). As an imperfect analogy, note CheeseDream's restrictions on editing Christianity-related articles -- and the claim that such restrictions don't apply to CheeseDreams editing articles on Jesus himself (or Himself, if you prefer). Obviously absurd, and similiar to the argument being floated here.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1a) Everyking himself, in his defense of his actions, said <i>They aren't <b>directly</b> related to Ashlee</i> (emphasis mine), meaning he <b>does</b> consider them to be related to Ashlee Simpson, just not directly. However, the ruling doesn't make the fine distinction Everyking puts on it (<i>articles relating to Ashlee Simpson</i>), so by Everyking's own intepretation he violated the ruling and he knows it.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Ultimately, though, my arguments in #1 &amp; 1a are moot except as a rebuttal to <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> and an interpretation of the mindset of <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a>: as far as interpreting the letter of the ruling and making arguments based on that -- well, it's pretty pointless, since in the American legal system, at least, appeals courts all the way up to the US Supreme Court level frequently attempt to divine the intent of the legislature(s) in ambiguous cases of interpretation. In those cases, courts have to rely upon records of the debate, etc. Here, we just have to ask the ArbCom people who voted what they intended. Period. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 10:56, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>British courts too look at the intention of ambiguous legislation. However, where there is no ambiguity, they have no choice but to go with the words that are written. There is no ambiguity here. Similarly, CheeseDreams was correct in asserting that the article on "Jesus" was not Christianity-related. This is a simple case of English construction. I do not see how the words of the ArbCom used in their ordinary meanings can be interpreted as widely as you say they should be.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now I accept the problem here may be in badly worded decisions from the ArbCom (I'm afraid that the new Arbitrators, whilst having many qualities, and whilst having sped up the process, tend to be somewhat imprecise with their wording of remedies). Maybe the ArbCom did mean the parole to refer to reverting all Ashlee Simpson-related material. I can certainly see that such a parole would have been consistent with the findings of fact (and would certainly, IMO, have been a better remedy than the one that passed). But it's not up to you or me to change the wording of the remedies: this remedy is clear - and it is clear that Everyking's interpretation of the remedy as worded by the ArbCom is correct, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 11:06, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You realize that the third sentence of your first paragraph is immediately contradicted by the first sentence of your second paragraph? (<b>There is no ambiguity here</b> versus <b>Now I accept the problem here may be in badly worded decisions from the ArbCom</b>). Also, by the fact we're having this argument, I maintain that <b>[t]here is no ambiguity here</b> is <i>a priori</i> false, and you're attempting to handwave around the issues to avoid ArbCom actually clarify the issue? If it's as clearcut as you say, then the ArbCom members will agree with and there was no harm in asking them; if not, then you were wrong on the claimed unambiguity and on your interpretation. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 11:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Arbitrators may have intended the revert parole to refer to Ashlee Simpson-related <i>material</i>, rather than <i>articles</i>, but that is conjecture on my part. I should add that we who are not mindreaders should not block a user based on our conjectures. Nor should we look to overextend the parole, just because we might have decided the matter differently. Certainly I see Carnildo's reading of that is that Everyking is "prohibited from reverting any article in which Ashlee Simpson is referred to", which is incredibly wide - and would mean that Everyking could break his revert parole by reverting material that had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Simpson, but happened to be in an article mentioning Simpson elsewhere, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 13:43, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyking is right.

<p>The Arbcom may hear this as a group and come to a different conclusion than I do. For me the operant language in our ruling is "What constitutes a revert shall be left up to adminstrators' discretion." So if an administrator feels that Everyking has reverted an article related to Ashlee Simpson, then the 3RR penalty applies. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 22:52, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed they may. As a point of construction, what is left to adminstrators' discretion is whether any edit is a revert. Determining what constitutes an Ashlee Simpson-related article is not left to adminsitrators' discretion - and neither should it be, as what constitutes an Ashlee Simpson-related article is a matter of fact, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 23:16, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter.

If you are <b>not</b> an admin, and feel the same, then bring this to an admin's attention so that the admins can apply the admin's discretion, either way, to the matter at hand. Thus, any actions by Everyking that are reverts can be punished, while actions that are not, won't. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 16:21, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh, no, if the admin's discretion is <i>wrong</i>, then actions that are not reverts <i>will</i> be "punished". And so far, every time an admin has blocked me they have done so wrongfully. So clearly there is some sort of problem that needs to be addressed. I would say that the problem is leaving the matter to admins' discretion when there are several admins who loathe me and will block me on the slightest pretext. That other admins might feel differently does me no good, because it only takes one. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:59, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, if that's the problem, you've got few options, IMO. The arbitration committee ruling clearly states admin's discretion. That's the letter of the law as handed down by the committee, and the letter clearly allows any and all admins to block you if they believe you did a revert. If you feel that an admin is abusing their power by blocking you wrongfully because of a personal vendetta against you, you can still go through the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process against that blocking admin. Your opinions may be biased, as may the opinions of the blocking admin, but the dispute resolution process can bring in neutral/outside people who can provide an opinion on matters. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:19, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think RickK is on the arbitration committee; if you make a request for comment, he's just one voice (or you can ask that he not be involved); and if you make a request for mediation, you can specifically ask that RickK not be involved. In addition, if you feel that RickK is abusing his powers of adminship (or doing anything else wrong), you can also specifically ask for a dispute resolution regarding *his* behaviour. There are plenty of people out there who can look at an Everyking vs. RickK dispute without being biased either way. The arbitration committee's ruling is quite explicit about all admins using their discretion, not just the ones that you don't have a beef with, so you're going to have to go through normal dispute resolution procedures with this, IMO. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:48, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I rather object here. The <i>edit/revert</i> of 17:28 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Concerned_Scientists&amp;diff=10468004&amp;oldid=10466560" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Concerned_Scientists&amp;diff=10468004&amp;oldid=10466560" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> simply wiped out virtually all of my edits of 19 Feb. plus a bit more with only minor addition of anything. Looks like a <i>complex revert</i> to me. Compare my edits of 19 Feb. here combined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Concerned_Scientists&amp;diff=10466560&amp;oldid=10415435" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Concerned_Scientists&amp;diff=10466560&amp;oldid=10415435" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. The changes I made on the 19th were apparently mainly affecting previous edits by JG. Also, the 23:01 (the first of two simultaneous edits) referred to by WMC was a labeled revert. JGs <i>"Don't forget"</i> comment above is misleading and evidence of attempting to confuse and subvert the system. -<a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 02:42, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am agreeing with Vsmith here, all 4 edits are reverts, including 17:28 and most definitely 23:01! I also really don't like JonGwynne's misleading and confusing comments, especially writing between the lines of other users comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=10476056&amp;oldid=10476021" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=10476056&amp;oldid=10476021" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. This makes the whole discussion hard to read and difficult to follow. About the 3RR: I would support a block of JonGwynne for this 3RR. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 03:49, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite. JonGwynne made 3 edits on Feb 8 &amp; 9.

<p>A bit of detective work by myself and others on the IP of the Nazi troll who has been around for the past week or so reveals him coming from the Tor network. This network consists of loads of proxy machines which hide the true IP of anyone who uses Tor. Every one of these proxies will need to be blocked!(All 117 of them) Please help. Put {{BlockedProxy}} as the reason for the block and indefinite as the duration of the block. Come back here and delete the ones that you blocked from this list so that people wont waste their time blocking already blocked machines.

<dd>If you think it is possible, I will try for a 3RR block. The link he is adding to Open Gaming is not a spam link, although it is a self-post to his own blog so I'm not sure if it qualifies as spam. Given the above, would a 3RR block be possible? Would it also be possible to block the proxy editor accoutns as well? --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 10:15, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if the proxy accounts turn out to be <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock-puppet_accb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock-puppet">Wikipedia:Sock-puppets</a>, yes they could be blocked for that. But if they are real, independent people, they could only be blocked if they violated the rules.

<dd>True, I'm not an admin. If I was, I would have already given a collective 3RR block to the offending parties. I was just remembering the CheeseDreams/Tigermoon saga, where it was determined that, since Tigermoon was editing at the specific direction of CheeseDreams, it should be treated as if Tigermoon <i>was</i> CheeseDreams. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:33, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, what I meant was that if an account was a true sock-puppet, it could be blocked indefinitely, simply for being a sock (intended to avoid policy), and we wouldn't have to worry about it again; but if it were a proxy (i.e. another real person), all that happens is that the proxy gets counted in with the original user for 3RR violations, i.e. you'd have to keep an eye on them. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:41, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two points. One, Everyking would be well advised to steer clear of editing anything to do with Ashlee Simpson. Two, Carlton would be well advised to stop getting into edits wars with and goading Everyking. Both users are disrupting Wikipedia.

<dd>Three points. One, my name is <b>Calton</b>, as it plainly says in my signature: not "Carlton" and not "calt", and you would be well advised to read before responding. Two, Everyking is enjoined from any reversion at all of any Ashlee Simpson-related articles-- any of them, no matter how many hairs you, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a>, split over the meaning of the phrase -- and he had THREE bites of that apple before I reported him here. This is because of <b>his</b> behavior, and if there's an edit war going on, it's Everyking versus the World. Three, your posts indicate that you fundamentally misunderstand the issues involved, so you would be well advised to butt out of things you don't understand. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 23:59, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>but he isn't banned from repeated editing of an article. You could argue that is is a complex revert but I don't think it is. The disputed passage has been taken out of the article now anyway <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:53, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He deleted the entry several times before the ArbCom clarification, and once that came down, he kept reverting the entry to his version of events. Yes, the last few have not been simple "click-here-to-edit-the-old-version" reverts, but reversions they've been. It boils down to Everyking having a version that satisfies him -- and only him -- and that's explicitly not allowed. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 23:59, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
