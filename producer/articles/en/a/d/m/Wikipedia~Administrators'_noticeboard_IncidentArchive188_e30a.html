These are especially unacceptable, since he has been handing out long blocks to (possibly shared) IP addresses, for minimum rationale. Not only may this result in collateral damage, but it is also basically wrong, for the simple fact that it makes wikipedia out to be an autocracy with admins holding the reins of power. The basic fact is that <b>anon IPs should and are allowed to edit</b>, and there can be no reason to deny that basic fact of a <b>free</b> encyclopedia.</p>
<p>In most of these cases, he has blocked the offenders without proper warning, not even a generic message, such as {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest5_8993.html" title="Template:Test5">test5</a>}}. Also, he has, in some cases failed to revert the vandalistic edits, for example:</p>

<dd>No such thing as a vandalism only account when it is an IP - it is, by definition not an account. This is very troubling. Have you spoken to him about it?

<dd>In the first example listed, I gave an indefinite anon-only block because there was a message from the ISP apparently asking for that on the talk page. In other cases where I've blocked shared ISPs (usually US educational establishments), it seems to me that there is a duty on the schools to monitor pupil activity, which of course is easily done.</dd>

<dd>On another side note, I have indefinitely softblocked IPs when there's been no good edits. A lot of these are school IPs. Anyone who wishes to edit from such an IP can still log in and do so. Static IPs are also potentially subject to lengthy blocks if they are clearly static and clearly solely used for badness. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone talked to him about why we don't indef block IPs? Before taking this to RFC, try communication. I don't see any lasting harm here that couldn't be fixed in a minute or two. 6 months is acceptable for a static IP with persistent vandalism problems. Tone the other blocks down to a few months, bring him up to speed on why, and move on - unless there's more to things than this thread indicates. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 23:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I engaged him on his talk page and pointed out that WP:BLP requires the removal of <b>controversial</b> uncited items from a biography, but his reply was that since we have no way of knowing what items may be controversial to the subject, everything uncited must be removed. This deletion in particular is a good example. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Abagnale&amp;diff=103741041&amp;oldid=103730146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Abagnale&amp;diff=103741041&amp;oldid=103730146" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>I <b>strongly</b> support the first diff (Frank Abagnale). That is precisely what admins and other experienced users should be doing, aggressively, and blocking people who refuse to write appropriately. (Not blocking people just for doing it once or twice, mind you, we do still practice WikiLove, but people who <b>refuse</b> have to be blocked.). As for the 2nd diff, it seems a bit aggressive, but the article was pretty awful, so I see no major problem.

<dd>On the contrary, people who write BLPs without strictly citing their sources show a serious lack of respect <i>for the subject</i>, <i>their readers</i>, and <i>other Wikipedians</i>.

<dd>This edit on Cyberanth's talk page suggests suggests that the disruption is intentional, and designed to provoke a response. <b>that Hank Aaron was elected to the hall of fame" - I do not know hardly a thing about Aaron, so that can absolutely be a controversial statement, given that it is not verifiable. Cite it. That shows you care. CyberAnth 03:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</b>. Yes, Hank Aaron being elected to the hall of fame is SO controversial. Obviously, it is easily cited, but his actions here are disrespectful to the work of editors. The stubbing of this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claudio_Abbado&amp;diff=103766335&amp;oldid=103764889" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claudio_Abbado&amp;diff=103766335&amp;oldid=103764889" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> removed completely neutral information from an article that only gets a couple of edits a month and probably doesnt have people watching it, so what is he expecting to accomplish here other than to destroy months of work by editors who had no other intention than to contribute to wikipedia. The information removed is not controversial in the least. Additionally when I pointed out that in his initial stubbing, he left nothing but the date of birth, he went back and deleted that as well <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a><a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 05:01, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is patently ridiculous. You are trying to impose a new interpretation of BLP which says that EVERY statement should be deleted if it is not sourced. BLP has never been interpreted that strictly. Current BLP policy requires the citing of potentially controversial statements, but you are redefining EVERY statement as potentially controversial to force citing of every statement.

I have not looked at every one of these edits, and some of them may well be valid, but to use just two examples he has removed from the Hank Aaron article the fact that Aaron was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame and removed from the article on golfer Tommy Aaron every bit of information in the article save for his name and profession, including his finishing places in various golf tournaments. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> exists to make sure that libel is not placed in wikipedia and specifically mandates that only controversial information should be deleted. None of the information presented above, and presumably most of the rest of the material removed, has been challenged by anyone or could fit into a rational definition of controversial. Furthermore, the user did not attempt to resolve what problems he claimed existed through dialogue on the talk page of the article or through use of tags. I posted about the issue on his talk page, and he was unapologetic. I reverted some of the changes and he immediately reverted me.

<dd>Suppose of every four edits CyberAnth removes three uncontroversial and sourcable but currently-unsourced statments and one instance of potentially libelous misinformation?</dd>
<dd>Jimbo Wales as quoted in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, "I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons."</dd>
<dd>Once again, life isn't a game (and I note CyberAnth's involvement in both threads.) Wikipedia must not do capricious harm to real-world individuals, however valid our inside-the-box concerns may be. Talk of wiki consensus and congenial editting is valid in itself, but in such situations is beside the point.</dd>

<p>(unindent) I'm getting deja-vu over this. There was a similar problem, as I mentioned above, with the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> article where the entire thing was blanked under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> as unsourced. The outcome of that was that the blanking was the right thing to do. I think this block is out of line and the editor is doing a good job in removing some of the large amount of unsourced information from the site.</p>
<p>Every article on this site has at least one editor who has worked on it. If another editor comes along and deletes info as unsourced and doesn't actively try and source it himself, instead of revert warring over it or violating <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by re-inserting it without a source, why don't we leave the community to re-add it with the citations? We have policies, why are we telling off and blocking an editor who is editing in good faith to enforce them? It just doesn't make any sense. If we do that then we are just going to drive editors who do controversial but good things away.</p>
<p>As CyberAnth states, the burden of evidence is on the editor who adds or restores the info and re-adding it without a source is against policy.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 12:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. Only properly sourced information should be added to an article, especially where living people are concerned. CyberAnth is correct in removing and challenging information that was added without a source. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFrise_d673.html" title="User talk:Frise">Frise</a> 14:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are we really changing the policy to one of 100% Citation at all times? That is patently Absurd. If that's done, it would kill the project, because it disregards <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/_/WP%7ECS_79c7.html" title="WP:CS">WP:CS</a> entirely. to go back to the Hank Aaron example above, we should erase such things as Aaron being a baseball player, male, black, living(or dead), american, and so on. Looking at a number of the articles Cyberanth has blanked or reduced, they now are completely non-notable people, given the lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> information there. I think CyberAnth's next step it to recover his ground and nominate all such articles for deletion on teh grounds of unsubstantiated notability. I have always been under the impression that Verifiable and Controversial were two entirely different priniciples here. Instead, CyberAnth has taken the interpretation that anything NOT citation verified is by its very nature a Controversial statement. I think this is a bad direction for Wikipedia to go in, but I look forward to watching CyberAnth's behaviors spread. When Thousands of editors are marginalized by having any and all work they've done deleted, and quit, I think we'll see the folly of assuming that 'Hank Aaron was a baseball player.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>' is a good way to be.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 15:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've bashed heads with Cyberanth numerous times. I think he is often a very good editor. Cyberanth is sometimes a big problem though. The problem is not in erverting or removing a small bit of text in one article though. All editors do that from time to time. The problem is that he gets in a mode of deleting large chunks of material, in a a great many articles to the point of disrupting editing by other editors on those articles, and Wikipedia wide when we get into these long discussions. It is a variation of the same old deletionist argument, applied to the specific case. Cyberanth is a deletionist, for good or for bad, and spends mos of his time deleting other peoples work. In some cases, the work deleted is garbage and opinion that is not, or can not be sourced. In some cases, it is perfectly good material that has not yet been sourced, but would be, given time. If Cyberanth's method of operation was one based on consensus, discussing the faults of a given article in detail in cooperation with other working on the article, and eventually removing material that no one could, or was willing to source, then we would not be discussing his actions over and over and over. His method of operation is to blindside editors who have worked together for weeks or months on an article by swooping into an article and removing the bulk of an article, making it a stub. The editors of that article become angry that their efforts are swept aside by someone who has not bothered to even explain to them on the discussion page what the problems are. At best the edit summary gives a vague reference to Wikipedia policy on providing sources, often not even that. If Cyberanth removed material from articles where no one was contributing or editing, or after a discussion with editors, no one would be complaining.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the problem is not whether or not it is okay to remove unsourced material. The problem is the method of operation. Cyberanth is not interested in communication, negotiation, or working towards consensus with others. Cyberanth is entitled to work on Wikipedia however he pleases. But, when that method becomes dysfunctional, and creates more negatives than positives wikipedia wide, then it is necessary to take action, such as this block. The block is appropriate and necessary. Cyberanth may be insulted, but that is needed to get his attention. Eventually he will get that disrupting other editors on wikipedia is not acceptable, and that editing wikipedia cooperatively with others is necessary. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 15:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it might be argued that Cyberanth was a bit over the top here, I don't think too far so. I've really never understood the constant objection to sourcing "obvious" information. If it's so obvious, it's trivial to find sources! I've found tons with just a cursory Google search, and probably <i>any given one</i> could source 95%, if not 100%, of that disputed "obvious" information all on its own. If information really is obvious and widely known, then it's widely stated and widely sourced! If not, maybe it's not really so "obvious". <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 15:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that is what the problem is. Cyberanth could have gone to baseballhalloffame.com and cited the claim in under 30 seconds. The user didn't do this, because they are being disruptive to make a point and if it hadn't been that particular "fact" in question, the user would have just choosen another article to go after. And that is where to no-no is. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 16:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, that editor inserting has the burden of proof. We are discussing CyberAnth's actions and whether they were appropriate, disruptive, or both. It in my opinion that CyberAnth did not remove the unsourced material because it failed BLP; it was disruption to illustrate a point and had nothing to do with the original author's lapse in citing that <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Aaron_0d82.html" title="Hank Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>'s a retired professional baseball player in the hall of fame. For crying out loud, the encyclopedia Britannica is not aswath with this footnotes and citations. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_sources.html" title="Tertiary sources">Tertiary sources</a> are not written in the same manner that academic research and Wikipedia should not adopt the standards of academia. The sort of research and reference found in journals and trade publications that cite every single statement is because it is technically original research]] and we don't allow that no matter how many citations we use. I agree with the statement below that the application of BLP is getting out of hand. What's next, I cite a source and then have to source to source to prove it exists? This is policy wonking to the extreme and is in no way productive. In fact, it is destructive. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 17:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke">Teke</a>. Further, <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFrise_cfcb.html" title="User:Frise">Frise</a>, pleaes remember that many editors, especially newer ones, operate without the serious investment in time that learning the nuances of every wikipolicy takes. There are still dozens of policies and groups here at WP that I don't know, and I'm coming up on my first year anniversary(of membership), such as the OTRS remarked upon below. It is incumbent upon established editors and admins to HELP newer editors who edit in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> whereever possible. Without going being WP:Just plain obtuse, no one could argue that an editor who adds Hank Aaron's Hall of Fame status isn't acting in Good Faith. Such an edit should be supported by other editors, who can, as demonstrated, fix this in 2 minutes or less. If CyberAnth had gone through all those articles, tagging them wih the top of page uncited template and then hitting the talk page with a simple 'Hey, Let's work this weekend to fix this article's citation needed tag', he'd probably be collecting barnstars, not criticisms this weekend. Instead, he's deliberately AVOIDED explanations on some of the pages he's edited. CyberAnth has demonstrated that he can understand Wikipolicy when he wants to, but chose to disregard the spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> here in a big way, in favor of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. That picking and choosing bothers me greatly. I didn't see any controversies being debated at Hank Aaron, so the slower, measured style could've worked well there. Further, CyberAnth could've just picked an article and fixed it, then moved onto the next. Why didn't he do that? Finally, As I've mentioned before, CyberAnth has juxtaposed "Controversial" and "Uncited". There is NO controversy about the fact that Hank Aaron is a member of the HoF. The fact is, however, an uncited inclusion in the article. Not every uncited claim is by its nature controversial. Hank Aaron is male. That shouldn't need citation. Hank Aaron is alive. That shouldn't need citation. (and good luck getting a continuously current citation on that one.) There's <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMON_9dc8.html" title="WP:COMMON">WP:COMMON</a> to consider here. Certain facts shouldn't be removed because they are uncited. At best, they need a cite tag, and others are just going to have to remain uncited.(standard disclaimer - I am not an admin, if this is inappropriately posted here, please delete.) <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When the BLP policy was introduced it was originally for 'negative comments' and worked fine except for occasional disagreements about what was 'negative'. Then people suggested (correctly) that allowing unsourced 'positive comments' to remain could result in equally biased articles... just in the other direction. That was true, but IMO missing the point... nobody is going to <b>sue</b> Wikipedia for having unsourced <i>positive</i> comments about them. The BLP policy was changed so that any 'controversial comments' could be removed. Various people predicted that this would result in endless conflicts as there is always <i>someone</i> who will label <b>any</b> detail 'controversial' and then insist that they are allowed to edit war over it (free from 3RR violation no less). Sometimes the people restoring the comments are blocked, sometimes the people removing them are blocked, sometimes it turns into a massive mess like the above... but it is <b>always</b> disruptive and pointless. The BLP policy was enacted to protect Wikimedia from legal jeopardy. It allowed draconian reversion free from 3RR to achieve that aim. It <b>should not</b> have been expanded to cover things which do not place Wikimedia in legal jeopardy. We have long-standing procedures at the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy for handling unsourced claims in general... the special strictures of BLP should be restricted to claims which may be legally actionable. Not every fact someone decides to object to. Otherwise we will continue to have nonsense like the above over and over and over again. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>nobody is going to sue Wikipedia for having unsourced positive comments about them</i> - that is a bit presumptuous of you. What if the comment was a claim that a person had won a nobel prize. OK, the person in question wouldn't be doing any suing but the Nobel Foundation may... Many things that are seemingly innocuous can actually be a problem to people other than the person in question if it is belittling to their own achievements. Anyway, what I'm saying is that anything that is unsourced could be actionable on a BLP by that person or someone related to that fact... The idea of removing unsourced information is not new - it is one of the aspects of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the problem is the re-adding of info and anyone who is engaging in revert warring over re-adding such info should be blocked and not someone removing it. I think that those who are saying that CyberAnth's actions were wrong are incorrect, his actions are zealous but not wrong.

<dd>I agree with a lot of the spirit of CBD's comments, but at the same time, positive vs. negative is not always so clearcut. Saying that a person is gay would be viewed as negative by someone who believes homosexuality is wrong, but wouldn't be viewed as negative by many other people. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 17:11, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is another problem here. And that is with the fact that the authors of articles often object to 'non negative assertions'. And OTRS often has to pick this up. E.g a bio of Jean Smith says "she was once a director of firm xyz'. If Jean Smith contacts OTRS and says 'no I wasn't - and I object to being associated with them', The OTRS operative will remove the claim unless it is verified to the point that the complainant is obviously lying. In these cases putting <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> on it will not do. If the subject, or anyone claiming to be the subject, e-mails OTRS, or even edits the article themselves, then the default position should be that <i>any</i> unverified information can be removed and should not be replaced without solid verification. This isn't just about who can sue us, this is also about real people who have a right not to have us hosting potentially misleading unverified information about them. I will remove any unverified information from a biography in response to any OTRS request, and I expect it to stay removed unless verified.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 17:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's break it down then. There are some comments that almost everyone agrees are potentially negative/controversial/legally actionable (e.g. 'this person enjoys sacrificing puppies to Beelzebub', 'this person's parents hate them', 'this person has sex with &lt;whoever/whatever&gt;')... such comments should be covered by BLP. Then there are comments which seem innocuous to some and potentially controversial to others (e.g. 'this person is ## years old'). If we are contacted through OTRS or some other means and told that the person <b>does</b> object to some such statement then it falls under BLP and <i>must</i> be sourced for inclusion... any uncertainty has been removed by the person themself. However, extending BLP to cover seemingly innocuous statements that <b>anyone</b> objects to leads inevitably to continuous disputes like the above. We have a verifiability policy for that stuff. It still requires sources... it just doesn't give people a license to edit war over anything and everything. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:14, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So you are saying that we should allow unsourced information, that might mean people complain to Wikipedia, to be left in articles? Surely that is completely backwards. We should be striving to only include well sourced or blatantly obvious information (ie. water is wet) and anyone who tries to re-add unsourced information to an article is violating <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and in this case <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> as it could be seen as controversial (an example of something innocent - Jimbo recently posted regarding the date of birth on his article here saying that it was wrong and unsourced. Should we just slap an unsourced tag on it? No. We should remove it and only re-add it if it has a source).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 18:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You say that 'water is wet' is uncontroversial... I say that 'Hank Aaron is in the baseball hall of fame' is uncontroversial... but we see above how that worked out. Yes, "we should be striving to only include well sourced or blatantly obvious information"... which is what <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is for. We should absolutely follow that policy. When Jimbo says, 'hey my birth date is wrong' we should absolutely put that under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <i>However</i>, putting everything under BLP... even things that the person has not objected to and which there is no significant reason to think they <i>would</i> object to is a great way to cause massive pointless disruption... and not much else. It effectively means that all un-sourced statements in biographies of living people, sentences which mention living people, and/or sentences which mention groups that livng people belong to <b>can</b> be removed at will without restriction by 3RR. Note, we aren't saying that all these things <i>must</i> be removed... presumably because if we did the database size would be cut in half, but we are giving anyone who wants it free license to edit war over any and all pages they like. WP:V is a perfectly sound and reasonable policy which has been used to deal with unsourced statements for years. It can continue doing so just fine. There is no reason to extend BLP to cover objections to claims that 'water is wet'. If someone needs a citation for that they can go through WP:V procedures to get it... rather than using BLP as an excuse to edit war about it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there is a big difference between that situation and this one. If someone tells you that a piece of information in their article is false, then you have good reason to distrust the claim. If any editor actually distrusts a claim in an article, and the claim is uncited, he should remove it. This doesn't characterize CyberAnth's actions, however, because he was removing (among his numerous edits) facts that no reasonable person would distrust. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 01:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that Frise has done the right thing here. Yes, it is entirely possible that he could have done more... by going through this thoroughly horrible article and trying to extract the tiny handful of facts which are properly sourced. I hope that he, or someone, will take the time to do so... fact-by-fact, very carefully. But simply restoring the unsourced junk in this article and adding fact tags to it is not really enough. We must take quality very seriously, and this is precisely the intent of our ongoing efforts to raise quality standards. The version I just blanked contained such gems as an unsourced claim that Mr. Jeremy is known as a "The Hedgehog", that he was but is no longer capable of autofellatio, that he was arrested on two occassions, that he has had unprotected sex with thousands of people, that he claims to have had sex with 5000 women, etc. Are those claims true? Well, in the case of Mr. Jeremey who has admittedly led a colorful life, it seems likely that they are. But "it seems like something that could be true" must not be sufficient cause to re-introduce questionable material into Wikipedia, and if all that someone has time to do is nuke a bad article, the right response to those who want to restore it, is to restore it fact by fact, piece by piece, making absolutely certain that the quality is right.-- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> 07:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Jimbo, CyberAnth, CBD, Doc, and just about everyone else here as valid points have been raised from all sides about referencial information in BLPs. What I disagree with is the blanket application and methodology of the actions taken. I'd consider Ron Jeremy's nickname and other such "fact" to be trivial and unencyclopedic, even if it were sourced. Especially since it wasn't, kill it. But there is a huge, huge difference in <i>some</i> of the blankings. I would agree with 80% of them, but the ones that I do not I have a huge disagreement with, as in the much referenced Hank Aaron case.</dd>
<dd>As an example, last March there was a big hubub over at <a href="../../../n/e/i/Talk%7ENeil_Patrick_Harris_cfae.html" title="Talk:Neil Patrick Harris">Talk:Neil Patrick Harris</a> over whether or not the actor's speculated homosexuality warranted inclusion. I argued against inclusion, as there were no reliable sources or verification possible. If/when Harris "came out of the closet", it might merit inclusion then. The content was agreed to be removed, and when Harris declared his homosexuality publicly a month or so ago the information was reinserted, as now it met with BLP and WP:V. <i>No one ever blanked the fact that he is an actor, as that is not what BLP is for</i>. It simply is not. Removal of unreferenced, trivial, obscene, positive/negative, ORTS requests, etc is fine. Removal of the obvious to prove a point with a unilateral response of "It's policy that's what Jimbo says" is not working with the community and is not helping to resolve the issue at all. Jimbo is not our God, and policy is not law- certainly not strict interpretation. A unilateral approach that does not involve the <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">OFFICE</a> strangulates the goal of a shared effort. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know why we are still talking about it. It has been said over and over that the issue is in taking a legitimate policy, and pressing it to obscene ends to make a point, disrupting Wikipedia in the process. All of those changes could have been made in a graceful, cooperative, collaborative manner effectively, without upsetting anyone. That would have required more time, more patience, and more adept listening skills, but it would have been done according to the way we have all agreed to deal with each. How many more times will Cyberanth disrupt Wikipedia, step on a dozen or more editors toes, and get away with it while well meaning wikipedia look aside quoting wikipedia policy. Many of you keep turning your attention away from the poor communication, poor cooperation and disruption to explain how some small part of that process of disruption was beneficial. It doesn't matter whether 1% or 99% of the edits were legitimate, the intentional act of disrupting is the topic, not the method used to disrupt and insult other editors. Cyberanth should have been blocked two weeks ago when he disrupted wikipedia, and he should have been blocked again this time — not blocked for four hours, and then unblocked by another admin who disagreed with the previous admin. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 04:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a start, CyberAnth, if not a bit seemingly tongue-in-cheek. The objections that Atom, others and I have both been making is that there is <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a>, which is good, and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">making a point</a>, which is bad. Mixing up the two, which happened here, causes conflict and controversy and devolves the discussion into vague arguments where we're all trying to win. Thebainer pointed out good diffs, as most of them were (I have no comment on the rollbacks used). But there are instances in removing content where you know from experience that an edit summary, vague or explicit, will not suffice. Drop a note on the talk page before/after you do something like the Hank Aaron situation to get opinions. Without communication, both process and policy fail. It is a social interaction that builds the encyclopedia. I supported the block as preventative, at this point I support the unblock so that you may reply here. Either way, I think that the situation is done and there really is nothing more to say. Any other &lt;reporter&gt;alleged&lt;/reporter&gt; abuse of admin tools does not relate to this thread directly.

<dd>The reason people read encyclopedias is because they have an uninformed eye. The reason we have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is because of this.

<dd>Look, I'm not trying to be unfriendly, really. You aren't getting it still. No one is trying to divine your motivations, we are describing the results of your actions. The <i>results</i> of your <i>actions</i> (very strict interpretation/application of policy) was disruption (stepping on editors toes, breakdown in communication). Because this is the second time it has happened, and caused great disruption, and your continued argument is based on application of policy, it may give the appearance that you are trying to make a POINT. Regardless of whether that is true, and regardless of whether your intent is pure, or not, the result is the same. If you could please consider listening to a wide variety of people who offered advice here this time, here during the last brouhaha, and on your user page – to communicate with the editors on the talk page, and give them time to respond before applying policy in the manner you choose. This effort to work with others will take you more time, and slow the process, but the result will be the desired result (improvement of the article through additional citations, and removal of OR material) while at the same time using the consensus based approach that is the foundation of Wikipedia. I believe that most Wikipedia editors would say that an environment with more consensus and communication, at the cost of taking more time resolve loose ends in articles is preferred. Most of us vary somewhat from the median within a few standard deviations in how we communicate in working through issues. My opinion is that the result of your actions gives the appearance that you deviate substantially further than that. Enough so to outrage, upset and disrupt large numbers of otherwise reasonable and easy-going editors on multiple occasions. Moving from the bulldozer in the china shop to the bull in the china shop would be an improvement. As always, I wish you well. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 18:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am the person who reverted CyberAnth's original edit to the Guantanamo captive. I disagree with <a href="../../../b/a/i/User%7EBainer_b269.html" title="User:Bainer">User:bainer</a> on the appropriateness of the original bold excision, and his or her repeat of that bold excision. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AYakub_Abahanov&amp;diff=104139135&amp;oldid=103984884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AYakub_Abahanov&amp;diff=104139135&amp;oldid=103984884" rel="nofollow">replied</a> to his or her warning on the talk page. I tried my best to be civil in that reply. And I tried my best to be civil in a note I left on his or her talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I found the tone of the warning bainer left on the talk page inflammatory. It puzzled me, because I don't believe we have ever encountered one another before. And when I looked into bainer's contribution history, I was alarmed. The use of scornful language, the warnings in bold —— was I at risk of a sudden sanction?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if you administrators have a code of conduct you all agree to.
<ul>
<li>If you don't have one, I urge you to develop one.</li>
<li>If you do have one, I urge you to make it more prominently known.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>After some experience with grumpy or high-handed administrators I would urge you all to agree not to exercise your administrator privileges if you don't have the patience to attempt to make a civil answer to a civil question. If you don't have the time or energy to be patient to those who pose civil questions about your exercise of authority, then you don't have the time or energy to exercise your authority, and you should leave whatever raised your concern to other administrators who do have the time and energy to be civil.</li>
<li>Remember, if you leave scornful warnings the ordinary users to whom you addressed them have no way of knowing whether you might make a sudden rogue exercise of authority.
<ol>
<li>It would probably be best if you refrained from making any warnings whatsoever, unless you really were considering using your administrator's authority.</li>
<li>In that case you need to agree on the way in which you will inform the correspondent you are warning that you have administrator authority, and are considering using it..</li>
<li>If you have already participated in a thread, particularly if you had made even a small lapse from civility, you should consider taking off your administrator hat, recusing yourself, and asking another administrator to take a look and see if they share your concern.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I spent some time, a day or two ago, looking at this particular thread, because material I had added was in one of the articles under discussion. I saw that this discussion grew heated. Now that I have returned to it, I have a theory as to why bainer used such inflammatory language while addressing me. My theory now is that bainer got heated after reading the heated exchange here, and unloaded some of that heat on in their warning to me.</dd>

They don't care whether Wikipedia gets sued.

<p>This is a threat because he also appears to represent Free Republic in legal matters, and so is saying here (as I read this) 'do not put things I object to in the Free Republic article, or we will sue you.'</p>
<p>Now, he says it is no threat, and that he is here for reasons of pure altruism.</p>
<p>But I think it is more like when the mob sends people around to your place of business and says "Nice soda shop you have here. It would be a SHAME if something HAPPENED to it."</p>
<p>Now, he has threatened me with getting me blocked forever for mischaracterization. And maybe he will, though I am not attempting to mischaracterize anything at all. This is just how I read what I see here and how I react to this and his pattern of other statements and actions. If you want to make this into a mischaracterization and send me packing, fine. But I think this person is a danger to Wikipedia, and needs to be warned in the sternest of terms not to threaten and bully his way through content disputes. I wish I could let this matter drop, but my sense of duty demands that I try to do something about it. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 17:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Like Wikipedia, Free Republic is run by volunteers.<b>I am one of those volunteers, Im part of the Free Republic legal team.</b> I mentioned the TJ Walker article, however I most certainly did not impersonate him. I can only conclude that after I spoke with Carolyn [WMF Bookkeeper] the first time, she called TJ Walker herself and made a determination as to its authenticity and accuracy. Carolyn encouraged me to just open a Wikipedia account and remove the libelous material myself. I indicated to Carolyn, based on my review of the article and its Talk pages, that such an action would be like taking a stroll on the beach ... in Normandy on June 6, 1944. That remark has proven to be prophetic.</p>

<dd>Dino, regardless of your intentions, posting a comment stating that you are a part of the FR legal team and stating that you are here to prevent wikipedia getting sued, like someone else did, is what we class as a legal threat. It has the implication that if we don't do something then there will be a lawsuit brought against the site.</dd>
<dd>Stop threatening legal action. Also, I would advise looking at <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> with regards your involvement in the organisation. If there are legal issues you wish to discuss I would advise your organisation to contact the foundation directly. Any actions accompanied with what we see as threats are liable to get you blocked.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like Dino to document his claim that Jim Robinson is 'litigious'. I can find no cases other than Claridge suit and the Fresno 'hate group' settlement. Fred Phelps has filed 100's of cases. That's 'litigious'. Considering the things written about Free Republic, such as this article <a href="http://www.americanpolitics.com/sc20041108FreeRepublicHilarity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.americanpolitics.com/sc20041108FreeRepublicHilarity.html" rel="nofollow">American Politics Journal</a> (which is the same publication that Dino 'claims' he got to pull a 'libelous' article) I see no proof.

<dd>The bottom line is that the statement on the page is very close to a legal threat even if it isn't one (and it reads to me like it is so close that it doesn't make a difference). This would be unacceptable even if the individual in question didn't identify as being part of their volunteer legal team. As it is, this is so over the line it isn't funny.

<p>As has been said earlier, we can argue for a little while on whether or not there is an underlying legal threat with what's left on the user page but the fact is that it's too close for comfort.

<p>I think revert warring, in fact I think reverting without discussion, is not a good policy. There is no consensus for change on the page, clearly, so Ideogram ought not to have reinserted the same changes, but I think Irpen might have at least popped in to say that rather than just reverting. That said, Ideogram has been cautioned by many to cool it in several different areas. THAT said, I'm not sure I support Blnguyen's block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ideogram" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ideogram" rel="nofollow">log</a> and support Aaron's unblock.

<p>To try and modify a policy just because it fits a situation you're currently dealing with is a pretty poor way to deal with policies.

<dd>I totally agree with that and think that the proposed change, whatever the merits, isn't likely to stick now, consensus seems against it. What I'm saying though, is that I am not sure (I could be misreading the logs) that warning, then blocking without any intervening issues, will be be the best approach, which is why I support Aaron's unblock and ALSO think Ideogram has some thinking to do (see my talk page, i was asked to comment to Ideogram) and ALSO think that Irpen could have piped up on the talk page a little instead of just reverting. Hope that's clear.

<dd>Whenever I spot something where a closure might have been slightly wrong, or whatever, but a deletion review is not warranted, I tend to bring it up with the closing admin.

<dd>The precurser to this situation was discussed on a thread here on ANI last week arising from an indef block I gave to User:Claytonchilds89 (actually, I blocked him for authoring a series of what appeared to be vicious attack articles, although the subjects turned out to be fictional characters, "members" of the supposedly mythical but actually just hoaxical band that is the subject of the article). The AfD is headed to a foregone conclusion of delete and I considered speedying the article, but GunnerMike89 has indicated that if the article is deleted he's going to go away, plus when I saw this it was already days into the AfD and another user recommended that the process be completed to avoid drama, DRV, etc. Once the AfD is over I'd support (and issue) long-term blocks for any attempts at re-creating the hoax or any other nonsense. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was brought to my attention through <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2007_January_30_8eb7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2007 January 30">this AfD discussion</a>. "Zazzer" created the article in question, and I thought that this was rather strange because the article was an obvious hoax, but the user has a barnstar and is generally a good contributor. I concluded that the account had probably been compromised. What's the appropriate thing to do in this case? I didn't simply post on the talk page in case the compromiser was still using the account. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 03:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, he was repeatedly warned in the course of several days, and has been before, last year, when he and his friends first started it.

<p>3) "Fadix, don't overheat yourself in the hollow pursuit, your witch hunt against me (I'd be interested to find out which political party do I allegedly work for, among other weird allegations) is nothing new, and very typical of you." --AdilBaguirov 04:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 04:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is beginning to get out of hand. With the exception of one, every person 'voting' to keep this article has registered with Wikipedia for the sole purpose of writing about this practice, or, in most cases, for the purpose of voting at the AfD. Moreover, many of these editors are 'voting' more than once, by prefacing their long, rambling comments with a 'not delete' in bold each time they write something, which is misleading and annoying. The AfD is becoming unworkable because of the endless semiliterate maunderings posted there, and the puppetry (of whatever description). Can someone take a look and see what needs doing?

<dd>Yes, it's a mess, but it's not a speedy close as the article at least contains some tenuous claims to notability through media reports, and there are now a number of apparent bona fide "keep" opinions. Just keep applying {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpa_94ad.html" title="Template:Spa">spa</a>}} tags where necessary and the closing admin should discount those contributions. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hate to make a big issue out of this: anyway, I say, looks like he's done for the night.

<dd>In addition to the public evidence presented at Unblock-en-l, I also presented abundant evidence privately via e-mail to these administrators.

<dd>Dino - so H4672600 is your account too? Your admission of family members editing on your behalf is an admission of meatpuppetry, EXACTLY what the Admins on unblock L warned you about. Those emails are public, by the way. Any Wikipedian with a valid account can sign up to that list and read the archives, as I did, where I read the specfic, direct warning and instruction for you to NOT engage in meatpuppetry. Should I post it, or do you admit that they warned you about meatpuppetry? - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness &amp; Accuracy For All</a> 23:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It is not an attempt at mischaracterization! It is your own words, just typed here mere hours ago. Now, please stop with the un-civil attacks on my person and deal with how you have so many "family members" that you can have an unlimited supply of editors willing to make the same edits to the same article using the same terms and the same sources. I'm sorry, but this isn't right at all. Nothing about what I have seen here since <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">User:BryanFromPalatine</a> checked in is right, and that includes the notice on your user page that I cannot read as anything at all except a legal threat against Wikipedia. So, I am asking you; 1. How many family members are you going to trot out as editors here? Is there a limit? And how is that different from the Wikipedia term-of-art "meatpuppet"? 2. How is what is on your user page not a legal threat? How is it different from when some guy comes into your business and says; "Nice soda shop you have here... It would be a SHAME if something HAPPENED to it!"&#160;??? Now, you can probably get somebody to block me for writing this. Maybe permanently. If you can, have at it. I won't sock puppet my way around it like I honestly believe you have, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna shut up when I see this sort of thing happening here. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Now, just a moment here</b> - Are you claiming that Author TJ Walker claimed never to have written the article that archive.org puts on his web site in 1999, which at least one other site used here as an RS republished, that is still in the index of all of his articles on his web site, and which you are seemingly threatening suit over? Is that what you are claiming? And you are claiming it on the basis of an unverifiable telephone call? I think the fact that archive.org has the complete text of that article online and linked to its historical place on TJ Walker's web site is absolute proof that he did write it, did publish it, and that it did exist. The fact that it is not currently online anywhere does not mean that it is not a valid cite for any article here on Wikipedia. We can prove its content. We can prove it was published. archive.org does not make stuff up. We can also prove that the quotes used in that article absolutely were on Free Republic. I am going to stick my neck way out here and say that I very much doubt that you ever called author TJ Walker. And also say that if somebody claiming to be TJ Walker called Carolyn at Wikimedia Foundation, that was not likely to have really been TJ Walker. I see no proof of the truth of either event being proffered here. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>I can address that, Physicq</b> --- "Dean" here is a member of the legal team of Free Republic. He therefore represents Jim Robinson, the owner. On the talk page for Free Republic, "Dean" says, (prarphrasing here) 'I am just trying to keep Wikipedia from being sued as Jim Robinson is litigious.' - Well, as Jim Robinson is his client, this is just a lawyer saying <b>Do as I say or my client will sue you.</b> isn't it? It is absolutely a legal threat from a lawyer who WORKS FOR FREE REPUBLIC. And he works for them whether he has ever taken a dime from them or not as he has represented them and written briefs on their behalf, and bragged about it in the Free Republic talk page. Now I haven't gone over there and looked up exact quotes, but I am not attempting to "misrepresent" anything here, or being "uncivil" here. I am giving you my understanding of the actions of this person as expressed by what he has said in the past and applying logic to see what deductions arise. And my deduction is that <b>he has directly threatened wikipedia with suit if material not to his liking is incorporated in the Free Republic article</b>. If there is some other way to read this, I don't see it. Again, if you want to say I am misrepresenting anything, and block me forever, go right ahead, I am doing what I think is right in making this observation here. I also am going to make the observation that I do not believe for even one moment that these many usernames are not a single person trying as hard as he can to game the system here, but I will leave the determination on what to do that up to admins here and abide by whatever is decided. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 03:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

To leave the situation unchanged is to assume bad faith by human editors and good faith by bots when a judgment call is made regarding linking policy. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 04:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look, the bottom line is that <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> doesn't support this and imposing policies by bot is not good. Second, even given the unmoderated nature of Flicker that's not a reason by itself to not link to it. The consensus on on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> for some time has been not to link to obvious or likely copyvios. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't link to pages that don't have copyright info if they are likely to have copyright permission. There's no moral, ethical, policy or pragmatic reason to do so and there are obvious strong downsides. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above referenced user reverts good faith, accurate edits, which were made in response to his insertion of his political (pro-IRA) slant into almost every article he touches. I am the user formerly known as <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_chulito_e561.html" title="User:El chulito">User:El chulito</a> but I was forced to changed my username by an administrator because in Spanish it has more than one meaning, and at least one of these may be offensive.</p>

<p><b>Analysis:</b> If this is not seen as evidence of his irrational, pro-<a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a> agenda, I don't know what is. "Murder" and "assassination" are only POV when misapplied. Which goes to show <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">User:Vintagekits</a>' style -- argue and deny; insult ("you lack indepth knowledge"; "you dont seem to have a full grasp of it at the moment"; <i>dear boy"); provide boilerplate nonsense as final excuse and then shows his contempt for anyone who opposes his agenda ("dear boy"; "now, now"). For example, he insists on putting</i> "Óglach" (an IRA honorific meaning "Vounteer") into the Irish translations of English names for members of the <a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a>. He claims that my actions are "against mediation"; I don't know what this means nor have I been informed of this issue being in mediation.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, under my old username (:<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_chulito_e561.html" title="User:El chulito">User:El chulito</a>, which I was forced to change by an administrator; although far more provocative and offensive ones continue unscathed), I observed his massive use of pro-IRA websites and news outlets as the source of his info; threaten the <b>integrity</b> of Wikipedia, and the millions of people who rely on it for information. This should be fixed before mirror sites (answers.com; information.com, etc.) pick it up.</p>
<p>He/she has been particularly active reshaping the bios (most of which are boilerplate and contain little information) of the eight <a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a> men killed at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughgall.html" title="Loughgall">Loughgall</a>; as noted he adds "Óglach" as part of their birth names in Gaelic, when it is no such thing; it means "Volunteer" in <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaeilge.html" title="Gaeilge">Gaeilge</a>; he also deletes categories he personally disagrees with such as <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_convicted_on_terrorism_charges_b915.html" title="Category:People convicted on terrorism charges">Category:People convicted on terrorism charges</a> b/c he/she does not personally view the IRA/PIRA as terrorist. Thus I suggest that all eight bios (which are basically the same except for names, schools, etc.) be redirected to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_in_Loughgall_ed50.html" title="The Troubles in Loughgall">The Troubles in Loughgall</a>.</p>

<p>I think I need an administrator to sort this out (if not, I'd appreciate a pointer on how I can do it).

<p><a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopeofPeru_94a1.html" title="User:PopeofPeru">User:PopeofPeru</a> earned himself the sad fame of "winning" last night's Colbert vandalism competition. He was immediately indef-blocked, but I let him off the hook because in his case it seemed to be a one-off occurrence and he had some constructive earlier edits. But now we have the problem that people keep congratulating him on his achievements, there's now a userpage full of such congratulations, glorifying the vandalism. And some people even revert that page when I try to at least blank it. The guy himself hasn't been online since the block/unblock, apparently. What do people feel, is it worth taking admin action over? The guy's lucky blocks aren't punitive, because otherwise I'd reblock him to scare off the others. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since Colbert has done this more than once, why do you think this users actions are a one time thing? I think reblocking would be rather inconsistent at this point, but I think the user should have stayed blocked. Sure it is funny, but not so funny we can just let it happen. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 14:08, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, the point is not whether Colbert or anybody else has done it before or is likely to do it again, but whether this particular user is likely to be doing it again. And I see no more evidence for that in this case than in the case of any random vandal who we let off with a first warning, rather less in fact. He's been seriously cautioned, and he's got a (modestly) positive record otherwise.

<dd>A "good" user shouldn't be so easily swayed into vandalism. Also, if you look at his talk page, there's at least one other established user defending PoP's actions as "not harmful." I think PopeofPeru should be blocked for a short amount of time, but longer than the three hours for which he was actually blocked. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 14:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not seeing any signs of remorse on that talk page, or a pledge that he wouldn't do it again. Did I miss that somewhere else?
