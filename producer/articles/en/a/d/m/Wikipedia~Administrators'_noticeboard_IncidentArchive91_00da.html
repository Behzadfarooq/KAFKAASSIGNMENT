<dd><i>Hi Fang Aili. I'd like to request some support in the spirit of defend each-other. I've been having some problems with an anon user 67.172.194.15 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.172.194.15.html" title="User talk:67.172.194.15">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.172.194.15_013e.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.172.194.15">contribs</a>). The user has been causing a disruption in one of the articles I watch, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Sonata_5269.html" title="Star Sonata">Star Sonata</a>. The user has been adding patently untrue content, removing sourced material and engaging in personal attacks. If you look at 67's contributions 90% of his edits have been in the vein of disrupting SS article. I've really tried to talk nice to this person but I've gotten nothing but insults back. I've reported to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> but I doubt that will result in any kind of permanent resolution. Thanks, ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.Smith</a> 07:02, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>I posted this on Fang's talk page before I noticed fang was on a wikipedia. I chatted with the fine people at #wikipedia and they suggested I post here... so here I am. Instead of rewriting my comments I just copied.</p>
<p>What I'd like is some outside opinions and perhaps stronger actions if you think it warrants it. Or, alternatively, if I'm in the wrong here I'd really like to know before I make myself look like any more of a fool. Thanks! ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.Smith</a> 08:01, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>THIS IS AN OUTRAGE - ARBCOM YOU MUST STEP IN AND STOP THIS HARASSMENT AND DEFAMATION:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>First - Dirigisme has no relation to LaRouche.</li>
<li>Second - American System is supported by LaRouche but is a historical American philosophy that LaRouche neither invented or added anything credit worthy too. He supports it, and just because he likes this old American idea does not mean it is a LaRouche idea.</li>
<li>Third - I consider the above actions by the above admins, Harassment of HK - as this user has only engaged in constructive debate and talk on the pages Will Beback talks of. I should know because of the abusive behavior Will Beback has shown to myself and HK since I arrived here in February. Will Beback has been admonished by Arbcom for this type of behavior in the past.</li>
<li>Fourth - The edits HK has done at American System and Dirigisme have never been to promote LaRouche. Not once have I seen him do this. If there is proof of this show it, don't just accuse. This is not a Inquisitor's court, HK has some rights of innocent until proven guilty here. I have seen nothing but harassment from Slimvirgin, Will Beback and others associated with this small admin group including user 172.</li>
<li>Fifth - The previous mentioned users and admins have on numerous occasions refer ed to HK as being a member of a 'cult' and other such nonsense and personal attacks. That is hardly the conduct of an Administrator.</li>
<li><b>Hence, this is an obvious attempt at further harassment, personal attack, and political vendetta against a user who I have seen only cordial engagement from since I arrived and although I am not a LaRouche supporter by any stretch of the imagination - judging by the civility of HK and the hostility shown by the group that now charges him as if they were re-incarnates from Salem, MASS. during the witch frenzy - I'd caution any user and editor from what they say about HK's affiliations and group he is associated with.</b></li>
<li>And, let me make this very clear...<b>this is not the first time per Arbcom rulings that people have brought charges against the abusive behavior of Slimvirgin and Will Beback</b>, among others who always seem to congregate around each other and always seem to sign off with and edit in a very particular fashion that that socks are known of. Can I prove this? No. But it can be looked into and I request it officially. They are charging HK with sock-puppetry despite the fact he uses AOL and can't control what other users of that system do who may have the same IP as himself. I see constant accusations of this and no proof..NO PROOF of it.</li>
<li><b>I consider this whole suggestion here that this user who has is so scrutinized (he must surely know of the plight of so many minorities who have been harassed to no end by people who seem by their actions to despise them and hate them) be further blocked, banned as nonsense.</b> <b>It is Will Beback, Slimvirgin and that whole crew, that Arbcom should look into for sock-puppetry, harassment, defamation of character, rudeness, violation on repeated occasion of policy and so forth. Don't trust my word for it, just follow the links.</b> --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 06:00, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is HK actually contributing anything to Wikipedia other than trouble? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:03, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>How can he do anything with people scrutinizing his edits as if he were the devil himself? That is the whole point of this stuff. I could see if he were adding links to LaRouche (I would remove them myself in lieu of Arbcom's decisions) or that he was actively placing promotional material for LaRouche in articles (again no proof this occurs). Instead he is harassed for editing and wiki-stalked to every edit he try's to contribute to. This is wrong. The criteria is and should always be whether this user or any user is promoting LaRouche with links, inclusion of theory that has no backup outside of LaRouche, inclusion of promotions of LaRouche directly such as mentioning him by name in some sort of light that is way out of sort etc. I think that captures the spirit of Arbcom rulings. I see none of this from HK. If there is proof of this stuff then let it out. I see only an attempt to expand the definition of Arbcom decisions here to articles that Will Beback in particular has been engaged in in a rather harassing fashion with myself -American System and Dirigisme for example- where HK added his input along with other editors against Will Bebacks tactics and ideas of these things. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 14:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a claim he is a disrupting the project as well of negative personal attacks. The example shown by Will Beback however is out of context and was written on the NOR:Talk page after repeated personal attacks and insults from Slimvirgin (again follow the links to see this). He did not make allegations which were false - he provided citations to what he was talking about, and did not personally call any names or any other thing that can be attributed to personal attacks. Whether it is negative or not is the judgement of the reader, as the edits made by Slimvirgin speak for themselves and just recently another editor has come forward to describe the same thing on that talk page where this editor (Slimvirgin) changes policy to suit her needs when in dispute - so it is not out of the blue to state his complaint. If one objectively compares Will Bebacks edit's towards myself (since I arrived), Slimvirgins tactics used against Twrigley (a mediator she caused to leave Wikipedia) and compare them to HK's, one would fine a striking thing about Disruption, inflaming new users, personal insults to mediators, wiki-stalking a user to each edit he makes, personal insults lodged against users because of their edit number, personal attacks against myself etc. If this is to be a fair accounting then one must take into account the behavior of these admins and those associated. That is why Arbcom needs to look at this stuff and Jimbo Wales needs to step in and Wikimedia needs to step in before Wikipedia is hurt by all this harassment, defamation, and selective enforcement of policy. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 14:17, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Since then, Darin Fidika has ignored my warning on the talk page and continued to make edits based on fiction as if they were fact. I wrote him another message on the talk page, but I don't expect a response. Thoughts on what to do? Should the edits be treated as vandalism? I'm trying to tag the unverifiable ones with {{<a href="../../../f/i/c/Template%7EFiction_983c.html" title="Template:Fiction">fiction</a>}}, but he's doing so at a relatively high speed. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 11:09, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at the usertalk page, that's a lot of ignoring, not just of you but other editors as well. And the editing continues unabated.

<p>I request that IPs from the range 128.239.xxx.xxx be blocked. They are vandalising Star Wars articles with the words "DAGOBYTE" and realising that I am fighting that vandalism have now taken to my user page and talk page. I know requesting a block for over 65,000 addresses isn't good but it is getting frustrating fighting this vandal, especially since I'm powerless to block him. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth.html" title="Darth">Darth</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(Darth Talk)</a></small> 21:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blocking that many addresses is kinda drastic for some childish vandalism. It's usually reverted with in a couple seconds anyways. Best thing to do if it continues is to semi-protect, not block 65k IP's&#160;:-) --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 21:57, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes... but I can't semiprotect all the Star Wars articles and user/usertalk page. I guess we can just see how it goes for now.

<p>For quite some weeks, User:Timothy_Usher has been attacking any editor critical of his position on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> article. He has been censoring people's comments on the talk page which resulted in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamism_a150.html" title="Talk:Islamism">Talk:Islamism</a> being protected. I was shocked to see this development in our community. User:Timothy_Usher has been regularly violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a>. His motive now is to somehow claim that I'm four different users. Although this may not clearly be a case of violating <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, his constant harassment of editors needs a tough response. The way things are right now, if any editor contributes a comment critical of his position, that editor risks being labeled a sock puppet among other forms of harassment. My talk page shows a clear example of Timothy_Usher claiming me to be three or four different people which has clearly been shown to be false below in the <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">User:Deuterium</a> section. This tirade needs to be checked. I'm open to the community spirit of Wikipedia but Timothy_Usher's argumentative behavior is destroying the collaborative nature here. For transparency, my IP address is 24.7.141.159 and this is the user account I finally made. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUser247_16e3.html" title="User:User247">User247</a> 00:39, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the sort of fellow who makes you wonder what he's doing here. I suppose I'd recommend blocking Bgully because he's only ever edited an article twice, over a year ago, and both were crappy edits. . In one, he reverted an edit on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relations_between_Catholicism_and_Judaism_81c4.html" title="Relations between Catholicism and Judaism">Relations between Catholicism and Judaism</a> by Jayjg to restore a version that, in part, referred to Jewish Cantors by the Christian title of "Reverend". In the other, on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, he changed "the genocidal Holocaust" to "the allegiated genocidal Holocaust". The account was dormant between 28 April, 2005 and 10 March, 2006.</p>
<p>All his other edits are within the past month or so, he is a suspected sock of Antifinnugot because nearly all his edits are attacks on Antifinnugor's nemesis, Dbachmann and his supposed "clique" (which on the evidence before me is composed of absolutely any sane person who happens to be passing and comments on matters).</p>
<p>On April 7th, Bgully posted a rather dodgy application for arbitration <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=47425625&amp;oldid=47423269" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=47425625&amp;oldid=47423269" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. He hasn't edited since then.</p>
<p>Having reviewed his editing history, I'm inclined to recommend a community ban. He's obviously not been editing Wikipedia for any legitimate purpose and the bulk of his edits have been attempts to harass other editors. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about having a word with dab to make sure you catch 'em all, and community banning Antifinnugor and his whole sock drawer (plus any new ones to be blocked on sight)? It's not like there's any doubt that they're all one person, the editing style is as characteristic as the subject matter. Surely that alone is enough to run a CheckUser (or to make a CheckUser redundant, AFAIC). It's not like any of the incarnations has <i>ever</i> done anything but spout invective and waste good editors' time. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen, hate clique member</a>, 20:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Ian, I was just in the process of looking at what's happening at that page, because I was wondering if you had violated 3RR. I'm not saying you have, mind you, because I've just started to look. Regardless of that, could I ask you not to try adding new material to the policy pages without consensus? Particularly at the moment, because a few policy talk pages have been under some pressure of late from new editors (I'm thinking of -Lumiere in particular), whereas these are pages that need to be stable, and I was actually thinking of protecting NPOV if the reverting continued. Anyway, I'll go and take a closer look now. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:42, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ian, having looked into this more closely, I now see you appear to be continuing in the footsteps of -Lumière while he's away. I ask you most sincerely not to do this. I don't know what the particular issues are on the NPOV page, because it's a page I don't often edit, but I saw your comments on the RfC about how WP:V must apply to policy pages too, and of course it doesn't, so you and -Lumière have simply misunderstood how policy works on Wikipedia. I'm not saying that necessarily means you're wrong on the substantive issue under dispute (because I don't know what that is), but I can see from the comments you've left on the RfC that your reasoning and approach isn't good. -Lumière is a very troublesome, inexperienced editor who keeps changing his user name so that it's harder to keep track of exactly how troublesome he's being. Any editor who supports him is likely to be put in the same category, perhaps unfairly. Therefore, can I ask you (for your own sake as well as for the stability of the policy page) to take a rest from this for a few weeks, and perhaps return to it when the -Lumière issue has been dealt with and things have calmed down? As for the talk-page refactoring, -Lumière has caused havoc on numerous policy talk pages, so it's not surprising that editors on Talk:NPOV have decided to userfy his or similar posts. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin, at FeloniousMonk's request, I have read through all the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Talk%7ENeutral_point_of_view_514e.html" title="Talk:Neutral point of view">talk:Neutral point of view</a> archives to discover where the issues I have brought up, have been discussed before. While "Undue weight" has been discussed at length, the points I mention on (a) verifiability (b) paraphrasing, do not appear to have been mentioned before. I can't prove that, as I can't easily show what <i>hasn't</i> been discussed, but I am sure that FeloniousMonk can easily provide a quote from the archives to show that it has.</p>
<p>So effectively, ANY discussion on "Undue weight" is now beyond discussion; any issue that anyone brings up on "Undue weight" may be now be deemed Lumière-esque, and squashed.</p>
<p>Even my brief discussion on Undue weight, that was moved to my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Iantresman#Moved_from_Talk:NPOV" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Iantresman#Moved_from_Talk:NPOV" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> resulted in an acknowledgement that a link to the "original email" may be warranted. And there is even the suggestions that "Jimbo is not the supreme lawgiver" (which seems contrary to the Wiki Policy page), and also deserves discussion (and again I can't find previous discussion). There is even some discussion on the subject in my "absence" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view#Jimbo_Wales_comments_on_NPOV_Undue_weight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view#Jimbo_Wales_comments_on_NPOV_Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> but of course it is very one-sided.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin, the policy pages themselves encourage discussion. My discussion issues appear to be unique, and hence valid. Consquently their removal from the Talk page is unwarranted, and other editors certainly shouldn't be able to choose which issues to address, let alone whether to remove them. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 11:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to support Ian on this. SlimVirgin has a habit of removing material, even from talk pages, which she doesn't like. Her behaviour on the Animal Rights talk page is a case in point. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 06:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We don't allow the adding of links to one's site to articles; instead, we advise editors to do exactly what Jameswatt was doing: add the link to the Talk pages, and let other editors decide. The warnings, blocking, and removal of comments were therefore surely mistaken. Do other admins agree with that judgement?</p>
<p>The issue is complicated by two factors. One, which I think is essentially irrelevant, is that the site is appallingly inaccurate and worthless, and we shouldn't want the links added to any Wikipedia article. The other is that Jameswatt evaded the block by continuing to post his messages from <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">59.144.97.157</tt> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../5/9/2E/User_talk%7E59.144.97.157.html" title="User talk:59.144.97.157">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.144.97.157_d623.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.144.97.157">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59.144.97.157_56d1.html" title="Special:Blockip/59.144.97.157">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>).

<dd>Spam on talk pages is just as effective as spam on article pages, and once other edits are made on top of those edits it's a hell of a job to weed them out. Leaving those links in place <i>would</i> harm Wikipedia be encouraging people to spam talk pages. Placing a link on the talk page for discussion works fine for one proposed link, but not for tens of links each on a different page. Incidentally, as far as I am aware the IP edits came before the warning and block on Jameswatt's talk page, so I wouldn't have blocked.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Henry</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkalexander100_f98a.html" title="User talk:Markalexander100"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 14:38, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm with pgk and Scott here. Spam on talk pages is just as bad as spam in the articles. If you look at Jameswatt's talk page, several users said he could add the links. So not only is it spam, but it's basically a scam to trick people as well. We shouldn't be encouraging it. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 17:11, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When recently editors from another site added links to tens of articles, I removed them, explaining that we don't allow that sort of thing, and pointing to the guideline that such links should be placed on Talk pages. They were stubborn, and resisted, and in the end went off in a huff, but if they'd done what I (and Wikiepdia guidelines) said and added the links to all those Talk pages, it seems that the above admins would have removed them all and blocked the editors (something that I didnt do even when the link-spam was to articles). that seems wrong to me. Our guidelines don't say that links should only be placed on a certain number of Talk pages, nor that links should meet some quality standard.</p>
<p>I agree that he should have been approached (courteously), and told that none of the links would be added to any of the articles as they didn't meet our standards, and becasuse we discourage over-linking. A boiler-plate comment could have been added to all the Talk pages involved, saying that the link shouldn't be added, and giving the reasons. Instead, the editor was reverted and blocked for doing what Wikipedia guidelines told him to do. I don't accept that that's right. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then the guidelines and the function of RC Patrollers is in conflict here. I noticed it was spam links and that was its only intention of it. Regardless they are in talk pages or not it is still accessable by anyone and therefor promoting spam. It makes zero sense to not allow spam links on articles and allow them on talk pages. That said the reverts you did Mel should have just gone ignored and overlooked when you knew they were spam links and you admited to that. Now instead of 20 some odd pages that we had removed that from now still has it. --<a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESgrayban_0d5b.html" title="User:Sgrayban">Scott Grayban</a> 17:42, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Declarations like "spam is spam" and "this is a no-brainer" are unhelpful (and the latter is somewhat insulting, as are comments referring to common sense, etc. It's possible to disagree without being an idiot or lacking sense). We have a clear instruction to editors to behave in a certain way when they want links to their sites added to articles. The instructions don't limit the number of articles, nor do they say something like "only do this if your site isn't crap". This editor followed the rules, and was pounced upon and attacked by a couple of admins as though he was a criminal deviant. Why on Earth should we care if this person has seventy-one links to his site? We should care about what appears in our articles; the links don't appear there, which is what the rules about spam-linking are concerned with. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 21:17, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

Googlebombing is Googlebombing, we have forced people to remove links from their <i>User</i> pages, why should spam be allowed on 70, 710, or 71,000 Talk pages? Why do you object to "spam is spam", when that's an incontestable fact? Why do you <i>want</i> spam on Talk pages? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:37, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>More incivility; this really is getting people heated. "Spam is spam" simply repeats the claim against which I'm arguing, without bothering to consider and responsd to my arguments. Perhaps I'm wrong, and my arguments can be shown to be unsound — but merely telling me repeatedly that I'm being silly and missing the obvious is unhelpful and does nothing to move the discussion on. Talk pages are different from articles pages: we don't allow editorial discussion in articles, we do on Talk pages; we don't allow people to add links to their own sites to articles, we do allow (indeed encourage) it on Talk pages. If the claim is that our poicy should be changed, and people should be forbidden even from adding such links to Talk pages, then that should be argued for. If the idea is that a central page should be created where editors can place suggestions for links to a site in multiple articles, then fine, that should be argued for. Instead I'm just seeing a lot of emotional ranting about spam and Google bombing, etc.<br />
I care about Wikipedia's articles being compromised, I care about readers being pointed to misleading and downright false information, but I don't care (at least, not as a Wikipedia editor) about somebody increasing links to their site; I'm not an Internet policeman. They're using Wikipedia to do it? yes. Does it hurt us or our readers? No. Did we tell the person involved to do it in the first place? Yes. So should we officiously remove all mention of the links because we don't like them? No. Does that mean that I <i>want</i> the links? How on Earth could what I've said imply that? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:04, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The hysteria and unpleasantness over this, together with the original vigilantism as Jerzy correctly described it is worrying.

Calton has, unfortunately, joined in on this page with the same sort of aggressive language and approach. What on Earth is going on here? I made a point, in line with clearly stated Wikipedia guidelines, that a couple of admins had reacted very badly towards an editor who was following those guidelines. I reverted (<i>once</i>) their removal of what I took (and still take) to be legitimate comments left in accordance with <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> ("If [a link to a website that you own or maintain] is relevant and informative, mention it as a possible link on the talk page and wait for someone else to include it, or include the information directly in the article"). Few people (apart from Jerzy) who have responded have taken the time to read what I said carefully enough to understand it, but have simply reacted with robotic cries of "spam", etc.</p>
<p>I hold no brief for the editor concerned, and I've made clear that I think that the site is poor, and that the links shouldn't be added. I don't however, think that editors' poor behaviour is excused simply because they're acting against someone of whom we disapprove. When that poor behaviour is followed by the sort of reaction I've seen here, it saddens and worries me. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 14:01, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You didn't revert once, you reverted somone's good faith removal 47+ times with admin rollback. While it is guideline to add links to a talk page to suggest inclusion, that doesn't extend to doing it to hundreds of pages. One is sufficient to allow discussion. More than that, especially over 10 is not helpful and is just advertising, After discussion has occured and people have noticed it, and consensus is that the link isn't valuable, there is no reason to add the request for the links back. Further, there is consensus here that it is spam, so that's enough. And no, incivility isn't condoned, and you're right, people should calm down and stay civil even when dealing with a serious spammer, but your actions escalated the matter, they did not help resolve it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is a guideline to leave it on the talk page, but that doesn't justify doing it a large number of times in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>'s other guidelines. Trying to use one guideline to justify violating others is obtuse. And you didn't have to be clairvoyant to know you shouldn't have used admin rollback that many times in this case at least, and that most people would consider it spam. You could have discussed first.

<dd>I can see where some of the panic on Tim!'s side comes from: since these were category deletions and not a rename, it would be a complicated process to repopulate the category after it was depopulated. It would either have to be repopulated by going back through Catapult's contributions, or searching the last database dump, or by knowing which actresses and actors had indeed appeared on CSI X of Y. The final point there reminds me that I need to go make this point over on DRV... and I agree that the bot should not have been blocked and reverted. He had all the information he would need to repopulate it from the bot's contributions IF DRV overturned it, but now if it is indeed not kept we will have to rerun whoever's bot on it. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:09, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a bizarre concept that CFR/CFD regulars decision to delete categories be interupted by people who actually create and use them. I'll just go and vote speedy delete on all articles on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>? There seems to be a rather bad attitude at Categories for deletion that only the regulars of that page know what is best for wikipedia categorisation, and maybe they should read the tag line on the front page "Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit." CFR/CFD decisions should not be made behind closed doors. Anyone who thought the War of the Worlds nomination could be considered valid is not in the spirit of wikipedia. Calton's grossly uncivil comment ""category not tagged"? Please." exemplifies this.

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia where there aren't any closed doors. The discussion of the merits of the category itself (and whether deleting it should stretched into a month-long process-wank) belongs elsewhere, however. What I'd still like to know is why I was given a block and a mass rollback with no prior warning, and with the most ridiculous rationale I've ever seen. Because I follow unambiguous instructions to "empty and delete" several listed categories, some of which you have obviously taken offense to. This concerns me greatly, and my questions at <a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETim%21_d69d.html#CFD_and_DRV" title="User talk:Tim!">User talk:Tim!#CFD and DRV</a> have not been satisfactorily answered. I believe Tim! feels so strongly about this issue that he would have been blocked me and rolled back my edits just the same if I had done them manually, from my regular account. That, as I mentioned to him, would put things in a completely different perspective, but based on his more recent comments, I fear that Tim considers such perspective to be a personal attack. — <small>Apr. 17, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[08:38] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt>

<p>He was blocked while I was reviewing his edits and preparing a pretty stern warning. I've told him I want him to clean up his act or Wikipedia probably won't want him as a contributor any more. If he keeps it up over the next week or so, I'll probably recommend a long block, or perhaps an indefinite one. His userpage, some of his recent edits elsewhere, and edits by a suspected sock of his all contain extreme personal attacks on Chad Bryant and he hasn't edit an article in a month. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:05, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removing comments, especially good faith warnings from administrators regarding your conduct, from your userpage, especially with offensive edit summaries, interferes with the proper functioning of Wikipedia and is incivil, and may lead to blocking. If you disagree with a conduct warning placed on your user talk page, the proper response is to politely discuss the issue with the administrator in question, not to remove it with an edit summary that clearly indicates that you reject the allegation that your conduct was inappropriate.</dd>

<p>Sorry, but I do disagree with this course of action. There is no reason to continue hounding someone after the initial warning and thus it amounts to little more than harassment. Seriously, what beneficial purpose is served? Informing the person that their action was inapropriate? Already accomplished by the initial warning.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> policy allows <b>vandalism</b> warnings to be restored, and <i>only</i> vandalism warnings, because there are progressive levels of them leading up to a block and common procedures in place about warnings. Forcing a user to maintain a NPA, edit warring, or other warning in perpetuity on their talk page is the equivalent of imposing a scarlet letter / public humiliation. You made your point, they read it, case closed. There is no call to keep reposting the potentially embarassing note, threatening the user for removing it, or tossing in personal attacks in return.</p>
<p>If we <i>do</i> want to apply the scarlet letter principle then the user is right... the policy should be changed to say so. For the record, our <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html#Etiquette" title="Help:Talk page">documentation</a> currently states that removing such warnings without a reply may be considered 'hostile' or 'uncivil'... "However, reverting such removals or redirects is not proper and may result in a block for edit warring." So... considered yourselves all 'warned' for "not proper" edit warring. I'd put the warnings on your user pages, but then they might have to stay there forever and Kelly might call me a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>... because that's always helpful. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 13:26, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you looked at his overall conduct?

<dd>Yes, <b>here</b> I was 'focusing solely on whether removing (and re-adding) the notice was appropriate'... since that <i>was</i> the issue in question. At the user's talk page, on the other hand, I attempted (likely unsuccessfully) to get him to understand that his bad behaviour was the cause of his problems. On the DRV for the templates which set this whole thing in motion I've been arguing against his claim that 'the userboxes in question are not divisive' (paraphrased without the swearing) and saying that I feel they should therefor be deleted under T1... even though I also strongly believe that T1 is a bad idea on free speech grounds. I think I've got 'the big picture' here, but I've seldom (possibly never) seen an instance where one thing was 100% to blame with no other problems. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 21:55, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, please someone interfere. Eternal_Equinox has a history of reverting changes that other people make, specifically changes that I make to the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Clarkson_b0db.html" title="Kelly Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> page. He just recently removed a third image that I had uploaded to the page. The image in question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:KellySNL.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:KellySNL.jpg" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> was removed by E.E. a couple months back, along with the two other images, the issue was settled by an admninstrator who found fair use didn't apply to one of the images, but the others were OK. Now that I try to re-insert the image, he reverts it completely. He has a history of intimidating other Wikipedia users, which is crystal clear when during his nomination of another article he hawks to featured article status. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/We_Belong_Together/Archive_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/We_Belong_Together/Archive_1" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> Something seriously needs to be done, I thought Wikipedia was a place where anybody can come in and edit, but in this article it seems what you do edit has to pass muster with Eternal_Equinox or he'll revert during his daily check of the article. I think it's time Eternal takes a Wikibreak, because he's doing more harm then good. Hopefully we can reach a resolution! <a href="../../../h/e/y/User%7EHeyNow10029_96cc.html" title="User:HeyNow10029">HeyNow10029</a> 22:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made no material changes to this user's comments except to remove a misleading string of text while leaving the underlying Wp:AGF link the user had hidden <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JJay&amp;diff=48140923&amp;oldid=48139357" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JJay&amp;diff=48140923&amp;oldid=48139357" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Besides that, I changed the heading to the section- which is my right- and changed the link to the AFD page. I have very good reasons for doing this, because any message on my user page brings certain editors rushing to the AfD in question to vote against whatever stance I have taken. I reiterate that no significant changes were made to the comments. Nevertheless, there is a very clear warning notice on the user page that explains that messages can and will be edited for content. Besides all that, I have made no personal attacks against this editor and fail to see why he has addressed himself to this forum or on what basis he can make a broad statement regarding my history of exchanges with other editors, particularly since our exchange was never particularly heated. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:11, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Changes included nonsensically changing the section header "Personal attacks" to "pet rocks" do you have an explanation for that?

<dd>Thank you for that comment. I have explained why I change headings on the page. In this case, this user was not posting on the page to accuse me of making a personal attack. He was there ostensibly to find out why I was annoyed by his crack that I operate from "hardcore POV". In a series of posts, he then went on to talk about my "odd reactions", that "conflict with others is a recurring thing" for me, that I'm "looking at things the wrong way", take editing at Wikipedia "so personally", have a "history of heated exchanges" etc. In one of his messages, he writes "If there's good reason shown to keep the article, I'm willing to change my vote". Then when I provide some links showing that my AfD comment was not based on "hardcore POV", he responds with "You're missing the point. I didn't bring this up on your talk page to debate the merits of the Jackson article". I came to realize that his point was to lecture and provide advice, neither of which I asked for. His point was certainly not to apologize for accusing me of "hardcore POV". I came to feel very much like a pet rock, being told to sit, stay and roll-over. And since there is no reason that I have to repeatedly respond to this type of lecturing on my user page under an arbitary section header chosen by another user, I changed the heading to one I felt was more fitting to the general tenor of the conversation. Of course, as you have helpfully pointed out, I have a long history of being a dick, probably as a result of all those heated exchanges, and that is not likely to change anytime soon. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:40, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Stalking??? That's a fairly serious accusation for which I hope you have some proof. You should realize that this is a public forum. Like for most editors, it is on my watchlist. Naturally, I'm going to respond when comments are left here that concern me. That is most decidely not stalking.

<dd><i>Stalking???

<dd>JJay's statement above isn't an accusation of anybody in particular.

In any case, Tijuana Brass doesn't seem to have much of a case here from what I've seen. The only questionable edit linked here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JJay&amp;diff=48140923&amp;oldid=48139357" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JJay&amp;diff=48140923&amp;oldid=48139357" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> which does actually change the meaning of a sentence that didn't sound particularly offensive originally, but the meaning change was almost certainly unintentional considering the context it's in and his explanation of the change here. As for the revertions he made later, I don't see anything wrong with those either, it's his talk page and he wasn't removing warnings from it. Maybe he hasn't always acted as friendly as possible but I don't see any clear violations here, not even of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. –<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETifego_094d.html" title="User:Tifego"><small>Tifego</small></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/f/User_talk%7ETifego_c20d.html" title="User talk:Tifego">(t)</a></sup> <sub>07:15, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</sub>

<dd><i>JJay's statement above isn't an accusation of anybody in particular.</i> It's an accusation of stalking by individuals whom he coyly refuses to name -- so it's still an accusation of stalking, period/full stop. All in peculiar defense of making a misleading word change in someone else's words; again, period/full stop. Not a violation of civility, just of intellectual honesty and of consistency. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 11:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carlton, let's not cloud the issue. I have never stalked this user. In fact, the only interaction I have ever had with TijuanaBrass was one AfD nom, my responses to his comments on my talk page, and this forum. That is not stalking by any stretch of the imagination. It is also undeniably a different beast entirely from the stalking I have experienced, which has involved editor(s) repeatedly editing the same pages I am editing, shadowing my AfD participation, and otherwise taking actions that are designed to harrass. With much of this action using the talk page as the jumping off point. However, I have never accused TijuanaBrass of this, so it is not exactly pertinent to this discussion. It is also not an example of intellectual dishonesty. As to the small change made to one of TijuanaBrass's comments, it was excessively minor and not in any way misleading, nor was it intended to mislead. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">I tend to find long embedded links under unrelated phrases not particularly civil</a>. If he wanted to, he could have changed that minor removal back. Instead he removed all of his comments and the section header and made an uncivil edit summary. Since unlike most editors, I have never removed any comments from the talk page, including attacks, complaints or messsages from vandals, I would rather his comments remain, particularly since I took the time to respond. After considering this overnight, and in the interest of putting this to bed, I have returned the five words that were removed- i.e. "perhaps you're looking at things the wrong way". We may all be looking at things in the wrong way, but whatever the case, I am obviously more than happy to let this user express himself in his own words. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:17, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Carlton, let's not cloud the issue.'</i> Hey, let's not. You could start, by not making up things; you know, not defending yourslf against things no one said you did. Read what I wrote again, and do it slowly: what I was pointing out was your double standard in being insulted and demanding proof of an accusation you had not the slightest compunction in saying to others. And underneath all your convoluted justifications lies a simple truth: you changed someone else's words to change, however subtle, their actual message. Your <i>I am obviously more than happy to let this user express himself in his own words</i> is untrue on multiple levels -- starting with "obviously" -- and I stand by my reference to "intellectual dishonesty". No matter how much lipstick you put on that pig, it'll never be Miss America. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 20:21, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now would be a great time for both of you to drop this. You will never see eye to eye because of your fundamentally differing belief systems, and it's pointless to even try. What you should do is look at each other's contributions, weigh them against policy, and point out in a civil manner when there are things wrong. Just because someone disagrees fundamentally with your religion does not mean they are necessarily wrong in everything they say about it; and just because someone has deeply-held beliefs does not mean they can't write factually about the subjects of those beliefs without violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Guys, this is obviously fake: if he'd really stolen $500 (accurate to six significant figures, apparently) from the United States National Bank, using his computer and a time machine, he would have referred to himself as a <i>hax0r</i>, not a <i>hacker.</i> Further, there is no mention that he is an "3117 71m3 7r@ve113r". He also would have referred to his activities as "rox0r", and the bank's security as "teh sux0r". Without these tell-tale signs, I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that this is a false claim. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 14:03, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But the user doesn't replace the tag with "cleanup" or improve the article in any way; he just removes "prod" tags.

<dd>What the IP is doing is fine. A coherent edit summary is about all that etiquette requires for removing PROD tags; the anon is not only doing that, but in many cases adding stub tags and such.

<dd><b>Statement from the accused party</b> -- I am a somewhat regular Wikipedia contributor (300 edits last Saturday alone), mostly copyedit/grammar/typo fixes, but I'm on dialup and my IP changes several times per day. Today I decided to investigate the list of prod'd articles to evaluate how the feature was being used, worrying that it might not be getting sufficient oversight. I started with the oldest prodded articles and worked backwards through the list until I had looked at all ~500 prodded articles. Out of the ~500 articles I checked, I saw ~30 (I didn't count) that I thought at least deserved a discussion/vote before being deleted. That leaves about ~470 articles, ~94% of them, that I looked at but didn't de-prod.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the ones I unprodded, I did add stub tags where I saw untagged stubs, and I did add cleanup tags where I saw badly-written text, but most of the ones I de-prodded already had cleanup/NPOV tags or were prodded for notability and not for quality. Since my goal was to review all ~500 prod'd articles in a few hours, I didn't have time to do much rewriting of the articles I unprodded. However, I need to point out that prod tags are proposals for deletion, not proposals for improvement. I left improvement tags alone or added them, except in a few cases where I could make some fast changes to fix the problems. I've bookmarked the contribs page for this IP (as I've done for other IPs I've made many changes under) so that I can revisit the articles in the future.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the whole, after reviewing the entire list of prodded articles, I'm content that the feature isn't being abused by rampant deletionists like I feared; even though I thought I was a firm inclusionist, I could only bring myself to de-prod about ~30 out of ~500 (~6%), so I guess the system is working well. Still, I think there is a moral responsibility to check over the list, since it's not an "uncontested deletion" if nobody but the nominator ever sees it.</dd>

<p>User Leotardo has been using an anonymous user's totally spurious accusation of sockpuppetry between <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:pm_shef</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">User:Theonlyedge</a> to harass pm_shef and Theonlyedge. I'm starting to not feel very neutral here, so I would like an uninvolved admin to take a look at his actions. Check out Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchock (second nomination) for a list of extremely suspicious "evidence" Leotardo has against pm_shef and Theonlyedge, which I thoroughly rebuffed, but Leotardo apparently doesn't care. He has added this same evidence in three other places: twice at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, and he has created Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of Pm shef, in order to add Theonlyedge there. In the meantime, his only other edits have been blanking his talk page and removing sockpuppet warning notices from <a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPoche1_e9ba.html" title="User:Poche1">User:Poche1</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkycloud_6eef.html" title="User:Skycloud">User:Skycloud</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaHfa_5deb.html" title="User:BabaHfa">User:BabaHfa</a>, which are suspected sockpuppets of Leotardo, see Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of Leotardo for the evidence of this.

But <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">FeloniousMonk</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../f/e/l/User_talk%7EFeloniousMonk_476a.html" title="User talk:FeloniousMonk">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FeloniousMonk_cc7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/FeloniousMonk">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_FeloniousMonk_9733.html" title="Special:Blockip/FeloniousMonk">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) has unilaterally removed my discussion comments from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia_talk%7ENeutral_point_of_view_3315.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia talk:Neutral point of view</a> page, twice now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;diff=48463288&amp;oldid=48462632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;diff=48463288&amp;oldid=48462632" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;diff=48465849&amp;oldid=48465321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;diff=48465849&amp;oldid=48465321" rel="nofollow">[55]</a></p>
<p>While I can appreciate an editor not wanting to engage in discussion, I consider the removal of discussions to be at least uncivil, as it removes verification of discourse, and prevents other editors from engaging in discussion.</p>
<p>FeloniousMonk has claimed that "dozens of Wikipedia's most credible editors have asked for this discussion to be either dropped or taken to user talk space over the last four months". As far as I can tell, my points have not been discussed before (FeloniousMonk should be able to show otherwise). And how do I spot a "credible editor"... do they have the power to delete contributions without discussion with the other editor?</p>
<p>I would like (A) my discussion restored (B) FeloniousMonk banned from editing the policy page on the grounds of heavy-handed uncivility --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 10:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment: This is highly unlikely. FM userfied your very large, somewhat out-of-topic, and <s>tenditious</s> tendentious (not to say tedious) posts to the policy talk page. Your points have indeed been discussed, <i>ad nauseum</i>, as you would know had you read the archives. So far as I can see, your complaint is that your wordy and unsupported attempts to change a key policy have been userfied.

<dd>Sorry if you find the discussions tedious (I can't find the word <i>tenditious</i> in my dictionary), but I asked other editors for claification on policy. I've looked through the archives (as I explained to the previous administrator); can you show me where I have received <i>any</i> clarification, or how I am supposed to? Policy suggests that I discuss it.</dd>

<li>ya people do know that the 172.x.x.x range is only <i>semi</i>-portable, so usually they don't support more than one person <i>at a time</i>, unlike the 64.x.x.x, 152.x.x.x, and 205.x.x.x ranges, a block on a 172.x.x.x range isn't likely to cause any problems, so you could probably get away with a 24 hour block if you really had to, and unlike the 64,152,205's, the 172s don't rotate unless you sign off, or otherwise disconnect your modem--<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.65.html" title="User:152.163.100.65">152.163.100.65</a> 20:48, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>only issue I can think of, is the ease in which AOL users can switch between the 172 ranges, and the shared ranges, does seem to make blocking them virtually impossible, especially since AOL can assign several different ip groups to the same computer, at the same time, hence my little quick change from 152.163.100.65 to 172.151.240.130, and back again --172.151.240.130 20:50, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page Clive Bull is presently debating the introduction of a new version by Minglex. Some users believe that the article does not flow well: siting Minglex’s choice of subcategories, overall flow of the article (categories are stand alone and not linked well) and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>Blanning believes that the new version is better but instead of debating the issue has stifled debate through un-civil behaviour.</p>
<p>1. From what I can tell some of the opponents work in the same organisation (Same IP) and some others are students from the same university (hence same IP) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clive_Bull#Threats_by_Minglex.27s_sockpupet" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clive_Bull#Threats_by_Minglex.27s_sockpupet" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. Blanning has labelled them all sock puppets and refuses to debate their views of the article. He is also actively trying to ban them. These users have not vandalised any article yet he labels their justified objection to the new version as vandalism. 2. As the new article’s formatting and sub-categories are in contention by 10+ users it would be wiki procedure to keep the old version as by looking at the discussion page 10against to 3for is not a consensus. The 10+ users requested page protection for the old version. Against the wishes of the discussion and the majority of users he sneakily changed to the new version before protecting the page.</p>

<p>I don't see my conflict of interest here. I have never edited Clive Bull except for vandalism removal and a slight grammar fix. It is true that I stated I preferred Minglex' version on the talk page, but I've been largely trying to stay out of it because I don't have any interest in Clive Bull...I'm not British... etc. IPs and users from one side of the conflict have been trying for at least a week to have it protected, so when I saw that Sam (a party on the other side of the discussion) agreed it needed to be protected I decided to agree and protect it. Now that it is protected, Sam will not be able to edit it either for fear of censure because of unfair use of admin powers. JoshuaZ and BorgHunter are correct: we don't lock pages to help either side get ahead in a conflict, and anytime you request a page be protected you run the risk that it will be protected in the "wrong version". All that being said, if another admin feels that I may have been biased they are welcome to remove the protection. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A registered but unknown user with no User Page continues, despite warnings and with no response from him, to make inappropriate, evidently self-aggradizing changes on the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John_Publications_5150.html" title="St. John Publications">St. John Publications</a> page. Details below.</p>
<p>I have left comments on that article's talk page, and I also created the page <a href="../../../m/r/n/User_talk%7EMrnitpicker_a9be.html" title="User talk:Mrnitpicker">User talk:Mrnitpicker</a> in order to post comments/warnings directly to him before coming here.</p>
<p>I believe his edits to be inappropriate and contrary to Wikipedia policy, and I document below that they are inaccurate. He does not respond, and simply to continues to repost, and I believe this behavior, coupled with the facts below, may make blocking him the only resort.</p>
<p>I am reposting here verbatim what I posted on the St. John page, followed by my posting to the Mrnitpicker page;</p>

<p>All information on Wikipedia comes from other sources; that makes the St. John Pubs. article no different from any other, and <b>all the sources</b>, not just yours, were linked-to in the References section from the start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every word in this entry is my original writing; you imply plagiarism by putting your notice at the head of the article, yet the article contains no phrases from any other work.</li>
<li>It distills a long and highly detailed history of the company into a few concise paragraphs of original writing.</li>
<li>It draws from <b>a variety of listed sources</b>, plus separately footnoted and linked-within-article sources, as well as other Wikipedia articles (such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Baker_%28artist%29_3144.html" title="Matt Baker (artist)">Matt Baker</a>) to, in the intro, encapsulate the company's firsts in a way the comicvilleart pieces does not, and, in the history, adds many details the comicartville piece does not.</li>
<li>And finally, it includes a bibliograpy constructed from various contradictory sources, a bibliography constructed with my own sweat and hours — all of this, working anonymously, done not for credit or self-aggrandizement, but as an unnamed volunteer to help write an enyclopedia. If you'd wanted to write a St. John article from scratch as I did, nothing was stopping you.</li>

<dd>In this users defense, he/she was new and did not originate that site or spread it, I think, with any malice. He seems to just want a response from the users who it is about, in effect alerting them, and having the problem it talks about openly discussed, or responded to by the other side. I also note that the user, after being notified of his vio for the 3RR reverted himself so as not to violate the rule, and promised to follow the rules. I think he/she is potencially a good user, with a little explanation, and that therefore this bann is not just, esp. not indefintitely. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 02:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Simple Pilgrim has contacted me via e-mail contesting the legitimacy of the block I placed on him. He also posted on his talk page, and I replied at his talk page. I am pasting those two comments here so that others may weigh in on whether the block should be reduced/lengthened/left-alone. <a href="../../../h/k/3/User%7EHK30_d715.html" title="User:HK30">User:HK30</a> has made a similar complaint on his website. This is the comment from Simple Pilgrim:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am very interested in why you have blocked me.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In particular you say that I have posted personally identifiable information (or allegedly personal informaiton) onto multiple user pages. I dispute this and ask if you can point me at an example.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I gather from other sources that what you may have meant is that I provided links to a site which contained such information. If so, I dispute this too. There is only one site that you could be referring to. When I posted links to it the site contained no personal information other than that available on Wikipedia. I do not know if such information was added subsequently, but if it was I do not see that I could be held responsible for it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I notice that other users have also been blocked for doing the same thing. As far as I can tell, no one was warned about the Wikipedia rule concerning personal information and the website in question says that no attempt was made to contact it. This seems exraordinary. Why would you and AnnH seek to punish people for a first offence (people who could well not have known about the rule) but make no effort to have the offending material removed. This of course is a secondary question since, as I mentioned, in my case no offence was commited anyway - the links provided being perfectly acceptable when they were posted)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For the sake of clarity, I am happy to confirm that I have no intention of either mentioning or providing links to personal information in the future and in the circumstances I would be grateful if you would lift your unwarranted ban immediately <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplePilgrim_2f56.html" title="User:SimplePilgrim">SimplePilgrim</a> 21:43, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just received your e-mail. I will begin reviewing your situation and then I will make a more substantive reply to you here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 18:12, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here is a more complete explanation of why you were blocked:
<ol>
<li>You were blocked for a post you made at 23:44, 13 April 2006 (UTC) to <a href="../../../h/k/3/User_talk%7EHK30_07c1.html" title="User talk:HK30">User_talk:HK30</a>. That post has been deleted now, so it does not appear in your user contributions. It is visible to administrators if the go to HK30's talk history and view deleted edits. The content of your post was to point HK30 to an external website.</li>
<li>HK30 then spread that information further around Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The content of that website regurgitated the same content that previously made up the user page of User:John1838 and User:J1838.</li>
<li>The content from those user pages was deemed to be a personal attack, so it was deleted from those pages.</li>
<li>You have admitted that you are the same user as User:John1838 and User:J1838.</li>
<li>Given that this external website incorporates information off your old user pages, and pushes the same POV you have pushed here (which is your view that there is some sort of Christian cabal controlling edits to specific articles), it is highly likely you are directly affiliated with the external site.</li>
<li>Moving deleted content off to an external site in an attempt to circumvent the deletion of it here is simply not acceptable. By itself this would be a blockable offense because you are trying to use a back door to reintroduce these personal attacks. You are doing so with full knowledge of the policy you are violating because you went through the whole proceedure when it was deleted off your user page.</li>
<li>The external website also reveals personal information about some Wikipedia contributors. This is a violation of <a href="../../../h/a/_/WP%7EHA_a95d.html" title="WP:HA">WP:HA</a>. Harrassment of editors is such a serious offense that it merits no prior warning. I will block on site for harrassment based around distributing people's personal information.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd><b>In conclusion</b> - you did post a link to an external site. That site does provide personal information about Wikipedia editors. Such posting of information is considered harassement. The site is also being used an an attempt at an end-run to reintroduce content that was deleted off your Wikipedia user page. In the context of that deletion - you have been suitably warned already. Therefore, I see no reason to remove or shorten the block.</dd>
<dd>For clarity, short blocks override long blocks, therefore, your block will expire in a little less than a month.</dd>
<dd>I am also making a new post to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> to show other administrators that you have contested your block, and that I have replied to you declining to remove or shorten the block. This will give other admins a chance to review my decision.</dd>
<dd>Be warned, however, that the community is just as likely to decide to lenghten the block (perhaps permenantly) as they are to reduce it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True. The backstory is described pretty well on Slashdot.org posting. Although I should mention that both Timothy Usher and Pecher have been lobbing attacks at editors who were critical of what they believe. It actually qualifies as bullying and borderline psychological terrorism. As editors we either agree with those two or we suffer the consequences. I'd like to remind you that these two fired the first shots on my user page and I'm disappointed with the Admins responses to this harassment so far. 24.7.141.159 03:39, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lastly, the Talk:Islamism page was protected because User:Timothy_Usher was removing people's comments. The Administrators agreed this was non-sense. I certainly hope we come together as a community to rid our community of any editors that follow the lead of these two.

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I was alerted to this incident on my talk page and wanted to submit a letter I had been preparing detailing the actions of these two users. I only ask for your consideration.</p>
<p>My overall impression of both "Timothy Usher" and "Pecher" is one of growing annoyance at their heavy handed tactics against anyone who questions their established paradigms against Islam. Recently, Timothy Usher has taken part of multiple campaigns against any user he deems fit to attack. It started above when he lobbed insults and accusations at "Deuterium" [/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#User:Deuterium]. Anyone that made the error of contributing an opinion was labeled a sock puppet of Deuterium and sucked into this war. I completely understand why so many editors have avoided commenting on this troubled username, but by ignoring the problem things have gotten worse.</p>
<p>At one point in this protracted battle, "Timothy Usher" had falsely claimed I was 4 different users. His only evidence was English phrases he deemed to be similar. Colloquial English has a very limited set of common phrases people tend to use over and over in casual speech and discussion. This evidence alone cannot be a grounds for a substantive accusation any more than hearsay can be admitted into a court room. Had the users in question been using esoteric terminology it would have strengthen the case but even then examination of IP addresses was a better solution. Although the IP address clearly showed, after I geo-located them, that it was next to impossible for me to be 400 and 1800 miles away from my university. This absolved me of any claims that I had been any of these users and he quickly dropped this line of attack on the notice board. He didn't respond to my sincere desire to understand why he felt it necessary to involve me in his attacks. This, however, wasn’t the end of this user’s attacks or his desire to recruit others to carry out his agenda.</p>
<p>After viewing a private web forum discussion talking about Wikipedia editors leading wars against other users, it came to my attention that editor comments were being censored on a Wikipedia talk page. Although I was hesitant at first to be bothered to participate, I pulled out my old username that I hadn’t used in months in an attempt to correct this serious offense. I began by asking Timothy Usher to stop this violation of our community policies. Only after he kept violating these basic rules that I asked Administrators to protect the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> talk page. Timothy Usher at the time had created an anonymous sock puppet from IP address 67.188.110.197 that he used to make is sound like he had a lot of support on his side. He knowingly changed his grammatical style to hide this fact and carried on reverting articles and lobbing criticism. This can easily be seen by examining that IP's contributions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/67.188.110.197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/67.188.110.197" rel="nofollow">[85]</a> coming about right when the Islamism debate heated up.</p>
<p>Timothy Usher and Pecher’s violations are too numerous to list but there are quite a few notable events. Timothy Usher has compared other editors to murderers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=47044022&amp;oldid=47043779" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=47044022&amp;oldid=47043779" rel="nofollow">[86]</a> and has grossly violated <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> on the Islamism talk page multiple times. A glance over at <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUser247_6116.html" title="User talk:User247">User_talk:User247</a> and my own talk page shows "Timothy Usher" starting his accusations against both of us to somehow be sock puppets of each other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:User247&amp;oldid=48633522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:User247&amp;oldid=48633522" rel="nofollow">[87]</a>. I decided to largely ignore him while User247 decided to defend himself. Further examination of User247's talk page shows "Pecher" coming to the aid of "Timothy Usher" with his own accusations of User247 being yet another editor named "MuslimsofUmreka." This accusation was quickly countered by "Timothy Usher" and both of them agreed to concentrate their attacks on both myself and User247.</p>
<p>I am now seeing a Slashdot comment discussing a long history of this epic battle. Where this came from is beyond my knowledge but I would not put it beyond Timothy Usher and Pecher to write such a diatribe to further their ends. Quite honestly, this entire incident is growing to be an embarrassment for the community. I, too, am finding these attacks are unwarranted and becoming tiresome. I don’t try to focus on Wikipedia too much because my studies keep me very busy. However, I can attest to the fact that all the regular editors over at the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> article have left due to the events that have taken place since Timothy Usher arrived. Regardless of my personal opinions on the article, we cannot afford to drive out content creators and editors because of the actions of users such as Timothy Usher and Pecher.</p>
<p>"Timothy Usher" and his friend "Pecher" (anyone else think they are the same person?), have a fair bit of trouble getting along with people. I also firmly agree with the sentiment that this complaint is in retribution for the Administrator Notice against User "Timothy Usher" not too far above. Maybe its time we, as a community, ask Timothy Usher and Pecher to start abiding by our rules of conduct. If they cannot follow these rules, then they should have the option of not contributing any longer. We cannot make exceptions for any editor who wastes limited Wiki resources of prosecuting an agenda war because the casualties are editors who have made this place as great as it is. I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter. I look forward to proper measures being taken so this never happens again from these two user accounts.</p>
<p>Although I know that my comment will open me up to an assault of name calling, false accusations, and belligerent commentary in gross violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> from both of these users and those who support them, this is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 04:56, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wrote this to El_C on my talk page and I'm putting it here for record... Was that a comment or was it an introduction? I assumed it was an introduction to the talk page because it was not signed and was residing above everything but just below the notices. If it was a comment then by all means revert it or I can revert it myself. I had no ill intentions whatsoever. I suppose I became confused due to the location and lack of signature. You are welcome to check my other contributions because I never edit/censor people's comments. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To Timothy_Usher... please assume "good faith" as per Wikipedia policies. As you already know, I never revert or censor people's comments like you have repeatedly done in the past. I'm sure you can remember when the Islamism talk page was locked because of your censorship. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you are just hunting for anything to accuse me with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also for records sake this is what I am hoping to achieve (as posted on hrana98's talk page)... I think I am more than willing to overlook Timothy Ushers accusations of calling me an Islamist, a murderer and his constant harassment without any conditions if El_C continues doing the great job he/she is. Everyone has been asking you to abide by the rules, stop the revert wars, stop the harassment and name calling, stop using multiple sockpuppets, stop pushing your negative agenda against Islam, stop the meaningless argument, stop censoring people's comments, stop banning users who don't agree with you, stop asking for Administrators to ban anyone you happen to not like, stop labeling me a sockpuppet of another user without proof, changing your negative attitude, etc. I'm asking the same. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUser247_16e3.html" title="User:User247">User247</a> 06:30, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The next AfD must be Gay Nigger Association of America 16.</li>
<li>All other nominations will not be considered; in fact, they will be speedy deleted as trolling/vandalism.</li>
<li>GNAA 16 will only be unlocked after gaining consensus on the GNAA talk page that a new, never-before-considered argument as to why the GNAA is non-notable is possibly persuasive (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">User:Linuxbeak</a> realizes and convinces us all that the GNAA is, in fact, merely a <a href="../../../m/e/f/Mefloquine.html#Side-effects" title="Mefloquine">Mefloquine-induced nightmare</a>).</li>
</ol>
</dd>

</dd>

<dd>Or, boiled down to its core, <i><b>Deletion of the GNAA must be discussed on the talk page, and a consensus must be built there that its deletion in AfD 16 is plausible given new arguments demonstrating its non-notability.</b></i></dd>

<dd>

<p>Jiang was reverting his user page and talk page to a state that, in my opinion, called disruption of Wikipedia.

I am tempted to revert it, but I might very likely be block by either Jiang or Nlu. However, I would like opinions on this. Should his preferred version be allowed to stand?

<p>Well, as you can see, some of the words are in English. It seems like some sort of propaganda by the communist government in China to justify its claim over Taiwan. Some of the accusations include "Dalai Lama owns slave." "Taiwan=shame" It is basically two photos that provoke racial hatred between Taiwanese and Chinese, which is already a delicate topic on wikipedia. The photo also accused Taiwanese President <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-Bian_4190.html" title="Chen Shui-Bian">Chen Shui-Bian</a> of faking the <a href="../../../3/-/1/3-19_shooting_incident.html" title="3-19 shooting incident">3-19 shooting incident</a>, which is possible, but has yet been proved correct.

<p>I find it interesting that <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a> find the "Taiwan=shame" photos amusing. Nevertheless the captions depicted on the photos are forms of racism/personal attack against a group and disruptive to the wikipedia community, since Taiwan-China relation is already a delicate topic on wiki. (see translation/examples listed above) However, I still like more neutral opinions on this before taking any other actions. To add to that, I consider the following phrase "Freestyle king would do better to put his own house in order." highly offensive.

<p>You do realize SIP is just a sockpuppet of another well-established user, right? The tradeoff is either that the sock gets blocked indefinitely or the same sanction must be applied to the main account as to the sock account.

<p>The page Clive Bull is presently debating the introduction of a new version by Minglex. Some users believe that the article does not flow well: siting Minglex’s choice of subcategories, overall flow of the article (categories are stand alone and not linked well) and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>Sythriss along with Blanning (above) believes that the new version is better but instead of debating the issue has stifled debate through un-civil behaviour.</p>
<p>Sythriss used his administrator rights to protect a version of the Clive Bull page that is disputed.

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I noticed your block of Karmafist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FKarmafist&amp;diff=49017356&amp;oldid=49015261" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FKarmafist&amp;diff=49017356&amp;oldid=49015261" rel="nofollow">[106]</a>. However, you may have been mislead by his provocative edit summaries, but it is not the case that "substantially all" of his edits have been disruptive. If you check their content, you will find most are normal edits (admittedly with the customary level of sarcasm here and there).</p>
<p>I certainly feel a block is warranted by his last "f*ck it" edit summary, and a few others in a lesser degree, but a year is <i>much</i> too heavy for this.</p>
<p>Please review the edits under question so that you can see for yourself the were not disruptive, but rather that only his edit summaries were uncivil. I'd appreciate it if you would adjust the block time accordingly.</p>

<dd>You're right insofar as some of the diffs themselves show relatively normal editing with curious edit summaries. The way I see it, though, he isn't contributing <i>anything</i> of value at this point, but is instead doing three things: (a) updating his user page and pages related to it, (b) making various edits motivated by wikipolitics, and (c) baiting other people by deliberately ignoring the AC remedies. I took the bait -- knowingly -- because the AC remedies were crafted based in giving lots of second chances to an established contributor. But he's not contributing -- he's made a decision to leave and is trying to leave as much damage as possible in his wake. He knows exactly what he's doing and is flouting the community on purpose. While I appreciate your concern and look forward to further discussion, and am willing to remove the block if it's clear there's a good deal of reasoned opposition to it, I'm going to leave it in place for now.</dd>

<dd>I agree he's not very contructive lately. And no doubt his edit summaries are only to be regarded as purposely inflammatory. Thats why I formulated so carefully - in no way to I condone this behaviour. But to my mind, your points (a) and (b) are no reason for blocking at all. Point (c) certainly is, but for one <i>year</i>? While I often disagree with Karmafist, he has seen good times as well and I think this counts for something. He's not a troll or a vandal, he's a contributor gone awry. And I think "there is still good in him"&#160;;-).</dd>

As a process fanatic, I would think that we'd rather wait till the fifth (sixth) violation to have him blocked for a year, as the ruling <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Karmafist_75f4.html#Karmafist_placed_on_civility_parole" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Karmafist">says</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 22:59, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(from IRC) I do sort of feel sorry for Karmafist because I did used to respect him, but at the same time, he's been nothing but disruptive for awhile now, and I cannot in good faith reduce that one year block. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde&#160;Weys</b></span></font></a> 23:12, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have reduced the block to one week, pending me being able to discuss this with him. The one year block was WRONG and out of place.

<p>I have to agree with Oleg Alexandrov here. Karmafist is flouting the Arb Com ruling with his edit summaries, which he has been warned about again and again and again... and the spirit of UIC's block is right, but we should probably follow the letter of the law here and stick to the five-strikes-and-you're-out-for-a-year remedy of the Arb Com ruling.--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 01:22, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've had all day to think about this, and I have to disagree with the year-long-block now (and thus agree with NSLE's shortening of it). My reasoning is this: Karmafist is continuing with precisely the same violations that the ArbCom ruled on, thus, the letter of the ArbCom ruling should be respected. If he were doing something else, or taking it to a new destructive level, a lengthy block now might be appropriate, but as it stands, there's simply no reason to ignore the ArbCom's time and effort and short-circuit their decision. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 02:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User Zora recently reverted my contribution in the Rajput article without any satisfactory explanation. Here is what she did</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rajput&amp;diff=48963191&amp;oldid=48961689" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rajput&amp;diff=48963191&amp;oldid=48961689" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rajput&amp;diff=48963191&amp;oldid=48961689</a></p>
<p>In effect this is what she achieved</p>
<p>(1) Introduced a spelling error in the word "Coterminous".</p>
<p>(2) Introduced inaccuracy and confusion in a statement pertaining to the process of Sanskritization.</p>
<p>(3) Deleted the names of two famous Rajput personalities from the list of Rajput heroes, who will be considered heroes by any standard you choose.</p>
<p>If this is not vandalism, what is? Can something be done to keep her away from the development of this article, as she is nothing but a disruptive factor in this process.</p>

<p>I just now saw Maan Kanwar's notice at Talk:Rajput and his accusation here. I made a mistake. I posted this on Talk:Rajput --</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Maan, I agree, I made a mistake. The edits that you made don't seem particularily pernicious. I glanced hastily at the diff, checked your contribs, found that you are a brand-new account, and figured you were just one more of the sockpuppets that a banned user is creating at a great rate. I reverted to the last version by an editor that I recognized as NOT being a sock. I'm sorry I didn't see your notice here; I've been very busy. I apologize.</dd>
