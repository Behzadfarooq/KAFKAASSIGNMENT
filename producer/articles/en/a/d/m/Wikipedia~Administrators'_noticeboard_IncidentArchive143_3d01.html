<dd>Not all his edits are vandalism. I sampled one lower down, and it does indeed have no license info, as the template he added indicates. Since I created none of those images, and I'm now pretty sure the templates with that reasoning and a "from Commons" description are incorrect, I'll remove a few, but he has 130 edits. If a majority of them are bad, I'll need help.

<dd>So deleting those pages will not affect the pages that link to those images? If so, then I admit I'm completely in the wrong, which is why I waited for more opinions on AN/I before proceeding. I and others who responded were concerned the images might be CSD'd incorrectly and lost.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Considering this incident and another you mention, the template should have a bold note so it's crystal clear slapping it on images with "This is a file from the Wikimedia Commons. The description on its description page there is shown below." is exactly what's supposed to happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While it's clear to you, it's not clear to the people who responded here, all in good faith. I had no knowledge of the previous incident and noticed this one when I browsed some images in CSD.</dd>

<dd>Deleting the description page here won't affect the image in commons, or the description page there in any way. If you want to delete the actual image from commons, you'd need to log in to commons and be an admin there. Sometimes the description pages that are on wikipedia for commons images aren't useless, such as translations for longer pieces of text in the image description, but in these cases they were empty, and as such added nothing to the descriptions themselves. That's why the template says "[...]or an empty image description page for a Commons-hosted image". - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 05:59, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, don't worry about it, I'll probably fix (ie. delete) them eventually. And there's really no fault in what you did, you just happened to get unlucky by having people who weren't familiar with the subject answering at WP:ANI. As an example, I deleted the image page I linked above. As you can see, it's still a bluelink, but if you click on it, you'll see that it doesn't exist on wikipedia anymore (the "image" tab at the upper left corner is red). This is how it should be for the commons images. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 06:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad it's not a big issue and that you understand. I see the image is still there and that the Image tab is red, and "empty image description page for a Commons-hosted image" makes sense <i>now</i>.</dd>
<dd>See, I thought that "empty image description page" means that there'd be <i>no image to view</i>, just a description, especially given the other two: a missing or corrupt image. I wasn't sure if deleting the file "here" would delete it from commons or not, but I thought there'd be many missing images on the pages in "File links". Yes, some of the images had no WP pages linking to them, but in my mind there was a chance they'd be deleted from commons as well.</dd>
<dd>The other possibility was exactly what you just explained to me, that deleting these pages are fine. (How'd they come to exist on WP, since none of them had English translation descriptions?)</dd>
<dd>The wording is unclear since we all believed the incorrect option or were at least very unsure, and this is the second such incident. I suggest adding <b>IMPORTANT: This will NOT delete the image from Commons, and if you see the image fine above, you will STILL BE ABLE TO SEE this image on any page it's linked to, at this exact address and with this description. In other words, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Panic_%28Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29_6b66.html" title="Don't Panic (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)">Don't Panic!</a></b></dd>
<dd>I'm serious. It should be crystal clear that a good faith user seeing this 1. Shouldn't panic and 2. Why s/he shouldn't panic. I'd be bold, but <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template_talk%7EDb-noimage_16c0.html" title="Template talk:Db-noimage">Template talk:Db-noimage</a> says Be timid.

<dd>Vandalize? As I understand it the complaint here is solely about edit summaries? How is that vandalism? If he used no edit summaries AT ALL would we be blocking for that? It isn't the preference, but hasn't normally been a blockable offense. Is "SQUIDWARD" so much worse than <i>nothing</i> that we must warn and then block for it? What exactly is it harming other than his own credibility? To me this seems like looking for excuses to inflate a trivial issue into an actual problem. Leave it alone unless he does something which would actually <i>require</i> a block to prevent <i>damage</i> to the encyclopedia... not because he is using silly edit summaries while <i>improving</i> the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at the specific situation in the diffs above I agree (with Moe) that this is more than just a useless edit summary... those were extensive changes which could lead to confusion as to whether they were valid or not. The usual situation then is to communicate about the reasoning... I checked <a href="../../../s/h/u/Talk%7EShunpiking_ffbb.html" title="Talk:Shunpiking">Talk:Shunpiking</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">User talk:SPUI</a>, and the edit summaries in the history of that page, but it doesn't look like anyone even <i>asked</i> SPUI for an explanation. Others have since provided seemingly valid reasons for SPUI's changes here. Yes, meaningful edit summaries might have explained the changes up front and thus avoided the need for additional communication... which is why we strongly suggest that people use them. However, again... we have not to date blocked people for failing to provide that 'up front' explanation so long as they <i>do</i> explain when asked directly. SPUI seems to be 'acting out' in a less than helpful way... presumably because of the browbeating with which the road poll was pushed through (which, it should be noted, I supported, though reluctantly, given the wider disruption resulting from <i>not</i> settling on <b>some</b> standard). However, jumping to block isn't going to make that better. If he does something which seems strange without explaining it we should be able to muster the civility to at least ask WHY and only block if he doesn't explain it. Basically, the situation here is that we'd rather block than expend the effort to ask for an explanation. If SPUI were an actual 'vandal' who was unlikely to <i>have</i> a valid reason I could see that, but given that everyone (I think) agrees that SPUI is trying to improve the encyclopedia (as he sees it) why make a small problem into a bigger one? We should block people when we find we have to, not when we think we can. If SPUI wouldn't provide explanations for disputed edits then we'd <b>have</b> to block him... but if we don't even ask for explanations it doesn't seem like we're even trying to resolve things - just going straight to blocks whenever we think there is some reason that we can. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm wondering, what philosophy drives this block? An edit summary of "SQUIDWARD!" is not disrupting anything, nor is it any more useless/useful than a blank edit summary, which i don't see many other people being blocked for.

He clearly didn't vandalize, but the edit summaries just go beyond exceptable of what <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISRUPT_3700.html" title="WP:DISRUPT">WP:DISRUPT</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> say.

<p>I have been engaged in a lengthy correspondence with <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">User:PM Poon</a>. The history is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>User posts three copyvio articles.</li>
<li>I mark them as copyvios.</li>
<li>They write back, unhappy about this. I explain why I did this, and explain why it is sometimes difficult to AGF in the case of multiple copyings, and express my relief that they are a good-faith editor.</li>
<li>User apologises, rewrites two of them, I rewrite the other.</li>
<li>I write back to them, thanking them for their good edits, and all is right with the world.</li>
<li>Some time later, the user returns to my talk page, arguing the toss about whether their edits were a copyvio in the first place, and demanding that I show them how their text resembles the original text</li>
<li>I show them, in a long and careful (and partially computer-aided) analysis of their text. (Summary: over 90% is either literally copied, with slight puntcuation changes, or lightly paraphrased from the original source)</li>
<li>They take this as a personal affront, and advance a number of impassioned arguments about why they are right and I am wrong, wrong, wrong. (The correspondence is no longer of my talk page, but can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Anome&amp;oldid=83301879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Anome&amp;oldid=83301879" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>)</li>
<li>When asked for a second opinion, I invited them to take up my deletion of their content on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>, but they have not done so.</li>
<li>They complain about the "ABUSE OF ADMIN POWER". They complain about my "HALF-BAKED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT COPYRIGHT IS ALL ABOUT". They invite me to "Ask God whether you have indeed been honest to yourself, and had weighed the evidence fairly and squarely?" They claim to have "consulted my ex-company's lawyer" who has apparently told them that they are in the right.</li>
<li>So far, so normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they are now advancing a new and potentially dangerous argument, in which they justify their literal copying under the principle that, since they are only copying a small part of the original work (for example, "only" a few paragraphs from a longer work), and are not doing it for profit, this qualifies as fair use. They are clearly convinced that they are in the right, and seem intent on continuing with their behavior.</p>
<p>At this point, I feel that rational argument has failed. They clearly feel that they are now legally entitled to copy as much stuff as they like into Wikipedia, regardless of what anyone else says, and consider my attempts to stop them from doing this as persecution. They feel that they have the law, their friend the lawyer, God, right and truth on their side. And they won't be told otherwise.</p>
<p>At this point, I seriously considered just blocking them as a serial copyvio artiste, and being done with it. However, that edit was carried out before our lengthy discussion, and the user has not made any further copyvios since the discussion started. Indeed, they haven't done <i>anything</i> else other than carry on this lengthy discussion, in spite of my repeated attempts to bring it to a close.</p>
<p>However, if they are allowed to carry on with this, <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYRIGHT_17d4.html" title="WP:COPYRIGHT">WP:COPYRIGHT</a> enforcement will become impossible, since they no longer regard the copying of whole sentences, or even paragraphs, from elsewhere as being evidence of potential copyright problems. Short of blocking, the only course of action I can see would be watch their every edit like a hawk from now on, and to clean up after them, forever. I don't have the time to do this, and nor, I believe, does anyone else.</p>
<p>At this point, I feel that their announcement of their intention to start ignoring the copyright policy has become, in effect, an announcement of an intention to disrupt Wikipedia. However, I am reluctant to simply LART-and-go, since I don't want them to have any justification for them regarding this as a personal campaign against them on my part.</p>
<p>I feel that I have exhausted every possible avenue with this user, short of blocking them. I'd like to believe that I've done so whilst remaining civil, and assuming good faith as far as possible. I would appreciate it if other people (preferably several other people) could take a look at this, just to be sure that this matter has been properly dealt with. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:23, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If he makes one more post which implies that he will continue violating copyright, whether on talk or posting copyvio, then he should be indef blocked, immediately, and told that until he promises to respect copyright policy he will not be unblocked. I'll do it myself if I happen to be around when that happens. We don't play games when it comes to copyright. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update: Aaargh. After taking a second look, the fourth and last copyvio previously mentioned above, in Internews Pakistan, wasn't theirs: it was introduced in an earlier edit. I've removed that from the comments above: the remaining three are still valid, as admitted by the user in their earlier comments. I'm also going to remove my text concerning it from their talk page, since they do not appear to have read it yet, and the last thing I want to do is to mistakenly accuse them of anything extra that they <i>didn't</i> actually do. However, the rest of my comments stand. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm myself not quite sure about this aspect of copyright law - does it make sense to distinguish between "copyright violation" (a legal concept) and "plagiarism" (a concept of academic ethics)? In the case above, it seems quite clear that, even if the guy should be right and it's not the one, it's the other. Does plagiarism automatically fall under copyright terms according to US law? And if not, should Wikipedia add to its policies that plagiarism is just as unacceptable even if it should escape the legal definitions of "copyright"? Just a thought. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 12:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a policy issue, this problem will probably get worse before it gets better. As the screws are tightened on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, it becomes more difficult to add original writing to an article, especially on more contentious subjects. Everything has to be tied to a quote. If the quotes are too short, someone complains that the quote is out of context. If you paraphrase the quote, you're accused of original research. As one editor (a well known admin) has written, "We publish what the most authoritative sources on the subject have written. <b>That is all we do.</b>" Thus, with limits on original writing on one side, and limits on copying on the other, it becomes difficult to write anything in articles where all the rules are very strictly enforced. Tightening up even further may make it impossible. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They originally said to see talk page, however they cited a straw poll as reason why a section without sources should be kept. As I pointed out to them and want to make clear here, the sections have sources stating they happened, however they do not have sources stating accusations of terrorism carried uot by the US, per the article title. It was decided long ago that section would have to meet this criteria, containing sources that actually allege terrorism, however Travb has initiated an edit war without providing these sources. I making this note here because I want it on record that I attempted to discuss on the talk page with him, and he has instead reverted without even adding the sources, or continuing the talk page discussion of it needing sources that accuse the US of terrorism. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:59, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zerofaults adopted a new name to get a new start, offering on his talk page to tell admins privately his new user name. When he was called on it by Travb, and informed of his error by one of the arbitrators, he changed his sig and has been open about it since. That aspect of the case is a closed book in my opinion. Regarding his current allegations, I have previously said that arbitration provides remedies for disruptive behavior but is not a scarlet letter. The <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">arbitration enforcement page</a> specifically warns users against baiting editors who are under arbitration restriction. (For precedent see one of the [[<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Deathrocker_ddb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker">Deathrocker cases</a>, where Deathrocker was blocked for edit warring but so was the user who was baiting him.) Unfortunately I am at work and can not analyze the specifics right now. If any other admin can examine the facts (is NuclearUmpf editing disruptively and is he being baited) a third party review would be appreciated. I will return to this probably after work. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:00, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dear Mattisse. You are simply misinformed. I've removed an inappropriate tag "unsourced", from articles that listed their sources. That tag is inappropriate in that case. I've moved the appropriate tag, not removed it. Please don't mischaracterize what has occurred. What is happening is that you are tagging in an intentionally annoying and serial manner in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. You have annoyed several editors in doing so. They don't agree with you. You refuse to really discuss it with anyone, despite there requests for you to do so, but simply revert to "your way" right or wrong, without discussion. Then you try to tar others with your own brush. Why not do something more constructive? <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 17:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Her replies to questions of her motivation/strategy for tagging have mostly amounted to "The rules say I can!" despite other editors making the point that it can be disruptive. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 17:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would not normally raise it on this page, but tagging along with the discussion, I have found myself in conflict with the same user over a blues page. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lee_Hooker_e754.html" title="John Lee Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> has a reference, to a book. After some other edits, and some edit warring over the addition of an "unsourced" tag, Matisse has added a swathe of "citation needed" tags, with the commment "added citation needed tags - please do not remove without addressing problem as doing so is considervanalizm as Ekajati, Notinasnaid [that's me] &amp; Anger22 have done previously". I would remove them, because there is a reference and no indication that the reference does NOT apply, and no previous history before today (on this article) of inline citations. However, I don't want to do what would be considered vandalism. I would welcome guidance, in passing, from people already involved with or looking over this dispute (I realise content disputes per se don't belong here)." <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 18:07, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll go add that to the article. Not so hard - 7 steps, a few minutes each at most. And the article is clearly much improved, useful link, additional reference, correction of minor inaccuracy. It's not as if by adding the tags Matisse is deleting stuff, he's just questioning facts that really should be possible to verify. John Lee Hooker is a well documented person, so it should be possible to do the same for most of the other requested citations without making a fight out of it. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Folks, there seems to be a continuing misunderstanding about what citations are. Read <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for complete information, but in summary, when claims are made it's necessary to cite the claim's source <i>at the sentence in which the claim is made</i>. I believe part of the misunderstanding stems from the fact that WP:CITE says that an article can use any citation method. However, a list of references <i>is not a citation method</i>. They are half of a citation method, but the other half is the notes within the text stating which source claims were taken from.</p>
<p>As an example, the citation tag on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lee_Hooker_e754.html" title="John Lee Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> placed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Lee_Hooker&amp;diff=83210696&amp;oldid=81048903" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Lee_Hooker&amp;diff=83210696&amp;oldid=81048903" rel="nofollow">here</a> was necessary and appropriate. Removal of the tag by Anger22, Ekajati, and Notinasnaid was wrong and shows a misunderstanding of WP:CITE. On the other hand, Sir Isaac Lime and AnonEMouse added citations for various claims, which was helpful. Mattisse added specific "citation needed" tags to particular claims that were especially in need of citation.</p>
<p>Mattisse has never tried to force citations for every sentence in an article. Rather, tags are placed on articles that have <i>absolutely no citations</i>. Often, a contributor will add some citations, and Mattisse will add a few specific "citation needed" tags to claims that are felt to be especially in need of citation. This is the way things should work, and if we can just get rid of this "freakout phase" of the cycle everything will be great.</p>
<p>I'll summarize. Articles need citations. References are not citations. Do not remove tags requesting citations without adding citations. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Folks, there seems to be a continuing misunderstanding about what citations are.</i> — Yes, but it is not the one put forward. A <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citation.html" title="Citation">citation</a> is the raw information necessary to uniquely identify and to locate a source. For (say) a book it is (at minimum) the author, publisher, title, and date of the book. The links between the citations and specific content are matters of style. But they are links from the content to the citations. They are not the citations themselves. An article without such links is not lacking citations. The citations identifying the sources are there. It is simply that the article isn't spoon-feeding to the reader the exact source to consult for any specific part of the article. (Adding such links from sections, or even paragraphs, to the relevant citations <i>in general</i> improves an article.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> is a <i>style guideline</i>, discussing (in addition to the Wikipedia house style of citations themselves) the Wikipedia <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_style.html" title="House style">house style</a> for such links, which encompasses &lt;ref&gt;, Harvard referencing, and others.</p>
<p>The <i>policy</i> is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, which merely requires that sources <i>be</i> cited, somehow. The (minimum) author+publisher+title+date information for (say) a book source, enabling readers to locate the book, must be present, in some fashion.

<dd>I'd like to insert a comment. I haven't read most of this conversation, so apologies if I'm abusing a deceased horse, but re: <i>"About the many "citation needed" tags on this article, rather than fighting over where they're really needed or not, the best thing seems to be to actually provide the requested citations."</i></dd>
<dd>That's true. There may be legitimate concerns about the factualness of the article, and providing sources (inline or not) improves the quality of any article. However, I'd like to note that it's possible for an editor to be unkind strewing many <sup>[citation needed]</sup> tags all at once. The length of the tag, though relatively small, is still obtrusive, especially in great quantity. Partially, it's supposed to be obtrusive, to encourage editors to get off their backsides and source this one particular fact or sentence.</dd>
<dd>Instead of adding such a tag en masse though, a good faith editor should either add an <a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Template:unreferenced</a> at the top of the article/section (which may not encourage editors enough to source particular facts) or add a few <sup>[citation needed]</sup>s and <i>at least make an effort to find some of the facts</i> him/herself.</dd>
<dd>Nothing except derogatory material about a living person needs to be sourced immediately. It can be done over time. So don't do the easy, unsightly, unkind thing and strew the tag. Instead, add 3 or 4. If you want to source some yourself, do it. It shows you're willing to make the same effort you're asking of others. It's not necessary, but I argue that adding 3 tags and checking back in a week is far preferable to adding dozens and making it virtually unreadable.</dd>
<dd>Also, I'd like to prpose making it smaller. Some people said <sup>[?]</sup> (question mark) wouldn't be easily readable on all fonts, but something smaller and still differentiable from already sourced tags such as <sup>[1]</sup>.</dd>

<p>This has been going on and on. Newser was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:TV_Newser" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:TV_Newser" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> on the 21st for repeated harassment of <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a>, and continued it when he got off. He has therefore been blocked again. I'm getting sick of reading this. TV Newser is repeatedly adding sock puppet tags to Tecmobowl's userpage, and accusing him of being a vandal/sock without evidence and despite warning. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATV_Newser&amp;diff=83376527&amp;oldid=83375935" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATV_Newser&amp;diff=83376527&amp;oldid=83375935" rel="nofollow">response</a> to the latest block was far from dignified. While everything Tecmobowl has done hasn't necessarily been to code either, that still doesn't seem like a reasonable excuse for this.</p>
<p>As for Poncho's Disco, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_American_Card_Catalog_7c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The American Card Catalog">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The American Card Catalog</a>, as well as Poncho's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ponch%27s_Disco" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ponch%27s_Disco" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>. The user seems to be cooperating with TV Newser in this; Newser showed up in the AFD some 14 minutes after it started, and as his first contribution after the block.

<p>I know there are discussions on this already. There is even a mediation (which only Tecmobowl has shown any interest in participating in).

<dd>Agreed. Three's the magic number, I've blocked TV Newser indefinitely. I'm not sure about Ponch's Disco. Clearly some highly problematic behaviour, but I'm not sure whether he merits an indefinite block either on account of being a sockpuppet or being completely intolerable. I'd be interested to see how he reacts to Newser's block. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 19:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support the indefinite block. The block I originally instated was supposed to give Newser time to reflect, not time to plan more mischief. His last edits indicate he has no interest in building an encyclopedia. I am not certain about Ponch, though it does seem suspicious. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TV Newser has needed an indef block for a long time, really. He's been little but trouble since I came across him, which was within a few hours of his account creation. There is, and I say this only tentatively, a possibility that in fact he is a sock himself of a well-establisher socket, since he share linguistic traits with a particularly unpleasant user who I blocked long ago. Add to this the fact that his 'recommendations' on who I should block tend usually to be the reverse of what I actually decide to do and well....I may have allowed us to be...you know whatted. I've had my eye on Ponch's Disco for some time, and if he puts the outside edge of a toenail wrong, he'll be gone for good. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 21:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lately, XennoBB talk page has been "cluttered" with link spam by <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraky_e5dc.html" title="User:Draky">User:Draky</a>, bad comments regarding some GPL violations which never occured (we're in process of identifying the user and pursuing legal charges against him), and the only "sources" he quoted are a forum he uses currently (no problem in adding content there) and a blog. Surely, this is not the case where I can add something on my blog then quoting it on WikiPedia for example, right? The comments must come from a legitimate and verifiable source, right? Well, this is not the case with our vandal. If the Wikipedia admins' idea of democracy is that everybody can add whatever content they wish to a software talk page(a free GPL redistributed software, which doesn't get any money from it) well, I'd say it's a serious problem. Hopefully the messages can be removed. Thank you. - Osgiliath 20:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, the user has done nothing outright 'wrong' and is certainly not a vandal, although his comments may certainly be incorrect. However, there are far better ways to deal with incorrect comments than suggesting they are "full of ####" and removing the comments you don't agree with. Leave the comments there and try to start talking things out in a civilized manner. Additionally, <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">legal threats</a> against wikipedia users such as the one you made above are absolutely not allowed, and if you make any more you will be blocked from editing. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okey so If I understand correctly, I can add ANY unverified content to any wikipedia talk page and the owner/editor of that page must prove that my statement is wrong? Good thing to know ...

<dd>Since nobody bothered to reply to my last statement, I consider it correct. I think that's a violation of the "somebody being innocent until proved otherwise" principle; I wonder if such content was added to an administrator talk page or a page monitored by him, any measures would have been taken against the editor. I bet there would be, but clearly, trashing the name of a legitimate GPL software does not qualify for the same measures. It's a pretty sick sight to watch ... Don't bother telling me I violated the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> rules or such, any administrator who read my first complaint clearly violated the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> rules, which you so dearly "enforce".

<dd>Hello. As I'm involved, I'm telling some words. 1st, excuse my english, I'm French not English... (Osgiliath told me he didn't understand me so I'm excusing myself again). 2nd&#160;: I recognize that I was too rude and that I didn't respect exactly the "civility rule" of WP so I apologize for this point. The rest of the discussion is on the talk page of the article XennoBB where I was saying something that is sourced with blog and forum assertions (like source code comparison) so it might continue on the XennoBB talk page&#160;! I do not wish to attack personnaly Osgiliath, I'm just telling that is "program" is not OK.

Firstly, Kilz made one non-logged in edit (to <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiftfox.html" title="Swiftfox">Swiftfox</a>) and acknowledged responsibility for it 6 minutes later, without any prompting that I can see, so it hardly counts as attempting to avoid 3RR detection, or even using a sockpuppet.

I'm concerned that perhaps the new password is not generated randomly enough (and so collisions could be found with a bot), or maybe there is a plan to mailbomb people using this facility. Either way I thought that this should be brought to your attention. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 21:17, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mass e-mails happen all the time, and we already know about them&#160;:) You don't get a new password everytime you get one of those e-mails. You have to autoconfirm this by clicking on this link in the e-mail, then it becomes your password. If you never confirm these e-mails and you delete them, you never change your password. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 23:23, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thing is, I was wondering if someone has found a loophole such that they can make a reasonable guess what the password will be changed to. Not being familiar with the mediawiki software, there may be some kind of attack possible.

Therein, all will note that I failed to realize that I had signed out, subsequently resigned in, and made a new edit with a notice to that effect.

<dd>I don't know if Francis' selection of the skip-several-edits first comparison was on purpose or accidental, but the 4RR claim is bogus.</dd>

<dd>It's not so subtle. Wikipedia is not a free webhost. He's playing around not really in "his" user space, but in everybody's.

No one could figure out a rule, but it's pretty clear that you've got to be working on Wikipedia in some way to get that lovely storage space.

<p>Arbustoo has not helped at all. I want to know why the last edit I made, as user Cmr924, is in violation of vandalism. I clearly had good intentions. As the article stands, it is very biased. It is very one-sided, and reflects negatively. This is not something Wikipedia is about at all. White washing? So, trying to fix its inherent bias is now white washing? It would be white washing if it was a BALANCED entry. Also, I simply did not login, although I thought I had. This is why my IP Address showed up first.</p>
<p>Arbustoo also claimed I was a bunch of different users. I invite you to investigate that, as I only have one username and that is Cmr924.</p>

<dd>Ah, I see. Still, I'm not aware there's an actual server performance problem being caused by all these people making minor unnecessary style edits&#160;: this page seems mainly there to explain that if you are doing it because you think it <i>helps</i> server performance, you are wrong, not to tell people not to do it for aesthetic reasons. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 11:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can think of no logical situation where the right side of a piped link would be longer than the left one. However, changing <tt>[[Chicago, Illinois]]</tt> to <tt>[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]</tt> would be quite logical, as it gives the reader the benefit of an extra link, with no sacrifice on the wiki-text end. Generally speaking, don't ever pipe a link just for the hell of it. If you think a redirect should be bypassed, rephrase the sentence to accomodate an unpiped direct link. If that can't be done, you might be better off canceling the edit. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 11:37, Oct. 25, 2006 (UTC)</p>

Said user, who has an apparent history of tagging articles for various reasons with little or no reason, and has aggravated various people with said actions while refusing to read anything associated with the article in terms of references, rather simply posting annoying tags, etc. The article in question is <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Byrd_1a88.html" title="Joseph Byrd">Joseph Byrd</a>, which Timmy12 has repeatedly tagged despite the fact the article has numerous inline citations and references listed at the bottom of the article from a variety of sources. After disputing Timmy12's tagging, they have labelled me as part of some cabal of people they've had an ongoing set of issues with I have nothing to do with. Timmy12 has now crossed any sense of good faith by reverting a significant number of inline citations I made to the page earlier today, just to attempt address an issue they raised I felt never existed in the first place, merely to repost their own citation tag that was inappropriate to begin with. I and others, from reviewing the history of Timmy12, have repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate with this person, who may or may not be a sockpuppet. The last revert by Timmy12 can be seen as nothing but vandalism, and this person should be suspended from continuing this kind of behavior. I read commentaries on cites, etc. from a link Timmy12 left on my talk page, but they don't follow what they insisted I read. Any and all assistance/advice you can provide would be helpful, this kind of behavior is absurd. I'd add, in this particular case, the material on the page has been verified not only via the numerous sources cited, but by Joseph Byrd himself, who has commented directly to me and others on the material provided, is a person I have known for some years and have published material about. I should also add I write for a major newspaper group and am a professional writer and researcher by trade.

<dd>Some of us have slow dial up connection, so yes 15 reverts does take time, and any way I did not think there was any race to perform the reverts (also I did rather need to leave to get to work). So yes, if a nice Admin such as Physicq210 (thank you) can do this with a single click, so much the easier is the overall effort on the wikipedia editorialship. If at any point I gain Admin or rollback privelages, then even easier too&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 15:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After seeing some vandalism tonight, I ran a checkuser on an account and discovered an *enormous* sockpuppet army massing. Come to find out it happened to be the range used by Blu Aardvark (72.160.0.0/16). I blocked over 100 of the easily recognizable ones (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Blu_Aardvark_1754.html" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Blu Aardvark">Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Blu Aardvark</a> - almost everyone one of them was one I blocked tonight). I blocked that range for 6 months - anon editing and account registration, but not regular users.</p>
<p>Here's another 45 or so accounts that may or may not be Blu's. I suspect the vast majority are, but didn't block them for fear of hitting a bystander:</p>

<dd>I'm Rosencomet, and yes, it seems that Timmy12 is actively stalking me, following behind me and eliminating the citations I post on articles I have either created or contributed to. He characterizes them as commercial, although I have asked respected Wikipedia editors who have been here much longer than I if I am doing anything wrong, and they say I am not, and have in fact reversed his efforts several times. Evidentially, I am not the only person having problems with this individual.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most recent examples have been elimination of citations for speakers and presenters appearing at an important event, one that constitutes a credit for them, that is three years old. The web page referred to advertises no new event nor any product, although one could visit the rest of the website from there if one was interested, but the purpose of the citation was to support the fact of the participation in the event, not to promote anything. In fact, they were mostly reactions to others (if they were others) claiming that I must provide citations when I state such facts in an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Except for the declaration that he has "taken down a commercial link", he has given no justification for his actions nor attempted to contact me or my talk page, yet the moment I reverse his actions he repeats them. I see that he has done similar vandalism to others, yet I find little or no contributions by him among the articles of Wikipedia. I'm relatively new at this, yet I've created and/or contributed to about 100 articles, revisiting most of them often with additional data. I've encountered several very helpful folks in this microcosm, and have been pleased to see stubs grow and expand into useful and informational articles. People like Timmy12, it seems to me, ruin it for the rest. I'm not sure what I should do at this point.

<dd>I apologize for barging in uninvited. I do RC Patrol, and it is common practice for me, when I see vandalism, to check the contributions of the user involved to determine if there is more vandalism to be reverted. I do not know whether that is Wikistalking or not, but it is <b>my</b> practice, and as far as I know it is standard practice for many RC Patrollers. It would seem to me quite non-sensical <b>not</b> to follow up on the users contributions.</dd>

<dd>Without commenting on the above material, we've now got about 4 threads here involving Timmy. Anyone want to combine them for easier reading? And can anyone fast track those checkuser requests so we can say something decisively about them? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Please indicate which of my edits are relevant here, so I will know whether to defend myself, plead ignorance (I have learned something useful today), or apologise. Based on a quick scan of recent edits, I can't see anything in common between <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Notinasnaid_b1b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Notinasnaid">Special:Contributions/Notinasnaid</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Timmy12_d60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Timmy12">Special:Contributions/Timmy12</a> (except this page, of course), but I could easily have missed something.

<p>I received these two vandalism warnings today:</p>
<p><b>*First warning:</b></p>
<p>--Vandalism warming--</p>
<p>Please do not remove content from Wikipedia, as you did to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winterstar_Symposium_3c85.html" title="Winterstar Symposium">Winterstar Symposium</a>.

<p><b>*Second warning:</b></p>
<p>--Removing citations is vandalism--</p>
<p>Please stop removing citations from articles. It is vandalism--</p>
<div class="floatleft"><span><a href="../../../s/t/o/Image%7EStop_hand.svg_c10c.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/8b/Stop_hand.svg/30px-Stop_hand.svg.png" alt="" width="30" height="30" longdesc="../../../s/t/o/Image%7EStop_hand.svg_c10c.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>This is your <b>last warning</b>.<br />
The next time you <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalize</a> a page, you <i>will</i> be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> from editing Wikipedia. -999</p>
<hr />
<p><b>*My actual behavior:</b></p>
<p>The "vandalism" of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winterstar_Symposium_3c85.html" title="Winterstar Symposium">Winterstar Symposium</a> consisted of (as recorded in the edit summary) -- (External link - removing 1 of 2 links to a Rosencomet commercial site as 2 links to exact same site address are unnecessarily commercial). This was one edit only. I have not edited that article since, so I do not know what the second warning refers to. The last time I edited that article was October 12, 2006.</p>
<p>The warning was given to me by the same person who left the note below, soon after I joined Wikipedia so I had no idea what it meant:</p>
<p>-- You again? --Hello, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a>! -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 17:35, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I had a discussion of <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">User:Rosencomet</a> commercial links a while ago with <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">User talk:JzG</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG%2FArchive-Oct-2006&amp;diff=83437625&amp;oldid=83219283#Maybe_you_can_help" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG%2FArchive-Oct-2006&amp;diff=83437625&amp;oldid=83219283#Maybe_you_can_help" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, he agreed the site was commerical and said he was in favor of reducing link spam.</p>
<p><br />

<dd>With cases these obvious, it's not necessarily needed to leave a talk page message.

If the consensus is to block him for legal threats, that's fine too. I am leaving his horrendously long and poorly formatted post on my page (most of it is a cut-and-paste letter to another editor, some is commentary about what others have left on his page, and some, of course, is actually directed to me.) <b>Note:</b> He looked at my block log; comparing my block message about him to a block message I left for another anon; He signed with a link to Liberty and a small icon of an American flag, and all in all seems to have a good bit of Wikipedia experience, legal threats and calling a short block "banning" notwithstanding. He has repeatedly vandalized another editor's User, not Talk, page, and in this puppy's opinion knew what he was doing. I could be wrong, of course.

<p>Need some guidance. I was about to block this user when I realized I should get other opinions first.

<p>Actually, I am going to block him for 2 weeks (1 week was his last block). If someone disagrees, they can shorten it.

<dd>Two blocks for the same thing in the last month-or-so, then returns to such diabolical behaviour? I would have been thinking at least a month, considering what he said. However, if you reckon 2 weeks is enough, that's fine. I can't see anyone shortening it, given his past, and the fact that the blatant PA's contained such racist and homophobic content.

<p>Some months ago, I had added to the article "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life" some information I considered relevant to the film's low box office numbers, specifically a comparrison to the film "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in which I and many others had seen an apparent remake of the first twenty minutes of "Raiders" into "Cradle". This was mearly trivial information which added to the scope of the artical. However, someone who is known as "TheHandle" did not see it that way, erased what I had written, and left an abusive paragraph in the Discussion page. I had replaced the article, but he deleted it again, this time with statements in which he has refused to allow me to answer. Instead of doing what is required in the Discussion page, "TheHandle" decided to use foul language and behave in a very un-professional manner. Can something be done about it?

<dd>NBGPWS's intentions are clear from his username: "Neocons Be Gone, Protest Warrior Sucks". Until recently, NBG has put a great deal of effort into vexing supporters of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_Warrior_6648.html" title="Protest Warrior">Protest Warrior</a> at that article and related articles. In other words, <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> is a special-purpose troll account. NBG has since branched out into wild claims at AfD and DRV pages. NBG's marked problems with spelling, grammar and wikisyntax seem to fade out when he gets really het up, suggesting to me that NBGPWS may be a sock-puppet account.

<dd>The question really shouldn't be whether he is vexing "supportors" of Protest Warrior. Is he vexing _neutral_ editors at those articles?

<p>Daniel Brandt's recent plagiarism report uncovered that Jack had added text without attribution from the Utah History Encyclopedia, which is not a public domain resource, to the article on Utah governor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Blood_9a62.html" title="Henry H. Blood">Henry H. Blood</a>. Following Brandt's lead I've found that Jack Cox also plagiarized from the same source in writing articles on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_R._Mabey_5634.html" title="Charles R. Mabey">Charles R. Mabey</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Christopher_Cutler_a161.html" title="John Christopher Cutler">John Christopher Cutler</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/b/Heber_Manning_Wells_5a83.html" title="Heber Manning Wells">Heber Manning Wells</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Spry_fbb9.html" title="William Spry">William Spry</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_B._Maw_fc7e.html" title="Herbert B.

Rampton">Calvin L. Rampton</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_M._Matheson_db69.html" title="Scott M. Matheson">Scott M. Matheson</a> - all of them Utah governors. In each case I've deleted the articles and restored pre-Jack versions where there were any.</p>
<p>I have checked a few of Jack's other contributions and found one more plagiarism incident, Charlie Wyse, which was not from the same source. Obviously I have made nothing like a comprehensive check of Jack's thousands of edits, most of which don't have an edit summary. <b>It his highly likely that multiple copyright violations inserted by him are still out there.</b></p>
<p>Looking at Jack's talk page I notice that OrphanBot doesn't like him and the feeling is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Steven_Blum.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63532300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Steven_Blum.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63532300" rel="nofollow">mutual</a> I get the feeling that this contributor habitually doesn't exercise enough caution in handling copyrighted material. Please take whatever action you feel is appropriate. We would of course be fully justified in banning him but if someone could engage him productively, get him to clean up his act and help in identifying old boo-boos that could be even more valuable.</p>
<p>I'd also like to encourage more admins to get involved with the project on identifying serial plagiarists at <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_list_0219.html" title="User:W.marsh/list">User:W.marsh/list</a>.

<p>Yes, one of these bored kids created his own long term abuse section recently (I deleted it).

<p>Briefs, eh? Wikinews has had a problem with a "briefs vandal" where a sockpuppet army (one sockpuppet at a time) would basically rise and create articles about briefs. They, of course, get banned quickly, do the CheckUser, and get on with our lives.

<p>Simple: delete silly hoax articles on sight, protect and block/ban for repeat offenses. Once the person behinds it realises they're wasting quite a bit of effort on nothing at all, they'll stop. If it does get to be a bother, a call to the school might be in order.

<p>I'm hereby reporting <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthseeker_85.5_20f3.html" title="User:Truthseeker 85.5">User:Truthseeker 85.5</a>'s behaviour, that is becoming more and more disruptive with time.</p>
<p>Originally an anonymous and variable IP stalking several people on WP, his finally made an account and was warned by Alex Bakharev and Blnguyen against such kind of stalking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Truthseeker_85.5&amp;oldid=67600678" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Truthseeker_85.5&amp;oldid=67600678" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>.</p>
<p>He was again warned by Bishonen for RFA disruption and PAs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATruthseeker_85.5&amp;diff=76715914&amp;oldid=67601920" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATruthseeker_85.5&amp;diff=76715914&amp;oldid=67601920" rel="nofollow">[86]</a></p>
<p>Just a few days ago, he was warned by Alex and Piotrus as per WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL policy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATruthseeker_85.5&amp;diff=82615128&amp;oldid=76715914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATruthseeker_85.5&amp;diff=82615128&amp;oldid=76715914" rel="nofollow">[87]</a></p>
<p>I warned him yet another time for personal attacks just today. Indeed, I discovered that he has been spamming people's talk pages to vote on a (in)famous WP:RM regarding the <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila.html" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> article. In addition to that, his tone was deeply inflammatory and offensive (see an example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ldingley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83826508" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ldingley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83826508" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p>Needless to say, he promptly blanked his talk page for "archiving" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Truthseeker_85.5&amp;curid=6256678&amp;diff=83826230&amp;oldid=83826066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Truthseeker_85.5&amp;curid=6256678&amp;diff=83826230&amp;oldid=83826066" rel="nofollow">[88]</a> Of course, no archive files was made, it is just plain BS to remove all these warnings.</p>
<p>Based on this, I request that a stern action should be taken against such kind of disruptive behaviour.

<dd>First, to put things mildly, that statement is not true. This guy was an anon IP stalker in the first place, resorting on dynamic IP to turn down any block attempt, then recieved warnings (including one of Piotrus') back in September (and even August if memory serves). He should have been blocked back then, but for some reason wasn't. Plus, he spammed talk pages and blanked his own in an attempt to delete warnings. He also disrupted an RfA with PAs. So all this stuff is only a catch-up for a block that should have been applied long ago.</dd>
<dd>Second, since when is it permitted to reply to incivility with incivility? That's absolutely false. Even if some statements were made (and while borderline, they don't reach the heights of Truthseeker's own comments), it is <b>NOT</b> a reason to go spam talkpages, be incivil, blanking your own talk page and so on.</dd>
<dd>Consequently, a) the block is well deserved, b) I don't see what's the problem is. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 16:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Irpen that a block for three days is too soft (he has made longer breaks in his edits). I am going to block him for a month for stalking Ghirlandajo and Irpen in the past couple months. The recent edits were just a part of it, but this time it got out of control. Usually the stalking was done in the article namespace over some minor details and one could argue it helped to NPOV the articles, but spitting out hatred on talk pages, already troubled with conflicts, is too much. Of course, not mentioning some insulting edit summaries. I hope one month will give enough time to reconsider behaviour. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 17:44, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As the original blocker, I would endorse a longer block if the community agress on it. I only blocked for three days because it was the user's first block, and there wasn't community consensus for anything longer. The user had seemingly violated a buffet of Wikipedia policies, but didn't press his luck with any particular offense. Since there were not warnings for having either posted multiple personal attacks, multiply blanked his talk page, etc., I decided a short block would be appropriate. However, if there is community consensus to block for a longer period of time, I do not contest it. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Упражнение В!)</a></small> 18:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a long story about this user. At first he was a dinamic IP wikistalking a couple of editors, but then somehow was convinced to get an account. He continued stalking but since the "stallkees" knew who they are dealing with they did not bother with formal warnings or reports. His main offense is not blanking or removing warnings from talk pages, but stalking. He made those comments on talk pages that were reported here because he followed contributions of one particular editor and rigoriously opposed whatever he had to say. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 21:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

The full wording was <i>As much as I hate those limey bastard we must give precdence to whatever variant was written first on a case by case basis</i>, and it was a reversion of an anon's edit which changed the spelling of an article from British English to American. Note also that – unlike the words <i>kike</i> or <i>nigger</i> – it is actually possible to use the word <i>limey</i> in friendly (albeit very informal) conversation. WP:AN/I is not the political correctness police, and the usage in this context was obviously not meant to be offensive or derogatory.

<dd>Sorry this is not about political correctness it is about people and races being treated equally. Yes the word nigger may sometimes be used among black people themselves as a joke- but I doubt if the phrase "<i>nigger bastard</i>" was used it would be taken merely as a "<i>joke</i>".

<dd>This is not something we should simply sweep under the rug - when someone says something like "as much as I hate the $epithet bastard", it's something that people can reasonably assume is meant to offend. There are limits to AGF, and this goes clearly beyond them. If it's a joke, it goes way too far and should not be repeated. If it's not a joke, it's a moment of rather poor judgement and should again not be repeated.

<dd>(edcon)Brandt doesn't much like us, I'm afraid. The purpose of his project is not to assist Wikipedia, but to advance the theory that Wikipedia is a massive infringer of copyright and a massive hive of plagiarism. My suspicion is that if and when we fix any instances of plagiarism or copyright violation (the two shouldn't be confused--neither is a subset of the other, and only one is illegal, though the other is certainly unethical and shouldn't be tolerated on Wikipedia), he may well claim that our doing so is "misconduct" and/or "destroying evidence". Brandt's understanding of the "safe harbor" provisions of the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> is a bit suspect; that's entirely the point. When copyvios are discovered (by the rights holder or anyone), they are removed. Which is how the law is supposed to work.</dd>
<dd>Brandt seems to think that the safe harbor might not be as safe if a) particular copyvios persist for a long time, or b) if the number of occurrences exceeds a given threshold. There is AFAIK no case law to support either conclusion. a) might hold if agents of Wikipedia (however that is defined) were to know about a copyvio for a long time and do nothing, however Wikipedia is fairly agressive about dealing with copyvios. An interesting legal question is who exactly are "agents" of Wikipedia--Brandt feels that any administrator is an "agent".</dd>

<dd>I'm not a lawyer and I don't play one on WP, but putting Brandt's examples on the copyvio page (at least when a speedy is not immediately indicated) seems like the best defense to a charge that WP doesn't care about plagiarism. We could make the case that we did everything possible to handle his examples, by using the mechanisms we've already set up and which have successfully dealt with many other examples. As for supposedly "destroying evidence", anything deleted can be successfully restored, so nothing is really getting destroyed in the first place. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 18:08, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's because I've removed it already. One paragraph, present from the initial revision, went practically unchanged up until my edit, with other, presumably legitimate, material being added around it. This puts us in sort of a catch-22. If we delete the article and only restore the lone non-copyvio revision, it would create the appearance that I wrote the entire article myself. And that, my friends would be plagiarism in itself, not to mention gross exaggeration of my writing abilities. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 19:13, Oct. 26, 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EngineerScotty got one thing right. I do indeed believe that administrators are "agents" of the Wikimedia Foundation. As such, their failure to respond to copyright violations could result in action by the copyright holder against Wikimedia Foundation. Now then, the entire point of my plagiarism page was to investigate a sample of Wikipedia articles. I downloaded 16,750 articles from the listings at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dsp13" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dsp13" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dsp13</a> These happen to be a subset of biographies in Wikipedia of people born before 1890. It looks like these are about 32 percent of all the articles Wikipedia has that fit this description. I tried to process these articles in an effort to find plagiarism. The upshot is that I was able to do one or more Google searches for 12,095 of these articles. The rest weren't googleable because my software couldn't extract sentences that looked like they would work in Google.</p>
<p>Of these 12,095 articles, Google came up with at least one non-Wikipedia URL for 5,867 of the files. Some of these 12,095 files had several URLs that hit on several sentences in the article. Since I asked Google to exclude all pages with either the word "wikipedia" or "wiki" on them, these URLs tended to be either scraper sites that did not credit Wikipedia on the page, or possibly a site that existed prior to the Wikipedia article. I was looking for the latter.</p>
<p>To separate these two types of sites, I extracted all the URLs and sorted them by domain. Then I looked briefly at each domain. I came up with a list of 965 domains that looked like they scraped from Wikipedia. Using this list, I back-purged the data from Google, and eliminated any files where all the URLs found by Google came from a scraper. This left me with 1,682 files.</p>
<p>I compared these 1,682 Wikipedia articles with the suspicious URL, side by side. Most of them turned out to be from public domain material, and there was an attribution. (If I knew this before I started, my software could have looked for phrases such as "1911 Britannica" and eliminated that article immediately.) Some of them turned out to be scrapers that I didn't catch when I compiled the list of 962 domains. Others had only a sentence that may have been scraped. Others were marginal for other reasons -- the site had no copyright notice anywhere, or it was a blogger, or a forum, or someone trying to sell something such as artwork, a tour package, or music CDs. I rejected the marginal URLs. In the end, I had 150 examples of an article from Wikipedia in which some portions of the content appeared to come from an external URL that existed prior to the Wikipedia article. Most of these had bylines or copyright notices. Some were public domain sites, but there was no attribution on the Wikipedia article. That may not be illegal, but it's plagiarism. This is a plagiarism project, after all. I'm matching sentences, and the copyright notices are just another clue as to which content existed first. I'm not looking for copyright violations.</p>
<p>Then I went through the 150 and manually highlighted the plagiarized content. During this process, I discovered another 8 that were scraped from Wikipedia -- a some of these were second-generation scrapes that were harder to identify. I ended up with 142 articles.</p>
<p>The whole point of the exercise can be summed up in one sentence: I looked at about one percent of all English-language Wikipedia articles, and I found that one percent of these contained plagiarism. If you take 142 times 99, then that leaves 14,058 articles that probably contain plagiarism. I'm not going to look for these. It's not my problem.</p>
<p>Given that the agents of Wikimedia Foundation have now been notified that there is a systemic problem with plagiarism in Wikipedia, they have a duty to initiate, to the best of their ability, programs and procedures to identify the 14,058 articles that I did not try to identify. My sampling is the equivalent of a notice that there is most likely about 99 times more of a problem on Wikipedia, than the problems that have already been found from the titles I've identified on my site. Now Wikimedia Foundation and its agents should go out and find them. It's your fault that they are there, because adequate screening has never been in place. That's the conclusion that should be drawn from my plagiarism project. -- Daniel Brandt 68.91.88.245 23:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Although you'll probably be blocked rather quickly, being banned here&#160;:)... we seem to be doing exactly that. Your argument seems to be that Wikipedia, in order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, has an absolute and affirmative duty to <i>actively</i> hunt down and remove every possible copyvio (I'll ignore plagiarism for now, as many forms of plagiarism are not illegal); and that such efforts must be 100% effective. However, the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> doesn't say that--to qualify for the safe harbor, a website operator need only remove infringing material upon notification. Wikipedia does this, far more aggressively than most website operators. In addition, we must not actively seek to profit from them (certain peer-to-peer networks, for instance, traffic in almost nothing but copyrighted works, and benefit financially from their presence, and have been held liable for copyright infringement); as Wikipedia is a non-profit entity, we meet that criteria by definition. (There are interesting comments by some concerning <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>'s buyout of <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, and whether or not Google's style of targeted ads might evict a Google/YouTube combo from the safe harbor; this doesn't apply to Wikipedia as we don't accept any advertising). Your analysis reveals that of our 1.4 million articles or so, 99% are likely infringement-free; obviously Wikipedia has substantial non-infringing uses. We should chase down the remaining 1%, I agree; however, Wikipedia appears to far exceed our duty under the law. Of course, I'm not a lawyer--but then again, Daniel, neither are you.--<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 23:14, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is that still assuming that a court would accept Wikipedia as a service provider rather than a publisher? Or doesn't it make any difference? Some other things - Wikipedia is a bit unusual in that it actively encourages and enables third parties to copy its content. Thus a copyvio hosted here can spawn many copies all over the web. When something gets plagiarized from, say, Britannica, the Wikipedia entry will typically get a higher Google rank than the original page and be widely mirrored - suppressing the original work into obscurity. I noticed this with the half a dozen copyvios from them which I deleted today. Britannica could argue that this is highly damaging for them (and we probably have hundreds of copyvios from them). It's a bit counterintuitive that Brad Patrick can say: "Not our fault - it was user X who did it. We'd give you his IP but our records don't go that far back. So no-one can be held responsible." If we really do far exceed our duty under the law then it seems to me that the law is very kind to us. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 23:42, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The '1% have copyvios' conclusion seems implausible to me. Daniel's test found that 1% (actually, 142 / 16,750 = 0.85%) of the articles he tested had plagiarism (not necessarily copyright violations)... but he tested articles on people born before 1890. Surely that subset is both more prone to copying <i>and</i> less likely to be extensively reviewed to catch / clean-up copyvios. You aren't likely to find alot of encyclopedia articles on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> to copy from and people are more likely to know about the subject and write their own text anyway... and even if something <i>were</i> copied more people are going to be looking at 'recent history' articles like that and be more likely to recognize the text as coming from another source they have seen. Granted, articles on pre-1900 history and other topics may be just as susceptible to overlooked copyvios as 'pre-1890 people', but the whole of Wikipedia is not. I'd guess that 0.5% or ~7000 articles is probably closer to reality. Still an issue which we should look for ways to address, but hardly "systemic". Indeed, it is less prevalent than I assumed it was prior to this. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>There are also other factors to consider. Brandt's 0.85% figure is just for plagiarism he was able to fairly definitely identify using a particular methodology. It will only pick up articles which were plagiarized from web sources which are still online. It will not even pick up all of those and it seems Brandt threw out some possible examples he wasn't really sure about but might well have been problematic as well. So this figure does not include articles with text plagiarized from web sources no longer online nor from printed works. Also note that Brandt only checked three sentences from each article and only checked for exact matches on Google. This means that a part of an article can well have been plagiarized but Brandt's bot might miss it because he didn't happen to choose the right sentences. Or someone might have made minor changes to the text, enough to make a direct Google search fail but not enough to eliminate the plagiarism problem. And I'm not convinced that 'pre-1890 people' is a field especially sensitive to plagiarism, the Spears example is not very apt. In sum I think Brandt's estimate that 1% of Wikipedia's articles contain plagiarism is a very conservative one. My estimate would be 2-3%. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:14, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The word "agent" is overloaded here. One meaning is "designated agent" as defined as <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a>; that person is presently Jimbo. Nobody else. The other meaning of agent is as follows; Agent is occasionally used as legalspeak as a person whose actions may legally represent an organization--in this particular case, the suggestion being that the WFM is liable for the actions of each and every administrator. (What about wikis where there is no admin class--and anyone can alter content as they please? Are all users "agents")? Such an interpretation would make operation of a wiki legally problematic--not just Wikipedia, but any wiki. There is scant case law on the subject of wikis. The WFM could argue, that only those employed by it are "agents"--volunteer editors, regardless of how many bits they have--cannot be and should not be construed as agents.

<p>Yes, Jimmy is the "designated agent" for DMCA. That only means the Wikimedia Foundation filled out a form and enclosed $30. It means little else, according to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/</a></p>
<p>"The fact that the Office has accepted a designation of an agent and has included it in the Office’s directory of agents should not be construed as a judgment by the Office that the designation is sufficient or error-free."</p>
<p>"Definition: For purposes of section 512(c), a "service provider" is defined as a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefor, including an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received."</p>
<p>Look at that last phrase. Administrators spend all day long modifying material. They block users, ban users, protect articles, unprotect articles, and delete articles. Look at all the deletions they just did on the plagiarism articles. That means that Wikimedia Foundation is <b>not a service provider</b> but rather a <b>publisher</b>. The DMCA doesn't even apply here. The Foundation owns the servers, controls the software on those servers through employees, and is ultimately responsible for designating administrators. These administrators are expected to go out and modify content. They tweak, they delete, they revert, and they run bots to do it when they cannot do it fast enough. The Foundation is not a "service provider" under the DMCA's definition. Therefore, they should be doing the prior screening that any publisher is expected to do. 68.90.178.184 00:58, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>, but your statement "These administrators are expected to go out and modify content" seems to be a fundamental point of error on your part. ALL editors "go out and modify content," whether or not they are administrators. That's a fundamental function of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia, <i>as an organization,</i> makes every effort to prevent plagiarism and copyright violations before it happens. Wikipedia has a policy of removing plagiarism and copyvio on site, and the administrators (and those editors who comply with said policy) not only make every effort to abide by that policy, but many of them actively seek out examples of such postings. Not only that, but editors who post material in violation of that policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including temporary or permanent revocation of their editing priveledges.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Frankly, Mr. Brandt, no program is going to be perfect, but we're doing pretty well. And if our efforts are not good enough to satisfy you, then I humbly invite you to start up your own open content encyclopedia and implement the anti-plagiarism and anti-copyvio policies that suit you. We will continue to do the best we can--and in light of our continuing efforts, frankly, your complaints don't matter a fart in a windstorm. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 01:49, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Much discussion has occured at that article's Talk page and also on Heqwm's talk page and is still visible.</p>
<p>Heqwm himself filed a mediation cabal case, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-10-08_BSA_76e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08 BSA">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08 BSA</a>. Several editors have responded to that cabal case and documented Heqwm's problematic behavior. 10 days ago, a moderator said he would accept the case, but wanted to make sure he was acceptable to the parties since he has belonged to the BSA. Heqwm has continued to edit the articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82952665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82952665" rel="nofollow">[93]</a> and the mediation cabal case<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08_BSA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83114083" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08_BSA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83114083" rel="nofollow">[94]</a> during this time, yet he did not reply to the question of whether he would accept the moderator. Today, after the moderator stated that he would take the case, since there has been no objection, Heqwm has objected.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08_BSA&amp;diff=83855300&amp;oldid=83441313" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-10-08_BSA&amp;diff=83855300&amp;oldid=83441313" rel="nofollow">[95]</a> This is clearly a stall tactic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he continues to be disruptive at the articles. For instance, he made <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=83855031&amp;oldid=83008381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=83855031&amp;oldid=83008381" rel="nofollow">this massive deletion</a></b> today removing multiple sourced statements with the spurious edit sumarry "Removed unsourced claims".

<dd>Actually, the policy at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources says "Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote it, ..." We often use information provided directly from the source. For example, sales figures of companies, quotes from the subject of a biography, etc... Deletion of that material was absolutely not justified. If the user felt this sourced informaiton was inappropriate, he should have discussed it. Instead, he continues his pattern of disruption and incivility. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Read the article in whole. Self-published sources should only be used "when not contentious; not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing;", also note "Although the company or organization is a good source of information on itself, it has an obvious bias." (and should be used with caution only). Your examples are very different from the case at hand: Quotes are properly attributed. If you write "according to the BSA, they do...", you can use them as a source. For the absolute statement "The BSA does ..." this is not a good source. Performance data for notable companies is typically audited by a professional auditor, and people who misrepresent them can go to jail. As such, they have a certain level of review and are more reliable than pure fluff and marketing materials.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 20:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, but even if we conclude additional sources should be added, that does not excuse the behavior of this user, who does not bother raising these types of arguments at all. He is simply making deletions. And he is doing this in the face of his own supposed attempt to bring in a mediator. He needs to recieve a block and/or a stern warning against this sort of behavior.

<dd>Looking around a bit, User:Heqwm has 62 edits in 3 weeks, about half of them on talk or on the mediation page. How disruptive can 28 name space edits (slightly more than 1/day) be?

<dd>The urgency is that valuable contributors have been assuming good faith by trying to steer him in the right direction, reply to his mediation cabal case, etc. He takes one minute of his time to delete something, and then other people have to waste tens of minutes or more. Also, his behavior goes back much farther than 3 weeks. There was a lull where he was inactive, but this has been going on for months. It is likely (though unproven) that he was doing this sort of thing as an IP even before creating an account. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:40, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His first edit to the BSA article is on September 25th. "Much longer" than three weeks?

<dd>Because they're almost all on the BSA article and the same edit/revert/edit/revert. He is being <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Disruption" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">disruptive</a> and doing it to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. He seems to refuse to accept the mediation cabal though he himself requested it, which shows unwillingness to compromise and clear POV. This history of disruptive editing, towit: Misleading edit summaries - removing content for lack of citation, when the content removed includes a valid citation, adding tags for cites directly on a valid ref--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82952665" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82952665" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82952665</a>, continued warring on a A-class article without working toward consensus (note no one else has supported him). Evidence that BSA editors are not censoring, is that we have a FA on BSA membership controversies that was and is worked with BSA and non-BSA editors. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 21:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at your example of a "valid cite", it isn't. Not only is it a link to the BSA itself, hence not a good source as stated above, it also does not support the sentence it is attached to. Again, I very much think that Heqwm should work much more cooperatively, but I do not find serious problems with the <i>substance</i> of his edits.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 22:31, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment by the puppy: I'm feeling rouge-ish. He's wasted enough of other editors' time. Block him for a month with a recommended reading list of policies, and when the month is up if he has read them and abides by them, fine. If not, community ban. I would also support a community ban if those who have attempted working with him feel he is beyond redemption. If he won't even work through a mediation case there is little hope of Rfar being anything but a waste of time for the very busy members of Arbcom. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 21:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Alternative view by admin:</b> I have reviewed this "case" in detail. The "massive deletion" is part of a pattern of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> edits by User:Heqwm. Misleading edit summaries are part of the pattern — "Deleted unsourced claims" as the reason for removing a section of the article (that is cited) that he does not like is misleading. The citations clearly reference the topic; though it is possible that a slight rewording of the section, such as "according to the BSA mission statement", could be made. On the same vein, Heqwm has put {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags immediately following a cited sentence in the article.

<dd>The "remarks" left on my talk page warned me of "vandalism" and 3RR (which I did not violate). Keeping Rfc in line with the rules at the top of the page is hardly "vandalism", yet I kept that comment on my talk page. I did remove the big, ugly 3RR stop hand, though.

<dd>Turns out that the second undeletion was succesful&#160;:) You can remove personal information yourself. First you delete the entire article, then you go to the page history that only admins can see (at Special:Undelete). On the top is the deletion log, on the bottom the edits to the article. Tick the boxes beside the good edits, and leave the edits with the personal information unticked.

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there is no consensus that one should <i>not</i> remove warnings (cf. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_45df.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings</a>). On that basis, I believe that <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">User:Mets501</a>'s block of <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">User:Jooler</a> for removal of warnings is clearly incorrect. In addition, this is based on Mets's close of an RM at <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoghurt.html" title="Yoghurt">yoghurt</a> in which he threw out 5 votes for flawed logic, simply ignored another 5 votes, and declared that there was a 7-4 majority in favour of the move. (He also move-protected the page after making his "decision" and left the message "<i>Please do not come to my user talk page with long monologues; I will not change my opinion if you write to me</i>").</p>
<p>On this basis, Jooler's action (undoing a move based on a fatally flawed RM close) is correct, Mets' warning to Jooler is incorrect, and Mets' block of Jooler for removing the warning is clearly unacceptable. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 00:12, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to get the view from Mets, was the block for removing the warnings or for disruption by reverting the move? If it was for reverting the move, fair enough (although he'd of course need a warning, so if <i>that</i> was what the warning is then I agree with it), but for removing warnings, no. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 00:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

I extended the block when the warnings were continually removed from the users talk page. This block had nothing to do with his moving the <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoghurt.html" title="Yoghurt">Yoghurt</a> page and our difference of opinion as to the location of the page. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 00:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is nuts. Perhaps I'm feeling a little bellicose, but why is this "removing warnings" thing continuing to plague Wikipedia? If a user removes a warning, then he has clearly indicated that he has seen the warning. If he then continues to behave in the way for which he was warned, further action is warranted. As far as I can see, that's the end of the story. How did we come to take such minutiae so seriously that some admins think it is OK to block people for removing warnings? –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 00:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your close of the RM, your move of the page against consensus, your move-protection of the page, your issue of warnings for correcting your page move, your block for a non-existent offense, your protection of Jooler's user page <i>after you blocked him/her</i> (making him/her unable to contest your improper block), and your refusal to undo your block over the course of half an hour after I told you the block was improper can all be characterised as "mistakes" (if someone chooses to stretch WP:AGF almost to the breaking point).

<dd>The article at this point belongs wherever it was at the start of the discussion/vote. Moving it now is disruptive, and against a consensus agreement from both sides to leave be untill the discussion is completed. Your opinion does not overide consensus - nor does it override the need to minimise disruption and confusion over the vote. The spirit of wikipedia is fundamentally that of being constructive in the day to day work of building an encyclopedia. Anything that is disruptive, such as movine an article during an ongoing vote where both sides have agreed not to do so, is very much the anti-thesis of the wikipedia spirit. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 03:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As your previous comment was referring to the exact same thing I was referring to, I suggest you drop it as this is not productive. You had mistaken my comment to mean the opposite of what I actually intended (which I later clarified). Consensus is that the page not be moved during a vote on whether to move or not for wuite obvious reasons. If it was at Yoghurt to start with, that's where it should stay untill the vote is over. I have no opinion on what the name itself should be. I'm interested only seeing disruption minimised. I'm not advocating your opinion on the final resuult, not am I advocating the other. I'm merely pointing out to you that even if the artcile started at yogurt (which it didn't), then your opinion alone is not grounds for causing disruption by moving it (purely because you asked the question.). Moving an article after a <i>dodgy vote count</i> doesn't nessecarily mean that it was against the spirit of wikipedia. It could quite simply be a mistake (as here).

<p>Please monitor this user, as I am about to sign off for tonight. S/he has been creating articles about a town (and schools) that s/he claims are real just because s/he claims to live in it. S/he is also removing AFD tags and adding speedy tags to AFD discissions associated with the articles s/he created. When I issued my warning, the response I got was a personal attack. I think this situation will only worsen, so some form of admin intervention will be needed sooner or later. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScobell302_092b.html" title="User:Scobell302">Scobell302</a> 04:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

It had led to a revert war over tag. Some argued that she had put it in her past so she should be allowed to take it off her talk page. But <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Mattisse_b5e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Mattisse">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Mattisse</a> has confirmed that Mattisse was operating a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../x/a/m/User%7EXampt_ce4b.html" title="User:Xampt">User:Xampt</a>, just 6 days prior to her removal of the sockpuppet tag. I'm not sure what should be done about this (and since I'm not an administrator, there's not much I can do) but this appears to be the 19th sockpuppet she has operated based on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Mattisse_815b.html" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mattisse">Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Mattisse</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 10:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't do 'scarlet letters'. The sockpuppet tag is for users who have been indefinitely banned as abusive sockpuppets... not active participants. Neither account here was banned, and indeed as there was no apparent abuse of the dual accounts I'm not sure why a checkuser was even run. In any case, repeatedly editing another active user's page in ways they do not want you to is generally considered harassment and/or vandalism. Don't do it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Xampt part of the RFCU was added only because I didn't think it warrented its own RFCU since, as Salix alba stated, the account was never really disruptive. I just tacked it on to this fishing expedition that the rest of the RFCU appears to be since I didn't think it justified having its own RFCU. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 16:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, only admins can remove protection. Removing (or adding) the tag doesn't do anything. Secondly, the Winick article sometimes goes days with no edits. Anyway, I just blocked the editors who got around SP and edited the Zamora article.

<p>I have a seemingly minor but thorny problem with <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeandrod_cc8e.html" title="User:Leandrod">User:Leandrod</a>. He engages in frivolous changes of "typography" as he calls it, without bothering to explain his rationale. He moved scores of military articles, from <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-French_War_6b17.html" title="Anglo-French War">Anglo-French War</a> to the large series of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Turkish_War_f259.html" title="Russo-Turkish War">Russo-Turkish Wars</a>, so that en-dash would separate two parts of the war's name. This resulted in huge trails of double redirects, which nobody bothered to fix.</p>
<p>The latest bout of his activity happened a week ago, when he moved all <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Swedish_War_fdab.html" title="Russo-Swedish War">Russo-Swedish Wars</a> to his preferred spelling. When I asked him for a rationale, he went to consult <a href="../../../d/a/s/WP%7EDASH_9598.html" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a> and discovered that he was wrong about the en-dash. After I requested him to undo the damage he inflicted, he moved Russo-Swedish articles back to their original names but failed to revert his previous moves or to fix double redirects.</p>

The most disturbing thing about all this mess is that links to some articles repeatedly moved by Leandrod went red.

<p>If she were the real candidate it is unlikely she would engage in the juvenile attacks against me or trying to use wikipedia as a blatant political platform and I think it is best we assume this person is not the real Cris Ericson, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:12, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She's the candidate of the marijuana party. I see no particular reason why we should assume she wouldn't be juvenile.

<p>Purely on the basis of being safe rather than sorry and not assuming she would be juvenile when we might be wrong as someone may indeed be impersonating her.

<dd>You know what they say about assuming. Whether or not it is her she is not a credible politician. I wasn't suggesting that we assume it is not her. I would even be perfectly happy with pretending that we do not believe it is her, as I think it's best policy to be better safe than sorry. I was mostly just nitpicking at the idea that it is "unlikely she would engage in...juvenile attacks" if she were who she said she was. I think that's nonsense, and I think it's much more likely that she is who she says she is - as I said before, who would bother impersonating her? Other than that, I don't think I disagree with the actual course of action taken, just with the way it was expressed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody said they were. I support legalizing marijuana, and consider myself to be fairly credible, in general.

<dd>I wish you would look more closely before assuming that both parties' claims are equally credible. There is no evidence to support the claim that Pak434 is a sockpuppet of anyone else or that anyone else is a sockpuppet of his. There is, on the other hand, evidence amounting to proof that Fwdixon is MookiesDad, 71.125.234.14, and SuperDuperMan, and very probably <i>he</i> is Noumenes, not Pak434. There is no truth at all to the claim that Pak434 has violated 3RR, as can be seen from the edit history of the page in question. I am frankly quite perturbed that when there is evidence of one party acting disruptively and in malicious bad faith, someone who is not an admin steps forward and pronounces an opinion based on the presumption that the party who has been operating sockpuppets to deceive the entire Wikipedia community could <i>not possibly</i> have also been slandering anyone who tries to expose his bad behavior. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry for not presenting this evidence sooner; I had no idea that you actually <i>wanted</i> to see evidence, since you started off your remarks with "Assuming the sock claims are true ..." As you can see, the claims of sockpuppetry against Fwdixon/71.125.234.14/MookiesDad/SuperDuperMan are indeed backed up by evidence. By contrast, "SuperDuperMan" makes strong accusations about Pak434 and Noumenes and I all being the same person but has provided no evidence whatsoever, neither on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Talk%7ETom_Swift_5822.html" title="Talk:Tom Swift">Talk:Tom Swift</a> nor here. The claim that Noumenes and I are the same person seems particularly ludicrous, given that to my knowledge Noumenes and I have never agreed on anything so far. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:49, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Does this sound like someone who is interested in arriving at a compromise to resolve a content dispute or someone whose parochial view on an article is so entrenched that dispute resolution is impossible?

<p>I have come here basically bacause I can't do this alone. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> won't leave me alone. There is already another thread about this <a href="#Block_for_removing_warnings" title="">above</a>. I have admitted that I may have made a mistake, but for some reason Guettarda thinks that I intentionally am trying to harm Wikipedia, which is absolutely not true at all! He claims I "chose to ignore a large number of votes in order to get [my] desired result" in the Yoghurt requested move, which I have already explained is not true and have explained many times why I discounted various votes. I do <b>not</b> have any bias at all towards American spellings: I myself use various British spellings due to my British family history even though I live in America. And I discounted an equal number of votes for Yogurt and Yoghurt, so he cannot claim I attempted to alter the outcome. He claims I "refuse to explain why [I] simply ignored many of the other opinions" which again is not true: I wrote next to each opinion that I discounted the reason for doing so. He continues to make comments like "STOP VIOLATING WIKIPEDIA POLICY" and "This one never should have gotten past RFA". Can someone please tell him to leave me alone? —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 19:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That this keeps coming up is tiresome. You have not admitted you made a mistake. You said "perhaps [you] made a few mistakes" and admitted that you "may have made a mistake." You have not apologized and you continue to argue that it is correct to block users who remove warnings on their talkpage – something for which there is no consensus! I can't for the life of me see why this issue keeps coming up day after day on the AN/I. If you wanted to let the matter drop, you would have, rather than coming here to post yet another complaint. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 00:53, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently had a run-in with this user over the speedy deletion of some pages he'd worked on. I offered to restore two of them (without going through DRV), but his sexism and personal attacks quickly made the conversation turn. (See the conversation I removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMerope&amp;diff=82470327&amp;oldid=82470121" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMerope&amp;diff=82470327&amp;oldid=82470121" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as well as my comments (admittedly not the calmest I could have written) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStreet_Scholar_5141.html#Pakistan_Hackerz_Club" title="User talk:Street Scholar">here</a>.) Another user alerted me to the fact that he'd been warned for personal attacks in the past (which I had gleaned from his talk page), but I did not realize he had a similar incident report just a few weeks ago (see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive140_5e32.html#Comments_from_Street_Scholar" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive140">here</a>). While this was amicably resolved, it seems that he did not learn from the incident. While a person's beliefs are his or her own business, attacking a person based on gender is a clear violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, and requesting all womankind to respond to his attacks is using WP as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">soapbox</a>. I'm not sure if this should go to RfC, since the first attempt to resolve this was "successful".

<dd>I have encountered similar irreverence to wikipedia norms from this user before.I'm not sure how to link to this, but he made several uploads of images that were blatant copyvios (he put one in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_warfare.html" title="Mountain warfare">Mountain warfare</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mountain_warfare&amp;oldid=76796252" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mountain_warfare&amp;oldid=76796252" rel="nofollow">here</a>) which were speedily deleted. However, he had uploaded several such images from the same website that had a clear "All rights reserved" statement on it and, if an admin could assist me, then I can cite the records of the speedy deletions.This shows an irreverence for copyright rules on wikipedia. In addition, a mediated debate progresses on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheema.html" title="Cheema">Cheema</a> (see <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7ECheema_ccf8.html" title="Talk:Cheema">Talk:Cheema</a>) where he continuously misrepresents sources and tries to push a POV without adequate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Most of the sources cited in the article are fabricated or misrepresented and, when confronted about this by a mediator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStreet_Scholar&amp;diff=80428725&amp;oldid=79892086" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStreet_Scholar&amp;diff=80428725&amp;oldid=79892086" rel="nofollow">here</a> ignored the mediator completely and still continues with such tendentious editing (see mediator's assessment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuhammad_bin_Qasim&amp;diff=81031430&amp;oldid=81019678" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuhammad_bin_Qasim&amp;diff=81031430&amp;oldid=81019678" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<dd>To be honest, I considered it closed at that time for that reason (assuming of course you were referring to the incident on my talk page and elsewhere). However, this doesn't appear to be the case! If the previous incident had been resolved successfully, then surely the same problem wouldn't have arisen again. While this user does have many good and invaluable edits among his contributions, it's also evident that he has displayed/aired these very offensive views on wikipedia throughout the history of his membership and is unlikely to change them. I would say that a firm message needs to be sent - the question of course is what that message would entail, which is a question I cannot answer. The eeasy way has been tried already. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 22:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If RfCs were votes and worked like requests for adminship I'm sure he's be blocked in no time (referring to the RfA "<i>gauntlet</i>" that is, per the village pump).

<dd>Merope and Crimsone, you have already been a lot more patient with this user than I would have been, and the work of filing an RFC is really unnecessary in such a clear case. If they return to the misogynistic insults and contempt on return from this block, I suggest a month's block. Promptly. If that doesn't give them time enough to reflect, it'll be time to think of a community ban.

<dd>Absolutely Bishonen and Merope. (thanks by the way&#160;:)). Disengaging does seem the best course for now, pending any further notable event which can of course simply be recorded here for somebody else to see and deal with as appropriate, which if nothing else should further indicate consensus to this editor. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 15:32, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Go to the History, or a user's contribs list. Find the edit you want to link to. Right-click on the word "last" in it, and select "Copy Link Location" or similar (however your browser expresses it). Your clipboard now contains the <b>diff</b> link you want. Present it enclosed in <b>single</b> square brackets--not double like a wikilink--to make a footnote in your text. Hope this helps, please ask if it doesn't. The reason people are always asking for diffs is that they're the only <i>permanent</i> links; other types of links will deteriorate and die as the page they're on is edited. Just include a few good examples (not 20 of them). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:14, 28 October 2006 (UTC).

Tagged as {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpa_94ad.html" title="Template:Spa">spa</a>}} in the single AfD discussion he had time to add to.

<dd>Regarding the AfD noms, this is basically what happened:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I nominated all the pokemon episodes for a group AfD (it actually turned out the Pokemon Collaboration Project was already trying to deal with them, but i didn't know). This was about four days ago. Since not all the pokemon episode articles are properly categorized, it turned out i had missed quite a few. This guy turned up today and slipped about 10 more articles in my group AfD nomination (slipping in as in he put them into the middle of my opening, making it seem like i'd nominated them in the first place.) I removed them, explaining that he shouldn't have slipped them in - because it's misleading. It made it look like as if i'd also nominated those 10 articles from the beginning, which wasn't the case at all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But when he'd added those articles into the group AfD, he'd tagged them all as AfD. So i went and removed the AfD tags, since those articles aren't nominated at all. I decided not to add them into the group AfD, because it's already been about 4 days, so it's a bit unfair on the people who commented when the AfD started. And he...just kept on adding AfD tags back in on the basis that those articles <i>should</i> also be nominated together with my group nomination (note that he didn't actually try to create a new AfD nomination for them.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>

<p>I recently stumbled upon the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Wikipedia%7ETendentious_editing_11fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Tendentious editing">Wikipedia:Tendentious editing</a> essay and realized how well User:Anarcho-capitalism fits the description of a "problem editor". This characteristic of a problem editor particularly struck me: "You challenge the reversion of your edits, demanding that others justify it. Wikipedia policy is quite clear here: the responsibility for justifying inclusion of any content rests firmly with the editor seeking to include it." Anarcho-capitalism is similarly demanding that I demonstrate, "one by one", why his edits are not worthy of inclusion before deleting them; until then, he believes, his contributions have a right to remain, even though he hasn't justified or discussed them at all. Besides this illogic of "true until proven false", Anarcho-capitalism has the audacity to say that "There is no rule on Wikipedia that says I have to discuss my edits before I make them." This is right after I made him aware of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>. He also seems to think that he has the prerogative to determine the controversiality of his own edits: "I do not believe they are controversial edits at all, so I see no need to do so."</p>
<p>Overall, this editor's rejection of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> and explicit rejection of formal mediation indicate that it is impossible to bring about a consensual resolution with him—plus, I and others have been trying to discuss things with him for months on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> pages, yet he has made no, or only very minor, concessions. Likewise, an <a href="../../../r/f/c/RfC_1260.html" title="RfC">RfC</a> would be futile, because he adamantly believes, despite all objections, that "[He hasn't] violated any Wikipedia rules," and that he does not have to discuss edits that <i>he believes</i> are uncontroversial. I therefore suggest that he be blocked as per <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a>, because he is tendentious (he is a single-issue editor, as you can deduce from his user page, with avowed partisan intentions; and he only cites sources that endorse the anarcho-capitalist POV, leaving others to rectify the massive imbalance), he abuses <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (he says, "I haven't violated any policies. I cite my additions." — that something is sourced does not automatically make it worthy of inclusion, however, nor does it preclude violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and he preemptively rejects community input by explicitly refusing to discuss his edits in advance. At the very least, I would like him to be admonished by an administrator so that he will not continue to believe that he is operating within the parameters of Wikipedia policies and guidelines.</p>

<dd>There is no rule on Wikipedia that says one has to get permission from you, or anyone else, before they add cited information to an an article or remove uncited information, which is what I've done. You should focus your energies on questioning things that are not cited instead of being disruptive. And, don't tell stories that I refuse to discuss my edits. I asked you to tell me what specific problems you had with them. You wouldn't answer until you were pressed.

<dd>Gotta agree with WGee, this isn't a simple dispute, this is an editor who has consistently pushed his point of view and has no respect for Wikipedia or its policies.

<dd>'Sfunny how one of the people who agrees with him appears to slag the rest of us off. Virtually all left-wing editors have gone out of their way to allow a disputed reading of anarchism have a place in the article. However, POV-pushers like anarcho-capitalism and banned users like thewolfstar and Hogeye (and their many socks) insist on redefining the entire history of anarchism to make this disputed idea fit. Yes, we're biased, in that we have our own POV, but that's very different from pushing our POV onto the entire article. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 21:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Daniel, is there no course of punitive action that you are willing to carry out right now? — because his being blocked temporarily could allow a return to consensual editing. I understand that this is not the Wikipedia complaints department; I have actually followed Wikipedia's recommendations for "<a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html#Dealing_with_disruptive_crank_editors" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Dealing with disruptive crank editors</a>." Since the editor has refused impartial dispute resolution in the form of mediation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anarcho-capitalism&amp;diff=83960109&amp;oldid=83959237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anarcho-capitalism&amp;diff=83960109&amp;oldid=83959237" rel="nofollow">[117]</a>, which is step 4, I've carried out step 5 (seek administrator intervention) because he refuses to attempt to build a consensus. As I've attempted to demonstrate, he fits the definition of a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html#Definition_of_disruptive_editing_and_editors" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">disruptive editor</a> quite well. It will probably be necessary to ultimately seek arbitration, but I do think that a temporary block is justified under policy; it would also cause an increase in productivity at the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> articles. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 17:09, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>WGee is just making a lot of noise. I haven't violated any policies, and in my opinion I have done some pretty good editing. I've added sources where there were none, took out some unsourced false information, and better explain some concepts. For some reason WGee thinks others need his permission before they make changes to an article.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:25, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having seen some of these issues surface at <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>, this has been going on much too long; I'm glad all parties have at last read up on tenditious editing, and I wish you would both make an honest effort at mediation. The last time WGee approached <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a> about removing status of one of these articles, I encouraged him that dispute resolution would result in a better outcome for Wiki than seeking removal of featured article status; I haven't yet seen what looks like a sincere attempt to put forward a mediation case to resolve these issues, and two are tangoing. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 04:02, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There appear to be several editors in this area that fit the classic definition of Single Issue. I'd agree with what WGee is alleging about AC but point out that there may be more to this than just one side. However AC's user page!!!! My goodness, what a screed...

<dd>WGee is claiming that I am required to discuss my edits before I make them, but that's not true. It's perfectly permissible for me to discuss them after I make them. I'm trying to discuss the edits on the discussion page but he refuses to participate, because he's upset that I didn't discuss FIRST. It's ridiculous. He's the one that's refusing to discuss. I've been trying to get him to discuss what problems he has with my edits but he won't do it. All he wants to do is threaten to report me to administrators, threaten an arbitration case, etc. He's trying to coerce me, with threats, into not reverting back when he deletes my edits. He simply refuses to allow others (or at least me) to make edits if they dont talk about them on the discussion page first. This is all obvious if you read the "Unilateral, controversial edits by User:Anarcho-capitalism" section at bottom part of the discussion page.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 04:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, WGee, I don't know what your problem is. The consensus seems to be that Anarcho-capitalism's edits are just fine. <b>You are the one who is going against consensus</b>. He has tried repeatedly to discuss what your problem is with his edits and you refuse to state one damned thing. You are acting irrationally - he's right. You are only here to cause trouble with this article because you don't agree with it's phiosophy. That much is clear. I suggest that you might benefit from psychiatric help, WGee. Jesus, you're only 16 years old and you're acting like a mean cynical old man.

According to him, this is standard practice on the Dutch Wikipedia, and prevents vandals from retaliating. I see three problems with this: one, if he makes a mistake, the user will find it much more difficult to explain himself; two, it's discourteous, and arguably a failure of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to assume that someone is going to vandalise your userpage if you give them your name; and three, user page vandalism isn't usually a big deal anyway. If a vandal is diverted to someone's userpage, that means he isn't vandalising the encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>After a <a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKittenKlub_archive_7d3b.html#User_warnings" title="User talk:KittenKlub/archive">brief exchange</a>, which was then archived, KittenKlub refuses to sign based on the fact that it's a bad guideline and only a guideline anyway. For the reasons above, I disagree, but he is right that it's a guideline and currently it's just a matter of my opinion against his.

<dd>I also don't think not signing warnings is a very good idea, but unltimately he's correct: it's a guideline, and a guideline cannot be enforced.

<dd>I think this might be a bit of a different case; while it may be a guideline in the general sense, I think in the case of warnings it's assuming bad faith (especially from Kitten's statements), and almost harassment (in the sense that they're not making it easy for people to contest/explain their actions). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want 'enforcement' as such, I'd just like someone to give him a third opinion. Guidelines may be only guidelines, but they tend to stem from policy - notability guidelines, for example, are extensions of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> etc. In this case, both <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> are arguably being broken.

<p>I don't see why vandal warnings need to be signed. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:20, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Centrx. I think it is good form to sign the vandal warning although I think it does open one to being vandalized and attacked. If the vandal wants to explain himself, he can do so on his own Talk Page. Besides, the identity of the warning's author is available in the edit history. So we're only talking about courtesy here not anything very substantive. Considering how many people do not leave warnings when reverting vandalism, we should be happy that KittenKlub is leaving a warning at all. I would advise that you leave him be and focus your energies elsewhere. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 23:28, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I always sign mine, but I don't think it's that big a deal that he doesn't do it. Vandalism warnings are basically a community action anyway, so unless he's leaving them in an abusive manner (i.e. for people that aren't actually vandals), his identity isn't really relevant. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 02:13, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The least I'd like to see is five tildes (timestamp), whcih would make it easier for future warnings. Not signing it makes the job longer going into the history to see how long ago the warning was, especially when it may have been issued five or six months prior, in which case the IP could've been re-assigned and a next-level warning would not make sense. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 02:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. People leaving warnings later need to know when the warning was given. While it's possible using the history, there's no need to make it that difficult. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 03:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure I'd say it's a "big deal", but I'd largely agree with SB here. It seems especially odd to do this, while explicitly asking on one's own page "Please sign your comments using four tildes". The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Rule_1af3.html" title="Golden Rule">Golden Rule</a>, and all that. That it's policy to ignore guidelines (as well as policy to ignore policy) is ultimately a problem with <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">that policy</a> (and the dictat that underpins it being policy), but in this case one struggles to see how the imposition of signing warning even satisfies the side-condition of same. Doubtless we'll shortly be seeing a Wikipedia:Just a guideline essay (or guideline?): it's a depressingly familiar refrain. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:39, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not an admin, but before this gets moved to a page not on my watchlist, I think people should always sign warnings (although like others I don't think this is an issue that deserves punitive action). If nothing else, an unsigned warning carries less weight. If an editor is unwilling to put their name to the complaint they're making, then it encourages (IMO) the recipient to ignore the warning. Also, I think retaliation is a red herring. The thing is, editors who are not savvy enough to figure out how to use the history to discover who posted the warning are likely to have adverse reactions (as noted above), and those who are savvy enough can still harrass the poster of the warning. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 03:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is about a specific user, not policy in general, so <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">WP:VPP</a> is not the right place, and this isn't serious enough for RfC - that's blatantly obvious by the fact that I wouldn't have a second certifier. It may not be an admin-only issue in the strict sense of what privileges your account has, but it's an adminstrative issue in the sense that it relates to a 'behind the scenes' matter. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:41, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are two reasons why I sign my vandal warnings is to provide a timestamp for other vandalwhackers so they can provide the appropriate level warning and to make it easier to get feedback. You can easily deal with the userpage vandalism by 1) revert, block, ignore or 2) semi-protection. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 11:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If however, as the <b>author</b> of the work-in-progress in question, I am asked to provide ‘edit summaries’, I am in reality being asked to provide you and others, not with any ‘editorial’ details that might help anybody with anything, but rather give you a privileged insight into my creative process, disclose my work methodologies, organization of material, priorities given to certain aspects of the subject, the direction in which I am going with the article, etc., etc. No one has any right whatever to this information, and insistence that I divulge it constitutes an invasion of my privacy as the author. While such an invasion may not violate Wikipedia’s internal guidelines and policies, it is against the law of my country (which is also the country where Wikipedia was founded). By becoming a guest on this website and by using your facilities I did not, voluntarily or involuntarily, implicitly or explicitly, surrender the rights vested in me by the law of the land.

<p><b>This is just an example of what this user is ranting about</b>.

<dd>My apologies...I didn't see that there were admins who were trying to sort it out, other than the two who he wants desysopped. And don't worry NYBrad, I didn't interpret your comment hostile in the slightest - actually, quite civil compared to what you get other times from certain users&#160;:).

In the Privacy log on my anti-virus software, I found the following: <a href="http://visit.geocities.com/visit.gif?&amp;r=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AEbionites&amp;b=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%204.0%20%28compatible%3B%20MSIE%206.0%3B%20Windows%20NT%205.0%3B%20.NET%20CLR%201.1.4322%29&amp;s=1024x768&amp;o=Win32&amp;c=16&amp;j=true&amp;v=1.2" class="external autonumber" title="http://visit.geocities.com/visit.gif?&amp;r=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AEbionites&amp;b=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%204.0%20%28compatible%3B%20MSIE%206.0%3B%20Windows%20NT%205.0%3B%20.NET%20CLR%201.1.4322%29&amp;s=1024x768&amp;o=Win32&amp;c=16&amp;j=true&amp;v=1.2" rel="nofollow">[137]</a> , <a href="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=76001404&amp;t=1162135553&amp;f=p1w35" class="external autonumber" title="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=76001404&amp;t=1162135553&amp;f=p1w35" rel="nofollow">[138]</a> , <a href="http://ss.webring.com/navbar?f=j;y=Ebionite;u=10127920" class="external autonumber" title="http://ss.webring.com/navbar?f=j;y=Ebionite;u=10127920" rel="nofollow">[139]</a> , <a href="http://visit.geocities.com/visit.gif?&amp;r=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AEbionites&amp;b=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%204.0%20%28compatible%3B%20MSIE%206.0%3B%20Windows%20NT%205.0%3B%20.NET%20CLR%201.1.4322%29&amp;s=1024x768&amp;o=Win32&amp;c=16&amp;j=true&amp;v=1.2" class="external autonumber" title="http://visit.geocities.com/visit.gif?&amp;r=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AEbionites&amp;b=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%204.0%20%28compatible%3B%20MSIE%206.0%3B%20Windows%20NT%205.0%3B%20.NET%20CLR%201.1.4322%29&amp;s=1024x768&amp;o=Win32&amp;c=16&amp;j=true&amp;v=1.2" rel="nofollow">[140]</a> , <a href="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=76001404&amp;t=1162135553&amp;f=p1w35" class="external autonumber" title="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=76001404&amp;t=1162135553&amp;f=p1w35" rel="nofollow">[141]</a> , <a href="http://hostingprod.com/js_source/geov2.js" class="external autonumber" title="http://hostingprod.com/js_source/geov2.js" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> , <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Button_redirect.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Button_redirect.png" rel="nofollow">[143]</a>.

<p>I believe that all of these originate from the same user, <a href="../../../n/a/z/User_talk%7ENazirene_c025.html" title="User talk:Nazirene">Nazirene</a>, who is the owner of numerous websites promoting his own religious group. A stub created by this user to promote the group recently went through two AfDs resulting in deletion and page protection Ebionite Restoration Movement. Recently, this user has been complaining about censorhip on the Ebionites talk page <a href="../../../e/b/i/Talk%7EEbionites_da7a.html#Please_Don.27t_Fix" title="Talk:Ebionites">Talk:Ebionites#Please Don't Fix</a> and in a website linked to the talk page <a href="http://TheThreeLies.com#TrueProphet" class="external autonumber" title="http://TheThreeLies.com#TrueProphet" rel="nofollow">[144]</a> that criticizes the editorial policies of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I was tipped off to the problem by a warning message when I clicked on the talk pages and the edit history. If I'm wrong about all this, I apologize in advance, but it's better to be safe than sorry. <a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 16:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If it helps, I recovered these IPs from my connection log. I think these are all linked to this user: brotherofyeshua.com(66.94.237.68;66.94.237.82;66.94.237.85), thethreelies.com(68.142.212.90), ss.webring.com(69.90.135.88;69.90.135.89), hostingprod.com(66.94.237.82), visit.geocities.com(66.218.77.64), geo.yahoo.com(68.142.232.54). <a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 17:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The same funny-business is apparently going on with my user page <a href="../../../o/v/a/User_talk%7EOvadyah_49d0.html" title="User talk:Ovadyah">User_talk:Ovadyah</a>. I tried several other user pages, but I only see a warning on mine. <a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 21:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia pages cannot contain <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_bug.html" title="Web bug">web bugs</a> or trojans. Whatever it is that's happening to you, it's nothing to do with the contents of those pages. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 21:44, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even so, it's odd that only certain pages are affected. I'll take your word for it, but I'll keep monitoring and testing. <a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 02:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is possible to put a link on page for the purposes of getting peoples IPs, but that is about all. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 16:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is what I suspected; that the purpose was to troll for the IPs of users working on the article. It should be noted that soon after this user appeared on Wikipedia to engage in a dispute over the article, a Downloader Trojan was placed on the web host of a rival group. It could just be a coincidence, but the timing coincided precisely with a talk page dispute between this user and the other group's leader. <a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 14:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is far more likely that these problems are not directly related to wikipeida. If this site had been compromised then many people would ave noticed by now, especially after having it pointed out. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:40, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
