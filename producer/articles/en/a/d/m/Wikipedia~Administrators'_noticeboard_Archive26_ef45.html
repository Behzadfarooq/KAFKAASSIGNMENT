<p>Album covers fall under fair use, if they are reasonably low resolution. User:Arniep tagged a 750x750 version of Image:MeettheBeatlesreissuecover.jpg, removing links to it, and instead diverting links to <a href="../../../m/e/e/Image%7EMeet_the_Beatles.jpg_c427.html" title="Image:Meet the Beatles.jpg">Image:Meet the Beatles.jpg</a>. Now, I do not believe that a 750x750 scan of an old album cover is unreasonable. On the front page, we have a 430x421 image of a CD cover, now, this album is a vinyl so is obviously larger, but 750x750 is no way too high res. Another user even reuploaded a lower res version of the cover, removing the delete and hangon tags, only for them to be replaced again.</p>
<p>I'm asking for admins to look at this. I believe that <a href="../../../m/e/e/Image%7EMeet_the_Beatles.jpg_c427.html" title="Image:Meet the Beatles.jpg">Image:Meet the Beatles.jpg</a> should be deleted, and the links to that file reverted to the original at Image:MeettheBeatlesreissuecover.jpg. The argument of orphaned fairuse is irrelevent in this case. I believe that claiming a 750x750 scan as overly high res is copyright paranoia, I also believe that even the new lower resolution of that image as it is now, is still better than the poor quality scan of Meet the Beatles.jpg. The thing has been on contested CSD for hours now, so could some admin please just come in and sort it out. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I first noticed this when he uploaded a bunch of images of Mexican Presidents and claimed them to be under the GFDL without any evidence, sometimes not even stating where he got the images from. I left a few notes in his talk page trying to explain him why he could not do that and asked him to change the tags to fair use. He apparently ignored me (he edited other articles after my message) so I decided to change the tags to {{PUI}} after a week. Recently, however, he's been tagging newer images with {{CopyrightedFreeUse}} with no evidence to support this claim. This time, at least, he's providing links to the source website.</p>

<dd>My head is perfectly cool, thank you. I do however welcome broader input. Having once undeleted, i will not undelete this again any time soon, so no wheel war will result from my actions. I would argue that deletinmg things out-of-process does tend to spark conflict and not infrequently wheel wars, but then so does undeleting out-of-process deletions, as I did. Of course, i instantly reported my own action at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> which i think is the proper forum in such a case, and also mentioned it in the <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> discussion on the above tempalte.

<dd>As I explained on Aaron's talk page, it was more of a "neither side has been willing to engage in constructive discussion" kind of equal block. Aaron had done three full reverts and once re-inserted content that someone else had added but that he felt should be in there.

<dd>It's a private machine, nobody else uses it.

<dl>
<dd>I suspect that's what it is. I didn't see any deleted edits in history that would account for it, so it might be some weird bug that occurred: maybe you performed your revert at the exact moment that someone else did some vandalism, or the vandalism you were trying to revert somehow got assigned to your username. Do you use AOL? If so, perhaps you shared a proxy IP with someone? Either way, looks to be some sort of database bug. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 21:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I've had this happen to me before too. I think it's some kind of bug when more than one person tries to revert. It's a bit off if you ask me.

<dd>I would not be overly concerned at his return. However, I would demand that he undertakes not to attempt mediation, whether formal or informal.

<dd>He got banned indefinitely only on the 11th Jan 06. However I can't see any explanation on his talk page or elsewhere. All we have is "malicious sockpuppetry and running a botnet". He got banned earlier for repeated attacks on Node over the Romanian/Moldovan dispute. He clearly has a history of edit warring but this is a controversial and heated issue. The fact that he's made useful contributions isn't in doubt. I'd like to know what the details of the "botnet" were before we unblock. This probably wants to go formal - we may want to stop him editing articles on Moldova for example. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 16:55, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will speak up for Bonaparte here; I think he is not malicious, he is just very passionate about his subject. The closer he gets to Moldavian nationalism, the more worked up he gets. I would offer to act as mentor but I know next to nothing about his chosen subject areas and don't speak Romanian, so that would be hard since many exchanges are in Romanian. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid"> Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bonaparte was trolling as hell all this time on Moldovan wiki and continues to this day. It was on account of his sock puppets that Wikipedia lost one of its most precious contributors, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a>. It is worth pointing out that running a sock puppet farm is just a fraction of Bonaparte's offenses. He will be more careful when vote rigging in the future and will post from different computers, so you won't catch him again. If the troll sneaks back, more valuable contributors will leave. People who have commented on the issue so far seems to have had very little experience with this archtroll. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> | <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">talk</a> 18:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>From reading over the information here, I'd want a lot more evidence of reform and a lot more time with no disruption. What this sounds like is a disruptive user who when sanctioned is loudly promising to be good next time. That's not very convincing and we should be careful unbanning and wasting everyone's time. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:55, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree with all the above. I am just saying that I think the whole stupid escalation was not malice, much of the blocking was done by Mikka and even Mikka's friends have said that he did not exactly improve things, which is a shame because Mikka is a good guy and this made him look bad. I don't think Bonaparte is a saint, but I do think that he has trouble with <a href="../../../t/i/g/WP%7ETIGERS_f7f0.html" title="WP:TIGERS">strong opinions</a>, and I think he has at least some justification for feeling aggrieved since nine of the blocks were by an admin with whom he was engaged in a content dispute; my problem is that I don't honestly believe in his ability to stay calm if provoked, and some people deliverately provoke him because they know this. I do not know if he was placed on probation before and violated it, I <i>do</i> know that the reason he wants to come back is not just to fight the same battles, it is that he is actually interested in contributing to the encyclopaedia. Which is not to say that, if unblocked, he won't get straight back into a fight.

<p>As a Romanian-speaking Wikipedian who knew Bonaparte rather well, both on Wikipedia and through email contacts, I must say that I would be very very doubtful of his desire to reform. Bonaparte holds very ultranationalistic beliefs, and has been known to use any means to advance them. That being personal attacks, either logged in or anonymously, the abovementioned botnet, revert wars, trolling, etc. I don't believe he does it maliciously, that's who he is, and these things don't change easily if at all.</p>
<p>I believe he will be a lot of trouble again if he comes back. I would like to see a written statement on his talk page promising to not do revert wars, no personal attacks, no multiple accounts, and be constructive on talk pages before even considering that. And I would support an indefinite block the first time he violates any of these. Bonaparte is one of those users who are a drain of energy and puts strain on others editors. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 19:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the blocking administrator I have been asked to comment so I will briefly comment here. I blocked Bonaparte for being blatantly disruptive, being repeatedly rude towards other editors, edit warring relentlessly, using a number of sockpuppets to violate policy (especially <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>), also for running a malicious bot net which is grounds for an immediate ban. I am opposed to any unblocking of him until a clear and concise case can be made that he will not continue his previous behavior even if that means him staying away from certain categories of articles and certain users. If he were allowed to continue now I feel that he would continue to edit war on articles, be incivil and this would just give him a chance to do a better job in the future of hiding his edit warring and bot nets. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 21:05, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey folks. I'm not sure if I should be divulging this, but I was corresponding with Bonaparte via email on &amp; off during the past two months or so, and in one of his last emails some days <i>before</i> he was blocked he indicated that he desired to leave Wikipedia because, according to him:1) he had more pressing matters to attend to 2) he had already accomplished a lot of what he aimed to achieve 3) he never intended to be a contributor over the long haul. I will email him again &amp; inquire about this some more. Besides the emails he sent me, which indicated clearly that he planned on leaving the English Wiki, does anyone have a shred of evidence that Bonaparte <i>wants</i> to return/be unblocked?

<p>I am sure that Bonaparte is quite capable of good edits. He can be very rational and polite when he wants to be, and I wouldn't be opposed to his return, but if he comes back, we'd have to ensure that "he wants to be" <i>all the time</i>. He has a history of trolling and harrassment, and has been warned more times than many of us can count without taking our shoes and socks off. As someone else mentioned above, if he went up before ArbCom tomorrow it'd be a dead cert ban even without Jtkiefer's evidence. If Bonaparte returns, I don't think the rules can apply to him anymore. He <i>knows</i> what he's doing, and following procedure — dispute resolution, warnings, etc. — just gives him extra opportunity for trolling. If he returns, he's on permanent probation. He's wasted the time of too many editors. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 02:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see the problem with an unblock here. If he has repented and will not be disruptive again then he should be allowed to resume editing Wikipedia and I counsel my fellow editors to grant him some space to do so, while not relaxing vigilance against possible recidivism. We only block editors if they are a net detriment to Wikipedia. If Bonaparte will not be such a detriment then he should not be blocked. This goes for any editor who has been blocked or banned in the past. Blocking and banning are preventive, not pre-emptive or punitive. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:29, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly oppose any unblocking of Bonaparte. It's a very bad idea with no real benefit to the community. Bonaparte has a long history of supporting troublesome and abusive editors and created a large number sockpuppets, not just a few, and knowingly used them to rig votes among other things. All while he chose to participate as a <i>mediator</i> in resolving disputes, most of which were very poorly executed and likely done in just as bad faith as his sockpuppetry. His actions are by definition acts of bad faith and significantly abused the community's goodwill. Claims that he "is willing to apologize and never use sockpuppets to troll ever again" raise new questions. What will he use sockpuppets then for, if not trolling? An apology and promise is woefully insufficient for the community to again trust someone who so knowingly and repeatedly betrayed that trust for months already. Unblocking Bonaparte now is a slap in face to every good faith contributor whose vote or contributions were discounted due to Bonaparte's bad faith acts. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:30, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FeloniousMonk, I find your comments to be utterly irrelevant to this discussion. They were also incorrect - as shown by you having to correct them. I also initiated a request for comments specifically about this issue, as you well know as I told you on your talk page. You did not comment on this RFC. Since you did not participate, I believe that your comments here about me are bordering on disruption. I believe you are attacking the person presenting a suggestion, rather than constructively criticising the suggestion itself. I would like you to apologise and withdraw your comments. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 04:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As one who was once actually nominated for Adminship by Bonaparte once, I can say that for a while, my impression of him was that as a user, he could be both constructive, active and kind, as long as he wasn't provoked (or dealt with provocative subjects). He also seemed to have good relations with many Wiki contributors (and not just Romanians). When provoked he would indeed react in an objectionable way, but as time went by, he seemed to learn that there was some subjects he should avoid in order to not damage the Romanian cause unwillingly (Anittas for one gave him some advice of this kind).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the sockpuppetry activity on multiple RfAs was far more disturbing, and gives me second thought about speaking in favor of having him unblocked. If he could be placed under some sort of probation in which he would be closely watched, and banned for any kind of offense, An unblock might work in a positive wat, but I don't know if he himself would accept such a deal. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnclation_5bb1.html" title="User:Anclation">Anclation</a> 18:39, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>His sockpuppetry alone does not mandate an indefinite block. I actually feel that his persistent edit warring, personal attacks, and hamhanded attempts at mediation have been far more damaging to the community. While it is undeniable that he has made significant contributions to Wikipedia, it is questionable in my mind whether his readmittance to Wikipedia will do more good than harm. If he agrees to stop pursing the "Romanian cause" while on Wikipedia, an unblock contingent on supervised probation would seem reasonable. Absent such an agreement, I feel no strong desire to unblock him. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 19:13, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just like unblocking <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARMOT_55be.html" title="User:MARMOT">User:MARMOT</a> this will only server to exert stress on good contributors. I have no idea how many people MARMOT harassed (aka vandalising wikipedia by using their ips) and scared away. MARMOT was able to evade blocks as if they never happened since he could tell wikipedia servers which IP he wanted to pose as.

People will be less hesitant to use sockpuppets and vandal bots if they face serious consequences. Sweet talk of "ex"-malicious users dont warrant my or yout attention. I oppose the unblocking of any user blocked indefinately unless it was an automated block. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 19:22, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bonaparte has been notorious for his returning to various sorts of malicious activities every time after his promise to be good next time. He got the idea that this tactics work and he needs finally to be taught a lesson. I see no better lesson than a block for several months, at least, so that he knows that his behavior brings some real consequences rather than the counter having been reset every time he promises to be good next time. The main goal of the punishment in any society is to serve a deterrent from the potential malaise. There is no reason to believe that Bonaparte will reform only because he promised to. Only after he feels the consequences (that is forced to wait a <i>long</i> time) he may loose the desire to resume his trolling. After his unblock, he needs to me vigorously watched and still I think that unblocking him is a bad idea although I see, in view of the prevailing sentiment here, that sooner a later he will be unblocked. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:30, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, as Bonaprte's advocate here, I have quietly watched the discussion and was impressed with the dialogue. I understand the hesistancy, but formally move that he be unblocked, be carefully watched by multiple users and that a zero tolernace policy be adopted, whereby his indefinite block will be replaced if he reverts to his old behavior. Thank you again for your time and thoughts on this matter.Gator (talk) 14:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I will repeat what I wrote above, and specifically note I am against unblocking at this time. It's not that hard to edit constructively and follow the rules and anyone that has repeatedly shown they are unable to do that and is willing to disrupt wikipedia is a net loss to the project even if they make some good contributions. I don't see the value in wasting so much time having several users babysit a known problem. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:20, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just like Mikkalai, I never received apologies for having been blocked when I tried to fend off Bonny's socks from vandalizing an article, although that block violated both <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> and <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.

<p>Unblocking this person is absolutely out of question. there was quite a profound amount of his disruption of wikipedia. If he wants to start afresh, he very well register a new account.

<p>Eliezer warned me to explain my alert. He blocked me without reading my explanation on the talk page and never gave me the chance to elaborate the reason for my alert. His excuse for warning me contradicts the realities on the article and talk pages (please compare). Furthermore, Eliezer &amp; OpenInfo both keep deleting my and others' edits to the article that would make it conform to Wiki's npov policy. How am I supposed to resolve this problem when these two men neither allow anyone to edit the article in a good faith effort to remove their anti-Messianic biases nor allow several of us editors to express our concerns via alerts? Eliezer deliberately set me up for failure. He reverts the article and talk pages to appear the way OpenInfo wants and then warns "both" of us - i.e. me. I complied to his warning only to be blocked. Meanwhile, OpenInfo hardly gave me the chance to tag the article and put my explanation on the talk page without constantly disturbing my edits and tags (Look at the timeline to see how fast he was working). I warned him to stop per Wiki's vandalism procedure and he deleted my warnings. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't deleting my warnings considered vandalism?

<dd>Yes, this sort of delete-undelete has to be done at the moment. There should be little or no problem with the GFDL, and in any case much less than for a libel suit. There is a wiki-rumour that an easier method of selectively deleting edits from the history is being developed, but it hasn't arrived yet. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 12:35, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As long as no content from the deleted revison is left there shouldn't be any GFDL issue, if there is a simple reversion following the bad content best to delete that too to avoid a confusing page history.</dd>

<p>If an administrator must selectively delete revisions from an article with a ton of edits (1000+), and no developer is at hand, a faster way than checking all the thousands of boxes is to do a "history unmerge" like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete all revisions</li>
<li>Selectively undelete the <i>libellous</i> revisions.</li>
<li>Move the libellous revisions to an arbitrary title.</li>
<li>Delete the libellous revisions.</li>
<li>Undelete the article.</li>

Now you probably don't have a clue what Runescape is, but I feel your superior knowledge of Wikipedia is needed to help diffuse this situation.</p>
<p>Basically, the problem is that there are way too many links. Before now, there were about 30 links, and they all got cleaned out, but now about 20 have come back and I had a suggestion. My idea was to only have the top-5 websites which are universally agreed as the best and most-used websites. However, There is one person who is objecting to me, who thinks the idea is wrong. This person i feel may be bias, as he has his own runescape site. A few people are agreeing with me, but he stills feels he is right, and feels he's correct.

<li>Both instances are pretty lame.

While I hardly agree with those comments, I do believe we it is very inappropriate to remove anyone's comments from any talk page (given that <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> is already controversial). Also, it's inappropriate to state that since something is in the past, it may no longer be discussed. I've undone both protections and restored the comments people made. People, this is getting out of hand. Kelly's new function allows her to read and summarize comments on arbitration pages, and make remarks to the ArbCom. Well, guess what? So can you.

<dd>(edit conflict) The page Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin/Protected was created by <a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">User:Dschor</a> in a clear attempt to 'game the system'. The original RfC was closed and archived by clear consensus. Material was then added to that RfC regarding Arbcom's decision to creat a clerk's office. The material was removed as irrelevant (comments on Arbcom go to Arbcom - not on a continual gripe sheet on one individual user - or are we saying once an RfC is filed it is an eternal place for personal grips and silly vendettas?). Dschor and others edit warred, until the page was protected by someone. He then cut and paste this, in violation of GFDL. There is a long history of his trolling and and incivility, for which he has already been warned by JamesF and others. I have blocked him for 6 hours for disruption. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 13:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is why I protected them, I don't think there should be a receptacle for people to bitch about someone ad infinitum which is exactly what these pages are turning into. The RfC was archived by clear consensus it's over, time to move on, Kelly withdrew from the election long before the election which is now itself over was over, it's over, time to move on. No one is saying they can't discuss this, they shouldn't be discussing it there. Finally, Radiant, as I mentioned on your talk page, you should at least do the courtesy of attempting to contact me before changing admin decisions I've made.

<li>There is really no such thing as "archiving an RFC", as I pointed out on that RFC talk page. There are RFCs on which discussion has died out, but one cannot state "hey, we must now stop discussing this". Yes, people should move on. No, removing their comments will not magically cause them to move on or drop the issue (in fact, more like the opposite). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:49, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>My two cents: Please do not protect the pages in question, and please allow these people to say whatever they want to say on them without interference. Obviously some people feel that they have something important that they have to say, so letting them say it is probably the best thing. Taking away their forums will just cause them to look for increasingly inappropriate places to say them, and reinforce their sense of disenfrachisement, to boot. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 13:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps, but I've always felt that open-ended RfCs are unfair tot he subject. If RfCs are going to do any good, they will do it in the first week so. After that, they are just an open sore. Kelly, I realise you can cope with this, but a less thick-skinned editor could find this intollerable and leave. For the sake of the subject of the RfC, there should come a point where we say 'move on' - and hush those who will not. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 14:01, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do agree we need a better RFC procedure (<i>suggestions please?</i>). However, at a certain point when the discussion becomes redundant, most people stop watching an RFC page, and so (in most cases) does its subject. At that point, any remarks by long-term gripers will only be read by other long-term gripers. While that's not particularly helpful, there's hardly a point in forbidding it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:13, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There may a point. Not everyone will be able to handle the thought of people posting negative stuff about them on the open internet for all to see, and it going unanswered (particularly if they edit in their own name). I'd suggest that RfCs ought to be closed as a matter of form after 3 weeks or so. If the conduct problem is ongoing, then another can be filed. If not, then the thing will be well stale by then. I think the problem here is not that Kelly's RfC was closed - it is that an exception was made in closing it. If we had an agreed policy of closing after x weeks, then no-one would be arguing. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 14:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It makes sense to protect them as soon as they are no longer linked to the main page or "archived" although that doesn't mean much. A reasonable approach to when to remove would be that if <i>either</i> if no comments have been made for three weeks <i>or</i> there is consensus to close. As Doc has said, there wouldn't be a problem if we did that consistantly.</dd>
<dd>However, as I never unwatch any RfC I have participated in, I see that comments do trickle in. Not just from hard-core disenfranchised, it's often "normal" but infrequent editors. When the page is protected that should be given a link to some sort of forum. Any suggestions as to where?</dd>

<p>I don't see the point of protecting talk pages like this. As long as nobody is mucking about with the vote, and nobody is engaging in personal attacks, then there's no problem. It is possible to reaise legitimate concerns without doing so. If people are attacking the candidates or making accusations of dishonest behavior then they should be bloody well blocked for a long time, of course, but that doesn't require page protection. A bat about the nose should be enough to bring the miscreants to their senses, I should think. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:00, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was an exceptionally dirty arbitration campaign. There are those who care not for Wikipedia one bit, would love to use the campaign as a lever to divide Wikipedia.

<p>Should this even really be thought of as an RfC? I mean, I know that technically it is, but it actually was a vote, not an attempt at conflict resolution, and the voting is long since over. As such, I don't think you should have any qualms about protecting the page. Anyone who has continuing beefs with Kelly is free to use her talk page or file an honest RfC or RfA, but there is <i>nothing</i> that can be added to this particular page that will further any constructive debate on any subject whatsoever. ---<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:48, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I havn't been following the issue on the vote page, but I have been part of the issue on the RFC. First off, the RFC was closed by its participants and wide community consensus, overidding any proccess already in place. Why? Because they felt that anything further was beating a dead horse, and disrupting the wikipedia. (This is an important, I'll be coming back to it). Later, after the clerk's office was opened, some people decided to use the RFC as a vehical to complain about Kelly Martin and the Arbitration Commitee. This clearly served NO constructive purpose, was and is disruptive, and is irrellivant to the matter at hand. (The RfC was on her conduct in relation to userboxes). It was then later moved after several editors, myself (I got blocked for 3RR on this for the record), Doc and Dalbury consistantly removed the comments because of their irrellivance and disruptive nature. I protected and quickly <b>unprotected</b> the article. Then Dschor <i>moved</i> the talk page, causing utter choas which I tried to fix (creating a bit of a mess along the way).</p>
<p>I have no qualms with people messaging KM on her talk page, filing a new (albiet silly) RfC, or doing any number of other things. But no, people don't have a right to say what they want, where they want, when the want. We have rules, policies, guidelines, all of which are there to protect the project. This was, is, and will continue to be a disruptive action until it is stopped. Protection seemed to be the easiest action at hand. Barring that, I'll go with Tony's suggestion.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't been following this closely enough to have picked up on the fact that the arbcom election page was just one venue in a larger attack. And it does sound to me like you're describing a personalized attack. Now I'm not Kelly's mom, either, but I'm not aware of any legitimate issues with her conduct on Wikipedia. This does seem indeed to be a personal attack of unprecedented ferocity upon a Wikipedian in good standing, and shouldn't be tolerated. Like I said, if they keep it up, block them good and hard. We don't want Wikipedia to host that kind of trash, because it's en encyclopedia. If they want a hate group, let them bugger off to Wikipedia Review where they'll find a welcome audience. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>If you followed it around you would see this is a broad case of a couple of people deciding to wage their little war on various pages - the Clerk page (which is where their criticisms belong), Kelly's RfC talk page and Kelly's Arbcom vote talk page. What is taking place is a multi-prongd attack, similar to the "Stalin" userbox that is seeking to rattle sabrres and get people agitated. At it's core it is to cause disruption. Trying to get people to move on is exactly what I was trying to do by protecting that page so that a couple of the prongs, those that had absolutely nothing to do with her RfC or Arbcom candidacy, were shut down. I wasn't trying to curb anyone's right to complain, I was trying to keep it civil and where it belonged. Now, if we're going to throw <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> out the window and just let people make their attacks or allegations on whatever page they see fit then, by all means, let's get on with it because that is exactly what doing nothing and allowing them to post anywhere they want is doing. I'm going to take Tony's recommendation although I would have preferred the softer approach which was protecting the page and directing people to the proper avenues for their complaints.</p>
<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with Kelly or what she wants, this has to do with precedent on how we handle stuff like this. Do we do nothing and allow RfCs and elections to go on ad infinitum and allow people to cast large attack campaigns across various pages? I believe this would drive many decent people out of the project should they ever have the misfortune of being the subject of an RfC or running for election. Or do we keep them contained to where they belong thus allowing people their dissent, just not wherever they want it and with a modicum of decorum? --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 00:50, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well we all know what an RfC would look like--that would be pouring gasoline on the flames. Maybe it's time for an arbitration case on the miscreants in this case, though honestly I think I'd rather treat it as petty disruption. There are legitimate concerns about the arbitration committee elections and subsequent events and these <i>must</i> be talked out, but people who say stuff like "It's a crock of shit and it stinks", "shithouse", "underhand procedure" and the like aren't really voicing reasonable concern, they're rabble-rousing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:20, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since this editor admits on the template talk page that he would have "reverted my changes in seconds", I guess protection succeeded in preventing edit warring.

As a related issue, I have chosen to disengage from this dispute, but the editor so far refuses to leave me alone about it. This is my last word on the subject, and if another admin wants to revert me I won't interfere.

<p>Refrain from abusing my power? I made a constructive edit to a permanently protected template.

Ec5618 didn't like that edit, and got another admin to revert. I disengaged from the issue. Where's the abuse? As for asking him not to contact me, that was taken far out of context. First off, he said, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Sprotected&amp;diff=37027248&amp;oldid=37026942" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Sprotected&amp;diff=37027248&amp;oldid=37026942" rel="nofollow">"Had I been able, I would have reverted in seconds"</a>.

After that, I read his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;diff=37026993&amp;oldid=37015204" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Philwelch&amp;diff=37026993&amp;oldid=37015204" rel="nofollow">comment on my talk page</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry, but there was no dispute when you left. All that had happened at that point was that
<ol>
<li>you had edited a protected template without discussion, and without even refering to ongoing discussion on the Talk page. Arguably not the wisest thing to do.</li>
<li>you had received feedback from several editors, suggesting they preferred the template be reverted.</li>
<li>I suggested I would have reverted your edit. Understand that all I saw was an overzealous editor, making changes I knew were unpopular, to a protected template.</li>
<li>you refused to yield to community opinion, and left your version standing as you left.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>That's not a dispute, and that's not something you should walk away from before undoing what you'd done. It seems you despise simple reversion as much as I despise unilateral,unpopular and undiscussed edits, and in that context your actions were perhaps in good faith, if unpopular.

<dd>ps. As for "where's the abuse": You should not have edited the template without discussion in the first place. But you really shouldn't have refused to change the template back when several editors disagreed with your edit. You made use of (abused) your powers as an admin to make changes, while another admin had to clean up after you, when you refused to. You forced me to ask for help in reverting the template, since you had refused to revert to its consensus agreed upon form.</dd>

<p>I was unaware we had to ask permission before making edits on Wikipedia. I was also unaware that admins had an obligation to revert war against themselves on permanently protected pages just because regular editors were unable to. Clearly, Wikipedia policies have changed dramatically in the past 48 hours and I should re-read them. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 03:01, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding of how things work is impressive. An alternative view is that, if you get reverted (possibly repeatedly) <i>then</i> you should 'ask permission' - you should talk it out. On full-protected pages, admins shouldn't really be making any changes without checking on talk first anyway. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do read <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a>, which reads: "Administrators must be cautious about editing protected pages and do so in accordance with consensus and any specific guidelines on the subject. In all cases, administrators should first raise the issue on the relevant talk page." While I hate to point to policy, it seems policy is on my side.</dd>
<dd>This isn't necessarily about policy though, it's a least as much about decency and responsibility. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 03:20, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Admins don't have the ability to edit protected pages so they can edit them without consensus. Admins have the ability to edit protected pages so the pages get editted when there's consensus (and only then). <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 07:44, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consensus is reached when a page is edited to a version everyone is willing to accept. When temporary protection is applied, say, in the case of a revert war, then discussion before editing is prudent because that's exactly the issue that protection is intending to force. However, *permanent* protection, as applied to the Main Page and certain frequently-used templates (see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Category%7EPermanently_protected_3578.html" title="Category:Permanently protected">Category:Permanently protected</a> is different. Admins make small edits to the main page all the time, and if another admin doesn't like the edit, he changes it until consensus is reached. Essentially, it's the same wiki process, except anyone who's not an admin has to edit by proxy by recruiting an admin.</p>
<p>There was nothing on the talk page that I saw indicating that people were against removing the box, so I decided to be bold and remove it. People complained about it and eventually got an admin to revert me. I don't edit war so I left the issue alone.</p>
<p>Seriously people, there are more important things on Wikipedia to worry about. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 08:03, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reverting oneself once does not constitute an edit war. And, for future reference, I'll quote policy again: "In all cases, administrators should first raise the issue on the relevant talk page." I've clearly shown that policy disagrees with you. How can you still maintain that you had every right tot do what you did? Do you believe it was a nice thing to do?</dd>
<dd>You now claim to have looked at the Talk page, prior to making your edits. Then you'll have noticed that the design of the box was clearly under discussion. Since any editor could have suggested removing that box, the simple fact that no editor <i>had</i> suggested removing the box, or seriously rewriting the template in the way you had, shows your edit wasn't a 'small edit'. As for expecting all other editors to edit via a human proxy, I can only say that you have perhaps forgotten what it's like to be a simple editor.</dd>
<dd>Yes, there are more important things on Wikipedia, but please stop ignoring problems in the hopes that they might magically go away. Please also observe civility and abide by consensus. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 11:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to have a good trawl through his contributions. I'll explain why. This user has been extremely abusive towards muslims and now he's spreading the net wider and having a go at atheists. Maybe it'll be zoroastrians or rastas next week. On it's own, this kind of abuse to <i>anybody</i> would get him a lifetime ban from any decent web forum, and I think we're sending the wrong message if we say "oh but he did a good edit to the fluffy little bunny wabbits article six weeks ago so we should keep him. We all know it couldn't work like that because we'd have people coming along and doing just that so they get to vomit twelve hours worth of unspeakable bile out on Wikipedia once a month or so when their latest ban ends. And that's what seems to be happening here. If I find a single edit that isn't immediate revert-fodder in the past month, I'll list it here. Then I suggest that we discuss whether we want to retain this gentleman's services any longer. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the past month he has done good edits to, and largely been responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_medicine.html" title="Byzantine medicine">Byzantine medicine</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_Compendium_in_Seven_Books_1988.html" title="Medical Compendium in Seven Books">Medical Compendium in Seven Books</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is quite good work.</p>
<p>On the other hand he has gone out of his way to display extreme racism and religious bigotry. His list of article edits is extremely sparse and punctuated by vandalism of the most chauvinistic kind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali_Sina&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32734138" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali_Sina&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32734138" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Takbir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36165382" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Takbir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36165382" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<p>So, in view of my further research I've decided that it may be more appropriate to ban this fellow.</p>
<p>Points against a permanent ban:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some good edits about mediterranean culture and history</li>

<p>Points for a permanent ban:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent expressions racism and religious bigotry delivered in a manner clearly calculated to offend</li>
<li>Vandalism</li>
<li>Blanking an AfD</li>
<li>Does not respond to blocks by modifying his behavior. Just picks up where he left off. No sign of improvement.</li>
<li>When blocked for bigoted attacks, continued to use his talk page for such bigoted statements until this was protected.</li>

<p>I've thought of banning from certain articles, but then what about his stuff on user talk pages? The reason I'm not giving links, by the way, is that you just have to look at the guy's edit history.

<dd>I'd like to say I have come across this user before on www.cyprus-forum.com where he posted the same combination of anti-Islamic/anti-Turkish/Greek nationalism which earned him a ban (and this forum is run by Greek Cypriots). His edits were instantly recognisable to me and he acknowledged on his discussion page that he was that same person. I am shocked that some people are willing to dismiss edits such as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31219749" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31219749" rel="nofollow">Why I enjoy murdering Turks</a>" on the basis of his small number of innofensive edits.

<p>He does seem to have some kind of problem - no one can be so anti-social. Maybe he has the wrong idea about Wikipedia. I'd support giving him another chance and a last warning before a ban though.

He has made some useful contributions, that should be taken into account. <a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 19:55, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I support an indefinite ban. If in a few years he wants to make the case that he has reformed we can consider it. In the mean time, I see no reason for the rest of us to have to put up with this kind of stuff. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:39, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>An indefinite ban is probably not good. I'm going to go with something that may give him a chance to rethink his attitude. This is going to be a long (six months) block and a promise:</p>

<p>I'm certainly against this block. As the user points out, there is nothing in the BP about inactive accounts. While the 1st amendment doesn't apply to Wikipedia, blocking someone for "challenging the establishment" (dissent), reeks of censorship.

<dd>This can certainly meet the disruption point in the blocking policy, so saying it's not allowed by the blocking policy is incorrect. If he continues to disrupt he should be blocked again. He's been politely asked to stop disrupting and has chosen not too. And why is this so hard to understand that undoing admin actions in the first place is the problem and what starts wheel wars? The block was being discussed, so enter into the discussion instead of undoing the admin's action. Such a simple and obvious way to avoid wheel wars.

<dd>It's a nationalist thing. Some Croatians think that Croatian is a separate language from Serbo-Croatian, while some Serbs think that Serbo-Croatian and Serbian are identical (I said "most" on the talkpage, but I haven't asked them all ;-)). Outsiders tend to consider them the same language but each view is a POV. The war is over whether to describe the people in Serbian and Croatian or in Serbo-Croatian only. I suggested putting all three, which would surely resolve the conflict. No one would be happy but at least each would be equally unhappy.

<p>I've heard it said some times that creating an image gallery (i.e. a page containing a lot of images on a certain subject, and little else) is a violation of our "fair use" policy.

<p>Oh just delete separate pages in userspace with fair use images. It's just a way of keeping the wiki free from unlicensed images and one step ahead.of the copyright lawyers. If the user has his gallery mixed in with other text on his userpage, explain the legal position and ask him to comply with the copyright policy or go find a webhost that will let him play around with other people's material like this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:36, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We've been discussing the merits and suggesting changes to AFD for at least half a year now. So it's about time we stop talking and actually do something. The simplest variant to AFD would be to list all proposed deletions, and delete all that nobody objects to within several days. Since about 80% of AFD are obvious keeps or obvious deletes, we can accomplish the same with far less bureaucracy and negativity. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> does just that, and is intended to go for a test run very soon. Please join the discussion there. Note that this should solve the issues regarding deletion recently raised by Jimbo on the mailing list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:18, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really like this. With the current system, I can skim the day's AfD page, and if it seems like there is a strong consensus, I don't have to vote at all. With your proposed system, someone checking AfD would need to read every proposed article before knowing whether the article should be deleted. (I hope that wasn't confused... what I mean is I trust the AfD voters, and they save me time. With this, there are no votes to "trust"). -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregAsche_4f25.html" title="User:GregAsche">Greg Asche</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGregAsche_1ed6.html" title="User talk:GregAsche">(talk)</a> 00:03, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>So basically you're saying that people on AFD vote, and that they do so without actually reading the article, and that this is actually a good thing? By this proposal, you're not supposed to look for issues to vote on - you're supposed to find articles with a problem, and fix that. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 01:44, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think he is sayign that when he sees a dispute, he reads the article and votes, but when he sees a clear consensus forming, he trusts the other voters, does not read the article and does not vote. But simce with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> there would be nothing but the nom, someone who wants to avoid improper deletions must check every case, or assume that someone else that s/he trusts has done or will do so.

<li>True. The real question is the risk of no one looking at a tagged article, and it thus beign deleted when it would have been disputed had anyone looked. but if it is that obvious, no admin should delete it. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think the intended form for PROD is that the only people who need to look at proposed articles are 1) people watching or coming across a page(or category) with a tag in it (who, in nearly every case would remove the tag, unless they are watching it to prevent the page from being created); 2) people deciding if the page should be kept or deleted (i.e. people with the delete button, i.e. admins); it is intended that people don't just go through the list of tagged pages to verify that the nominator was right, unless they are going to act on their judgement. Of course, such review is acceptable, but the idea is that it is not necessary; so not being able to view the consensus is not a fault. AfD will still exist, it will be used for any nomination with at least one keep vote, in effect. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 07:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've spent time recently trying to make sure we don't keep articles semi-protected longer than is reasonably necessary. I've noticed that a good number of admins seem to semi a page and then never return to unprotect it. Please make sure you do. Imo, if we're protecting against simple vandalism (the only use of semi) then the teenager will have got bored within a few hours most times, so there's really no need for these 7 days of protection that we're getting out of forgetfulness. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This was actually discussed in an early draft of <a href="../../../s/e/m/WP%7ESEMI_521e.html" title="WP:SEMI">WP:SEMI</a> and didn't make it into the eventual version because of the desire to ask for as little possible from the devs and to have as few things for people to disagree with as possible. Additionally, a hard-expiry has the problem that it will be either too short or too long in most cases, and an admin shortening a variable-length protect is likely to run into the kind of shtuff we get on AN/I about shortening blocks (I think I irritate people enough by just unprotecting!).

<p>Regarding Mark1's statement above, <i>I'd much rather we were more careful to list on Protected pages, where we can all review them</i>, I'd like to say something that I've said before, and which I suspect will be as unpopular this time as the first time I said it. Listing things on Protected pages is make-work. It's is forcing people to do something manually which can be better done automatically. The templates already put things in categories, and the category mechanism already maintains the lists without need for human intervention. Any process which involves people doing some manual step which could be automated is silly. It's especially so when the automated process already exists, and the manual process just duplicates the automated one. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 15:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion">user:Nightstallion</a> suggested I ask this question here. A while ago, I moved the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate.html" title="Rebate">Rebate</a> article to <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate_%28marketing%29.html" title="Rebate (marketing)">Rebate (marketing)</a> and created a disambiguation page at Rebate. The word rebate has two main definitions, one being as described in the article currently at <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate.html" title="Rebate">Rebate</a> and the other as described at <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbet.html" title="Rabbet">Rabbet</a>. Over the weekend, this was all reversed because an anonymous user asserted that there was only one definition of Rebate. I have quoted the Macquarie dictionary definition on the Rebate talk page as an alternate definition and I'd like to have it all put back the way it was. What is the best way to approach this? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentC_c6bd.html" title="User:SilentC">SilentC</a> 21:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The main point seems to be that of the two uses of the term, neither is distinctly more relevant than the other. Your point thus becomes that a disambiguation page would give neither meaning preference, and thus would be preferable.</dd>
<dd>In this case, I'm inclined to prefer the current solution, in which a simple disambiguation notice on <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate.html" title="Rebate">Rebate</a> to refer users to <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbet.html" title="Rabbet">Rabbet</a>. If only because a disambiguation page for just two items seems silly. Obviously, it is still perfectly possible for you to link to <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbet.html" title="Rabbet">Rebate</a> using a piped link.</dd>
<dd>If you can show that a majority of the world's English speakers don't use the term rebate to refer to a promotional tool, but rather to refer to the woodworking term, the articles should be switched. If Australians use the term rebate to refer to promotional tools as well, I'd say the current status quo isn't bad. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 01:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The funny thing about the status quo is that it never stays the same! I didn't think there was anything wrong with the way it was prior to the move either, but there you go. Regarding disambiguation pages, how many items would you consider enough to make it less silly? As I explained on the talk page, my take on it is that if a term with identical spelling can mean more than one thing, I'd prefer to see a list from which I can select, rather than being taken to the one that someone else thought was more likely or important. Perhaps I have the wrong idea.</dd>
<dd>I don't see how I can show that a majority of the world's English speakers use the term one way or another. It's in the Macquarie dictionary, which is the standard reference for Australian usage. The fact is, there was no need to change it - it was changed because someone assumed that my alternate definition was invalid (he said that the marketing version was 'the ONLY definition' of rebate) and the change went ahead without my being aware of the vote because it took place on the marketing page, which I was not watching, not the disambig page. Perhaps I could have swayed people before it went ahead if I had known. It actually took quite a bit of work to set up the disambig page in the first place.</dd>
<dd>Shall we see how the votes pan out? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentC_c6bd.html" title="User:SilentC">SilentC</a> 01:21, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree.html" title="Tree">tree</a> for an example. It discusses the wooden forrest dwellers directly but refers to a disambiguation page for other meanings. Such is common on Wikipedia, since when most people say 'tree', they mean 'large, perennial, woody plant'.</dd>
<dd>Let's not continue this discussion here, though. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 01:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dd>It's not just two uses of the term, it's the fact that one of those terms has two, equally valid spellings. The dab link at the top of the current <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate.html" title="Rebate">rebate</a> page links to one variant (rabbet), the current debate is as much about equal time for the other variant (rebate), as it is about a disambiguation.</dd>
<dd>While there may be only two terms to disambig at the moment this could well change in the future. I believe a reader may be more inclined to edit a {disambig} page than to <i>disrupt</i> a fully fledged article, so there may be more entries added later.</dd>
<dd>A case in point being the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lathe.html" title="Lathe">lathe</a> article. Ignoring its current status (it's had at least one extra prod since), this article was moved by an editor to create a disambig page for the term <b>lathe</b>. At the time I felt it was unnecessary however the dab page eventually accumulated a few other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lathe&amp;oldid=33520607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lathe&amp;oldid=33520607" rel="nofollow">meanings</a> that I'd (obviously) never heard of, the end result being an overall improvement to wikipedia. It could be reasonably argued that a simple {otheruses} or {disambig} at the top of the original <b>lathe</b> page would have the same result, after all <i>lathe tool</i> is the <i>one true meaning of lathe</i> (if you'd have asked me a couple of months ago :-) but I'm happier with this approach - it's less territorial and allows others their view to be unobstructed by my (and others) presumptions. I believe you should catch and present the reader with alternatives earler in the browsing process. — <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraibeard_f9d8.html" title="User:Graibeard">Graibeard</a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraibeard_aa68.html" title="User talk:Graibeard"> (talk)</a></sup> 02:22, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's unfortunate that it's come to this, but these blocks are probably sufficient to cool tempers down. FSF looks to be leaving, likely in response to the voted-for desysopping. We'll see what happens, but in any case, the RfAr still needs to be carried on to its conclusion, IMO. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, do you think it would help to tell FSF that Jtkiefer is also blocked for the same period of time?

<li>Don't worry too much about it. The "indefinite" block will only last until 15:27, when MarkGallagher's block expires.

<p>An unregistered user whose IP belongs to Qwest keeps making a series of changes to the article on a candidate for Congress in Ohio that are the sort of things one would say on a campaign site. I keep reverting and have posted a notice on talk pages of the article and of the IP addresses, but it appears every new session gets a new number. Has anyone else been seeing this sort of thing? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 16:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are individuals who are adding points that are past POVs. They are simply and untrue and based on political agendas and motives at the expense of the truth. People come on Wikipedia to learn not to be be misguided. Established facts are systematically be represed. Please read the discussions on Kurds, Kurdistan, and Iranians. Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group and it is an established fact in the academic world, through language, ancestry, culture, traditon, and history, but there are individuals who are systematically deleting this information and even attack other articles to cut all ties and assocation between the definition to validate their agendas. They have even gone far enough to claim that Kurds are Jewish just to disassociate Kurds from being an ethnic Iranian <a href="../../../p/e/o/Peoples.html" title="Peoples">peoples</a>. In reality Jews are a religious group and not a race. There are Black Jews, Asian Jews, European Jews, and so on. The Kurds ancestors were <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> peoples who were <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrians.html" title="Zoroastrians">Zoroastrians</a> and have a language that can be mutually understood in portions by other Iranian peoples. Please we need ADMIN. They are even swearing in the history saying (KHarr) in Kurdish just to force their agenda atr the expense of facts. PLease read the discussions in relations to Kurds.

<dd>Seems like typical edit disputes to me...nothing that warrants AN/I. One of the pages have already been protected, and Kurdistan might end up so as well, as the edit summaries there are quite nasty. You need to discuss this on the talk page if several others disagree (or to avoid a revert war). Please add ~~~~ to the end of your comments to sign them.
