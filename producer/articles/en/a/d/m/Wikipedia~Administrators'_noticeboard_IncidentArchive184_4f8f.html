<p>Speaking as a native speaker of UK English, the usage of "color" is correct for WP:EN as the articles should be written in US English. As much as I groan over this, it is set fact, and I would personally not get so upset over someone correcting the used language.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 21:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Our <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> makes it quite clear that articles can be written in either American or British English (or any other dialect, for that matter) provided that the dialect is used consistently throughout the article. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 21:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the topic is closely related to either UK or USA, you can use the relating english variation. However, if an article has been written with one variation, and you change it all to another without a good cause (in example, "This is a British topic and thus British English should be used as most users checking this article are more likely to be from UK" or alike) can be punished, as already stated by a previous arbitration. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 21:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) However, it also makes clear that American dialect should be used for articles on America-oriented topics, British for articles on Britain-oriented topics, and (most relevant) whichever dialect was originally used in the article for topics not directly related to either, such as this one. It appears that "color" was the spelling first used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PlayStation_Portable&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=3976053" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PlayStation_Portable&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=3976053" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so the article should be in American English, if I understand correctly. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Also, another opinion that some will disagree with but most agree with implicitly, is that the majority of readers of English Wikipedia are American, not British or Australian, and thus articles will generally tend to default to American English unless there is a compelling reason otherwise (like, say, it's an article about a cricket team). --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 22:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zoe has either (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> here) acted a bit too hastily, or (not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>) is on some sort of power trip, because while it did have Hillary for President (paraphrasing) the first time, the second time she reverted, it was just a picture with her name underneath. The picture is from commons, so is not a violation of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>. If Zoe doesn't like Mrs. Clinton, that'sa her business. I don't appreciate her making it mine. The first reversion I can understand, the second (and who knows? maybe the third, as I haven't checked it again) I don't. I am puzzled, confused, and more than a little irritated atwhat I see as an abuse of administrative power
<dl>
<dd>Well, according to <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> we're not supposed to campaign on our userpages...but did you ask Jeffpw to remove it before removing it yourself? <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 19:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, no I didn't, and that was a failing on my part. But I did explain immediately afterwards why I felt it should not be there, and got nasty comments made against me when I made none against anyone else. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One photograph hardly seems to amount to <i>extensive personal opinions on matters outside of Wikipedia</i> - the reason for Zoe claims for deletion on Jeffpw's talkpage. No violation of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> is obvious here. In any event by convention editor's userpages should not be edited unilaterally and the correct thing for Zoe to do was surely to raise her concerns on Jeffpw's talkpage. To do otherwise is extremely heavy handed and disrespectful to an established contributor. I am sure Jeffpw would have removed the image himself if it had been shown to him to be in violation of policy. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a> 19:13, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Zoe, you seem to have missed the fact that Jeffpw's reversions and reaction to you are a consequence of the manner in which you set about deleting content from his userpage twice. Had you started a discussion with him on his TalkPage, as common courtesy required, you would have found him more helpful! <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a> 19:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The only portion it could possibly violate is the quote from Jimbo, which, in my opinion, is overly broad and does not reflect policy. Jimbo&#160;!= consensus. Zoe quoted another section of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> after a couple reverts and after being asked a couple times to cite policy, but I don't see how it applies at all (it was the "extensive personal opinions on matters unrelated to Wikipedia" bit). —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 19:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh, and just for the record, I think it was slightly misguided, and if still kept, should be very much reduced in size and prominence. I think Zoe behaved incredibly badly in not simply explaining her concern first and asking Jeff to modify it (not to mention using administrative rollback on non-vandalism and all that jazz).

<dd>And I certainly beg to differ that "A picture of Thomas Jefferson doesn't have any political implications."

<dd>If someone believes it's polemic, absolutely. This is silly, Coelacan. You're not campainging to put Jefferson for the presidency. There's a difference, and I think you understand that.

<dd>It is not POINT, because I am not disrupting anything. I just put up one picture on my user page to talk about it. We can hardly talk about it without a specific example.

<dd>I didn't say you were disrupting anything... but it does seem to go against "state your point; don't prove it experimentally". It's just an observation though... personally I think you are comparing apples to oranges here with posting a picture of a dead politician who is widely considered a "founding father" of the U.S. and trying to compare it to posting a picture of a current politician who has just declared her presidential candidacy. It's just not a good comparison... and I think your "Jeffersonian adovcacy" rings a bit hollow here since you seem to have embraced it after this issue with Jeff's page arose.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:59, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't care if you think it's hollow and I think you really ought to consider the implications of my actions on their face. If you don't think Jefferson's politics are controversial today, you don't follow politics. The man is almost single-handedly responsible for church/state separation, and thousands of pages of pages of analysis are written every year on his opinions of precisely what that separation should entail. As for polemic, well, I'm not quoting him on my user page at this time, but in <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, he wrote, "<i>There is not one redeeming feature in our superstition of Christianity. It has made one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites</i>". Father of the United States or not, he's not merely an uncontroversial footnote, and to openly support his politics was considered treasonous in America in the 1950s, and today is a guarantee of unelectability. A recent Supreme Court case regarding the Pledge of Allegiance hinged on his (and others') opinions. You can't box him away safely in the past. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm familiar with Jefferson and his writings, but again, comparing Jefferson to Clinton is a bad comparison. Comparing these actions "on their face" completely ignores the context; no matter how controversial Jefferson was in his day or how controversial his writings still are he simply is not a controversial figure in this day and age any more so than Voltaire or Dante. Besides, what you have on your userpage really has no bearing on this discussion; nobody has complained about it or tried to remove the picture have they?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually Patstuart has just told me that I should take it down if anyone asks me to. And are you seriously saying that "<i>In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty.

<dd>Consensus was established years ago by default, and last spring when political statements started being deleted, that ground to a halt because an alternative consensus was never formed. The userbox migration resulted as a compromise, and that was as far as it went. So as far as I'm concerned, consensus has always been that non-abusive political statements were allowed, with the caveat that political <i>user categories</i> were to be deleted because they were used for votestacking. In any case, "the community" is rather a lot more people than the one hypothetical "someone" you speak of. If someone asked me to take down Jefferson, I would come here and ask for a larger discussion before I made any move. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:40, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really understand how supporting a presidential candidate is "polemic". The American Heritage Dictionary defines "polemic" as "a controversy or argument, esp. one that is a refutation of or an attack upon a specified opinion or doctrine." Implying support for Sen. Clinton doesn't seem to be a controversy or an argument, or any worse than many of the things Wikipedians express through userboxes. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 20:05, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. For some Userboxes designating one as a Christian or an Atheist could be polemic. Heck, even the users boxes about American English vs British English could cause strife.

<dd>It does show controversy but it is over a span of topics. For some, the singular image itself is controversial. For others, the actual deletion process and admin conduct was controversial.

<p>Is it just images of Hillary Clinton that are not allowed?

How about User:BigGuy219 who just has a picture of John McCain with his name under it? Are those OK, or should we ask the users to remove them? How about the 18 user pages with the image Rudy-Giuliana-face.jpg? Is it ok because some ot them are userboxes that say they do not approve of vandalism?

<p>And here we go again...</p>
<p>If there's anything the various incidents over the course of the last year have taught us, it's that selective attempts at enforcing userpage rules simply don't work as intended, and usually result in little beyond getting many people quite upset. This goes double for attempts that dispense with the usual discussion and move straight to the ham-fisted removal.</p>
<p>There is very, <i>very</i> little that an established, good-faith contributor could place on their userpage which would truly need to be removed <i>right now</i>. Everything else doesn't warrant immediate, undiscussed removal; and most likely doesn't really need to be removed at all, unless we're going to make a habit of actually patrolling userpages for "inappropriate" content. A picture of Hillary isn't particularly important, in the grand scheme of things; it's rather unlikely to be worth provoking the sort of big, nasty, <i>utterly pointless</i> fight that is certain to result when you try to remove it by force. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I whole-heartedly support Barack Obama, but I certainly don't object to Jeff's picture of Hilary: when he first put it up I thought nothing more than "Thank God he's taken down that dreadful joke message bar". Personally, I am FAR more offended by users who have "His user believes marriage is between a man and a woman only" userboxes on their page. I suggest you start a discussion to remove them, rather than harrass a hard-working user whose only crime is to be an enthusiastic Democrat. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 21:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can someone please explain to me why people have to wander around policing people's user pages? Seriously. You are wasting time on this issue. The people that seem more concerned about what Jeffpw has on his user page are basically saying "it's against policy!!!" (yawn) I can sit here and find lots of things on people's user pages that are against policy.

<dd>I think she's suggesting that you could find better things to do than start fights with other users, Zoe. Maybe not better for you but better on the whole. This whole thing is nonsense, as are most fights over userpages. There's going to be an election in the States. It gets quite heated. Lots of people will campaign on their userpages. <i>yawn</i>. We could have a fascinating brawl over whether policy permits it, with some fantastic wheelwarring and lots of bad blood, or we could simply accept that it's sometimes worse to piss on playgrounds than to just let people play. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 23:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I just don't understand why no one was policing Jeffpw's user page when he had that annoying joke message bar up there. It took me a number of clicks to figure it out (and it took me the same number to figure out that with pop-ups I can use rollover to go directly to the user's talk page, instead of the user page first, then the talk page). Wow, American politics doesn't get more divisive. Still, I thought it was another practical joke. When I couldn't find the punch line, I assumed Jeff had taken a serious bent and was now working on a FA on Hillary Clinton's declaration of her campaign for Wikipedia. Now I find he's just campaigning. Will it never end?</p>
<p>The fact is Jeffpw's campaign would have recieved almost no attention but for this series of unfortunate events. IMO, it behooves administrators to act polite first, rather than retroactively--Jeffpw is an agreeable Wikipedian, who takes the fall even when he's not at fault. Now look at the other editors who have added Hillary's image to their user pages as a result of this series of incidents, "IF YOU HATE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, POST IT ON MY USER TALK; I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VIEWS Otherwise, if you need any help, just post on my user talkpage Thanks, Monbro 17:07, 27 October 2006 (UTC)," 8X10s of Hillary, a Hillary support user box. But Jeffpw's support of Hillary is the issue?</p>
<p>Jeffpw is an excellent, hard-working editor, who goes out of his way to <i>be the gracious party</i> during times of conflict. I think he is a poor choice of editor to make a stand on disliking political advocacy on user pages, particularly when there are so many more egregious choices on user pages made by editors who are not so polite, helpful, hardworking, and dedicated. In the end though, I predict that Jeffpw will back down and be as gracious as he usually is, the sterling example of someone who really does know how to contribute to Wikipedia's quality and sense of community. And, in advance of that, thanks, Jeffpw for getting rid of that idiot joke message bar, which I felt was rather hostile to new and uncomputer savvy editors. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:36, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive184_4f8f.html" title="Edit section: User:GoldDragon and Joe Volpe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">User:GoldDragon</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Volpe_59ac.html" title="Joe Volpe">Joe Volpe</a></span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">User:GoldDragon</a> has been revert-warring to restore his preferred version of the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Volpe_59ac.html" title="Joe Volpe">Joe Volpe</a> page.</p>
<p>Background: I've had several dealings with GoldDragon in the last year or so, all on pages having to do with Canadian politics. These encounters have tried my patience to the limit, and beyond. GoldDragon's general approach to Wikipedia is to make the same edits over and over again, even if several other posters have expressed opposition. He has also violated the 3RR several times, and I've frequently had to tell him to revert himself if he wants to avoid being blocked. I've tried arguing, making friendly outreaches, seeking outside opinions -- none of it seems to make any difference on his behaviour for long. There have also been times when I've completely lost patience with him, and participated in open edit-wars. I recognize that this was improper behaviour, and I've taken steps to avoid getting caught in such situations again. He has not reciprocated.</p>
<p>Concerning the present dispute: GoldDragon and I disagreed on the content of the Joe Volpe page in December. Two outside contributors weighed in, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldDragon&amp;diff=96229622&amp;oldid=95911965" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldDragon&amp;diff=96229622&amp;oldid=95911965" rel="nofollow">private negotiations</a> took place, and GoldDragon stopped reverting the page for a while. Unfortunately, he soon began to restore his preferred version in small increments. I summarized the current situation on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joe_Volpe&amp;diff=102470404&amp;oldid=102382334" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joe_Volpe&amp;diff=102470404&amp;oldid=102382334" rel="nofollow">yesterday</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Volpe&amp;diff=102470633&amp;oldid=102376107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Volpe&amp;diff=102470633&amp;oldid=102376107" rel="nofollow">restored</a> the previously accepted wording.

<p>what should be done in the case of a user who persistenly removes the "copyvio" tag from a page, then goes on to remove the listing from the copyvio investigation page? the edit summaries refer to "template not needed" and "rm troll" rather than giving any explanation. certainly nothing to justify the identical swathes of text between the article and the webpage.<a href="../../../i/b/a/User%7EIbaranoff24_bfad.html" title="User:Ibaranoff24">User:Ibaranoff24</a> is the user in question - his edits, in particular his response to the last incident filed against him, have an aggressive <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> quality to them. should he be warned? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">User:Patstuart</a> was the admin who warned him previously. thx.</p>

However, the edit warring on this page is clearly disrupting the article. What can be done here? <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 01:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On Rocky page I gave answer, pulltoopen gave his third opinion before I was able to reply, I was NOT even aware there was a poll. Again, i simply tried to fix things!-Boxingwear</p>

<dd>It wasn't a poll. I was asking for opinions so I could draw my conclusion, but you left a note on my talk page that gave me enough information. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 01:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fully reject that reply, you posted a question for second party on marciano page, you did not give me a chance and i thought you were administrators, brush up on rules, allow people at least 48 hours to reply, you did not give me half an hour. Boxingwear</p>
<p>I corrected the baker dilemma, the mkil repetition, replied to questions and on talk page, i hope somebody will watch over rocky page, again, somebody informed me on my talk page in december and in january to watch over it, somebody really wanted that, after a long conversation, i decided i will watch over it, no doubt there was a good reason, i explained all there is to know, just check my contributions!Boxingwear</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">User:Rfwoolf</a> is still bitching about the deletion of anal stretching. I deleted a rant on his user page as <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapboxing</a>, there was some argy-bargy, a compromise was reached with another admin over unprotecting the page, but it's now back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARfwoolf&amp;diff=102817331&amp;oldid=102018705" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARfwoolf&amp;diff=102817331&amp;oldid=102018705" rel="nofollow">substantially the same</a> with the small change that it says it's "constructive criticism", which is a bit like like saying "no offence" after calling someone a pikey.</p>
<p>Here is my major problem with it: it identifies me by name as having "unilaterally" salted the article. This is <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">complete bollocks</a>. Woolf kept reposting it in substantially identical form, and what I did was actually to <i>restore</i> the history for deletion review because <b>I was trying to help him</b> (I don't think I'll make that mistake again). Deletion and salting was then endorsed by deletion review, with numerous admins participating, and the history was deleted by someone else entirely. So this is a baseless personal attack, the falseness of which has been pointed out many times, and which he still insists on repeating.</p>
<p>Of course, calling us "trigger-happy deletionists" for deleting it after only five days instead of keeping this <s>uncited how-to</s> peerless article also does not help. Needless to say we should always expend our efforts to save those articles whose authors can't be arsed to write them properly, because that is what we are here for, especially when the article is on such a worthy subject. Woolf's rewrite seems to be based on sources as compelling as Goatse, so clearly we've gone badly wrong here. Oh, wait, maybe I lapsed into sarcasm for a moment there.</p>
<p>Anyway, if an uninvolved admin wouldn't mind popping over there to get him to remove his attacks on me, I'd appreciate it.

<dd>It's not bias because I'm asking the question seriously. If "Anal stretching" is a legitiment concept with enough actual coverage to back it up then it should have an article. Have you been able to find any books on the subject? Any journal articles? What about newspaper articles? ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 07:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I just begin by saying that on the whole I really do appreciate your input, especially as an <b>uninvolved admin</b> because on some level it has been helpful. But on another level you are dabbling in something beyond the scope of this post by Guy. The issue at hand is the content of my userpage. You are now making judgments about the Anal stretching debacle which has its own "mediator" (<a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">User:dfrg.msc</a>), and I'm afraid your latest comments about that here (and on my userpage) are unfortunately rather inapt. You haven't (for example) seen my rewrite project here, or have you? You will see my complete proposal to rewrite the article <b>as well as</b> my sources policy, which separates sources into two classes, i) <b>First-prize sources</b> and ii) <b>Second-prize sources</b>. Just because a source sucks doesn't mean I'm not going to provisionally add it to my notes as second-prize source.<br /></dd>
<dd>If you are going to continue to comment about the Anal stretching debacle (which is now rather complex), I suggest you <i>at very least</i> refer to my rewrite attempt which is in a very young stage!

<li>As I pointed out, most of your "first prize sources" were not sources for this term at all. You have managed to cause a truly staggering amount of disruption without actually producing anything of any merit thus far, and it appears that your response to being told something is a problem is - repeatably - to keep re-creating it and asserting it's not a problem. And then troll about it. The depth of your obsession with this utterly trivial subject appears to be matched only by your stubbornness in refusing to accept advice or correction. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 07:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:Gon4z has been introducing false information, removing citations, and outright changing correct information to false unsourced information over the past couple of hours. It appears that the user does not write/speak English as a first language, however a good portion of the previous 50 or so edits that the user has made are pretty obvious vandalism, most notably to articles related to Serbia and Albania. If it were a few edits, I could correct them myself, however this "spree" is over 50 edits and I alone cannot revert all of them. I also have no idea on how to contact the user in a case like this. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpot87_c192.html" title="User:Spot87">Spot87</a> 04:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wouldn't be at all surprised if Israelbeach's PR firm is somehow involved with Cherney, but that's just my suspicion based on his past editing patterns, no firm proof (tag team sockpuppet editing, Israeli current affairs, Wikilawyering from the getgo). I'm not particularly interested in tangling swords with this unpleasant user again, but perhaps someone with knowledge of Cherney should look into these articles and check to see they are not too wildly biased. And keep an eye on the puppets, liable to revert to blockable behaviour. --<a href="../../../y/l/g/User%7EYlggow_b690.html" title="User:Ylggow">Ylggow</a> 10:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a difficult situation on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Clark_%28journalist%29_74e8.html" title="Neil Clark (journalist)">Neil Clark (journalist)</a>, a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> article about a British journalist. The subject of the article has blogged about the issue <a href="http://neilclark66.blogspot.com/2007/01/old-dogs-old-tricks.html" class="external text" title="http://neilclark66.blogspot.com/2007/01/old-dogs-old-tricks.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In essence, Clark is claiming that negative material was added by either sockpuppets or meatpuppets of <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Kamm_8051.html" title="Oliver Kamm">Oliver Kamm</a>, a journalist and blogger with whom he has had a disagreement (which has involved the attempted instigation of legal proceedings). At the moment, the Neil Clark article includes a note accusing two editors of vandalising it and stating that they are aliases of Oliver Kamm. Meanwhile the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Talk%7ENeil_Clark_%28journalist%29_f23c.html" title="Talk:Neil Clark (journalist)">talk page</a> is a mess of claim and counter-claim.</p>
<p>I think this could all do with a thorough check, and possibly an <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>-style stubbifying and rebuilt.

<p>These sock puppetry accusations are absolutely untrue for this case and based on nothing but pure speculation. Just because you are unhappy that others agree with my line of reasoning does not condone accusations without solid evidence. - Animesouth 09:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Marc, I'm not buying this crap. You tried a similar tactic before with the list using anonymous accounts. That's why both the list and it's talk page had to be sprotected. You've don't nothing but complain because your convention doesn't meet the list's criteria and you couldn't convince any other editors to agree with you to change the criteria. Then when you couldn't get your way with the criteria or bypass it, you put it up for AfD. Now that you failed to delete the list through AfD, you are trying to change it by fiat using socks. This is discriminable behavior for any editor to engage in, and especially coming from the convention's chairman in question. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 12:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marc, you admitted to me via Private Topic on the AnimeCons.com Forums that you were the user "Anime South". That account also had the exact same IP as some of the anonymous edits here at the time.

<p>Heavy vandalism here: I've reverted 8 times in the last hour, but I'm packing it in for now, someone with rollback and block tools might like to keep an eye on this and maybe semi-protect. This has nothing to do with Giano, IRC or related wikidramas whatsoever, I just put that in to get everyone's attention. Wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone stopped running around like headless chickens at AN and started writing articles or clearing the backlogs...ah well.

<li>Woo-hoo! Semiprotected. It was unprotected for - what, a day? - and most of that time was spent in revert wars with anon vandals. 72 hours semiprotection, but that will probably not be enough.

<dd>I've never visited IRC, and I'm not sure I ever want to, more than once perhaps. Maybe this isn't the forum for this, but what specific constructive uses does it have?

<p>The above entry has been vandalised and maliciously edited on several occasions by 'philip cross' and 'elena zamm'. Neil Clark had an acrimonious dispute with the writer Oliver Kamm after Clark published a critical review of a book by Kamm in the Daily Telegraph. Both 'Philip Cross' and 'elena zamm' have also edited, but this time favourably, the pages of Oliver Kamm and Kamm's mother, Anthea Bell. There is very strong circumstantial evidence that Cross and Zamm are Oliver Kamm. Libels have been posted on Clark's page, including that he 'defends mass murderers'. The account of Clark's legal dispute with Kamm has only sought to put Kamm's side of things. Both 'philip cross' and 'elena zamm' should be barred from editing Clark's page as they are not interested in a factual biography, but only in repeating libels and editing maliciously. citylightsgirlCitylightsgirl</p>

<p>Hi. May I ask to have my user page history deleted? Frankly I'd welcome the side effect of my edit count dropping, and I'm sure I don't need anything from the past.

<dd>I endorse CyberAnth's actions. The only thing ey did wrong was to comment out the offending material. Our biographies too often slide into long unsourced slagfests. Here's what I suggest: write an article that both Swaggart himself and his direst enemy would agree was fair.

<dd>Taking the need for citations as read, that's not actually the reason he gave for the blanking- what he's arguing is that no more than a certain portion of the article should be devote to the controversies surrounding Swaggart, and if it is exceeded it should be blanked.

<dd>Sigh... It is however satisfied by the use of undisputed facts (rather than opinions) backed by cites. Currently the there doesn't seem to be any kind of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> dispute at all - though you persist in portraying it as such - the cited facts are undisputed facts, as called for by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The actual that is being made that the article shouldn't be expanded with facts that cast Swaggart in a negative light until facts that cast him in a positive light can be found, and until that can be done it should remain a stub.

For ex, he accused me (as usual) of distorting biomedical research and I asked him to provide examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=92669190&amp;oldid=92571210" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=92669190&amp;oldid=92571210" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> and he provided me with a link of an edit that WAS NOT mine. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=93817008&amp;oldid=93769617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWobble&amp;diff=93817008&amp;oldid=93769617" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> Or like how he accuses me of "total lack of any understanding of science" considering I just explained and proved to him that technically white isnt a color (in physics) a couple minutes before his edit in question. Or his another accusation of me committing plagarism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lukas19&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102685071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lukas19&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102685071" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> when I clearly attributed the work to the scientist by saying "<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._W._F._Edwards_2683.html" title="A.

<p>Anyway, besides those, there are also lots of other stuff that makes you roll your eyes, like calling me "Thukie Lulie" (one of above diffs) and "Thukas" (thickos?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_views_on_race&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102701486" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_views_on_race&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102701486" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, or "No, no shit.

<dd>If it can be proven that the professor in question really did ask his students to vandalize Wikipedia, then I suggest that the evidence be posted here, along with contact address for the professor's faculty dean, the president of the university, and the university's office for handling academic misconduct. Concerned Wikipedians can then send an e-mail or letter to the authorities of their choice to complain about the conduct of the professor. As a (former) academic myself, I'm appalled that an educator would encourage or require his students to commit an antisocial and possibly illegal act as coursework, and I expect that this professor's colleagues and superiors would see it the same way. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 03:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Keep in mind that the assertion and acusation that the instructor (who is not a professor) was behind this are unproven... I'm not going to post the proper contact info here to avoid a flood of abusive complaints, but it's all out there on the web, and I have sent the chair and assistant chair of the department and coordinator for the class series that this instructor is teaching a report and complaint, asking that they investigate and figure out if the instructor really did do that. If he did, then hopefully they can be convinced to take appropriate action. But he should be treated as innocent until there's some credible evidence. For all we know right now, it's a Joe-job, trying to get an innocent uninvolved person in trouble. If you feel the need to add additional complaints, please do so keeping in mind that the evidence is pretty weak (a single pseudonymous acusation). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 09:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fredrick, if one wants to prove the violatile nature of Wiki's, that's what sandbox and one's userspace is. I teach, I talk about Wikis, I do use my userpage to demonstrate those issues - but I'd never thought to vandalize a real article even for a few seconds to prove to my students what can be proven as well on my userpage (as messing up real article's history and allowing a reader to find vandalised info during the few seconds it takes one to revert a change is simply <i>bad</i>). That said, I encourage examples of 'good editing' - I prefer to show my studnets how easy it is to add interlinks or copyedit articles.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 19:46, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have a suggestion for Mr. Pierce. If you want your students to learn about the dangers of using wikipedia, have them search for five unreferenced figures in this encyclopedia. They can use the random article button on the left side of the screen. Have them verify those figures. Chances are that some of the figures will turn out to be wrong. You will get your message across to your students, they will hopefully learn from it and we will know which information is incorrect. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Bravado</a></sup> 00:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have another suggestion. He could get his students to <i>improve</i> an article on Wikipedia, and verify it.</p>
<p>As an aside, this professor has very little technical knowledge about Wikipedia, especially as we have the <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">revert</a> function and don't have to rely on printouts to restore the article to its previous state. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User%7EYuser31415_e4ea.html" title="User:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 01:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no qualms with a prof making a real-time point by inserting erroneous info into an article while the class watches on a screen, and then reverting it right then and there. But asking the whole class apart from oversight of the university's <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institutional_Review_Board_ab2a.html" title="Institutional Review Board">Institutional Review Board</a> (IRB) needlessly takes the point too far.</p>
<p>Like it or not, it is an entirely legitimate research project to study vandalism and reverts on WP by engaging in them. Such a research project could certainly pass IRB approval for a class research project. This has to be admitted and, yes, possibly expected. That said, this does not appear to be the case here.</p>
<p>The response letter composed was probably hasty and not done in the most effective manner. All that needed doing was to remind the prof that, for class research projects, he must first get IRB approval - which he would certainly admit to - and if he does the project again, you would report it to the university's IRB. IRB approval of research projects is a time-consuming, tedious task. This would have probably been the end of the matter. If not, if it occurred again, then the letter should go to the IRB, indicating the prof's class is doing research <i>not under their approval</i>. That <b>really</b> would put a stop to it. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 06:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that would assume that the professor was doing it as a research project.

<p>I have had further discussion with Professor Pierce. I asked him if he felt that if a newspaper had false information, his students should steal all of the copies out of the vendor's box, and if he found something wrong in Encyclopaedia Brittanica, would he encourage them to rip the page out of the book, but he doesn't see the analogy. I also mentioned that we have seen an increase in vandalism from NIU IP addresses which, despite his claim, he had not reverted, and he apologized for the extra work entailed in fixing that. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Because it does strike me as a very good topic for one, and something to hand to frustrated professors and the like while at the same time asking them not to vandalize to make a point.

<dd>Interestingly enough, just Friday I was talking to a high school professor about Wikipedia, and I indicated to him that I would never cite it in my papers, and the only articles that I would even consider citing are those in which I had personally worked on and could vet on its content and accuracy. He wasn't surprised, even though I had told him that I was a Wikipedia administrator. Also, I told him how it is easy to permanently cite a revision using the "permanent link" link, so all amount of vandalism to "destroy" the information doesn't work, it just hides it and adds work to everyone involved. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 06:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the professor's defense (at least on this point), the metaphors you suggested to him (stealing newspapers, ripping encyclopedias) were not the best analogies.

<dd>I'm skeptical. In my opinion, I don't think Bosniak would have been that subtle, and I think he would have headed straight for the Srebrenica article.

<dd>I agree that this one is borderline; there's some circumstantial evidence, but it's far from clear-cut.

<dd>I think Psychonaut is misinterpreting what "unrelated" means. It does not mean that there is no sockpuppetry going on; it merely means that checkuser could not confirm that there is. For a hypothetical example, a puppetmaster might have his main account in Nevada, but run his sockpuppets through a friendly ISP in Bolivia. There'd be no way to detect that other than going by the contents of the edits, and that's not checkuser's job, of course. Also, I erred about <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosna_658f.html" title="User:Bosna">Bosna</a>, for whom we lack new enough information. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 06:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is exactly what I would have expected from Maleabroad, basing myself on my previous experience of him. I had noted that after having completed his block, he had restarted editing, this time anonymously. As his ways have in no way bettered, and refuses to be civil or abstain from editing till the week passes, I propose to follow dab and give him an indef. block. Also, I advise to keep an eye on his favourite articles, and be ready to semi-protect them if necessary. Personally, this is what I had to do to contain his flood of block evasions after my first 31h block.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:52, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, this is not a questioning over the administrator's actions, as he was just following the policy, but the policy makes clear that vandalism edits are legitimate in reverting against 3RR. If there is consensus from other edits that his edits have been disruptive (as indicated in the talk page and the ANI page), would then his edits count as vandalism and 3RR become a moot point except for the offending party?</p>
<p>My edits have been largely benign for the almost past year that I have been editing, and I have tackled on a lot of vandalism and have improved a decent amount of articles. However, I cannot help but feel sore that I was subjected to being blocked and considered disruptive, something that I have fought against in many, many other articles.</p>
<p>What I'd like is to just see what others contributors think about all of this, and whether or not that maybe WP:3RR needs to be revisited in the case of potential sock puppets.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 18:48, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you can always revert the page back, once the sock-check has been done, I guess. Though it is somewhat frustrating to watch the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a> being gamed, I agree. Some of the younger admins enforcing 3rr think that it is an absolute rule, and apply it mechanically. Note that we DO have an <a href="../../../i/a/r/IAR_4211.html" title="IAR">ignore all rules</a> policy for situations like this, and all admin actions should be taken with your brain turned on.</dd>
<dd>If your version of the story is correct, then the blocking admin was <b>not</b> applying the guidelines to improve wikipedia. OMG! IARvio! My proposed punishment for IARvios is to beat the person in question with a cluebat until they agree to apply their cerebral cortex on wikipedia at all times.</dd>
<dd>Of course, all the above only holds if what you say is exactly right. We haven't heard from the blocking admin yet. Perhaps we could take it to their talk page and see what they have to say? --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 19:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am he. Am I young? I suppose I can hope so. CK got 3h; the sock (presumed; not proved) got 48h (in fact I reported that above (Animesouth)&#160;: I'd be grateful if someone could check it, since the sock evidence was by no means conclusive and may have been meat anyway...) but is CK grateful... for course not. CK asks <i>the policy makes clear that vandalism edits are legitimate in reverting against 3RR. If there is consensus from other edits that his edits have been disruptive (as indicated in the talk page and the ANI page), would then his edits count as vandalism</i> to which I would answer *no*: the 3RR exception is for blatant vandalism, allowing that to extend to "edits which other editors dislike" then thats a very slippery slope <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>In this particular case, I would argue that the edits were disruptive. The user failed to participate in discussion, and in retaliation had used suspected socks to be further disruptive. The reverts I made were in accordance to other editors who commonly edit the page, so if anything, the Animesouth and either his socks or cabal would be the ones at fault, not I. I have a huge problem with his because the 3RR was filed in such horrible faith. I am not targeting you personally, but I do feel that something is broken in this particular case.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 20:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(If this is going to be 3RR policy, it might be better over there). There is no 3RR exception for "reverting disruptive behaviour" because its far too hard to draw a line. The vandalism exception is blatant vandalism, and I doubt many would support anything wider. If your reverts were in line with what other editors wanted, you could and should have left it to them.

<p>Ayyavazhi is an autonomous religion in India. Though it was not officially recognised, it's factual existence (as a seperate religion) as well as the presence of thousands of (8000) worship centers across India is cited seperately from different university papers. Please see <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndia_Ayyavazhi_b349.html" title="Talk:India/Ayyavazhi">here</a> where a seperate discussion is opened for Ayyavazhi discussions. See there all the different questions were answered by me, placing appropriate citations. Mind that the citations are from the University papers, which are the least affected agents get affected to POVs. Apart from all these, the LMS reports, the first and the largest protestant missionary also witness the factual existence of the independent nature of Ayyavazhi. These too is cited.</p>
<p>After all thease citations, people there in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> article are removing Ayyavazhi merely because of the reason that Ayyavazhi is not officially recognised. I told them several times that, "If something is not officially recognised, then it couldn't be aurged that that thing does not exists factually." Also on the other hand I give a series of proofs from Indian Universities (different) for the presence of Ayyavazhi people accross the nation and the proof for the presence of thousands of Ayyavazhi worship centers in India. Also, three districts are declared as a holiday for an Ayyavazhi festival. Even 20% of the collective population of these areas covers over a million population. Still they don't understand. Even in my discussion I've said several times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:India/Ayyavazhi#Ayyavazhi_commoners" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:India/Ayyavazhi#Ayyavazhi_commoners" rel="nofollow">the main reasons</a> for the lack of official recognition of Ayyavazhi in India.</p>

<p>Also for the same reason, Iwas also blocked two times for violating 3RR. I discuss for all edits and I ask other users to discuss befor reverting. They revert without discussing. If two people decided they can force me to revert more than 3 times, since they two peopl ecollectively have 6 reverting chances. Finally I may be complained for violating 3rr.

<dd>Sir, Pls read the discussions carefully. There are definilely a large numberof Ayyavazhi's than jews and Zoroastrians in India. And hence Ayyavazhi is notable there. Also the sources used are not evn histirian views but university papers, one from University of Madras, one of the (one among the three oldest universities) most credible universities in India. Another from Madurai Kamaraj University a leading university in Tamil Nadu. Aren't they valid? If so, what is the value of third party citations in wikipedia? - <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><sub>Д</sub></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj">|Ж|</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><sub>Д</sub></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/10px-Flag_of_India.svg.png" alt="" width="10" height="7" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" /></a></b> 20:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interestingly enough, doing a search through the Daily Mail archives for March 9, 2005 for "Gerard Montgomery" brings up two articles about the murder, but strangely, Montgomery's name is not mentioned in the articles. I have to wonder how the Daily Mail does their search criteria. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a></p>

<dd>Yes- it needs to be removed from the other articles too. We don't want Wikipedia exposed to legal claims for libel. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:53, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have deleted Jim McCormack and Gerard Davison, as they didn't even have a single reference, let alone non-reliable ones, and yet the articles claimed that these people were murderers. Don't recreate until you provide reliable references. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC) I cant believe you deleted these page - these two are even more notable than Montgomery! Have you gone mad, do you know anything about these issues? If you had of prompted the pages I could have put loads of references on them.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 22:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Eric R's version is available <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-129979986.html" class="external text" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-129979986.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. No success in finding it on the Mail site, which is odd when there are several other articles on the topic for that day. Note the wording: "also identified as allegedly being involved". These are carefully chosen <a href="../../../w/w/_/WP%7EWW_a8b9.html" title="WP:WW">weasel words</a>, bearing no resemblance to the pre-blanking version. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have three <i>Daily Mail</i> articles which name Davison, McCormak, and Montgomery. I don't know if it's enough for articles on these persons, and we may be running into an issue where the names were removed from the papers online version for some reason. I'll add the quotes to Talk:Gerard Montgomery and we can go from there.—<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">eric</a> 22:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can I ask where you got the articles, Eric? I mean, do you have physical newspapers at hand? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The articles appear on LexisNexis, and articles asserting more or less the same facts (i.e. naming the men as allegedly connected with the murder) appeared in two other newspapers as well at the same time. So I tend not to doubt the existence of the article. It is possible it was retracted, but it is also possible that the DM archive is simply incomplete for some other reason. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 22:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>LexisNexis is a pay for use service, so if an article is only available through that medium, how do we verify what it says? Especially if it's information that could be considered as libel, such as accusing someone of murder. Perhaps Wikipedia should consider purchasing an enterprise license for LexisNexus that all <b>registered</b> editors could use. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These are news articles so they would be found on the LexisNexis academic search that many public libraries make available for free to their members. You could also head to a research library and look at the hard copies or microfiche. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 23:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have done nothing but bring up reliable sources continuously and just because he doesnt like it he results to personal attacks. He has even gone as far as claiming that the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade_f485.html" title="Mammed Amin Rasulzade">Mammed Amin Rasulzade</a> article is his and that I have no right to edit it (diff's, these are only some of his comments, he has claimed that the article is "his" many many times before): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103220752" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103220752" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100697169" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mammed_Amin_Rasulzade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100697169" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> (notice the title <i><b>my</b> article that Azerbaijani <b>spoiled</b></i>) , and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100698490" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100698490" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> (notice the false accusations against me, much of the current article is made up of Elsanaturk's contributions) His blatant and unfounded accusations that I have ruined that article are outrageous! Look at the edit summaries and look at my edits, I did nothing that constitutes vandalism, infact, I kept adding sourced information to the article. I should not have to take such abuse, and if you look at this users contributions, they have been nothing but un-constructive edits and comments.
