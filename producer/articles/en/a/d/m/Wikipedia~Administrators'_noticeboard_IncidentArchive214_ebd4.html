<dd>Hardly an edit war. The initial edit I made was to remove a clear <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">peacock</a> term. When I edited the article the second time I did fail to notice that is was a direct quote admittedly. The quote is of unclear attribution or neutrality so I added the peacock tag and posted a polite message on the talk page explaining my reasoning for it, then you subsequently removed the tag without explanation, and I have not edited the page since and have no intention of doing so. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 01:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

It seems that the article was copying the source word for word rather than being re-written in a more neutral and encyclopedic tone, and the subsequent quotation marks have been added to allow the use of a clear peacock term. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 01:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm requesting some kind of assistance in an edit war that has gone on for several weeks at <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lies_and_the_Lying_Liars_Who_Tell_Them_bb5c.html" title="Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</a>.</p>
<p>User:D323P initially took the tone of trying to improve the article, with notes on the "talk" page indicating his/her perception of bias in the article. He/she subsequently added several paragraphs of "criticism" of the book to the page, each of which drew objections from multiple editors.</p>
<p>Other editors, including myself, have attempted to engage D323P in dispassionate discussion, in order to reach a resolution. He/she has, however, resisted numerous editors' efforts to improve the text and remove the effect of POV pushing. Rather than engage the arguments raised, he/she generally calls other editors' credibility and motivations into question, and raises the emotional tenor of the discussion.</p>
<p>Please note that D323P violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> several weeks ago, after I had warned him/her of it, and I notified him/her via <a href="../../../d/3/2/User_talk%7ED323P_881c.html" title="User talk:D323P">talk page</a> afterwards. He/she has violated it again today, again after a warning.</p>
<p>Please consider blocking this user, or attempting to engage him/her in a discussion. I believe he/she is no longer responsive to the concerns of the editors currently involved in the situation.</p>

<dd>I have fully protected the page for 48 hours. The user Peteforsyth has a clean record of no blocks and no incivil/personal attack activity that I can see. Furthermore, the consensus was clearly against the reported user's edits, so I won't issue out any 3rr blocks regarding this matter. However, for future purposes please send the matter here or request protection at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>, because if I see it happen again I will be forced to block. Looking at the talk page I also see several <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> made by the User:D323P. I will warn him/her against using such attacks but I won't block him/her at the moment either to try and see if something can be done to resolve this without such measures.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 04:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I received your note. Thank you. Pete wrote, <i>"Other editors, including myself, have attempted to engage D323P in dispassionate discussion."</i> I'm sorry, but I do not agree with that at all. Discussions happened <i>only</i> after my material was deleted without discussion (violation of WP policy). They were also not "dispassionate." I rightfully objected to the way my material was misrepresented (as seen on the discussion page) and how I felt I was being unfairly treated. D323P 04:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is a job for either an RfC or a community ban fro all articles related to CWU. The overt legal threats were a while back, and these days he is only foaming at the mouth, not actually threatening people, I think. It is very hard to assume good faith of someone whose major activity on Wikipedia is whitewashing a diploma mill and attacking those who resist him in doing so, but let's play it by the book. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I'm sure Viridae acted with the best of intentions, reverting then protecting a favoured version was always going to result in protests.

<p>Nikodemos and Ruadh are the same people, and Nikodemos has been reverting back to Ruad's versions in articles. Compare their dates of their edit histories. Both are absent and present on the same days. Ruadh: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Ruadh" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Ruadh" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Nikodemos: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nikodemos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nikodemos" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Proof:</p>
<p>Nikodemos was gone from December 30 through January 12. There were no edits from Ruadh during that time.</p>
<p>Nikodemos and Ruadh take an extended leave, not making any edits from January 19 through February 19. Both arrive back on the same day, which is February 20. Both names make edits on February 20 and February 21.</p>
<p>Nikodemos and Ruadh don't make any edits from February 22 through Februrary 25. They both arrive back on February 26 and start making edits.</p>
<p>Nikodemos takes a break, not making any edits after March 5. Ruadh also stops making edits after March 5 as well and has not made any since. Nikodemos arrives back on March 12 to revert back to Ruadh's version of the article <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics_of_fascism.html" title="Economics of fascism">Economics of fascism</a> here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=114444784&amp;oldid=114422618" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=114444784&amp;oldid=114422618" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> .

<dd>I am curious to know exactly which policy I am accused of having violated. Although I have indeed reverted back to two versions written by <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuadh_22e1.html" title="User:Ruadh">User:Ruadh</a>, that was 7 days after that user had stopped editing the two articles in question. I have reverted to Ruadh's edits, but he has never reverted back to mine, thus there can be no question of two accounts working in tandem. I also never pretended to come in to mediate anything, since User:Ruadh is obviously absent. I claim to have no one's support other than my own. I have repeatedly attempted constructive discussion with Billy Ego on my own, which he has refused. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 18:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using sockpuppets to revert back to versions of your other sockpuppets is showing that you support that changes of your sockpuppets. It's creating the illusion of agreement with you. The only reason your Ruadh sockpuppet has not made an edit since you got back from your 7 day break is because I caught you. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 18:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if this is two accounts used by the same person, the timing on the edits is far enough apart that there's no violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> policy here.

<p>I find it upsetting that absolutely nobody responds to messages I leave here on the board <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114489838" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114489838" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. I'm trying to draw attention to a certain situation. I believe I have been acting correctly and with restraint in the face of clear misconduct, but if I can't rely on the support of other administrators, I end up feeling like an idiot. Why even bother. Here's the situation, one last time, as clearly as possible. After this, if no one chooses to respond, I throw in the towel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking the edits of a user I suspected to be the sockpuppet of a banned user, I read two newly created articles regarding subjects I found to be just barely notable, and heavily laced with advertisement-like hype.</li>
<li>Rather than deleting the articles under CSD-A5, I nominated them on AfD, for the benefit of the doubt. (I really and truly don't feel that either of them are notable topics for the English-language Wikipedia, and find it significant that neither of them have articles on the Hebrew-language Wikipedia. But that's just my opinion.)</li>
<li>The banned user I had originally suspected of starting the article published a long anti-wiki rant off-wiki, publicly ridiculing me personally and Wikipedia in general<a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/1797584/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/1797584/posts" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.</li>
<li>Both AfDs were visited by several brand new users, who with as few as three edits to wikipedia all "discovered" the AfD and came to vote "keep" (namely <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelgeeks_082b.html" title="User:Israelgeeks">user:Israelgeeks</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinnernetgal_20ea.html" title="User:Kinnernetgal">user:Kinnernetgal</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerusalemgold_873b.html" title="User:Jerusalemgold">user:Jerusalemgold</a>, user:Dervish8, and the suspected puppet I was originally tracking, user:Mhltv).</li>
<li>I added a note asking above-mentioned banned user to please stop using sockpuppets, and was accused of being "toxic" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Arnon_Katz&amp;diff=114075000&amp;oldid=114067647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Arnon_Katz&amp;diff=114075000&amp;oldid=114067647" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. The reponse did not surprise me and the style was familiar, I blocked this user as a sockpuppet.</li>
<li>The new user votes and chorus of criticism continue, unchecked. Voters protest my labelling of new users, claiming these are "ad hominem" attacks: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Arnon_Katz&amp;diff=114377859&amp;oldid=114377367" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Arnon_Katz&amp;diff=114377859&amp;oldid=114377367" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>; and in one case, simultaneously denying that new users are sockpuppets, and demanding the unblocking of the suspected sockpuppeteer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kinnernet&amp;diff=114660156&amp;oldid=114565375" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kinnernet&amp;diff=114660156&amp;oldid=114565375" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></li>
<li>Just for the record, the banned user I suspect of being a sockpuppeteer was blocked indefinitely after making legal threats, and veiled threats of what he "could" do to my children if he weren't such a nice person. He has never retracted any of these threats, and indeed to this day repeats the legal threat off-wiki. Every deletion vote that has somehow been connected with him has attracted "brand new users" (See <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_Israelbeach_f260.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Israelbeach">Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Israelbeach</a>).</li>

I honestly don't care if the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinnernet.html" title="Kinnernet">Kinnernet</a> article stays or goes, the notability is borderline, but that's no skin off my nose. I care that Wikipedia processes are being corrupted, but only to a point - I can just shut off my computer and it goes away. I care more than that when I feel I'm being ganged-up on with little or no support.

<dd>From my initial survey of what you've described, I agree that Mhltv (<a href="../../../m/h/l/User_talk%7EMhltv_9da6.html" title="User talk:Mhltv">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mhltv_a4fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mhltv">contribs</a>) is likely to be a puppet of banned user Israelbeach. It is a shame that the results come back as inconclusive from RFCU. In the meantime, as a non-admin, I've removed a handful of instances where israelnewsagency.com was being used as a source. It seems I was going back over JZG's own work in that area (which was reverted by an anon IP). I have dealt with another banned user once who was persistent and incorrigible. Don't let it get you down. While WP:DENY is a good idea, sometimes it burns you out faster than it eventually gets to them. Those times, I step back and realize that sometimes junk can exist in a Wikipedia article for weeks before it's noticed. If they get away with a day or two of vandalism/PoV before you come back and clean it up, it won't be the end of Wikipedia (and it may even garner more attention by others since you weren't there to wipe up the mess immediately). Good luck. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 11:25, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He cites Wikipedia rules in an effort to force us out of the <i><a href="../../../3/0/0/300.html" title="300">300</a></i> page. Initially he left "warnings" on users Erikster, ThuranX and Arcayne's page about violating the 3RR, which they didn't. In truth, these editors were cleaning up the article, and were removing original research that had no citation, or rewording for NPOV. Offended by their changes, he "warned" them. Later, as Arcayne was cleaning up the page, Mardavich reported him for 3RR violation. He cites the diffs and claims that Arcayne has been acting as if he "owns" the article. Arcayne was initially blocked, but when I asked the Admin responsible to go back and look at the diffs more carefully, and compare with the previous versions (which Mardavich did not supply) he did and then unblocked Arcayne, as it was clear that it wasn't real 3RR violation. Since my defence of Arcayne, Mardavich decided to basically wait for me to actually edit <i>300</i> (since I had regulated myself to the talk page the entire time), and he picked out the only 4 edits I had that actually removed information and reported me to 3RR committee. I have yet to see the outcome of this, but I responded on there to look carefully at the diffs, because Mardavich again did not supply an "original version" for comparison. All the diffs are completely different, 1 is removing 2 images that have nothing to do with the film itself, they were pics of real life statues that couldn't be used for comparison; another was removing duplicate information; another was removing more duplicate information. My point is that Mardavich is harrassing myself and the others to the point that he's trying to have use blocked so we can't "oppose" his views on the <i>300</i> page. I forgot to mention that the <i>300</i> page has become highly controversial because of all the reviews about it's possible "racism", and Mardavich is one of the many editors pushing to include every bit of information that calls the film and it's makers racists, withouth any NPOV. Can anything be done about this, or do I and my fellow editors have to worry about never cleaning up any article wikipedia for fear that Mardavich is going to pick out 4 edits and report us for 3RR, or something else? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 12:22, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree. But, throwing around these "warnings" to make editors leave an article so that you can push your POV is not part of the policy.

<dd>I would like to suggest that you reconsider your decision in this matter. I am one of the users Bignole referred to as being essentially wiki-stalked by this POV-pushing user. Dissent in Wikipedia is normal, but Mardavich is not one of those users who relents after losing an argument. He has disrupted the 3RR noticeboard on two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Arcayne_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:Warning.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Arcayne_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:Warning.29" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#.5B.5BUser:Bignole_.5D.5D_reported_by_.5B.5BUser:Mardavich.5D.5D_.28Result:.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#.5B.5BUser:Bignole_.5D.5D_reported_by_.5B.5BUser:Mardavich.5D.5D_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> separate occasions with baseless, empty accusations. Simultaneously, he has worked to tie up admin resources in filing this baseless claim. Even a cursory edit of Mardavich's own user and Discussion Page indicate his <i>strong</i> identification with any causes surrounding Persia and specifically Iran. I would be kind and suggest that his bahvior is a simply hyper-sensitivity to issues that concern Persians, but his actual demeanor is in practice very proactive in removing those editors he sees as interfering with his view of Wikipedia. That three editors (two of them <i>highly</i> respected memebers of this community - I am not including myself as I am still learning the ropes) have had to essentially spend their time away from contributing positively to Wikipedia to fend off these empty yet time-consuming complaints is just wrong.</dd>

His edits are POV-motivated, he refuses to work with anyone or tolerate edits of any viewpoint that differs from his own, and attempts to remove those editors who - following good Wikipedia policy - choose to oppose POV and unsourced edits. Lastly, and most importantly, I am personally troubled by his wiki-stalking tendencies. This is not healthy editor behavior.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 13:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As for Mardavich's "update", one man's spam is another man's email. As we the accused in the complaint, I find it extremely appropriate that Bignole brought this complaint to our attention. Mardavich perhaps thought he might be able to sneak this complaint by, as he didn't bother to notify the other people listed in the complaint - again, an example of Bad Faith and wiki-working the system. The fact that he is even able to offer an "update" clearly shows he is watching everyone's traffic instead of, y'know, <i>contributing to articles</i>. This person needs to leave Wikipedia for a nice long time. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 14:06, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My personal opinions of User:Mardavich have not been discussed in an open article Discussion page and only in other user talk pages as well as in official forums (although not in Mardavich's talk page). I think the guy <i>is</i> a pariah and an unethical, devious creep. His behavior utterly contradict Good Faith, Civility and No Personal Attacks. He is a wiki-stalker who only seems aware of these descriptors because he is following user edits and making comments where they appear. Kind of the definition of a wiki-stalker.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 13:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I thought it is worth noting that while Mardavich has been trying up the time of the editors who have been wroking on the 300 article, he has since helpted contribute to the article ending up like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;curid=2465797&amp;diff=114800092&amp;oldid=114799643" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;curid=2465797&amp;diff=114800092&amp;oldid=114799643" rel="nofollow">this</a> overnight.

<dd>If you don't mind, hang on for a second Heim. This is more complex than Mardavich is making it seem. I ran across this from looking at Alex's talk page last night and read through a lot of things, and it appeared to me that Mardavich has been harassing several editors on one particular article because he wants a particular viewpoint in the article. I read through one 3RR report that Mardavich filed that was laughable in how far from 3RR it actually was. He has been putting "warnings" and saying "I will have you banned" on several users talk pages. Arcayne asked Mardavich to stop leaving messages on his talk page; Mardavich refused. That doesn't excuse Arcayne's incivility, but it isn't as cut and dry as it appears. I'm still trying to sort everything out here. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 16:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I just discovered this new allegation by Mardavich (not putting the name of the person being accused appears to be a repetitive tactic of his, evidenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Inappropriate_user-page.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Inappropriate_user-page.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a> in an attack on User:ThuranX). I will admit to not being civil to Mardavich (although only in my and other user talk pages or in response to his endless tirade of complaints and accusations - never in an article or a Discussion Page, and not even on his own Talk page); the user tried to get me blocked for good faith edits and has tried to do the same with at least three other editors, filing spurious 3RR and AN/I complaints (again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Inappropriate_user-page.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Inappropriate_user-page.3F" rel="nofollow">this</a> one and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Personal_attack_report_by_User:Mardavich" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Personal_attack_report_by_User:Mardavich" rel="nofollow">this</a> one, He has also filed at least two 3RR reports, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Arcayne_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:Warning.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Arcayne_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:Warning.29" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Bignole__reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Bignole__reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:CovenantD_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:_24h.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:CovenantD_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:_24h.29" rel="nofollow">This</a> complaint's success probably rewarded him enough to think of it as a valid method of removing editors from the <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_%28film%29.html" title="300 (film)">300 (film)</a> article, as CovenantD has since left the article in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CovenantD" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CovenantD" rel="nofollow">disgust</a>. The uncivility referred to occurred between users on their own talk pages, all of whom had reason to not particularly like or appreciate Mardavich's special brand of working the system to block editors who disagreed with his edits in 300. I consider this user to be a wiki-stalker - how else would he happen to know the content of any of my conversations on other users' pages? Add to that the fact that I asked him no less than three times to never contact me, and I feel that my opinion of him is dead on, although it might not have been politic to come out and say it. Lastly, the mass revert he is referring to was to correct the massive vandalism and POV-pushing that had occurred overnight, as evidenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;oldid=114798789" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;oldid=114798789" rel="nofollow">this</a> version. The actual revert was done by <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamblinMonkey_6201.html" title="User:GamblinMonkey">User:GamblinMonkey</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114799643&amp;oldid=114799040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114799643&amp;oldid=114799040" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and mine took place moments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114800092&amp;oldid=114799643" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114800092&amp;oldid=114799643" rel="nofollow">later</a>. After that, i went back through all of the intervening edits and re-added every edit that was not outright vandalism or POV-pushing (citing in the edit summaries the origination contributor), including some edits by Mardavich himself. The current article reflects those changes by myself and many others who contribute positively to the article. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 16:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>I am concerned by what is going on here.</b></p>
<p>I have been checking the sources offered by the anonymous contributors, and it does seem to paint a pretty grim picture of what the NCLR actually is. Instead of honestly debating this, however, multiple administrators have both reverted and locked the page, user:Evrik stated that trying to get it locked was a "legitimate" method of trying to force someone to register (I was under the impression that registration on Wikipedia is not compulsory in any fashion), and the other side offers no citations of their own but attacks the messenger and sources without anything to back up their own attacks. This is not the way wikipedia is supposed to operate. I am going to paste this concern to WP:ANI in a moment.</p>
<p><b>My primary concern</b> is that administrators are locking the page, one administrator reverted the page before locking (which is a no-no and borderline abusive), and yet none who do this seem to be offering any response to the anonymous sources other than dismissive attacks upon the person of the anonymous contributors.</p>
<p><b>My secondary concern</b> is user:Evrik's statement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEvrik&amp;diff=113923535&amp;oldid=113896756" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEvrik&amp;diff=113923535&amp;oldid=113896756" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, "Excuse me, but asking for semi-protection is a way to <i>make whoever is forcing these changes to register</i> so it can be discussed."(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>I was unaware that it is ever required that we "force someone to register" in order to have a discussion, that seems very counterintuitive as talk pages are available to every contributor, registered or not.</p>
<p>I would appreciate some guidance on this matter; it seems Wikipedia is not a place for apologetic propaganda, and the existing article on NCLR (after spending some time investigating them and reading the sources provided, as well as hunting down my own sources) indicates that NCLR may be a duplicitous organization with a real position somewhere between what the current page is and what the anonymous contributors were offering. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 14:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bastique, I have no agenda, as you can clearly see from my history on the topic.</p>
<p>What I have a problem with is that you have now TWICE abused your powers to "win" at that page, locking it down to your preferred version in violation of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection_policy</a>. You then left me a threatening note telling me "Do not revert me again". You are passing the bounds of civility and I definitely have a problem with that: you appear to have an attitude problem and I do not feel safe editing at Wikipedia with you now obviously targeting me. I have filed a request for help as I cannot seem to figure out how to make the Request for Comment that you mentioned, but that too seems like a nasty abuse on your part, since I would have to get someone else to sign off on it and you appear to be working very hard to keep anyone else from being involved, especially since you completely locked down that page now.</p>
<p>I will note that, beyond twice reverting because I saw a problem with how people were doing things on that page, I have made no insertions with respect to content, and I have specifically stated each time that I am not doing that to endorse which version of the page I prefer. My issue is with how Wikipedia's processes are being abused, and certain editors are behaving in a less-than-fair manner. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 15:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest you quit trying to game the system. You've been reverted by none other than Danny Wool, an employee of the Foundation, once already. I reverted the page to the version protected by Kat Walsh, a board member. You can scream abuse and bloody murder all you want, but when all is said and done, you're doing nothing more than gaming the system into push some personal agenda on the page in question. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">Bastiq<span style="color:#EEA3D3;font-size:14pt">▼</span>e</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">demandez</a></sup> 15:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not trying to "game" anything, and I resent your continued threats and incivility. I don't know who "Danny Wool" is, nor do I know who "Kat Walsh" is, and I don't really care: edits should stand on their own merits, not based on who made them.</p>
<p>YOU, meanwhile, have twice reverted and then used your own tools to lock to your preferred version. That's a problem and a violation of the Protection Policy, and based on your continued incivil and rude comments, I am tempted to go straight to filing formal arbitration over this. I have done nothing to deserve your rude and incivil treatment, I was offering some friendly criticism because I thought that it would help, and I have not done anything or even been involved in any conflicts to this day. I have no "personal agenda" on the page, whatsoever, beyond wanting to see Wikipedia made into a better encyclopedia: you appear to be on the opposite side.</p>
<p>You have been rude, incivil, have misused your administrator powers. You have, in short, acted the jerk. I am asking you politely right now to stop doing it, or I will have no choice but to file a formal complaint with the one body that might do something about it. I refuse to operate under conditions where someone like you is just looking for an excuse to abuse people. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 15:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just took a glance at the edit history of the page. It's blazingly obvious to me that there's something out of kilter and that there is a need for protection of the page (reverting Danny??? not a good idea) until the differences can be sorted out by talking through them on the talk page. I see absoultely no sign of Bastique being involved in the content of the page, and to suggest otherwise may cause others to doubt your veracity. Also, I'm not sure there's a lot of merit in generally casting aspersions on Bastique the way you have been doing, <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a>, and I'd strongly advise you to reconsider your approach. What I see here is somewhat disruptive. AN/I threads are supposed to be succinct. Support page protection, support cautioning OEwotp on behaviour. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, again, who is this "Danny" and why does what he does matter more than anything another editor does? I do not see the point to this. Edits should stand on their own merits, not on who made them.</p>
<p>Second of all, the protection policy and policies on administrators specifically state that administrator powers should not be used to "win" a content dispute. If Bastique was going to revert, that's fine, but he should not also have protected it when there was no vandalism of the page, he should have let some other truly non-aligned administrator do the protecting. That is why I reverted it and why I left him a friendly note explaining why.</p>
<p>Where I start to see a real problem is that not only did Bastique threaten me twice - here and on my user page - he was very rude, and turned around and reverted it again, following by locking down the page completely so that nobody can edit it. This is not the action of a reasonable administrator, this is the action of someone who is using his own administrator powers to win a content dispute in violation of wikipedia policies. I am trying to remain calm and civil but it is very hard when I am faced with an administrator who refuses to be civil and thinks he has some right to insult, threaten, and berate users. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 17:07, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>No, I have not been very rude. I told you to get over yourself when you accused me of threatening. That's not "very rude." That was a reasonable response to your accusation of my threatening you.</li>
<li>I have not threatened you. I haven't threatened you once and I haven't threatened you twice. You are lying.</li>

<p>Reverting <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> is a bad idea because Danny works for the WMF and often tries to discreetly deal with issues that have been brought directly to the foundation's attention. Sometimes by large, angry lawyers. He's usually right about stuff, so when I see him reverted, it's a sign that the other person is usually wrong. Not always, but that's the way to bet. Reverting <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> is also a bad idea, because she's on the board of the WMF (second highest vote getter from the community in the recent board election) and often tries to discreetly deal with issues brought to the foundations attention. Sometimes by large, angry lawyers. That they both got involved in this article, to restore it to a particular place, is a sign that you're almost certainly seriously confused about something. I don't know what, no time to dig in, but it's the way to bet. Also, I've never seen Bastique lock content he was involved in a dispute in. Ever. I reviewed the edits and he's not, in my view, involved. I've not ever seen him berate users. He certainly didn't in this case, he gently warned you and then when you persisted in being unpleasant, warned you again. The charge that he's abusing powers is baseless. My advice to you: make your case for your changes on the talk page and drop this thread before you get yourself in deeper, because there's nothing that you really have anything to complain about. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bastique, from the moment I left you a helpful criticism, instead of following up on it, you have violated WP:CIVIL, you violated WP:NPA by calling me a liar (the Text Example of a Personal Attack from the policy page!) and you have continually left threatening comments to me only to claim that you are not threatening me later. This is duplicitous and not conduct becoming an administrator. Lar, I have tried to contact you to discuss it, but you have not responded, if you are on AIM or YIM, I will speak with you directly. I get the feeling you have not even bothered to read the case. I am not being spurious, I have been trying to get some help, because BAstique's threats and personal attacks are completely out of hand.

<dd>I suggest you stop threatening me, stop violating WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA constantly at me, and stop your abusive behavior. you trying to twist things around like this, openly calling me a liar and violating WP:NPA and then turning right around and claiming that I violated these, is completely ridiculous. You seem to be enjoying attacking me, and that's why I've filed this as well as sending an email to the mailing list about your abusive behavior.<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 18:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see anything wrong here. "Don't revert me" isn't a threat. Nor do I see any implication that Bastique would user admin powers in "retaliation", which is ludicrous. In fact the only incivility I see here is coming from One Elephant went out to play..., by accusing Bastique of "duplicitous" behavior, threats and other such things. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 18:07, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In addition, judging from One elephant's comments above the arbitrary section break, i.e. not knowing who Danny is, implies that One elephant is unfamiliar with wikipedia's policies, at least on some level. Therefore, it seems a bit ridiculous for someone who doesn't fully understand wikipedia policy to accuse a well respected administrator of violating these policies.<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 18:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Swat, yeah, I'm new here. I got a rude introduction to the policies when some idiot decided my name violated the username policy (though how a name referencing song lyrics violates policy, I have no idea) and I had to get THAT fixed. Thankfully, more of the admins here are like Mike Rosoft than are like this Bastique character, at least it seemed so back then. So I studied the policies. Nowhere in the policies did it say "AND IF YOU SEE DANNY DO SOMETHING, STAY AWAY" or "NOBODY CAN EVER CONTRADICT AN ADMIN." Trying to say that now is ridiculous, that's not how the policies say this is supposed to work.<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 18:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, actually it does, see <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>. "Danny Wool is a steward, elected administrator on the English Wikipedia, and a longtime Wikipedian. He is in charge of the Wikimedia Foundation Grants Committee and is one of three paid Foundation employees. Danny deals with some of the communication from dissatisfied organisations and people, and does his best to protect the interests of the Foundation in conjunction with Brad Patrick, legal counsel to the Foundation" "Please note that this is official policy, and reverting a WP:OFFICE may be grounds for blocking. I do not recommend that admins block for this, I'm just saying... don't revert a WP:OFFICE edit unless and until you've asked and know what you are doing. There may at times be legal reasons for this." As for your second part, nobody ever said you can't disagree with an administrator.

<dd>Swat, that is fine: I had not seen the WP:OFFICE page before, I might have missed it, there are so MANY pages. Regardless, it was not noted as a WP:OFFICE action, so how would I have known? Also, what I have done is reported when an administrator threatened me, and did something I thought and still do think violates the Page Protection Policy because administrators are not supposed to use their powers to "win" content disputes. It is not a violation of WP:CIVIL to report something like this, but Bastique has repeatedly violated WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA at me since, and yet the admins here are not doing anything about it, so I can only assume that I was right to fear when threatened by Bastique, because you won't enforce your own policies against his attacks. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Elephant_went_out_to_play..._cc4b.html" title="User:One Elephant went out to play...">One Elephant went out to play...</a> 19:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Elephant, I don't know the details of this dispute, but Bastique is a highly respected editor and admin, so it's worth making an extra effort to get along with him. Your edits to the article in question did seem extreme, and you were being reverted by very experienced Wikipedians. My advice to you is to let this go, because it's a misunderstanding that's spiralling out of control at this point. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, now I have been threatened once more. I am not "wikilawyering", it isn't even my original edit, I undid it because I saw what appeared to be a violation of policy.</p>
<p>But whatever, you have shown you admins don't care about policy or following the rules, I have been abused and false statements made about me, and you're just attacking me even more. Fine.

<dd>Irony. I post about my recent frustrations with WP, and that in itself becomes a wedge for a tendentious editor to attack me, leading to MORE frustrations with WP. I would like to thank all the other editors who responded here for supporting my right to put a simple, honest explanation up there while I figured things out, instead of just disappearing, which would've left others with no idea when/if I'd be helping them out ever again. I'll be editign some parts of it, but I'm still considering dropping this project entirely. That this is now being exploited by an editor who's already mentioned in a number of pro-iranian/pro-persian incidents around wikipedia is a problem.

<dd>Looking over your contribs and snipes at Golbez, it's more than a little difficult to take this complaint seriously. You insulted someone, they got upset, and this surprises you? It'd be a lot more productive if the two of you just <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">looked for a source</a>, and removed the content if such a source couldn't be found. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 21:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How in the world could golbez's actions here possibly be supported? I'll admit that I don't approve of substituting "common knowledge" for actual sources. However, it wasn't trolling. That was an outright false assertion. (Granted, it was somewhat uncivil, and not entirely helpful, but it was <b>not</b> trolling.) As such, he had no business blanking it from the talk page. That <b>is</b> vandalism. Removing material from an article's talk page simply because you don't like it is vandalism. If he disapproved, he could've simply said <i>why</i> right on the talk page as well.</dd>
<dd>As much as I disapprove of using templates (I find them too impersonal, and I prefer using my own words for things whenever possible), placing the vandalism template on his talk page was entirely acceptable.</dd>
<dd><i><b>Threatening a user for addressing vandalism is not in any way acceptable.</b></i> A freaking admin should know that by now. There's already more and more growing distrust of wikipedia admins; concerns of them abusing their powers. When 'normal' editors have concerns about an admin's actions, threatening to block them is hardly an appropriate response. That's childish <i>at best</i>, but really just downright abusive. And unbecoming of a position of respect.<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 22:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I'd like to make sure something's really clear here: Even <i>if</i> removing the notice from the talk page was valid, mislabelling it as "trolling" was not. And, far more importantly, even if you think it's obvious that such an action (deleting content, and mislabelling the reason) isn't vandalism, it's still true that he should've explained <i>why</i> it wasn't vandalism. Simply threatening to vindictively block can't possibly be considered appropriate. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 22:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Both</i> users were more confrontational than I can see was necessary, I'll agree with that much. I may not have a complete picture. In Golbez's case, getting somebody with a redlinked talk into an offended and defensive posture right off the bat may not be the best move, and in Dee Mac Con Uladh's case, we do need to educate new users quickly that trolling <i>isn't</i> the right way to win an argument. I do believe both of them meant well, but didn't handle the situation as well as they might have. That's my current take, anyway. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 23:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was not a threat. It was a natural consequence of his actions. He had not made a single civil comment to me, and I called him out on it. When I did so, he threatened me with blocking, and I simply showed him the futile hilarity of his statement. As for removing his note from the talk page? Ok, I'll claim fault for that, though I'm positive it did not exist to educate, but to troll me. But I do apologize for removing it, and did not revert him when he put it back. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 23:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's entirely true, and worth noting. You didn't revert when he put it back. And that's probably the saving grace.</dd>
<dd>However, there's somewhat of a domino effect there. You admit that you shouldn't have removed that section from the talk page. (It's incredibly mature to admit that-don't think that's lost on me) That means it <i>was</i> appropriate to address the action somehow. He(/she) chose to treat it as vandalism.</dd>
<dd>It isn't fair to simply say, "he threatened me with blocking". More accurately, he used a standard vandalism warning. If you disapprove of that, then you should probably fix the template. Otherwise, what are 'normal' editors supposed to do in the very few occasions when admins vandalize? Absolutely nothing? I don't think that's fair.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, saying that "It was not a threat", and following it by, "It was a natural consequence of his actions", specifically in response to the vandalism warning is, indeed, verifying that it was a threat. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 23:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're mixing the issues. He made what I saw to be an unsuitable edit; I removed it. He responded with an incivil message to me. I responded educating him in a vaguely sarcastic fashion on how to make quality edits and how to be civil. He responded with further incivility, and included it in an edit summary as well. When he also included it in his talk page post (accusing me of incivility of all things) that was when I removed it as trolling, which it was. He could have made a statement about the article without that. The initial threat of a block was due to his incivility and prior to him reverting me in either circumstance. This has nothing to do with the content dispute. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 00:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've received a report on IRC about someone vandalizing the globe image in the top-left corner of all pages. I don't think that this is possible, seeing as the image is locally stored on the server and hard-coded into MediaWiki's configs, but I figured I would put something here in case anyone sees it.

<dd>"Broken man" comes directly from <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Goltz_9922.html" title="Thomas Goltz">Thomas Goltz</a>, one of the most credible sources on the 20th century Caucasus. If you even bothered to participate constructively on the talk page, or read edit summaries, you would have known this, instead of blindly reverting. You continuously violate wikipedia's policy that third party sources and reliable sources be used. You keep trying to add information for an Azerbaijani nationalist website, which is unacceptable. Also, you continuously attempt to tarnish other users name by falsifying information, and in your process of edit warring you have broken the 1rr restriction that was put upon you.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, you are deleting paragraphs. Second, if Goltz said it, why don't you use that as a quote? 'Goltz described Rasulzade as a being a broken man at the time of his death in 1955" then source it. The two word phrase could've appeared anywhere in Goltz' work. source it, then use it.

<p>Over the past few months, significant problems have developed on a series of articles concerning disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Several editors, many from that region, have become involved in edit wars and feuding. Dmcdevit, who had been keeping an eye on these articles, ultimately filed an arbitration case, which was accepted and is pending. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Armenia-Azerbaijan_2091.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan</a> and its evidence and workshop pages.</p>
<p>ArbCom has enacted a temporary injunction putting all participants in the case on 1RR parole pending resolution of the case. Dmcdevit had been using this as a basis for trying to restore some order on these articles, and Thatcher131 had also been keeping an eye on things. However, right now both of them are on wikibreaks.</p>
<p>I am receiving talkpage notes pretty much daily from parties claiming that someone else has violated the injuction or otherwise misbehaved. There have also been personal attacks and misuses of personal information. See my talk for some of the flavor. As the only arbitration clerk active right now, I have my hands full keeping an eye on the case pages themselves, plus would prefer to be able to respond neutrally to the parties' procedural questions rather than be in an enforcement mode at this time.</p>
<p>If an uninvolved administrator would kindly roll up his or her sleeves and help out with this situation, I will be very grateful and so will the good-faith editors of these articles.

<dd>The solution is locking all those articles and forget about the 1RR.

<dd>Thanks for the reply.

<dd>One thing that might make the whole mess a <i>lot</i> easier on enforcement, if the arbitrators could be talked into passing it, is that any content revert made by any party must contain "revert" or "rv" in the edit summary. A lot of those articles are getting edited a hundred times a minute, and the revert edit summaries look a whole lot like the normal mudslinging in any of them. (P.S. That was my editor review, not the RFA, which is still open, but RFA tends to be editor review to the tenth power anyway.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 10:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Good God, now there's an edit war going on the arbitration page itself!

<dd>I'm not sure that it does. We were told that 1RR applies to Armenia - Azerbaijan related articles, and I did not know that it applies to our arbcom case as well. Recently a person got blocked for trying to add a party to the arbcom case, while others were trying to remove it. I think it would be really helpful if the admins explained the procedure for adding new parties rather than blocking. I filed a formal motion for adding new parties after I was explained the procedure. Could you please look again into <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">User:Atabek</a>'s block?

<dd>I share the frustration with editing of the Armenia-Azerbaijan pages, where it seems like harsh treatment awaits Azerbaijani editors, such as myself and user Atabek, yet the Armenian users such as user:Artaxiad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Artaxiad#Blocked" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Artaxiad#Blocked" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">user:Aivazovsky</a> constantly get away easily -- they either don't get blocked at all, or get blocked and immediately unblocked, or even tipped off by administrators to revert themselves in order to make them appear as if they didn't break the 1RR injunction.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrum375&amp;diff=114704690&amp;oldid=114657762" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrum375&amp;diff=114704690&amp;oldid=114657762" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Khoikhoi#Stop_Adil" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Khoikhoi#Stop_Adil" rel="nofollow">[93]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aivazovsky#Block" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aivazovsky#Block" rel="nofollow">[94]</a></dd>

<dd>That's your perception, it is just sad you think that way. Dmcdevit took a wikibreak reevaluating what he though of the community. Everything on Wikipedia doesn't revolve around the Armenian-Azeri issue as suprising as it might sound to you. If you really think that experienced administrators (in his case experience in arbitration) will bother checking what user is an Armenian and who is an Azeri before making a judgement on him/her then I am speachless. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Admins know what they do, I apologize for my mistakes, because I'm not 100% knowledgeable on the rules here, so I apologize and I do not want to get blocked so I try my best not to repeat my mistakes, when you guys get blocked, you report other users behavior while not talking about yours or even apologizing Adil you probably know what I'm saying when you called fadix a "fag" last time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan/Evidence&amp;diff=114071533&amp;oldid=114069980" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan/Evidence&amp;diff=114071533&amp;oldid=114069980" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>.

<dd>Your best bet is to post a complaint to the <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">3RR noticeboard</a> with a link to the parole and links to the two reverts within 24 hours that constitute a violation. Alternatively you can post to <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">arbitration enforcement</a>. I will watch there although I am on a semi-break. I certainly can't watch all the pages related to this dispute to find violations (well, I could but I won't). As for bias toward one side or the other, that's a laugh.

<p>My thoughts about the phrase. Unless it is a direct quote, "one of the greatest" phrases should not be placed in articles. If a reliable secondary source has stated, "...is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time," then the article can state that they are "widely considered one of the greatest players of all time," attributing the statement to the source. Looking at the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Maradona_6cd9.html" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> article, I'd say that the statement should read that he was voted as the best player of the century by fans on the FIFA website, not that he is "regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time." --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 16:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Regarding the Maradona article, this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diego_Maradona&amp;oldid=114526830" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diego_Maradona&amp;oldid=114526830" rel="nofollow">my last version</a>. It states <i>"In 2000 FIFA conducted an internet poll on the Player of the Century, with Maradona receiving 53.6% of the votes.[1] In 2006 Eric Cantona stated that Maradona was a superior player than Pelé.[2]"</i> rather than simply saying "one of the greatest". Acheivements should be listed, rather than claims. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubacca_3abb.html" title="User:Stubacca"><font color="green"><b>Stu</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubacca_abf2.html" title="User talk:Stubacca"><font color="green"><sup><i>’Bout ye!</i></sup></font></a> 16:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This debate is crazy. Anyone who's seen me play down at the leisure centre on a Friday night must surely realise that the claims of <i>any</i> of these players to be "the greatest" are at best spurious nonsensical fantasies. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 16:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> please AGF. The edits pointed out by Athænara above would make it appear you posted the cited oddity, however I do know you did no such thing. This edit history as it appeared to Athænara is as a result of the deletion of the sockpuppet's edit on the Project page from the database. With the edit record of the sockpuppet showing only two edits, I believe Athænara saw the edit history and your edit which was cited above, and drew a conclusion based upon the available facts. It's unusual for an edit history to disappear. While I do believe it is true to state you have abused the AfD process and are behaving more with incivility, it <i>is</i> <b>untrue</b> you made the edit accredited to the sockpuppet. I did point out this out below. Athænara may not have realized this before by examining the sockpuppet's edit history in the usual way, as the edit history was wiped, and nor was Athænara there when I tried to label the sockpuppet at the same time you were making PAs on Paulhorner, and there was an edit conflict, which means I know the sockpuppet’s initial violation was not yours. However, you did inappropriately restore that edit. That said, I am not going to make false accusations against you, but neither will I sit back and see you accused of something you did not do due to highly unusual circumstances, however it is unfair to assume bad faith by Athænara since the circumstances here <i>are</i> very unusual, and the normally available evidence can be highly misleading. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 12:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Orsini, you are right that I did not make that edit but simply restored it. The funny thing is that I well know who ChrisO, a known "anti-Scientologist", is but even so did not catch that there was reference to his real name in that post so I doubt there was much harmful potential in it. But I agree, better safe than sorry, and had I caught that was what it was about, rather than seeming nonsense, I would not have restored it. If nonsense were grounds for removal of posts then I can think of any number which would disappear; perhaps even the bulk of talk page "discussion" (cynical joke). As to Athænara's trollish "diagnosis", my assessment stands, as does my question. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 12:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How many other pages use OWW as a source? beginning to wonder if it's benefits are outweighed by JB's tendency to use it as a spam target.

<dd>Well there's a broader debate there, namely whether a wrestling fansite is a credible, reliable source for an encyclopedia in the first place. Simply having a domain name and being reasonably well known doesn't change the fact it's not really any different to a geocities or tripod site in terms of reliability. He's been using open proxies for a while now, but I post them all for checking on the open proxies Wikiproject for checking and blocking. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 22:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I am reporting <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi great</a> for his abuse of power as an administrator. It all started on a Vote in regards to the Category:Tamil_Americans <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_9#Category:Tamil_Americans" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_9#Category:Tamil_Americans" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p><a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> has been a trouble maker for some time now pushing his POV on wikipedia.

Sadly, these user accounts have another administrator <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> who backs them up biasedly. When I reported them, instead of <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> dealing with the issue like a responsible administrator, he started picking on me about images I have posted on my page in which I have respectfully replied him and took care of the issue. In the end, nothing was resolved, and <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> did not do a thing about my report. I have placed a report on <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> in the past for his abuse this favoritism towards certain users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive202#Report_on_Admin_Blnguyen" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive202#Report_on_Admin_Blnguyen" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>It seems that there are a group of editors with the backing of a couple of administrators who are working together in regards to POV pushing using Wikipedia as their propoganda tool. I am being ganged up on by these particular editors for opposing their POV. This is really uncalled for and un-democratic with all this bias and bullying going on by certain administrators. I respectfully request for this matter to be looked into and my name be taken off those sockpuppet templates posted by <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi great</a>.

<dd>I'm not quite sure I see what the problem is. At the very least, Aksi great should file a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">request for checkuser</a> if he suspects sockpuppetry, but I can't really see where anyone did anything wrong.

<dd>In regards to <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a>, he has also been engaged in a lot of incivility and trolling towards other users. Not to mention intollerance of other people's ethnic and religious backgrounds. As far as his name is concerned, that wasn't the issue with me unlike the others. Sorry to put all this in for you to read, but there are a group of biased editors backed by similar administrators who are just basically ganging up on me since ARYAN818 was blocked. Also, all of this is due to me disagreeing with their POV and voicing it. But, apart from all that commotion, <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi great</a> should not jump the gun and just slap my name on a sockpuppet template without proper confirmation. Don't you think that is a little irrational on his part as an administrator? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 00:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>What?</i> As admins are routinely assailed by baseless allegations from paranoid editors like Wiki Raja, I find it necessary to have a sense of humor. Wiki Raja's paranoia is self-evident when he sees a "group with eyes everywhere" after (a) he himself makes an ANI report, which almost everyone on WP can and prolly will see and (b) it was necessary to let Aksi great know about this discussion. There is nothing "totally unacceptable" about my response - the statement only rebuffs Wiki Raja's paranoia and I don't accuse him of anything but paranoia. "Patience" and "Modesty" are not ways to deal with paranoia.

<dd>Well, let's see. This person filed or participated in about three groundless complaints against me and user Khoikhoi in the past two days, and filed this one after being told that it constituted disruption <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANick&amp;diff=114790835&amp;oldid=114788330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANick&amp;diff=114790835&amp;oldid=114788330" rel="nofollow">[113]</a>.</dd>
<dd>All the articles he claims I intervened in are ones I contributed to substantially, and in virtually all I have contributed first or among the first. Checking his edit history will in fact reveal that most his contributions are removing things from texts I authored (breaking several wikipedia rules in the process). In fact, this dispute began because of his "revision" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;diff=114490562&amp;oldid=114354212" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;diff=114490562&amp;oldid=114354212" rel="nofollow">here</a> (the massive removal of sourced information he disagrees with qualifies under simple vandalism). Note his justifications in erasing content: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AValter_Roman&amp;diff=114774665&amp;oldid=114774168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AValter_Roman&amp;diff=114774665&amp;oldid=114774168" rel="nofollow">"I willingly eliminated only some vague remarks, that I found boring"; "no place for stalinist POV pushing here"</a>.</dd>
<dd>This person claims, ad nauseam, that I have broken the policy defined under <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a>.</dd>
<dd>Let him or her read the policy and tell me <i>which</i> point of it I have broken and <i>where</i>. Because, as he well knows by now, neither making constructive edits in articles that I contributed to before he did, nor checking out his edit history constitute stalking. In fact, as proof that this person is manipulating information, his at least one of the diffs he provided above proves that he follows <i>my</i> edit history (and his past trolling on my talk page shows that he has/had my talk page on <i>his</i> watchlist as well). To my mind, this person is mudslinging me, making many repetitive and fast-pace accusations that he cannot possibly prove, and that he knows to be untrue, in the hope that I will get too tired to answer them. It is exhausting, and, as all things this person has done ever since coming to wikipedia in the first place, <i>highly disruptive</i>. It goes hand in hand with his repeated trolling, for which he was already blocked once.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, this person claims that the user he associated with in a previous complaint, who was revealed to be a sockpuppet of banned <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a> (verified by checkuser), was eliminated by Khoikhoi after the latter conspired with me etc. When he was told by other admins and editors not to disrupt any further, when several editors pointed out that his edits in articles were reducing the quality of the project (by removing biographical data, balnking sources, and manipulating sheer facts according to his POV), he came here and reopened the same flimsy "case" against me (ironically, under the same header chosen by Bonaparte's sockpuppet). As I was posting here, he attempted to begin separate inflammatory threads on two separate pages (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115053127" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115053127" rel="nofollow">[114]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=115056168&amp;oldid=114977635" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=115056168&amp;oldid=114977635" rel="nofollow">[115]</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 11:52, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, not to help this poor excuse for a debate degenerate further, but:
<ul>
<li>one would have to ask about factual rule-breaking, not about what and why the same group of users like to discuss about me, especially when that group is the same one alleging stuff about me on the wikiquette page, and the same group urged on by manifestos such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIcar&amp;diff=109564162&amp;oldid=98582417" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIcar&amp;diff=109564162&amp;oldid=98582417" rel="nofollow">[127]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdrianTM&amp;diff=109627082&amp;oldid=109570614" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdrianTM&amp;diff=109627082&amp;oldid=109570614" rel="nofollow">[128]</a> (manifestos which have led to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVintila_Barbu&amp;diff=111255582&amp;oldid=110438847" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVintila_Barbu&amp;diff=111255582&amp;oldid=110438847" rel="nofollow">a warning for stalking</a>). Three of the "third-party users" invoked here have actually been involved in <i>every single groundless initiative against me</i> (at least one of those manifestos calls for me be singled out and marginalized on wikipedia through a collective effort).

<p>I am going to briefly provide the context for my request, since the matter is complicated, and <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> is bound to attempt to put her own spin on it. There are two editors, <a href="../../../d/k/i/User%7EDking_3156.html" title="User:Dking">User:Dking</a> and <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">User:Cberlet</a>, who in my view have been consistently editing against policy by attempting to dominate the content of a number of articles in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, by excessive self-citing in violation of <a href="../../../c/o/i/COI_4bd0.html" title="COI">COI</a>, and a pattern of personal attacks. There are also <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues involved, since these two are published authors who specialize in "attack articles" on living persons. This is presently before the ArbCom and I am not asking for intervention on this particular problem.</p>
<p>However, SlimVirgin has been acting as a partisan on behalf of these two, bullying and threatening anyone who disputes their edits. I won't list the entire history of these incidents, only the most recent. On March 11 I posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=114321182&amp;oldid=114147572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=114321182&amp;oldid=114147572" rel="nofollow">four questions on the talk page</a> of "Political views of Lyndon LaRouche," asking SlimVirgin to explain her positions. I found her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114322367" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114322367" rel="nofollow">answers</a> to be evasive, particularly when she accused me of "promoting LaRouche," and I asked for clarification <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114322460" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114322460" rel="nofollow">here</a>. She refused to respond, and archived the page to hide the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114519401" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114519401" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a>. I restored the page, asking her to please edit in a collegial manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114519401" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114519401" rel="nofollow">(diff.)</a> Her response was to threaten to ban me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tsunami_Butler&amp;diff=114744257&amp;oldid=114193297" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tsunami_Butler&amp;diff=114744257&amp;oldid=114193297" rel="nofollow">(diff,)</a> saying that I was "causing disruption."

<p>I must confess that I find it difficult to believe that SlimVirgin simply had the urge to archive the talk page at the point where I was attempting, with no cooperation from her, to ascertain her reasons for some of her actions. She deleted material that was sourced to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Information_Research_b1d1.html" title="Public Information Research">Public Information Research</a>, but was vague about her rationale. I asked her three times to explain: the first time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=112930922&amp;oldid=112929349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=112930922&amp;oldid=112929349" rel="nofollow">diff, question #2</a> she evaded the question.

<dd>Tsunami was responding to the accusation by SlimVirgin that she was "promoting LaRouche," clearly setting up the pretext for a ban. An editor who leaves such an accusation unchallenged, does so at his peril. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanDW_d5ae.html" title="User:NathanDW">NathanDW</a> 02:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia has a history of editors (or perhaps just one editor with many accounts) promoting LaRouche. We've even seen accounts that claim to have no special interest in that cause turn out to be single purpose accounts devoted to it. In this instance the charge that Tsunami Butler is an account dedicated to promoting LaRouche is borne out by the evidence. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 02:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Wikipedia has numerous well-reasoned policies that are designed to make it useful and credible as an information source, beginning with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. There are also policies that are intended to prevent abuse, such as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. From what I have seen, however, there is a peculiar state of affairs where articles pertaining to Lyndon LaRouche are exempt from all these policies. There seems to be some sort of special license to self-cite that has been given to Chip Berlet in his guise of Cberlet, and seems to have now been extended to Dennis King as Dking. The idea that "Wikipedia is not a soapbox" goes out the window here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> is also inapplicable, it seems. I have reviewed some of the history of these articles, which is voluminous, and a pattern appears: whenever an editor comes along and says, "Hey, there seem to be policy violations here," there is a Rapid Response Team of SlimVirgin and Will Beback that immediately brands that editor a LaRouche supporter, and the threats and harassment commence, until the dissenting editor gives up or is banned. This can happen to editors with the best of neutral credentials -- take a look at how <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">User:Pascal.Tesson</a> was treated at <a href="../../../l/y/n/Talk%7ELyndon_LaRouche_archive13_85a5.html#On_conflicts_of_interest" title="Talk:Lyndon LaRouche/archive13">Talk:Lyndon_LaRouche/archive13#On_conflicts_of_interest</a>. I have tried to raise these issues responsibly and appropriately through the various noticeboards, and for my trouble, I am accused of "promoting LaRouche" and judging from what I have seen, SlimVirgin will soon contrive an excuse to ban me, and Will Beback will applaud the action. --<a href="../../../t/s/u/User%7ETsunami_Butler_ee9c.html" title="User:Tsunami Butler">Tsunami Butler</a> 14:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I never met BhaiSaab, but I do know His_excellency. He's probably the worst personal attacker ever allowed to edit Wikipedia, and has attacked nearly every ethnic and religious group on earth at one point or another. I say <b>allowed</b> because he's already been indefinitely banned twice by Tom Harrison and Jeffrey O. Gustafson, then blocked for a year by Tawker, but each time was unblocked by Bishonen or by someone she'd asked to unblock him.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:His_excellency" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:His_excellency" rel="nofollow">[140]</a> Then Bishonen helped him in his arbitration case. For this, some arbitrators wanted to "commend" her. His_excellency was supposed to be banned for a year, but some arbitrators said this was too long, so made it only four months. He got another two months for making more attacks on Jews during the case. Since his ban, he's returned with a bunch of sock puppets to attack Hindus as "cow-worshipers" and "dung-eaters," and now I guess to stalk people and harass them. I wonder if the people who helped him stay around are still proud of what they did. His_excellency should <b>definitely</b> be banned indefinitely.HEWatch 19:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I have been trying to react by deleting offensive contributions, instead of reacting offensively and disruptively myself. Taalo has now reverted even these edits, starting a kind of edit war even on a talk page. I would just like to have a productive discussion, but I cannot continue this way.

<li>enough for what? look, maybe be concerned with your own communication and politeness. It isn't so black-and-white like you try to make it, that you are the good guy and I'm the bad guy. Could it be even slightly possible that since you are not a native English speaker, that you may take things like <i>"hey ladin dude"</i> as offensive, when they are actually friendly? Could it be a bit possible that you are instigating edit wars by doing things which are against wikipedia policies? Taalo 23:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>There are circumstances where anything but addressing one by proper name (or user name, respectively) can be felt as an offense. Obviously Emes didn't like it <i>("This was a personal attack")</i>. I woudln't like to be called even <i>friend</i> by you either, and you should know that. So, I think, it is now up to <i>you</i> to remove these edits, I won't anymore. -- <a href="../../../p/h/j/User%7EPhJ_8c2f.html" title="User:PhJ">PhJ</a> 06:16, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>ohkayyyy o_O Listen, the bottom line is that you can't go around and censor other's edits, full stop. Try and muster an apology for doing that if you can.

<p>I think that there are obviously a ton of problems relating to this issue, and because of that both of you (and everyone else involved) needs to be extra careful to not to do anything which could be interpreted as a personal attack, even if it was not meant to be one, and to follow all of the appropriate policies and guidelines. Blanking talk pages or selectively filtering them is not acceptable under any circumstances barring extreme and obvious cases. —<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 20:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Mets501 here. Both PhJ and Taalo have been incorrect, and I don't feel this needs to be elevated so high. Taalo needs to calm down and not take things so personally (and take care in the words he uses), however, PhJ has chosen to blatanly violate wiki rules while in the same breath attempt to report Taalo on the admin boards. PhJ blanked out comments on a talk page that he disagreed with (and were not necessarily a personal attack). Mets501 has stated this well, gentlemen. Both of you need to be careful with what you say or do so that it is not construed as a personal attack. PhJ - you need to understand that you clearly violate wiki policy by removing someone else's words from a talk page that you, yourself, deem inappropriate without the actions of an admin. This can be construed as vandalism or otherwise. So next time you disagree, state it on the talk page, attempt to communicate offline with Taalo (or on his talk page), or get the attention of an admin BEFORE you attempt to remove comments and violate wiki rules yourself. And for God's sake, Taalo - calm down and let this process breathe and we'll reach a more neutral and viable solution for all!&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 17:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oi, why am only I being asked to calm down? &#160;:P I'm quite calm actually, however I can't just be quiet when my posts are deleted/edited/moved and I'm being declared <i>problematic</i> or <i>anti-German</i>. o_O This week I: reverted PhJ's edits, said <i>hey ladin dude</i> to Martin, and reverted PhJ's "editing" of Bolzano talk. Bad Taalo, bad!&#160;:} Anyway, yes, please.. neutral/fair solution. All I've wanted from the beginning. later... Taalo 22:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Agreed. Looking back at my message to Emes last Fall, I feel quite bad I stated things in such a way (that he should seek a mental professional). At the time I was just amazed how much anger he was displaying (beyond his threat to leave en.wikipedia). But, I'm being censored because I say "By (sic) God"? Are there rules against <i>blasphemy</i>, as PhJ puts it? o_O Regardless, the selective filtering he is doing is completely out of line and really makes this feel like some sort of war. Doing something like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABolzano&amp;diff=114756861&amp;oldid=114698418" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABolzano&amp;diff=114756861&amp;oldid=114698418" rel="nofollow">[154]</a> is like a wiki-censorship service?&#160;:-) Taalo 21:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have to agree that User:Taalo's behaviour is quite problematic and the tone does not comply with Wikiquette or anything else for that matter. Users who are not the same opinion are accused of POVs, being "German" or whatever, every opposing comment gets inundated with a flood of comments that anyone reading this looses interest sooner or later. At the moment the user seems quite interested in pushing through a strange latter-day Italo-nationalism on issues concerning <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South Tyrol</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merano.html" title="Merano">Merano</a>, etc. Quite unfortunate IMO. My comments to this user's behaviour will probably provoke another flood of comments from User:Taalo, something that is to be expected. Wikiquette alerts have been registered previously, so far to no avail. I can only hope this user will mature and respect other opinions some day. sincerely <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 15:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Laughable. You are by no means impartial in this debate, and popping your head into this particular discussion is something I find quite reprehensible. It was <u>you</u> who initiated this whole argument by forcing some strange latter-day nationalist push for names which are not even common English usage. You moved a page unilaterally and without consensus. A poll was done <i>after the fact</i> and no consensus was found to move the page back to the common English usage, so it got stuck with your odd POV for all this time. This was flat out wrong, and you know it (and should know it as an Admin). What really gets me is you do this and never apologize or feel you did anything at all wrong (even though this debate now of almost two years clearly shows you initiated something very wrong, that has in the end hurt many feelings). You have user PhJ here who also breaks protocol by going through and selectively editing out user comments. Instead of either of you taking any responsibility what-so-ever for both of your actions, you make personal attacks on me: the one who called you both out incidentally. hmm. So where is the maturity? Where is the respect? At least I have the courage to make apologies when I find I did something wrong. I have both Italian and German heritage, and have roots in this region back to Roman times. I've only wanted a fair solution, it is you who push some strange German POV. Being I AM German, I have every right to self-criticize and I will certainly not have someone such as you telling me what to do. I have been quite saddened at the German group-think, and I have every right to be! Now, as I've told PhJ, I've really had my fill of you all. As far as I'm concerned, that neither of you have the capability to see anything wrong in what you do, and simply try to make this so black and white that I'm bad and you guys are good, just accents this giant waste of time. But you know what, my field is Engineering, from your user page I see yours is Politics. So, please, just go along your own way. Taalo 17:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Lastly. This discussion was about reverting edits on Bolzano's talk page. Edits which were against Wikipedia policy by selectively editing out other editor's sentences. A mature approach might be for both PhJ and Gryffindor to stick to this topic, without trying to divert this into a referendum against me (i.e. take responsibility for your own actions).

<p>66.93.144.171 has publicly accused me of <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalking</a> several times over the last few days. Cyberstalking is a serious ethical and criminal matter, and I can assure everyone I do not do it. This user first made this accusation in response to a single comment I made about one of his/her edits (in fact, my first post ever directed towards this person). That initial accusation is here (note the part where I am called a "known cyberstalker"): [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMake_Love%2C_Not_Warcraft&amp;diff=113910925&amp;oldid=113790042|Here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMake_Love%2C_Not_Warcraft&amp;diff=113910925&amp;oldid=113790042|Here" rel="nofollow">[155]</a>]</p>
<p>This user then accused me of cyberstalking here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive212#User:SkipSmith" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive212#User:SkipSmith" rel="nofollow">[156]</a>] . Note that despite the policy that users should be notified if someone has made an accusation against them, I was not notified about the post about me in the incident archive --- I only found out about this accusation because another user emailed me.</p>
<p>In response to this accusation I voiced my concerns that this user seems to have a history of violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive213#User_66.93.144.171" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive213#User_66.93.144.171" rel="nofollow">[157]</a>]. Note at the bottom of this post 66.93.144.171 again accuses me of cyberstalking.</p>
<p>Finally, I just found out today that 66.93.144.171 has shifted to making accusations of cyberstalking on <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee's</a> talk page, again without notifying me of the accusation. That accusation is here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jreferee#User:_SkipSmith" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jreferee#User:_SkipSmith" rel="nofollow">[158]</a>]</p>
<p>To summarize, 66.93.144.171 is making unfounded and serious accusations against me, and appears to be deliberately hiding these accusations from me to deny me the chance to set the record straight. This appears to be a concerted effort to sully my name in revenge for disagreement over a single edit, and I believe it violates <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, at least.</p>

<dd>Ugh. Hey Avi, long time no talk --- thanks for checking this out for me. Now, on to the sparring: the best way to settle your sockpuppetry and stalking accusations would have been to do a CheckUser, which would have revealed that I didn't do anything wrong. For some reason this was never done, and I've still got these accusations hanging over my head because nobody could be bothered to investigate a sock puppet case correctly. As far as the non-wiki stuff you brought up, I was banned from the Outpost because I protested the treatment of Abducens (who by the way, was ultimately reinstated, but refused to return). I never had anything to do with the protest site --- again, a CheckUser several months ago would have cleared that up. On second thought, maybe it's good that nobody did a CheckUser on me --- I wouldn't want to get a fax at work ... <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 05:58, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After looking at the edits brought, I agree that your initial comment telling him not to hyperventilate was not the worst edit, and should have been laughed off. However, you <i>do</i> play into his hands by commenting under every one of his edits. There are, at best, a minor lacking of good faith on all sides here. I would suggest you let sleeping dogs lie, and ignore this issue. Likely it will die down. If it does not, there is always <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>, but a little time may be all that is needed.

<dd>Avi, there is something you need to understand. I did not leave the comment I did based solely on his edit. This user has cyberstalked me for years over various websites. He came to that article simply because I mentioned it in my blog. I did not file my complaint because of the content of his comment, but because of WHO he was. If claiming that he is cyberstalking me is such a painful lack of civility, then this user only needs to finally learn how to do one thing: LEAVE ME ALONE. - 66.93.144.171 18:40, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Avi. Yeah, I was debating whether to kid around with my edit on that page because I didn't want to offend anyone, but I had no idea it would set someone off like that. I remember how upset you were when you misunderstood me and thought I was accusing you of harassment [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/SkipSmith|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/SkipSmith|here" rel="nofollow">[159]</a>], so you can imagine how I felt when this person unfairly accused me of cyberstalking. However, it appears that nobody is taking this person's accusations seriously, and as long as he/she doesn't make a habit of libel, I'm willing to forgive and forget. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 06:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wasn't there a way to set one's display preferences? I feel like there used to be some default date format that would get parsed into the user's preferred way of viewing them.

<dd>Pete, you're right, but Canada isn't much of an excuse for changing formats since they apparently accept both US and UK styles, see our article on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_date.html" title="Calendar date">Calendar date</a>. Since E8 was born in England, and is generally most famous for his influence on the UK, I'd say UK format is appropriate. Selket, you're not mistaken, see <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html#prefsection-4" title="Special:Preferences">Special:Preferences#prefsection-4</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> is a great article for trying it out, since it uses every legal and several illegal formats.

<dd>The date preferences thing is great (though implementing it through wikilinks is a little tacky) but the big problem is that this only works for registered users (i.e. editors) and most of our readers don't have accounts, so therefore see the "raw" formats. Seeing American dates in an article about a British king is as jarring as seeing International dates used in (say) an article about President Kennedy. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 00:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could somebody please take a look at what they think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AStreet_Scholar&amp;diff=115131046&amp;oldid=105331795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AStreet_Scholar&amp;diff=115131046&amp;oldid=105331795" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>. I'm one of those that has reverted the person trolling his userpage. I even gave the IP a stern warning and ended up reporting it at AIV where it was blocked for three months. Sufficed to say though, I find the comments of Street Scholar himself (once more!) seriously offensive.</p>
<p>Perhaps he should be told (yet again!) that his own personal belief system and values are not an excuse for his poor behaviour on wikipedia. Alternatively, because it is a case of "yet again", perhaps something else may be in order? <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 20:53, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, there are many problems. First, the user <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> has been deleting images from the Evanescence articles, because according to him the use of album cover images violates thes Fair use criteria. This is totally fake, and it can be proved. <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwish.html" title="Nightwish">Nightwish</a> have images of album covers, and these articles are Featured articles. If the use use of album cover images is forbidden, then these articles would never have passed the FA. Now, he is also contradicting himself, because he has also deleted an logo ([[:Image:Evanescence early.png, an earlier logo of the band). Logo are not album covers, so...? He has deleted it with no reasons. The only thing he said was that the use of the images hasn't been discussed. What's that??</p>
<p>Some edits he made (deleting images):</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Another problem is that he has nominated an free-use image created by me, <a href="../../../e/v/-/Image%7EEV-In.svg_4e0a.html" title="Image:EV-In.svg">Image:EV-In.svg</a>, with a very vague reason. He says this is a derivated work of the Evanescence logo. It would be a derivated logo if I would have copied the Evanescence logo and added something like some lines or whatever. Here's the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2007_March_12_38ac.html#Image:EV-In.svg" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 12">discussion</a>, but it's going nowhere.</p>
<p>And the last thing, he has tagged the Image:Evlithium1.jpg for deletion. This is a fair-use image, but many of the contributors in the Evanescence articles including me, reached a consensus. (<a href="../../../e/v/a/Talk%7EEvanescence_Archive_2_cc87.html" title="Talk:Evanescence/Archive 2">this</a>.</p>
<p>Also the fair use rationable stated the reasons why we are using a fair-use image by now.</p>
<div style="font-size:85%">No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. While Evanescence is a very popular band and would probably be easier to get user-created pictures of than most, the fact remains that in general it's incredibly difficult to get good free use images of bands. The reasons are two-fold: the majority of user-contributed images are going to be from 1) dark concerts with bad lighting, where the band is spread across the stage and difficult to see, or 2) individual members posing with a fan. Highly unlikely that a decent picture of <i>just the band</i> outside of a concert setting could be found. (Check the fair use rationable for more reasons).</div>
<p>You should also check this <a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html#Evanescence_main_article" title="User talk:Armando12">discussion</a>.</p>
<p>I really don't understand his reasons. I can even compare the fair use rationable of the main image of Nirvana (FA) with the rationable of the Evanescence (GA) rationable. The Evanescence images is very very very detailed.</p>
<p>Well, I hope these problems end and we can continue our Wikipedian lives normally... <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmando12_bd10.html" title="User:Armando12"><font color="#276394">Armando.O</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmando12_6440.html" title="User talk:Armando12"><font color="#2C518F">talk</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/v/_/WP%7EEV_8e07.html" title="WP:EV"><font color="#2C518F">Ev</font></a></sup> 00:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's hard for the rest of the community to evaluate a ban since we don't have access to the checkuser information.

<dd>Gnetwerker spent several months harassing <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> after they got into a content dispute that went to mediation and the ArbCom in January 2006. The harassment consisted of posting ID's personal details; creating sockpuppets to post complaints about ID on AN/I; and inventing user names that mimicked ID. After several months of putting up with it, ID asked me for help, at which point Gnetwerker turned on me too, and has since posted what he thinks are my personal details several times, which he's copied from an attack site.</dd>

<dd>After many warnings stretching over almost a year, he was blocked indefinitely in December 2006 for posting personal details. I e-mailed several ArbCom members about the situation a few weeks before the block, and I understand the entire ArbCom was alerted to the proposed block just before it happened. Since then, he has written to everyone he can think of to try to get them to kick up a fuss on his behalf, including at least one bureaucrat (trying to get a name change), and an appeal to the ArbCom, which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=102298816#Gnetwerker_indef_block" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=102298816#Gnetwerker_indef_block" rel="nofollow">turned down</a>.</dd>

<dd>To mildly counteract the echo-chamber effect, let me add this: the events that SlimVirgin describe happened in July 2006, whereas the block (which amounts to a non-community-sanctioned ban) did not occur until December. I don't think it was the case that it took her and Jayjg five months to weigh the evidence. Something occurred -- even I'm not certain what -- that they ascribe to me, and I got blocked in the crossfire. I am sure that if there was evidence it would be presented. There is no record of a checkuser connecting me with any account past the one incident in July, which I explained to everyone involved. In reference to the ArbCom case, there were more votes to hear it than not, but a failure to hear an unblock case does not make a community ban (its final state can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=102313083&amp;oldid=102298816" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=102313083&amp;oldid=102298816" rel="nofollow">here</a>). <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> states that <i>"indefinite blocks of established users are always controversial"</i>.

Finally, let me post a question. My reading of <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, in distinction to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a>, is that <i>accounts</i> are blocked, and if one is indef-blocked, in the absence of a community ban of the <i>user</i> in quetion, he or she is free to create another account and edit, provided of course, that the behavior that caused the block is not repeated. Is this a correct reading? -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 15:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I suspect you are at present community banned by the old definition, which is that of a thousand admins not one can be found who is willing to unblock you. And, as Slim suggests, you could simply open a new account and start editing quietly; if you'd behave, no one would know it was you. But per Slim's explanation and yours, let me ask simply - <b>are there objections to a "formal" community ban?</b> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The "no other admin will unblock" rule seems to fail to take into account the power of the blocking admins. I have had more than one admin say privately I shouldn't have been indef'd, but that they can't take action because it would put them on the wrong side of two very powerful people. But let me repeat: block me, ban me -- that is up to the community here, no problem.

<dd>This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are a ton of very mysterious "new" users editing China/Taiwan pages lately that immediately make either very POV or very obscure edits. Takes these for example: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quitepick_ec0a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quitepick">Special:Contributions/Quitepick</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trendsure_6f1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trendsure">Special:Contributions/Trendsure</a>. Two users with names that are 5letter/4letter random word combos. The first four contributions of each two are the same edits made to two different articles. If those aren't socks of existing users I'll eat some clothing. And of those, there are a few more. I'm betting on finding some edit/move wars on sprotected pages soon.</dd>
<dd>In this specific instance though, I find it hilarious that Secrecy follows Privacy to vote pages and comments on the three users who showed up after Instantnoods disappearance. Secrecy obviously isn't Huaiwei. I've never seen Huaiwei run sockpuppets and he is never afraid to play the revert games with those he suspects of being sockpuppets using his own account. He's also not banned from editing any of the articles Secrecy reverted (I don't think) as the OP suggests. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 21:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at the claim "Secrecy seems to be actively trying to disrupt Instantnood's Sandbox." And, well, Instantnood's sandbox needs disrupting. He's storing a bunch of his classic POV forks and they show up in Google searches.

<dd>I may be speculating, but I cant help but wonder if there is a possibility of users creating sockpuppets, using these to revert one's own edit or POV, and then subsequently pinning the blame squarely on the other party, particularly when charges of sockpuppetry are pressed on them. Of course, the same scenario may be applied by me as well, but whatever the case, I hope investigations will be thorough, transparent, and not based purely on subjectivity and assumptions.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 09:28, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm not going to speculate as to who might be whose sockpuppet, though it's hard not to suspect various sorts of co-ordinated editing, at the least, and what are close -- or in a couple of cases, right in the middle of -- being SPA accounts (whether socks or fresh recruits to 'the cause'). There's a legimate content issue in here somewhere (how to refer to, and whether to categorise by, the entity-that-used-to-be-the-PRC-pre-1997, now somewhat inexactly and less than formally refered to as "mainland China"), but there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut consensus on it at present, and very clearly there's no willingness to "leave well enough alone" on either side, much less to achieve even pro temps consistency either way. As less than ideal as the heavy-handed resolution of the "highways" issue was, I'm beginning to think that something similar might be required here. Preferably not "policy by narrow majority vote", but at least a solution to be adopted <i>pending</i> definitive resolution, and some fairly zealous enforcement of the "cease fire line", whatever that turns out to be. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 03:54, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

So far the votes are exactly split between leaving things alone, and applying "China" as the common name of the PRC. Ironically, many of those who want to leave things alone think it will be less edit-warring. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 11:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Of course their judgement will be effected, they probably live in the country were this fight is happening, just as I do, albeit they live in the safe and army protected area --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddleEastern_be86.html" title="User:MiddleEastern">MiddleEastern</a> 14:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MiddleEastern, you are not being persecuted for your ethnicity or beliefs. You ARE being criticized for being disruptive. You have made offensive statements and allegations at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_MiddleEastern_eb0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/MiddleEastern">your RfA</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EMiddleEastern_United_States_a460.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:MiddleEastern/United States">the MfD for your subpage</a>, and in this very thread, just for starters. You on track for a community ban in short order if your attitude does not improve. Editing Wikipedia is a privilage that can be revoked, not an inalienable right. The diff that you point out at the beginning of this thread is misleading because you removed quite a bit of content from the article and made no reference to that in your edit summary. And one more thing: even though it is completely irrelevant to the matter at hand, I am not a "Jewish editor". <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 15:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
