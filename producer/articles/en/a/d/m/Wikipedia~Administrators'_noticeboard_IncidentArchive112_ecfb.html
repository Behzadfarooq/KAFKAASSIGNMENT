<p>81, You're also responding to me and acting politely, so you can't be him. Sorry. Sorry. And damn; jumping the gun when my credibility is a vital issue! Here's my side of things. What I said earlier stands, except for the striked-through part - <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User:74.136.222.198">74.136.222.198</a> has repeatedly edited the page to force his will through. He's answering no attempts at dialogue and accepting no version but his; communications from him have been limited to "Read this and become familiar with it <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>" and "ricidulous". He's snide and insulting in his few talk page messages and edit summaries. He's not elaborating on his problems beyond saying that what he doesn't agree with is nonsense, and has made no acknowledgement of the sources I've provided. There is no original research in the article, at least not by me or in the parts he's attacking and I'm defending. I gave an elaborate summary <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User talk:74.136.222.198">on his talk page</a>.

They are by no means the only sources with data of male pregnancy, but cover everything used in the article. If the page that hosts a copy of the Sunday Times article about Winston seems suspect, it's also hosted elsewhere. If the sources should be pointed out better, I'm all ears, but I'm not - repeat not - using OR. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 18:07, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The snopes link you provided appears to debunk your entire article's human component.
<dl>
<dd>Not really. It examines the present state and says that it's <i>doable</i>, not yet practically feasible - and the Wikipedia article agrees by describing it as doubly foolhardy. Snopes.com's description of how a male pregnancy would be done corresponds to Winston's statements on the issue. The Snopes link finishes by saying that it could become reality in the future. The article and the source seem to fit nicely to me. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 11:31, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I blocked both users for six hours (3RR breach on the page). I think what is happening is that the <a href="../../../w/o/t/Wikipedia%7EWOT_a2ea.html" title="Wikipedia:WOT">Wikipedia:WOT</a> poll is suffering from vote stacking (see my note about it on <a href="../../../w/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EWOT_dade.html#This_poll_suffers_from_questionable_vote-stacking_practices" title="Wikipedia talk:WOT">This poll suffers from questionable vote-stacking practices</a>). So what Nescio is doing, is placing links to the old polls on these issues, while Zer0fault objects and reverts, and Nescio reverts in turn. But Zer0fault has also removed a link within Nescio's comment on the AfD (which I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FWikipedia%3AWOT&amp;diff=59607656&amp;oldid=59604047" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FWikipedia%3AWOT&amp;diff=59607656&amp;oldid=59604047" rel="nofollow">rollbacked</a> — it is a links to an <a href="../../../i/r/a/Talk%7EIraq_War_0d4c.html#Starting_a_proper_RFC_that_mentions_all_views" title="Talk:Iraq War">article RFC</a> that Nescio has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FHistory_and_geography&amp;diff=59590080&amp;oldid=59583865" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FHistory_and_geography&amp;diff=59590080&amp;oldid=59583865" rel="nofollow">prepared</a>), calling it "linkspam."

<dd>I've reviewed the edits for that IP and also the related IPs (as per talkpage).

<dd>It is a difficult problem to conclude the best response to. Each of these IPs has been used for extensive vandalism, indeed that is *all* they appear to have done. Over many months many editors have warned them and given "final" warnings with short-term blocks. As such, and unless we want to be seen to be toothless, we have no further options left <i>but</i> to permablock. Yes, of course, the IP allocation should be checked at intervals to ensure it hasn't changed hands so "eternal" is inherently wrong. It is a bit like someone being detained "at her Majesty's pleasure".

<dd>That is a very selective quote from <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>. I am sure you would agree that <i>"should"</i> is a fine word, but I'd point out that this isn't <i>just</i> about vandalism (where your brief extract is taken from) but also about the extensive and regular <i>disruption</i> that this range of IPs is causing to Wikipedia generally. Look in that section and you will note: <i>"For static IPs and user names, such blocks should initially last 24 hours, but <b>repeat violators may be blocked for increasing lengths of time</b>." (my bold)</i> These are static IPs and blocks of increasing length have been tried over more than a year and have clearly failed despite clear and many-times-repeated "final" warnings. The policies of Wikipedia are there to assist the project, they are not a bureaucratic straightjacket that prevents us dealing with issues however. I would really like an alternative to permablocking these addresses, but there just isn't one. We have to be realistic about that. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 22:17, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support this, so long as each IP address has a note on providing reasons why the IP address is on a long-term / indefinite block, and the procedure to get the block rescinded if an actual contributor strays onto the IP address.

<p>I have given up. I'm not going to revert any more AOL <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kuching_City_centre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59398133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kuching_City_centre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59398133" rel="nofollow">edits</a> like this one. I'm going to skip right past.</p>
<p>The feeling of hopelessness is immense. I'm sitting there with Vandal Proof watching edits by that user go by faster than I can revert them. I don't even bother leaving warnings. He will just change his IP with the next edit anyway. I just try and reduce the damage. It's a whole IP range. I jump the hell on IRC, yelling for someone to help me but no one does. An admin finally blocks it, but I see other admins seeing the same vandalism as me, reverting the same vandalism as me, and they don't do anything. What kind of climate are we living in when a sophisticated vandal with an efficient system (3+ vandal edits every 30 seconds, or an edit every 10 seconds) wrecking havoc with our encyclopedia gets to scare off our administrators just because he uses AOL? Even when the range WAS BLOCKED, it was ONLY FOR 15 MINUTES. The vandal promptly started up again and that's when I decided to throw in the towel. This isn't just some kiddie at his school putting in "omg lol" into articles. This is a determined vandal who knows our system with its red tape and silly rules can't stop him. He has the power and he knows how to exploit it.</p>
<p>"But mboverload," you say, "obvious vandalism is easy to revert and it only took a few minutes even if you had to look on in horror as thousands of peoples' work was being destroyed." Well, why don't we just let stupid criminals out of <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">prison</a> after 15 minutes? They learned their lesson. Stores can always get their money back from insurance and it's easy to spot them with the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">security cameras</a>, right?

<p>I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm supposed to be understanding about this. But maybe I'm just the cop that realises that it's a completely hopeless battle; we will never win. Every day we go back out there and we hand out warnings and we watch as they commit more vandalism and we hand out and other warning and then we watch them do it again, all in the name of due process. Criminals don't get 4 warnings. They get <a href="../../../t/a/s/Taser.html" title="Taser">TASERed</a>. Maybe I'm burned out. Maybe I need a wikibreak. Maybe I don't care enough about all the good that comes out the the AOL IP addresses with 8 blocks. Maybe I need to calm down.

<dd>if not enough people willing to spend their time reverting this are online, the entire range should be blocked.

<dd>Its obvious vandalism. Easy to revert and the collateral damage would be huge. Seriously, but you're the only one with this huge obsession with this vandal. I'm content with the edits being reverted. The good coming out of the AOL IP's <b>vastly</b> outweighs the bad, blocking that range would be more disasterous then any vandal could possibly be. Our ultimate goal is writing an encyclopedia, not being elitist towards anons and AOL in paticular. As long as those using AOL contribute towards that goal, we just need to revert the vandals.

<dd>When I come across more vandalised pages by accident (i.e. while not on RC patrol or looking at my watchlist), I might get behind a block on an entire ISP, but right now in my whole time reading Wikipedia I can only remember coming across three vandalised pages by accident, and I can't even remember what they were, though I do remember all but one were very obscure.

<p>Any time the vandal's giving you trouble, mboverload, drop a note on my talk page, and if I'm on I'll block the range for 3 hours. I'm truly not afraid of blocking AOL one bit for as long as need be, and have blocked that range for relatively long times before (as far as I know, my blocks of this range have never once been undone), and I truly don't think that many users are that harmed by it, with a couple of <a href="../../../w/b/a/User_talk%7EWBardwin_56b1.html" title="User talk:WBardwin">exceptions</a> for whom solutions are typically found quite quickly. I get the impression that AOL simply doesn't give a damn about abuse, and AOL users are typically quite used to getting shitty service from their ISP--they'll understand, or perhaps consider changing to a decent provider. If a few users are unable to edit from home for some time, I think it's well worth it. This vandal, and many others, are quite well aware of the effort we put into ensuring that no AOL user ever be unable to edit, and they just sit back and laugh at our wasted effort. It is absolutely absurd to expect anyone--mboverload, myself, etc.--to simply "revert and warn" this vandalism without blocking, and anyone who does not find this expectation absurd obviously has not been involved in the clean up (as mb stated, we're not dealing with the dumb schoolboy vandal here). Might I propose that we at least keep this range blocked between the hours of 5 and 15 UTC (midnight and 10am pacific time) when nobody except the few of us are available to deal with it? I, like mboverload, simply refuse to clean up this crap anymore, and why should we with that nifty block button there? By the way, we're not talking <b>all</b> of AOL, just the pacific coast branch.

<dd>Thank you for your post AmiDaniel, thanks. I get mad at the regular vandals but I'm fine with that in the long run. It's just these people who take advantage of an ISP that doesn't care is what makes me mad. Even madder at someone who is this smart (I have heard that he must have found a special way to get a new IP address each time, it's not the regular behavior usually). And when we block a range <b>he can just disconnect and call another number</b>. God...I hate dialup. Maybe I'm madder at AOL than the actual user. It's just so awful that there is a stereotype of the AOL user, and they seem to reinforce it to me every hour.

<p>One more time: <b>blocks of AOL should never exceed&#160;:15.</b> The bad outweighs the good? Hmm. Let's see: yesterday I wrote two full articles with references, cleaned out some CSD's, and added to four prosody articles. I mediated the behavior of someone about to get a block, and I tried to put the brakes on some overzealous blocking on this page. Sure, I can see why you might think that the bad outweighs that tiny amount of good. <i>This is not a debate: our policy says that you will not block AOL for longer than&#160;:15.</i> If AmiDaniel's block hasn't been overturned, that's just luck, because, although I've not before wanted to get involved in unblocking and wheel warring, the kind of attitude I'm seeing from you people is enough to pull me off the sidelines. If what I'm saying is changing tone too many times, just remember this <b>do not block AOL for longer than&#160;:15.</b> Oh, and you can put your prejudice aside. Your denunciations of AOL are as well reasoned as meeting drunken sailors and concluding that all the people of a nation are hideous. If you don't know who the AOL contributors are doing any good, it's because you're vandal hunting. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blocks of AOL should be based on preventing vandalism from AOL. It should be as wide-ranging and as long as necessary to accomplish this goal. Since AOL is making it impossible to lay a narrowly-targeted block on an AOL vandal, AOL users have no reasonable expectation of <i>not</i> being blocked. The problem here is with AOL's conduct towards the rest of the Internet, not Wikipedia admin's conduct. AOL's randomizing proxies are a big fat "screw you" to anyone who's trying to deter vandalism, harassment, or other abuse and criminality. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 16:33, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where is this policy which says no more than 15 minutes? <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> doesn't mention it, the block page says "Please keep blocks in these ranges to 15 minutes or less" that isn't a never. The reality if the blocking should be proportional to the issue, in this case it appears to be bot like rapid vandalism e.g. 20+ edits per minute, in which case a range block does seem in order. If initial 15 minute blocks don't stop it then increase in length does seem appropriate. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 17:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gosh, and here I thought the block page had precedence over zeal. You know why you think AOL users are a problem? You are vandal hunting. If you clean septic tanks all day, you'll be convinced that no one does anything but poop. Do you think Time Warner AOL will be harmed by your virtuous scourging of its users from Wikipedia? Do you think that the users will either gain the money or expertise necessary to switch ISP's? Do you believe that other ISP's will suddenly appear with dial-up connections in their areas? No, in fact, reverting vandals is not sufficient justification for wiping out <i>an entire ISP.</i> Do you feel free to ignore policy, consensus, and practice and block entire school systems? They do more damage by far. If not, then please drop the anti-corporate attitude when it means blocking innocent contributors. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The semi-block idea sounds very interesting. Yes,something must be done about AOL vandalism, and waiting for AOL to do it seems a forlorn hope. I put my faith in the clever developers giving a software solution <b>top priority now</b>. Meanwhile, do you rangeblock enthusiast really know the situation of the good users being affected by the AOL blocks? And what the encyclopedia loses through that situation? Do you see, above, that the fine admin and exceptional Featured-article writer <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> can barely edit at all nowadays? I know him, so I know his situation. I also know the equally virtuous and even more unfortunate <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">User:WBardwin</a>, who was invisibly pipelinked to in AmiDaniel's post above as one of "a couple of <a href="../../../w/b/a/User_talk%7EWBardwin_56b1.html" title="User talk:WBardwin">exceptions</a> [to the rule that three-hour blocks of the whole range aren't much of a problem] for whom solutions are typically found quite quickly". Really, a solution has been found for WBardwin? No, it hasn't. His polite, resigned unblock requests still pop up on my watchlist most days. This amazingly patient editor still tries, and to a certain extent manages, to edit Wikipedia--if I were WBardwin, I would have given up long ago. Take a look at his <a href="../../../w/b/a/User_talk%7EWBardwin_56b1.html" title="User talk:WBardwin">talkpage</a>, and click from it to his special subpage about his AOL blocks: it's horrendous. So, just by accident I know two users who are <i>hugely</i> impacted by the AOL blocks. This suggests to me that there are many, many more. PLease keep AOL blocks to 15 minutes or less. And PLEASE work on a software solution for the vandalism! I find the pointlessness of blocking vandals or edit warriors when they come in from AOL as frustrating as anybody. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>It is luck, Zoe. (Gasp! Another admin using AOL? But, above, we were told that AOL is far and away more evil for Wikipedia than good!) I've been stuck with Netscape ISP for over a year and a half. Netscape is owned by AOL, so it runs my IP through its pool. For 10 months or more, I never had collateral damage. In the past 6-8 months, though, I find myself blocked at least twice a day. Being an admin, I can get around it, but the kind of shotgun approach to vandal fighting being <i>actually encouraged</i> in this thread is simply ignorant. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:40, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope. I use Mozilla and don't use AOL. I simply have an ISP (Netscape) that's owned by AOL.

<p>for the record, I never meant to suggest we should block the entire AOL range for long periods. I meant to suggest that if there is an auto-redialling vandalbot run on AOL, we should block AOL for&#160;:15 without remorse, and for another&#160;:15 if it persists, and for yet another&#160;:15, <i>and</i> another&#160;:15, essentially amounting to a permablock for as long as the wanker continues to run his bot. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't the software solution easy? Give MediaWiki the range of AOL proxy server IP addresses (these are <i>well known</i>), and if the IP address is blocked but the user account isn't, let its edits go through. This is a sort of "semi-block" that allows registered users to edit. Also, disable autoblocker on these ranges. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:46, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Unnecessary notices, such as "Information here is from his official website, byj.co.kr. Google is not a verifiabe source of information on Bae Yong Joon.

<p>Good day, all. This user has been (for about a week now) unilaterally slashing out the "spoiler" tags from at least a hundred game-related articles. He doesn't use the talk page, and doesn't give any explanation in his summaries. His removal of the tags is wrong in all of the instances he's done it in (for example, in the Resident Evil 4 article it talks about the specific death of a main character during the course of the game), and there are elements within those storylines that a user casually reading the article might not want revealed to them without prior notice. Other users have asked him to stop repeatedly, but he hasn't listened to them, instead filing false "Request For Investigation" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59588237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59588237" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> attempts and trying to get Mongo involved in order to "get his way".

<p>I just blocked Biff loman9 indefinitely. This started as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=59740028&amp;oldid=59563673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=59740028&amp;oldid=59563673" rel="nofollow">personal attack</a> case, so I blocked him for 24 hours. Almost immediately, he started using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThanos&amp;diff=59796985&amp;oldid=59743263" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThanos&amp;diff=59796985&amp;oldid=59743263" rel="nofollow">socks</a> to get around the block. So I blocked him for 3 days. So then we got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59799228" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Woohookitty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59799228" rel="nofollow">this</a>, we went up to 9 days. And then he pledged to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWoohookitty&amp;diff=59831537&amp;oldid=59829348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWoohookitty&amp;diff=59831537&amp;oldid=59829348" rel="nofollow">continue</a> using socks.

<dd>Its not a RFC first of all, I have told you that numerous times. Second you are attempting to classify everyone vote on a semi-related poll to fit your interpretation. I removed your commentary on what you feel those people were saying with their votes and added the vote count + the questions. Which is more appropriate then you summarizing what you think those 10 people were saying into 1 sentence. You also removed the comments I added to that poll when you first completely misrepresented what was even being asked in the poll. The polls are about infoboxes not about the general question of if the WOT and War in Iraq are related, no matter how much you attempt to slant it to be about that. And stop posting your NPA / Vandalism tags on my page. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:36, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me but how dare you take his side simply because I remove NPA tags he puts on my user page. This woe is me act also involves him removing my comments from Iraq War talk page.

<p><b>Are you even listening to each other?</b> This supposed poll on the "war on terror" at <a href="../../../i/r/a/Talk%7EIraq_War_0d4c.html" title="Talk:Iraq War">Talk:Iraq War</a> contains over 11,000 words posted in <i>less than 36 hours</i>, more than 90% by Nescio and Zer0faults. Stephen King writes less than that daily. You are both obviously immovable in your opinions, and no one else is willing to step into your fever swamp to offer an outside view because the atmosphere is so acrimonious. Tagging a person's talk page with personal attack warnings when he is an obvious established user is lazy and rude, and in the context of an ongoing content debate, obnoxious and thoroughly unhelpful. But you might as well argue about each other's behavior, because you're obviously not going to change each other's mind on the issue. Just don't come running to ANI any more like a coupe of eight year olds (he touched me! she touched me first! he's making faces at me!).</p>
<p>This is only the latest in a series of political articles you two have been fighting over, and the fifth or tenth time one of you has come running to ANI. I'm surprised no one has yet thought of filing an RFAR against <b>both</b> of you to get you both banned from political articles altogether. (Maybe Arbcom will see that one of you is clearly "right" -- but I doubt it.) Wikipedia is not a blog or a usenet newsgroup. Stop editing political articles, even if it means swallowing your pride and letting the other one "win." Find some way of dealing with each other before a solution gets imposed on you that you may like even less. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>yself and another user have been attempting to get Nomen to talk to us about reaching a middleground, much like we did with Kizzle and was able to satisfy what they felt was wrong with the War on Terror title, they have since voted in favor of it, with a condition attached that it be put in quotation marks. However Nomen does not respond to other users attempting to work a middleground or even asking what would convince him otherwise. This is evident by his own talk page, and the fact that he just cahnged Mrdthree's vote on the poll he is creating. I not dealing with this user anymore, as he runs to AN/I when noone wants to participate in his poll. Especially when that poll calls for anyone who agree's that Iraq is part of the WOT to also state they do so regardless of evidence and are being unobjectionable. Anyone else see a POV problem with a person having to agree on the basis they do it withuot having any facts support them? I am sure he will see the lack of votes in that category as a win on his side however.

<p>vandalism - assistance required. I have just try to clean up this overlong article by removing DUPLICATED information (info that is included in the infobox) and some irrelvant trivia. I have also reorganized by the info box by breaking it down into admin and geography. I believe all these are reasonable edits and within Wiki guidelines but have all bene reverted by what can only be described as a possessive editor. I wholeheartedly believe my edits improve the article and would welcome intervention.

<dd>My own feeling is that there are three different block discussions going on:
<ol>
<li>User name violations</li>
<li>Hate speech, repeated</li>
<li>Calls for intervention and 3RR</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>and the three folks aren't talking to each other very clearly. As for #1: if the user has an article on himself, then he can't have the name, <i>but</i> the user shouldn't have a page about himself, because he is not actually substantial enough for the .se Wikipedia to have an article on him. As for #2: absolutely. This user's speech has been horrid and continuing. However, for process sake, I don't think an indefinite ban for hate speech is at all allowable. Personal attacks and bad speech is not sufficient, IMO. The user's edits are not all vandalism. Instead, they're all <i>worthless,</i> but worthless isn't vandalism. There are plenty of ArbCom cases of people calling each other "communist fascist" and the like, and since there are no priviledged classes, the mere hatred behind the terminology can't allow an indefinite block without consensus. For #3, the call for meatpuppets is <i>at least</i> a cause for resetting a 3RR block <i>for the duration that the call for intervention is visible.</i> In this case, I think <i>the worst offense should be treated.</i> To me, that's #2, not #3. I'd say a month block for repeated and pretty much sole attack and hate speech is appropriate and a referral to mediation/ArbCom after that month at the first sign of attack language. Incidentally, I think that <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shamir_9e98.html" title="Israel Shamir">Israel Shamir</a> should be sent to AfD <i>after the block is in place.</i> If that is disrupted by any calls for intervention, etc., I'd say we're looking at an indefinite block. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:00, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Geogre, from the point of view of the encyclopedia, I believe that the worst offense is not the hate speech, it's the "All edits worthless" and its concomitant "user is not here to build the encyclopedia". I've gone through his edits, and they may be divided into POV rants in article space, extreme personal attacks on userpages, and additions of useless external links. Following your argument I will block indefinitely for encyclopedic uselessness, not for the call for meatpuppets. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Geogre: I think the only "problem" with the 3 simultaneous discussions/causes of action against this user is which each of us thinks is the worst of his blockable offenses, not that some of us regard one as a problem but not the other two, etc. I don't think we're talking past each other so much as saying "yeah, I saw that, but look at this! this is even more outrageous!", all the while agreeing that everything is sufficient cause to block him indefinitely. The guy needs to go for <b>all three</b> reasons, and I think sufficient evidence has been brought to demonstrate that an indefinite block for <i>any</i> of them will meet with zero admin disagreement. We can discuss and discuss all day which of his offenses is worst, but at the end of the day, the verdict is still an indefinite block.

<p>I'm kind of terrible in being process oriented. I'm well aware that our dispute processes are...overburdened?...but I worry very much that a lack of dissent on one project page (this one) be taken for positive assent from the project. Again, I'm certainly not defending this person or his actions. I think he's probably irredeemable, but I'm concerned that we have all allowed "well, I'll mention it on AN/I" to replace our fuller, slower, but surer methods. I also don't like relying on "well, anyone else can block for a shorter time." Again, in no sense do I vouch for this anti-semite. I'm all for a block, and past offenses are plentiful, but past remediating actions aren't. Even though it won't do any good, I recommend a month. &lt;shrug&gt; I'm just one scold, but that's my nagging opinion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not opposed to dragging it out, I just don't see any point in doing so, other than to placate the policymongers. If I think this discussion has served pretty well as an RfC, and I don't see how an RfM would go anywhere...I don't like to sound so dismissive of this guy, but sometime reality has to strike and say "THERE IS NO HOPE". As happens far too often, this guy would simply take the extra time he's given while we go through "process", to continue flagrantly violating every WP policy in existence (I can't think of one he hasn't violated, except perhaps naming conventions, but that takes productive editing to violate...), meanwhile productive editors are being tied up not only undoing his useless edits, but now also with compiling all the voluminous evidence against him for presentation. If it were to ever go as far as ArbCom, I think they'd be very annoyed with us wee little admins for having dumped such a clear-cut BAN ON SIGHT case on them, as though they don't have enough TRICKY cases to work on.

a loosely related question, why on earth do people see "you are blocked" messages before they even attempt to edit? It unnerves and angers readers for nothing. Block notices should only come up at the time a user attempts to do an edit, since, duh, they are blocked from <i>editing</i>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:12, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Mystery not mysterious</b>: If the user is an IP, or even if he isn't -- if he merely doesn't have "remember me on this computer" checked -- when he first gets to Wikipedia, he'll have "You have messages" lit up. When he clicks on that, he'll see "You are blocked, you nasty thing, you." The block message is directed at the IP, but, if he doesn't know that the IP is just one among thousands at AOL and that it's not directed at his user name, he could, before logging in, get the impression that it was directed at him. Given this user's, and many others', for that matter, technical expertise (and people who aren't good with computers may well be architects and entomologists and other highly intelligent, trained, and valuable persons who could crush the computer nerds making fun of them), it's quite possible for him to have that misunderstanding. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The most important issue, in my opinion, was that a particular user had called attention to the poll on the talk pages of many users. Not counting users thus solicited (but counting every other registered user) the poll had 8 supports to 8 opposes. But the editors solicited to come to the page broke 13-1 in favor of the opinion of the person doing the soliciting. I interpreted this as a sign that the user had only contacted people he thought likely to agree with him. I felt this tainted the poll and I took it heavily into account when interpreting the results. I closed the poll as "no consensus". <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a> contested this as "<b>outrageous</b>", overrode my close and performed the move.

<dd>I don't think I worded it correctly. I didn't mean you should change how the votes of Polish editors are considered, what I meant is that it should be realized how weighty their votes would be, since the Polish editors on English WP are more likely to be interested in Polish subjects. That gives an unfair edge to the opposing side. I don't think any distinction should be made between votes, except those by anon or very new users.

<dd>Actually, the people who were contacted were for the most part the people who had over the last three years done the work of pulling the pages on royalty, which were a notorious dumping ground for POV opinions and wacky titles, into a cohesive structure based on naming conventions. They were approached by that user not because they would "agree with him" (anyone who looks at the people contacted knows that they regularly vote different ways on issues. John Kenney and I, for example, are frequently on opposite sides in debates) but because they were people involved in doing the specialist work on the area of the naming conventions and so presumably the user believed that <i>their</i> contributions, <i>for</i> or <i>against</i>, in a topic many of them were experts on, would be useful. The consensus was 71% to move, 29% against. Haukur's mispresentation of the poll is hilarious. It suggests that he approached the page without knowing what was going on, jumped to (the wrong) conclusions and did his maths wrong. I moved the page as per the <i>overwhelming</i> consensus to move it. (Two of the votes of the 29% who opposed were suspected, BTW, of being sockpuppets of another 'oppose' voter.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, suspected by me as I noted in my close where I discounted their votes completely. In any case I was sort of hoping to have some input from administrators not previously involved, so far I've only had comments for people who voted to move this particular page.

<p>So what Haukur is saying is that experts can't contribute to a vote if they haven't actually edited a page (even if they have edited hundreds of similar pages, just not that one), and that they have less right to participate than those who did edits, even where where those edits were contrary to naming conventions and the manual of style. I don't doubt that Haukur was well motivated in his actions, but he completely got it wrong. He judged that outside experts should be excluded, and a small number of editors who tried to give preference to their language usage over Wikipedia's in naming, should get priority. And experts who worked on the naming conventions and the manual of style cannot be told there is an issue to do with the application of the naming conventions and manual of style being discussed, even though those experts have years of edit histories of being impartial and of never voting <i>en bloc</i> for anything.

<dd>No, that's not what I'm saying at all, as anyone can see. Look, I was working on the backlog on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and I came to this page. I haven't been involved in this apparently all-important life-or-death issue of the names of Polish monarchs before and I think I'm as neutral a closing admin as they come. I did my best to close the vote in a fair way. You then immediately overrode my decision and moved the page anyway, even though you had voted in the poll yourself. Now the people who agree with you are "experts" and the people who had previously worked on the article sneakily want to "give preference to their language usage over Wikipedia's". Could you try to see this in less stark terms? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Less stark? Why do we need a prismatic rainbow of arbitrary numbers and niceties, that you admit would have swayed either way, in lieu of the standard? Obviously, there is a preference for the Polish form of the name among Polish editors. But they were fairly outvoted. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 22:05, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is stark. The people approached are the people involved in drafting the relevant manual of style and the relevant naming conventions for up to <b>four years</b>. I have done over 2000 edits on royalty related topics on Wikipedia. John Kenney probably as many. Charles has spent months since he joined working on the topic. So have others. The people approached were approached (BTW by someone few of us had even heard of) simply because, as the guys who had written thousands of articles on related topics, we might be able to offer a non-Polish insight into how the naming conventions and Manual of style work, and what, going by their guidelines, should have been the correct format for the name of the page. Many of the Polish contributors are new to Wikipedia and don't understand the MoS and NC and how both are used in shaping naming and content, and thought that WP must use a form of names used by Polish people. Wikipedia policy is on this Wikipedia to use the form used by <i>English speaker</i> (that does not mean English, if English speakers also use native language versions). The experts asked to contribute are all independent-minded and often disagree. Inviting their contributions did not in any way mean that their votes on either side of the argument could be taken for granted. On some Polish pages, all agreed. On many others, we all agreed. If anyone is looking for guaranteed block votes then they are wasting their time coming to me, to John Kenney, to Charles, to Deb or to others. We each make our own decisions on each case. We each made our own decision there.</p>
<p>BTW I moved it as per the consensus and did so explicitly, only because a wrong interpretation had been made. I would have done <i>exactly the same</i> if I had voted the other way. Once I vote the issue is closed with me. The only issue I care about is that the decision, <i>whatever decision</i>, is implemented, and I have on the past implemented decisions I disagreed about when a vote was clearcut and a week after the end of the vote no other admin had gotten round to doing the move. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My own concern about the Polish issue, is that there's obviously an organized voting block via the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Portal_talk%7EPoland_Poland-related_Wikipedia_notice_board_550e.html" title="Portal talk:Poland/Poland-related Wikipedia notice board">Polish Noticeboard</a>. I have noticed that as a matter of course, when a Polish-related issue comes up, one of their number spots the issue, posts about it on the noticeboard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal_talk:Poland/Poland-related_Wikipedia_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58257598" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal_talk:Poland/Poland-related_Wikipedia_notice_board&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58257598" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, and then there is usually a rapid influx of Polish-speakers to a particular poll, usually (though not always) voting as a block, with an emphasis on changing article titles from English spelling to Polish spelling. Which is fine, as long as other non-Polish speakers are also allowed to advertise a poll as a balance. Yet in this particular case, when an opposing editor, Marrtel, advertised the vote to other interested editors, it seems to have been regarded as a kind of vote-stacking.</dd>

<dd>As long as both "voting block" techniques are treated fairly, I have no problem with it, but when one voting block is considered okay, and the other side is regarded as inappropriate, it does give the appearance of a double-standard creeping in, as it clearly gives an advantage to whichever side is allowed to trigger a group of voters sympathetic to their cause. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 22:10, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Noticeboards may in some cases be problematic but I don't see any obvious problem in this case. It's a noticeboard on Poland-related issues which anyone interested in those issues, be she Polish or not, can watch. Asking editors interested in Polish issues to vote on a Polish issue should usually be okay. Selectively soliciting votes from individual editors may be problematic and I think it was in this case. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:20, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was <b>no selective soliciting votes</b> from Martel. There was however, clear evidence on this and numerous other pages of block voting by Polish users to ignore the manual of style and naming conventions and turn references used internationally to Polish language variants used nowhere but Poland. It has been happening all over Polish articles, with topics that they never edited before suddenly being besieged by Polish editors, and rules everyone else follows being swept aside by their block voting.

<dd>The English Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for all English speakers, not just native speakers of English. Polish readers and editors are as welcome as any. If there are articles which have a large number of Polish editors then they probably also have a large number of Polish readers so it's good that Polish preferences are well represented there. One of the things I personally like best about Wikipedia is that often I get to read articles on local issues written by the locals themselves, rather than filtered and dumbed down through the international media. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WP's rules are clear. Articles on English WP use language and naming that reflect usage by English language speakers. They call the Irish prime minister <i>Taoiseach</i> because that word, though Gaelic, is used by English speakers as the office's title. But they don't call the Irish president <i>Uachtarán</i> because that word is only used by Gaelic speakers. That is the same with all WP articles. That a cabal of Polish users are trying to do is force exclusively Polish usage, not used by English users, onto Polish articles. That is not allowed under WP rules. You should be concerned about the highjacking of articles by a linguistic cabal, rather than about the fact that other users vote to uphold Wikipedia rules by voting to put the name of a Polish king at the name that he belongs under according to the manual of style and wikipedia naming conventions. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:56, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Few notes. One - I am an involved party and have voted in that RM, and I am a Polish editor. Two - I feel that a user who is involved in the vote should not 'override' the vote analysis by a clearly neutral RM specialist. Three: I find the accusations of 'Polish cabal' highly offensive, and I hope some neutral editors will reprimand those using such arguments and remind them of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and related policies. Fourth: while some people speak about the 'evil Polish cabal', the same people feel that they have the right to move the articles not only if the consensus is disputed (like here) but even the RM vote is closed as 'no consensus' (evidence: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABoleslav_I_of_Poland&amp;diff=60017420&amp;oldid=59855190" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABoleslav_I_of_Poland&amp;diff=60017420&amp;oldid=59855190" rel="nofollow">RM closed with 'no consensus'</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boleslav_I_of_Poland&amp;diff=60082552&amp;oldid=60030673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boleslav_I_of_Poland&amp;diff=60082552&amp;oldid=60030673" rel="nofollow">article moved</a>).

<p>The more people talk about "voting" the worse things will get. Matters of fact cannot be decided by votes. Matters of following style guides do not get decided by votes. NOTHING at wikipedia gets decided by a vote. Wikipedia works by building <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> through discussion. Obviously that has failed here. I know absolutely nothing about naming things in Polish, but if we have a style guide, we should follow it. If the style guide is bad, we should fix it. What we definitely should NOT do is decide with a vote to ignore the style guide. It is the responsibility of Admins to encourage discussion and help others reach consensus. If it is not appropriate to decide an issue by using consensus, it is the responsibility of the Admin to explain why, and direct those that disagree to the correct forum for their concerns and explain the appropriate process. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 09:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A few minor points. To accuse somebody of biased editing because of nationality is very dangerous. I could use the same accusation in regards Russian, German, French, English voters of being unfriendly to Polish articles because of historic reasons, which would be damaging to Wikipedia and quite absurd since nationality doesn't determine views or opinions. Second as to claim that <i>My own concern about the Polish issue, is that there's obviously an organized voting block via the Polish Noticeboard</i>. Well it is a normal thing for a board to exist that focuses on topics of interest common to certain editors.For example there is similar Russian related noticeboard where frequent calls for attention to certain articles are made, and similiaryd then there is usually a rapid influx of Russian-speakers. Are such procedures against Wiki rules&#160;? --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Haukur and Mackensen, I would like to offer my heartfelt appreciation for this data. The related events over the last several months have been genuinely perplexing for me, but now that it's revealed that there was a quadruple sockpuppet involved, things make much more sense. It's my hope that we'll be able to use this data to finally untangle many of the resulting messes that occurred, and start the process of rebuilding trust among all the Wikipedia editors involved, now that it's clear who's "real", and who was just a sockpuppet.

I also hope that the actions of one rogue user will not be overgeneralized to a largec community, we have had enough uncivility with the entire Polish cabal accusations recently (on a sidenote, please note that neither logologist nor his sockpuppets were significantly active in the Polish noticeboard).--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 18:52, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure. Just institute a shorter block. For something like that, a day or two might be enough to send the message the first time. After all, when the creature snapped, he <i>was</i> going to run amock until he'd punched himself out, as they say on <i>The Simpsons.</i> I'm not sure how valuable the editor's going to be, but let's hope for the best. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's worth noting that he was just coming back from a 24-hour block, and it didn't seem to have the desired calming effect. His first edit was to insult and implicitly threaten Pacific COast Highway (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pacific_Coast_Highway&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60102972" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pacific_Coast_Highway&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60102972" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>), and he followed up with an attack on me (I placed the first 24-hour block): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60103456" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60103456" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I gather that the guy has some good contributions behind him, and PCH seems to be taking this mostly in stride. Nevertheless, his behaviour is quite disruptive. Until he can work out how to control himself or manages to sort out whatever personal problems he's having, he's going to find himself blocked. I'm trimming the block down to 48 hours since he's expressed remorse and an interest in contributing positively again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:I.M._Rich&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60113028" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:I.M._Rich&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60113028" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.

<dd>I got in on this whole thing a little late, but I'd just like to stick myself in in favor of I.M. Rich. I don't think his death threats are plausable, and he certainly has a large quantity of valuable contributions to <a href="../../../n/y/c/WP%7ENYCS_17b2.html" title="WP:NYCS">WP:NYCS</a>. An indefinite block would be entirely unreasonable and a certain detriment to the quality of NYC related articles. Coincidentally, when I first confronted him about the threats (I think I was the first), he responded reasonably (see the top of his talk page). --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't find his comments amusing in the least, and his actions on his talk page are far from reasonable. Saying you will stab someone (and that it is feasible as you know what he looks like) is a serious matter.

<dd>"Polish Cabal"? That one's not half as bad as "Serbian mafia" which is regularly used around here. I hope I don't need to remind you that on Eastern European related articles people <i>do</i> vote along ethnic lines (I can dig for diffs if you feel its necessary), and I hardly think "Polish Cabal" qualifies as a personal attack (people who use "Serbian mafia" certainly get away with it). --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>When people show great solidarity based on race, it raises questions about whether their contributions to discussions/"votes" are actually based on judgement on policy, rather than ethnic/national pride. Wikipedia has a lot of room for the former, but the latter has no place here. To a certain degree, reminding people that Wikipedia is not a democracy helps to avoid these distortions, but to the degree that people and processes approximate democracy, it's a problem, no matter the specific races involved. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 17:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>what Improv said. I am disgusted by people who use their nationality instead of their brain, as too often evidenced by votes along ethnicity-lines. Polish editors who do that may be justly called "Polish cabal", just as I would not hesitate to call Swiss editors who do the same a "Swiss cabal".

Now let's fix some points:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> was not an "independent observer": he was taking part to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content_disputes.html" title="Content disputes">content dispute</a> on the opportunity of describing the "controlled demolition theorists" as "conspiracists";</li>
<li>the dispute involved several people in both the parties as you can see looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59080643" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59080643" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> and keeping pressing "newer edit";</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User: MONGO</a> was supporting a change to the old version of the article while I was supporting the old version;</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_policy.html" title="Block policy">block policy</a> you can read the following paragraph:</li>

<p>So I think it's clear that <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User: MONGO</a> did violate the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_policy.html" title="Block policy">block policy</a> realizing an abuse of power.

<p>This seems pretty clear-cut to me. Administrators are not permitted to use their access to advantage themselves in a content dispute, for instance by blocking the person with whom they are disputing.

<dd>Well, you can go to <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EArbCom_eb42.html" title="WP:ArbCom">WP:ArbCom</a>, the arbitration committee, and file a formal complaint. Which may or may not do any good, as I've yet to see ArbCom take action against an administrator for abusing an non admin editor, whether the admin violated policy or not. I have a case right now there claiming an admin violated at the very least <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> with a indefinite block, and ArbCom has so far (yawn) asked if I could come up with any other violations. So I did. Silence. Similarly, I've seen people blocked by admins for violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, but on this very page you will see an administrator label my comments as "assholery."

<dd>It's like this: as soon as an admin steps in to control an edit war, they are asserted by the POV pushers to be "involved in a content dispute". If we accept that at face value, we soon run out of admins with any understanding of the issue. The loudest protests are usually fomr the most tendentious editors. Simply policing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is not necessarily involvement. I don't know what went on here, but there is little doubt that the people asserting the "controlled demolition" theory are conspiracy theorists and not "independent researchers". <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What evidence have you that this is the case? In the present case, we don't simply have an administrator wandering by and dealing with vandalism, then getting accused of conflict of interest. The admin in question seems to have been involved in the conflict well prior. In such a case, the accepted and respectable thing to do is to request that an uninvolved administrator investigate and take action. Nobody is claiming that a block can't result if one is appropriate. But in cases of apparent conflict of interest, admins are supposed to seek review -- <i>not</i> to use admin access while in conflict. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:21, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The best advice I can offer is to be very calm and measured. Ask, on WP:AN (not here), for other administrators to review the situation. "Administrators" disagree with each other often enough, and there shouldn't be any special divine right to the position. You can also ask (not demand, not threaten, not accuse) MONGO to get another administrator to look in. I doubt he'd had any reluctance in doing so. However, when you come in suggesting that it's Us and Them, that the persecuted truth is being hunted to extinction by the evil cabal, etc., it's fairly offputting. Most administrators are administrators because they've been pretty carefully watched and assessed before getting the position, so there is some inherent trust there and a slightly larger benefit of the doubt, but the community is pretty quick to reverse inappropriate administrative actions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to agree with Pokipsy76 here. MONGO, you were (and are) out of line. Calling them 'conspiracists' seems clearly derogatory and thus not 'NPOV'... which makes Pokipsy's effort to change it to 'some' or 'some independant researchers' look not unreasonable to me (despite agreeing the claims seem unlikely / far-fetched). However, let's assume for the moment that isn't the case... 'conspiracists' was a perfectly neutral, reasonable, and encyclopedic term to use and no other would do. You'd still be completely out of line. This was a content dispute between the two of you... pure and simple. Blocking someone for disagreeing with your version of what an article should say is an inexcusable violation of adminship... it shouldn't be done <i>ever</i>. He wasn't "trolling" as you said in the block summary or being disruptive, indeed <i>you</i> seem to have acted considerably more incivilly. You called it "trolling" in the block summary, but elsewhere you said it was for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59305594" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59305594" rel="nofollow">'reverting you'</a>... you <b>can't</b> block for that. Ever. And you certainly shouldn't be nasty and dismissive about it. Protecting someone's talk page to prevent them from requesting unblock (I realize that wasn't you) also strikes me as <i>extremely</i> 'not kosher'. If the request is groundless the next admin will see that... just put in comments on why you think the block is sound. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their "contributions" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers. Simply put, and I won't apologize for this not being more civil, I will continue to block POV pushers that disrupt the discussion pages and the articles with nonsense. Two other admins responded to the unblock request and did not unblock this editor. I then moved the early parts of this conversation from an article talk page to here for all to see. It is ludicrus to assume that I was doing anything other than to ensure that the POV pushers of nonsense know that there is a limit to the level of disruption that needs to be tolerated.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 15:08, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that a majority of people (including myself) agree with a characterization does not make it 'neutral point of view'. Isn't that obvious? Or should we rewrite the 'Hitler' article to say that he was a 'vile murderous bastard' because most people agree with that? That the people who argue for controlled demolition are 'conspiracy theorists' (or "conspiracists" as in the article) may well be the common view... but it <b>ISN'T</b> "neutral" or 'encyclopedic'. It's a deliberately derogatory presentation which <i>should</i> be changed to something more neutral. You say above that he has repeatedly been told that his edits "violated numerous policies". What policy did he violate by changing 'Some conspiracists say...' to 'Some say...' and/or 'Some independant researchers say...'? Edit warring? Weren't you doing that too? A policy which definitely <i>was</i> violated is the restriction against admins blocking those with whom they are in a content dispute. Indeed, you went so far as to say, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATom_harrison&amp;diff=59308295&amp;oldid=59306356" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATom_harrison&amp;diff=59308295&amp;oldid=59306356" rel="nofollow">He's going to post an unblock request and I have told him that if he reverts me one more time, the next block will be for a week.</a>" What is that? 'If you dare to revert me I will block you for a week'? You think admins are supposed to act that way? I understand that you may be frustrated and annoyed, but that's a reason to take several steps back... not charge forward. If dealing with the craziness is starting to get to you go work on some other topic. I haven't touched political articles in months for just that reason. You say several admins approved this... well shame on them. IMO that's worse than doing it in the first place. I'm telling you that you 'crossed the line' not to get in your face, but to let you know that I think you need to get away from this for a while and reconsider your position. In my view those saying (effectively), 'yeah, admins <b>should</b> block people who revert their edits... <i>we</i> decide what is good enough for inclusion' are doing more harm to you (and Wikipedia) than my criticisms. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>actually, "conspiracy theorist" is a republican talking point. By naming it as such, the fact is that that way of naming it is itself a patent invalidation. In other words "its just nonsense, because its a conspiracy THEORY." Which does violate npov policy. That this isn't simple and apparent to all concerned is rediculous, again pointing to the need for conversational logic to be a required feild of study for all admins. The whole point of calling it a "conspiracy theory" is to characterize it as a tin foil hat propaganda. The evidence regarding the 911 problems is overwhelmingly for the fact that the buildings were demolished with thermate. There is an entire panel of first rate scientists who are looking into the matter, and they are indeed independant researchers. Finding out the truth about what happened on 911 is a depth research game, and thus, those who are promoting the 911 truth movement are by definition researchers, not conspiracy theorists. That i would randomly run into this, and have to explain something as simple and as basic as predjudical charecterization to a batch of (supposely long time and thus wise in the ways of the wikipedia) admins and editors should be humiliatingly emberassing. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 01:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was this a 3RR? Could you have just rolled them back? My point is that the block, when you're involved, gives them fuel. I don't want to advocate a revert war, of course. (And I was up on 89th E. when the towers went down. Conspiracy theorists about the tower attacks are not only inventing where plain evidence is abundant, they're also highly offensive to those of us who knew people who died.) If they're horking you off (and they are, it seems), at least hand off the blocking phase. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:59, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it was, in my opinion, vandalism.

<p>This isn't a content dispute between the Mongo and Pokipsky. This is persistent tendentious editing by a few conspiracy theorists who are determined to add their speculation to every page related to 9/11, with links to videos and books. The consensus is against him, and Pokipsky's actions have long since become disruptive.

<p>calling these people conspiracy theorists IS an INVALIDATION and a PREDJUDICIAL CHARACTERIZATION. Its also an Ad hominem, and, amusingly enough, also A straw man. Also, this is no longer in the realm of speculation. Science and fact have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that thermate explosives were present, and that the buildings were destroyed via demolitions. All you are doing is attacking these editors personally, not adressing the facts of the content. Where republicans can't win on logic, they engadge in demonization. Well, clap clap clap, its a great show. Mongo blocked somebody for changing a pov loaded predjudicial wording to an npov wording. So whos the pov pusher? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 02:06, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mongo might have been advised to get someone else to actually implement the block. The Conspiracy Theorists who are edit-warring over the insertion of small-minorty POV in all articles related to that small-minority POV, however, are not editing the encyclopedia to make it more informative, but rather to win a debate about how there is a grand conspiracy to do something. As such, Mongo is right, thought I feel he would be righter if he just asked someone else to block them indefinently for exausting the communities patience. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 20:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

To me it looks like an attempt to insert NPOV wording. We don't block for that. At least... we aren't supposed to.

<dd>You're so wrong about what is going on with these articles, it's laughable. Just yesterday, one of the more prolific conspiracy theorists was identified as using a strawman sockpuppet, just to make his preposterous nonsense seem more credible. The websites that some of these people have been affliated with or simply read, have issued a call to arms from time to time and called for like minded people to go and edit wikipedia to push their POV. You claim that those that support the known factual evidence are not following concensus? Ridiculous. So terrorists becomes freedom fighter? So conspiracy theorist becomes independent researcher? It is also preposterous to say that by using the term conspiracy theorists that it is somehow the same as editing that "Hitler was a vile murdering bastard". I simply cannot disagree with this more. If you find the wording so problematic, then go over to those articles and edit till your heart is content...you'll probably get reverted, but the only possible explanation would be because people like me are POV pushers of nonsense, right?

<dd>I'd generally not go with RfC (which all too often has a 'punitive' focus) over one problem incident, but since the process is already underway I will comment there. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:26, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Proposal:</b> Since this has now strayed well past any call to action I propose it be archived or moved to Talk, to clear the noticeboard for actual incidents requiring action. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree with the proposal, I do endorse MONGO block by the way, but he should have gave a warning. Thanks Jaranda <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 02:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am fine with archiving this section, but I find it unconscionable that <i>anyone</i> would claim that MONGO's block for these edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59152448" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59152448" rel="nofollow">[99]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59258911" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59258911" rel="nofollow">[100]</a>) was 'proper'. Even ignoring the fact that he blocked Pokipsy76 specifically for 'reverting him'... the content of the edits just is <i>not</i> block-worthy by any remotely reasonable standard and I'd challenge anyone to look at them and seriously tell me they believe otherwise. If those edits were worthy of a 48 hour block then virtually every edit on Wikipedia is. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 02:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tru, the block was a bit harsh, but I don't understand Prometheuspan involvement in this, who is currently trolling and harrassing MONGO, see his talk page.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ok Prometheuspan is blocked indef by Tony Sidaway, which I fully endorse as his last 50 edits was mostly severe trolling. Jaranda <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 02:58, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Block on Prometheuspan seems fine to me as well. Finally, a block in this mess <b>not</b> made by someone currently edit warring with the blockee. There is no question that there are 'troublemakers' of various sorts involved here, but that isn't a blank check to throw all standards out the window. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 03:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh I didn't realise this was being discussed. But honestly he's an obvious nutter. Let's put him behind us. Doesn't matter who he has engaged. Thar's what trolls do. Let's just tell him to fuck off. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 03:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
