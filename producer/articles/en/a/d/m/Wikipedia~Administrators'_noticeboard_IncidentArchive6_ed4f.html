<p>Hello. My name is Amir, an occasional contributor to Wikipedia. I just wanted to post the following here so that everybody knows that how pathetic and small-minded some sysop can be.

<p>This person's edit to the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a> article was "<b>Attention:</b> <i>The pictures that you see on this page, as it is obvious from the colours, are aesthetically enhanced pictures for the purpose of religious promotion. Enjoy the "pretty pictures" but keep in mind that they are retouched pictures.</i>"</p>
<p>What he quotes above is correct. When he made the same edit, I blocked him, as I promised him I would. I have no stake in the article, I'm not Bahai, the only edits I've ever made to the article (and I'm not even sure if it was to this article, but possibly others in the Bahai series) was to revert vandalism. His edits are not only vandalism, they're anti-Bahai. His edits to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians_in_Iran_930d.html" title="Christians in Iran">Christians in Iran</a> are of a piece. His claims that I'm doing any of this for personal reasons are bogus. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:25, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But why should you block him? His addition seems factual rather than POV (although I can see better ways of making the point he wants to make). POV insertion is not, of itself, a blockable offence - if it was we'd have a much much longer Block Log. It seems like a run of the mill content dispute rather than something he should be blocked for, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 08:43, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The first and second images appear to be the sort of work a good professional photographer can produce, while the third is pretty clearly a computer rendering. But that doesn't excuse condescending remarks about "pretty pictures" as the article lead, and it particularly doesn't excuse repeated insertions of those remarks.</dd>

<dd>Not to mention the little matter of what appears to be five reverts over the course of fourteen hours. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 09:01, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And an examination of the discussion page of that article reveals that it was other users who brought up the subject of artificiality of the pictures, and after that was discussed the note was inserted in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether there's a 3RR violation is a separate issue. So is whether there are better ways of making the point than referring to "pretty pictures" (there are!). My comment is that this is a content dispute, and that Amir should not have been blocked for adding that comment to the article. (Whether he should have been blocked for 3RR violation is a separate matter.) <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 10:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If there was no violation of 3RR, he should not have been blocked just because the admin thought that his edits were POV. If he does it consistently, then the case would go to arbcom. Since when admins got the authority to block people for what they personally think is POV edit? Is that some new kind of policy? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 10:28, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I can't see how images being retouched can promote a certain religion. RickK, instead of blocking him, you may have had more success if you explained to him why you found his edits inappropriate and why he runned the risk of being blocked. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:27, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The description of the pictures as retouched is factual. The way in which this statement was made was slanted. Amir's edits on Baha'i-related articles taken as a piece are slanted against the religion. I think RickK used the discretion granted him to warn this user he stood to be blocked for continuing to make slanted edits. I support this action. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does not matter whether the edit is factual or not. "Factual" is not the issue here. The issue is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia: No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia: Neutral point of view</a>. If Amir is infering from the colors that the photo was retouched, then his claim is an example of original research. If, on the other hand, Amir can cite some source (according to this article; according to that website), then the claim can be made. Note, it would be made in the "According to ..." style, which would also ensure compliance with the NPOV policy because it admits that others disagree. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> an arbiter of truth, and these two policies are what keep us honest. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 15:48, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The pictures are <b>not</b> the issue. Amirs edits were vcrap, of course, and should just have been rolled-back. This is not what we are discussing here, though. The point under discussion is that to Amir's question</p>
<ul>
<li>And who are you to determine what is appropriate and what is not? --Amir 07:36, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>RickK replied</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm a sysop who will block you if you do it again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not something a sysop should say, ever. A sysop should rollback and point to the NPOV policy. Then he should warn that repeated policy violation will lead to blocking. If the user still persists, call the issue to the attention of other editors who will revert the edits quickly. "I am a sysop and will block you because what you say is obviously crap" is not right, imho, even in cases where the edit in question is, indeed, obviously crap. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>They're retouched, like postcard photos that tourists buy. My point is that it isn't unusual and is almost impossible to say without sounding like you're making a big deal out of it (for instance, inferring as Amir does that the retouching has some significance). Amir is clearly deliberately making a big deal out of it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:08, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article content dispute isn't what's being discussed here though. It's whether sysops should block (or even threaten to block) because the quality of an edit that is clearly not vandalism is thought to be poor, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 17:30, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you, too -- this is not at all a valid block. My comment above was just taking advantage of this discussion, as it has revealed some serious confusion over what even constitutes a bad edit. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 17:39, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've unblocked Amir1. There seems to be consensus here that the block was improper, I agree with this. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 19:26, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since my intergrity has been questioned on this issue I will stay away from all of the vandalism that the User makes in the future. I hope someone else will keep track of him, because his edit history is one of contstant anti-other-religions rants and vandalism. Did anybody even bother to check the other things he's edited? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:59, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello all. Thank you for the unblock and for having bothered to discuss this situation a bit. I want to first say I am sorry for having reacted to Rick's unfriendly approach the way I did. I should have handled it smoothely. Regarding Rick's calling my edits on Bahai articles "vandalism", this truly hurts. Even if that one page-top note can be classified as such, still I have a long list of other contributions to those articles. Because of my contributions (and others modifying or editing or improving my contributions) the articles are now slowly moving from the state of being pathetic religious promotional leaflets, into something that is gradually resembling worthy encyclopedic articles; but they are not there yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also would like to point out that the logic of what I told Rick isn't wrong. Adminship is not a license to kill. In an open Internet collaborative project, the general mentality should be to encourage people to stay not to treat them in a way to make them leave the project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I have nothing against any religions, although I am myself irreligious (mind you, not "anti-religious" there is a disticntion), and while I believe people should be free to practice any faith they want, I have a propensity to fight religious or ideological promotional deceptions and try to expose them or at least balance them out with some facts to the best of my ability. If in this process my verbage has been substandard, one can help to improve it, but labeling it "vandalism" is clearly not fair. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 22:38, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, guess what? There's now a full-out revert war going on at <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>.

<dl>
<dd>That's an excellent way of washing your hands of any blame for escalating the edit war. Do you think it's possible that your block and your confrontational attitude worked to fan the flames here? <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 20:59, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Folks, I'd like to report a 3RR violation by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Blair_1706.html" title="User:Robert Blair">User:Robert Blair</a>. The reverts in question are partial reverts, please pay attention to certain sentences in the first paragraph of the introduction. See in particular sentences starting "Some argue that non-circumcision..." onwards. I'll give as the first link a diff of the two similar versions, and as the second a diff between the alternative version. Note also that "207.69.137.207" is known to be Blair.</p>

<p><s>There's a twist to the front page hack: one user (User:Spoogie) uploaded the image, but a different one (User:Hooxer) added it to the front-page template a short time later. Presumably they were working in concert or mutual sockpuppets, trying to make it harder to check contributions. If this was the intention it seemed to have worked: Hooxer was blocked indefinitely, but not Spoogie (until now; all his edits were vandalism in any case).</s></p>
<p><s>Another interesting point is that a Sud-Pol (Mr. Diaper) sockpuppet (<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELampo_517c.html" title="User:Lampo">User:Lampo</a>) was uploading a couple of images at around the same time that Spoogie uploaded the goatse image and Hooxer added it to the front-page template. So (this is just wild speculation here), is it possible that three user accounts were used in concert instead of just two? Perhaps some developers could check IPs for Spoogie, Hooxer and Lampo between 13:30–14:30 UTC on Feb 3.</s></p>

I don't think it'll be a problem to block them for the duration of his 2 month ban.

<p>wait a minute, <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">User:OneGuy</a> copy-pasted this from VP, apparently indeed in reply to JoergenF. So, it appears OneGuy (not me) was insinuating that Joergen may be part of this 'attack'. Not that it matters, though. Joergen appears remarkably slow to grasp the well-meant hints towards 'cite your sources' on Talk:Wiedergutmachung, and may, indeed, be trolling for suckers. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 23:01, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>as I said, it does hardly matter whether JoergenF is consciously part of the stormfront "attack", or if he is just coincidentally nurturing a pov similar to theirs. he may find people a little more impatient because of the stormfront context, and a little more insistent on precise citation of sources, but otherwise this is just business as usual: write about whatever you want, but keep it from the neutral point of view (no rhetorics!), and cite your sources. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 06:38, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>(via edit conflict) Well, let's see. You made multiple accounts following a regular pattern of naming, each with a password identical to its username. People logged in to these accounts and changed the password. Instead of choosing a secure password, you came to this high-visibility page to make a big fuss about how people were hijacking your accounts and how you wanted administrators to secure a password you couldn't be bothered to secure yourself. Many people saw your fuss and thus knew exactly what you were doing. Why are you at all surprised that anyone figured out the password for your latest account?</dd>

<dd>I am atheist because I don't believe in supernatural (gods, soul, angels, etc.), not because there are "errors" in the Bible or "problems" with Islam. I am not anti-religious. I am interested in topics related to Islam, especially because I have Muslim roommates. I am not interested in philosophical arguments about atheism. Why would I want to edit articles about "atheism"? If not believing in supernatural makes me atheist, then I am atheist. If it makes me something else, then I am that.

<p>although I have taken sides with OneGuy before, he does strike me as somewhat disingenious here.

<dd>as soon as they argue their point it ceases to be vandalism, but obviously blanking without comment is. Disputing a statement and then removing it is, well, a dispute.

<dd>Tricky one. Unless that link was spam it was not simple vanderlism which is the only thing exempt from the 3RR. So yes it was technically a violation of the 3RR IMO.

<dd>Further, Newberry's account is incorrect. There were two edit wars. If an edit war begins at the first revert of a revert (my understanding), then certainly Newberry started them both.

<dd>Can you two try to get to a compromise? Maybe ask other users for their input? The 3RR should also give both users some time to cool down. About Newberry's block: I also thought the block was appropriate, and don't quite understand why he was unblocked, as i don't think he was reverting vandalism. But, even lamer than an edit war is a blocking war, so I did not block him again. Anyway, please try to find a common solution.

<p>He was clearly aware of the rule, as my coments made it clear, also he visited the talk page where rmherman has put information about the rule, and said himself that THE RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO HIM since my edits were vandalism. They clearly were not, and moderator rmherman, who has different opinion from me, agrees on that (see my talk page). I have respected the rule, even though I was insulted repeatedly by that user. Will you enforce the rule on him?</p>

<dd>You inserted the claim that the bombing was a war-crime <b>6</b> times today, 151.203.229.38 reverted you 4 times.

<p>It is not true that I have inserted the claim 6 times, in fact one of the edits does not contain the claim (and they differ in other, and there is substantial difference between the posts). The claim is there 5 times, and surely first time is not a "revert". Also, If you count all of my posts than you shold count all the reverts of 151, and he has reverted 5 times. So I have at most 4 reverts to "war crime" claim, if you count like that, and 151 has 5 reverts to the same version. Yet you have given me ban for 24 hours and to him 20 hours. Is it because you did not count well, or are there some other reasons? To punish me for complaining here? I was not aware of breaking the rules, and I was the one who stated respect for them, yet I get punished more - what is your justification for this? It stops well short of treating all sides equally, if you have given both the same ban, then it would perhaps be OK with your interpretation, but this way you stepped from this rule! Also, my password does not work anymore, perhaps I am still banned.</p>
<p>The way I was treated here is completely unfair. I did not break the rule, or at least did not believe that I did, as comments with my posts clearly indicate. The post that was reverted 4 times was substantialy different from the other 2 posts which merely changed one sentence. What is counted as a revert? Also, it is not true that I posted text "war crimes" 6 times - I have made 6 posts and one does not have reference to the war crimes at all, while wording is different in the oters. So, if you want to interpret that way, I made 5 posts wich you consider equivalent, while user 151 has made 5 reverts to the same version. And does the first post count as a revert, or only further posts? Wikipedia clearly states that people who violate 3 revert rule should be treated equally in the same incident, and so if you want to interpret that I broke the rule too (and this can be questioned), then why did I get 24 h and he 20 h? All that while I have stated that I respect the policy, while 151 has stated that it does not apply since my edits are "vandalism" (does he believe that or was that an abuse) - MarkSOp 04:15, 12 Feb 2005</p>

<p>I'm not so sure. It used to be quite common for someone creating a large new article or doing a major rewrite on an old one to move the text to their userspace while doing so, so that they could work on it undisturbed.

<dd>I left the text on his User page but moved it also back to the Space Program article. This whole thing got started when the User used the "Move Article" feature to redirect the existing space article to his own user page. In any event, a User page shouldnt be listed under categories.

<p>That sounds reasonable. I've come across Nickshanks before and he has always struck me as having good intentions. I am pretty sure that he moved the page into his userspapce in order to preserve the page history. However that wasn't the best way of doing it and he will now need an administrator's help to move the article back without losing that history. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 00:03, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>another 3RR in the Gdansk dispute. Since I am a part of the dispute, I did not block this user myself.

<p><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:Dnagod</a> is the user who has tried to organize <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> and members of his white supremacist and eugenics websites to sign up for Wikipedia. He has been trying to insert links into articles and onto talk pages of two white-supremacist websites that he is the webmaster of. On <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a>, editors have allowed him to do this under a "fringe" section in external links, but he wants to insert two further links to his manifesto too. These two links are being repeatedly deleted by a number of other editors, yet Dnagod keeps re-inserting them, and in so doing, has violated 3RR by reverting four times in about five hours at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> by inserting links to the manifestos of two white supremacist websites that he's the webmaster of. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 04:28, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, no. There was an editing error in the link (several errors in the listing, actually), present in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=10120168&amp;oldid=10120059" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=10120168&amp;oldid=10120059" rel="nofollow">original edit</a>. I have fixed the errors, and also added timestamps for each revert. Also, referring to various links as "43" is not good, because if someone adds another link further up the page, the numbers in this section will change. Better is to tag them with names, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transhumanism&amp;diff=10086128&amp;oldid=10086013" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transhumanism&amp;diff=10086128&amp;oldid=10086013" rel="nofollow">original insertion</a>, so you can't lose this way. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:26, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "tough love" approach here, I think, is for the ArbComm to simply forbid EK from editing <i>any</i> Ashlee Simpson, <i>ever</i>.

<dd>I can't agree with this. Though it's frustrating to work with EK, he nonetheless at least tries to make compromises when he edits. I've seen him revert, but that's not very often. After I blocked him he hasn't tried his two edit revert stunt again. I will oppose the ArbCom if they rule on this, even if I am a lone voice in the crowd. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:50, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can comprehend it. True, I'm not nearly as familiar with the dispute as you, or those actively involved. But it doesn't take an expert to see that you are an excellent editor on all other topics, yet completely lose all sense of proportion on Ashley Simpson related articles. If you really wanted to help Wikipedia you'd voluntarily stop editing those articles, and restrict yourself to doing all the other good work you do on Wikipedia, which is vastly more valuable than edit-warring over whether or not the fact that Simpson "co-wrote" her songs should be prominently included in the opening paragraph of the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:00, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Probably not yet. The spambot also uses some .ru and .su domains. We could try blocking all of .su (old Soviet Union, discontinued but then in 2001 they started selling domains), but the trouble is we have no way of searching Google to see if there are any legitimate ".su" external links. The .ru domains would have to be case-by-case. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:36, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a long shot, but I don't suppose there's anyway we can get rid of that junk in the history, is there? At least the entries which are 100% duplicates of one another? One other disturbing thought occurs to me -- this happened right after nofollow was added to external links. Can we be sure this isn't someone with an interest in that debate (given that people have used the incident to argue on both sides of the issue, I can't say I think the person in question was successful, at any rate, if that were the case). - <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWordSmith_c15a.html" title="User:RedWordSmith">RedWordSmith</a> 18:29, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose we could purge the numerous spambot edits using the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html#Partial_undeletion" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">selective undeletion</a> feature, though technically we're only supposed to use that to get rid of copyright violations and sensitive personal information. That wouldn't save much, if any, disk space—the deleted revisions are still stored somewhere—and it wouldn't make any difference to Google—older revisions are not indexed—but it would make the histories more useful. Still, I don't think this is really necessary: massive vandalism attacks happen all too often, and they've never (to my knowledge) been purged from the history. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 18:45, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Raul654 unblocked him after Cantus provided some sort of explanation (I don't know what it was, I've asked about it but haven't heard back yet). I note that Cantus has discussed the matter with Hardouin since returning and has not resumed reverting over this issue. That suggests that the unblocking should be allowed to stand. Incidentally, Netoholic is involved in a dispute of his own with Cantus right now, see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Country_7f9c.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Country">Template talk:Infobox Country</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:29, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Very low blow Michael. Thanks. Cantus and I are actively discussing, with many people, the simple matter of ordering the standard infobox. This has no relationship to whether Cantus violated his ruling on the UK article.

<dd>I made no insinuation and pointed to no conclusions, it's simply information people might want to be aware of in order to get a full picture of the situation. The disputed edits on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> also involved this same infobox. Returning to the original issue, I think the situation is pretty clear. Yes, Cantus violated the ruling, so he got blocked, and since he's been unblocked he's back in compliance so there's no need to reblock. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:26, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>no insinuation and pointed to no conclusions</i>" - Cantus' edits had to do with the population data... just because he used the Infobox to slip in that change once, doesn't mean there is any connection between he and I on this point.

<dd>If I had wanted to poison the well, I would have brought it up at the initial block request, since I already knew about it then. As to why Cantus didn't contact me, well, <s>only he can answer that, but</s> he may have run into Raul on IRC (which I don't use), or he may have looked around for someone who was actively editing at the time (I wasn't online when Cantus was unblocked), or he may have turned to someone from the Arbitration Committee as a form of appealing the block. It's not particularly important, admins don't "own" blocks any more than editors own articles. I still would like to know the explanation he provided, though. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:49, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC) (More info: Cantus did actually try to email me before contacting Raul654, but as indicated, I wasn't online and didn't see the email until after he was unblocked and this discussion took place.)</dd>

<p>Cantus asked me to unblock him on IRC, saying that this was an honest mistake on his part, and that he didn't see Hardouin's offer to discuss until after he was blocked.

<dd>Isn't it about time we stop forgiving his "honest mistakes"? I mean, he is under a pretty strict ruling, and has been before ArbCom more than once. In this case, one extra revert <i>may</i> be accidental, but the second one sure shows he knew what he was doing. It does no good to have a ruling which isn't enforced. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:25, 2005 Feb 11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For my part, I accept the explanation, both from Raul654 and, indirectly, from Cantus. Re: "It does no good to have a ruling which isn't enforced" - the ruling <i>was</i> enforced. As part of its enforcement, appropriate discretion was used in deciding the length of the block initially, and later in reducing the length of the block based on the explanation provided. We don't just mechanically block Cantus for a week every time he makes more than one revert. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:19, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't ask for a full week block, but I'd expect more than a couple of hours or AT LEAST a very explanation as to why. Raul654's explanation is invalid because it <i>doesn't matter</i> whether Hardouin even offered to discuss. What matters is that Cantus reverted a page three times, when he is only allowed one. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:12, 2005 Feb 12 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not the fact that Hardouin offered to discuss that matters, you're right. What matters is that Cantus returned willing to discuss himself, instead of reverting. And 13.5 hours is more than a couple. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 05:22, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And it was two revertions (one more than I'm allowed), not three. And by the way, the first ArbCom request against me was made by Wik. The second ArbCom request was made by myself, and not against me of course, but against Guanaco, but for some strange reason I still don't comprehend both me and Guanaco were punished by the committee. Perhaps this is part of the rules of engagement (you make an ArbCom request against somebody and be prepared to be punished yourself), but I was never aware of it at the time. I never complained about this because I actually got what I was looking for (de-adminship of Guanaco). What it is worrying to me is that these ArbCom decisions seem to be for life. —<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a>…<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantus_e3f2.html" title="User talk:Cantus"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 05:29, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have blocked User:Sandor. This is my first-ever block, so please check to make sure I handled this right. This seemed to fit the pattern described at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Disruption" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Disruption</a>. The user made no edits to the main or talk: namespaces, but clearly zoned straight in to arguing with a particular user (CheeseDreams). A user has been banned for repeated sockpuppetry in the same pattern. I blocked for 3 months, as this was the lenght of time the ArbCom suggested for Rienzo. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanKeshet_ba33.html" title="User:DanKeshet">DanKeshet</a></dd>

<p>If <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigermoon_a647.html" title="User:Tigermoon">User:Tigermoon</a> isn't a CheeseDreams sockpuppet, then he's sure doing a great imitation of one. He comes back after being blocked for proxy editing <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus_53d0.html" title="Cultural and historical background of Jesus">Cultural and historical background of Jesus</a> on CD's behalf. The first thing he does is begin to revert it again, pushing aside a lot of work by several editors to restore an old version favored by CD. After being reverted by several editors (myself included), he is blocked (by whom, I can't recall) for violating the ArbCom order yet again. Then he returned as <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_before_blue_ea37.html" title="User:Red before blue">User:Red before blue</a> (look at that user's contributions....VERY crafty...makes sure his user and talk pages are blue links, not red, before he reverts me). Anyhow, I was upset at this kind of tomfoolery (to put it mildly) and blocked the sock indefinitely...I'm not sure what the protocol is, since I was blocking the sock who had reverted my revert. I figured I should post it here as a record, and anyone who wants to take me to task can do so. I decided, in the interest of propriety, not to revert the sock's edit (since I had just blocked them)...Curps reverted their edit. If you want more details, you can let me know, but mostly I'm just posting here to keep everyone informed who still cares about CheeseDreams's latest antics. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 21:31, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>the real reason is that wikipedia was running rather slow when you posted it and I didn't feel up to looking through the dozen pages I need to confirm any block<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:45, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I really can't blame Bkonrad here. Your version of the template looks bad on my pretty plain (and common) setup: Firefox 1.0 on Windows XP, default monobook.

<li>We'd have solved this a lot sooner if he'd resorted to discussing on the Talk page, rather than just reverting over the last two days. As such, his reverts were pointless since they really did not go toward solving any problems. Also, your Firefox setup is <a href="../../../b/r/o/Wikipedia%7EBrowsers_0139.html" title="Wikipedia:Browsers">not so common</a>, whereas mine is. I was trying to make a correction based on IE. Check the revisions in IE and tell me that <i>I</i> wasn't the one trying to fix a usability problem. Either way, "good intentions" are not part of the Three-revert rule. I am sure if the situation was reversed, I'd be sitting on my ass waiting for the block to expire. After all, if you're right, then I could just keep reverting <i>ad infinitum</i> justifying it with the reason you give for not blocking him.

<li>Having reviewed the edit history Netoholic made a total of 2 direct reverts within 24 hours. The other edits may or may no count as complex reverts. I reserve judgement on the matter<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 02:31, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I originally created this template, and I've been trying to get Netoholic's rationale for insisting that the template not wrap text if a browser is sized smaller. He has not addressed my concerns, and insists that I must not be using IE, when in fact I am using IE. Several people (including myself) have reverted Netoholic's changes not just Bkonrad. He seems to be resisting the concerns of others, or perhaps he is not communicating his case well enough. I would be happy to try and reach a consensus with him, and have made attempts to do so on the talk page. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 00:21, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>When someone runs out of reverts, their only recourse should be to discuss on the talk page. If someone exceeds that limit That is how it is supposed to work. He reverted once too much, and deserved a full 24 hour block for it. He is free to do offline editing, or work under another name/anonymously. 3RR blocks should be fully enforced. This really just looks like admin favoritism. Had I done what he did, even making the same mailing list posting, I am sure I'd still be sitting out for the full block. This is all bad precedent. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 00:44, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)

<dd>REMARKABLY bad precedent. He did something he wasn't supposed to and should have "suffered" the consequences. Michael, I disagree with your actions, especially since you've undone another admin's block (it's not like YOU blocked him and then thought better of it) and he didn't even ASK to be unblocked. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 01:06, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not a precedent at all; other administrators have unblocked 3RR violaters who have a reasonable explanation/apology, and who indicate they won't do it again. The point of blocking is to discourage the behaviour, not punish. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:10, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The purpose of enforcing the three-revert rule with blocks is to prevent revert wars. If we can be satisfied that the revert war will not continue, the block no longer serves any purpose and should be removed. It doesn't matter whose block it was, nobody owns blocks any more than they own articles. Raul654 reversed <i>my block</i> of Cantus yesterday, for similar reasons. I agree with his action in that instance, and I believe unblocking Bkonrad was equally justified. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:06, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The block serves a bigger purpose than solving just one edit dispute - it sends a message that these <i>actions</i> will be punished whenever they happen. By unblocking this person early, you now are sending a very different message. I am not saying every 3RR block must be for the max 24 hours everytime, but you should not step on the decision of another admin. In this case specifically, it was a clear violation of 3RR. Unblocking early just seems unsavory. 24 hours is nothing, and he only had a few of those hours left when you unblocked. Next time, you should just let it be - if <i>only</i> to avoid the perception that you are playing favorites. I was blocked only once for a 3RR violation (and it was <i>far</i> less obvious and could have been debated), but I sat it out without whining. All revert wars are avoidable, and even if I didn't really break 3RR, I certainly could have done something better. 3RR is a strong message, and one I now respect more than I used to. To me, unblocking this admin early just seems like you are weakening that message. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:17, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have written a lengthy reply to Netoholic at <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_3RR_aaa1.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad/3RR">User talk:Bkonrad/3RR</a>. Basically, I was completely taken by surprise by the 3RR block as I had thought we were making good progress in the dispute. I find that Netoholic's resort to seeking legalistic retribution under the 3RR to be extremely unwikilike and counterproductive, as this was not in any sense a <i>sterile edit war</i> which is, by my understanding, what the 3RR was intended to avert. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 16:29, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are free to comment on what you see as my "retribution", but <i>do not</i> give that as any justification for why you should be handled differently under the policy.</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> page does say "<i>The 3RR is intended as a means to stop sterile edit wars.</i>", but I think you are looking at that too narrowly. It does not say "stop edit wars in progress". A secondary application of the punishment is also to discourage <i>future</i> edit wars. Face it, in the time after the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_20b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement">enforcement vote</a> which adopted it, the environment has shifted and all of us <i>have</i> to count our reverts.</dd>
<dd>Since this rule's adoption, many people have been blocked for more innocent and less obvious violations than yours. The point is that we must apply the rule to <i>everyone</i> that breaks it, or it becomes useless. As an admin, you <b>are</b> held to higher standards by the community – not only to avoid violating the 3RR rule but also to humbly accept the punishment if you do. We should never get to the point that this rule is applied differently to admins, or even to people that happen to belong to the mailing list. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:34, 2005 Feb 14 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I think you are looking at that too narrowly</i> -- I think you, on the other hand, are looking at it far too broadly. Let's look at the guidance given in the 3RR: <i>If you like, chat with other Wikipedians whom you respect, and ask them if they could take a look. If you and the person you've asked to help have both needed to revert three times, then it is probably time to ask for the page to be protected and to start looking into dispute resolution.</i> Aside from this page, did you ask anyone else to look into this? Did anyone other than you have to revert my changes? Did you even ATTEMPT to contact me about why I was reverting your changes? While many "innocents" may have run afoul of the 3RR, that does not make it right, nor does it mean it is OK to use it as a legalistic tool for seeking retribution completely independent of trying to resolve whatever the actual disagreement is. That is most definitely NOT the 3RR that I voted to support and I would not support the rule unless that interpretation were explicitly discounted. You talk as if there is a consensus about this and a settled matter, when it is still an ongoing discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You on the other hand, apparently with great care, reverted exactly twice on multiple occasions over a period a few days. This is precisely against the spirit of the 3RR which explicitly <i>does not grant users an inalienable right to three reverts every twenty-four hours or endorse reverts as an editing technique</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently you were more interested in punitive legalistic measures than in actually seeking to reach an amicable resolution to our disagreement. I am not trying to justify being treated any differently under the policy. I am saying that such a strict application of the policy is just plain wrong, regardless of whether it is me, you, or some anon. I never asked to have the ban lifted -- I expressed my concerns about the 3RR to the mailing list and Michael Snow saw fit to lift the ban. I recognize that I reverted four times and that within a strict interpretation I could be banned. So I don't fault Geni at all for applying the ban. But I was and am pretty pissed off at you for jumping directly to seeking punitive recourse rather than talking first. It is not the best way to approach solving disagreements. Nowhere in the 3RR is there any mention of using bans to teach lessons or set examples. I find such an interpretation to be profoundly contrary to wiki-editing and not at all conducive to a healthy community. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 18:09, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You just happened to be careful about not exceeding your "quota" of reverts (and for the record, I would never have reported or blocked you for 3RR without discussing it with you first).

<p>He might argue that I did too, although I would argue that my first edit of the page today (16:00) was not technically a revert as there were eight different edits from five users, at least two of whom are legitimate, between my edit and Jalnet's previous edit the day before. If you feel I violated the rule too, you may as well go ahead and block me too.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate comment on the dispute between me and Jalnet. The fact is, this edit war has been going on for perhaps a month. These should give you all the background you need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#You_are_acting_in_bad_faith" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#You_are_acting_in_bad_faith" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#Jalnet5000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#Jalnet5000" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, and todays exchange: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#Jalnet.27s_vandalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race#Jalnet.27s_vandalism" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>.</p>
<p>The fact is, at this point I cannot have good faith in Jalnet -- because I have seen no evidence that he has done serious research on this topic, or understands even the basics. I have looked over most of his edits and he has made practically no substantive contribution to this article (Rikurzhen has probably contributed the most, but I have contributed a fair amount of content and many sources). Most of his edits involve changing wording. He claims he does this to assure NPOV, but I think (1) the article was NPOV before his edit (indeed, I would argue that it is a model of an NPOV treatment of a contentious topic) (2) his edits are at best weasel words and at worst, misrepresent the state of scientific discussion on race, and (3) are designed to push his own agenda, which is that the essentialist view of race is scientifically correct. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 20:41, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I can tell from the edit history and your entry on this page Jalnet2 has only reveted 3 times<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:49, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, if you look at <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, it's the <i>fourth</i> edit which breaks the rule. I admit the name is somewhat confusing! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 11:45, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
