<p>I really don't know where to begin on this one, but I just want to keep in mind that this conflict is nowhere new, yet it has for a while remained dormant...until today. Anyway in the past there has been many incidents when this user, has repeatedly stalked on my edits and in some cases it came to pure trolling... like these three edits on <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram_8dfc.html" title="Kryvyi Rih Metrotram">Kryvyi Rih Metrotram</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=47849711&amp;oldid=47846180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=47849711&amp;oldid=47846180" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47851190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47851190" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47874795" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47874795" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47876399" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47876399" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48096635" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48096635" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> before the article was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48133119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48133119" rel="nofollow">protected</a>. On demand I can provide at least thirty examples where he stalked on my edits like that, and as this one shows, he did it (and at times continues to) by using a dynamic IP to avoid blockage...it really reached its peak moment on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maladzyechna.html" title="Maladzyechna">Maladzyechna</a> this example is a showcase of just how ridiculous this user can be. Originally it was about getting rid of a title that was inputed by a user who was not aware of wiki policies and functions. I moved it back to the translit version Maladzechna <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maladzyechna&amp;diff=53204616&amp;oldid=48996166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maladzyechna&amp;diff=53204616&amp;oldid=48996166" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Like any stalker would do so, he went straight at it and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maladzyechna&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53204616" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maladzyechna&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53204616" rel="nofollow">reverted</a>. That begun a four month dispute where I went on all possible attempts, including <a href="../../../c/y/r/WP%7ECYR_e0ca.html" title="WP:CYR">WP:CYR</a> that was (and now is) to be a guideline for article titles...And I got the most stubborn resistance one has ever seen (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Cyrillic%29_c396.html#Proposal_for_Belarusian" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Cyrillic)">relevant link</a>). Even after you had <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Belarusian users with professional linguistic knowledge supporting</a>, and when it eventually came to a point where no one would challenge on which title the article should rest, he went on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Talk%7EMaladzyechna_4399.html#Request_for_move_back_to_Maladzechna" title="Talk:Maladzyechna">link</a> resisting the change... In the end we did move the page...and the word Maladzechna became Malad<b>y</b>echna... That's right four months of his stubborn resistance just to add a y... Does one laugh or cry about this?</p>
<p>Now then October/November he is absent on wikipedia. But, recentely he has returned, and really I just do not like knowing that every single edit of mine, particulary on sensitive articles is bound to get reverted by him w/o any consensus or discussion... Really its annoyance more than anything... However there is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> policy which clearly dictates that such behaivour is unacceptable, regardless of what form my edits happen to be. So I decided let it be sooner than later, and managed to set a trap for him. If one can go to my contribs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kuban_kazak" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kuban_kazak" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, then all edits between 14:36, 6 December 2006 and 14:38, 6 December 2006 were made deliberately to check his response...and what do you know? Check contributions for him between 19:04, 6 December 2006 and 14:38, 6 December 2006... all reverts. Oddly enough, I did actually have an excuse for the page moves which I put on his talk page <a href="../../../k/p/b/User_talk%7EKPbIC_c0ec.html#Lack_of_logic_and_respect_to_others..." title="User talk:KPbIC">here</a>, and reverted him again, just to put one final test... And as I am submitting this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/KPbIC" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/KPbIC" rel="nofollow">contribs for 23:4x of the 6th December</a>, same articles. Was it right or wrong for me to test him, you judge, even I get blocked for this, might be slightly extreme, but I won't challege it provided that I have the assurance that upon returning KPbIC will not be stalking me... --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 23:51, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At some point <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> wrote: <i>"You once accused me of Russification, well on one side you are correct"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68720911" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68720911" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. This is the core of the conflict. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> is a Russian user who devotes significant amount of his activity on <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russification.html" title="Russification">Russification</a> of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> history (as well as the other territories, which were taken by Russian Empire). The user recently moved 4 articles on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv_Metro_94cb.html" title="Kharkiv Metro">Kharkiv Metro</a> stations from Ukrainian spelling to Russian spelling. A part of the problem is that the metro stations do not really have a well established English name. But it should be noted that the people of Ukraine have chosen to have the only official language (as stated in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Ukraine_408e.html" title="Constitution of Ukraine">Constitution of Ukraine</a>), which is <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a>, not Russian. The Ukrainian independence, laws, and traditions of Ukraine are recognized by the civilized world, which commonly uses the local names in case establish English names are absent.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Back to <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> alleged accusations, I explained to <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> that his identity is of absolutely no interest to me. My interest is primary limited to the Ukrainian topics, the topics of my country. If there are drastic Russification attempts, such as <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> often used to commit, then it’s my understanding that it should be prevented. Kuban’s attempts are on the edge of vandalism, as basically he’s challenging the integrity of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bigger issue is the relation of a majority and a minority. There are more Russian editors than Ukrainians. While <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is postulated as one of the key elements of Wikipedia, often it’s difficult to achieve. With respect to the Ukrainian topics, instead of bothering with analyzing references, looking for information sources, some use brutal force to substitute NPOV by Russian POV. The rest of Wikicommunity very often does not care. Frustrated with the situation, many new Ukrainian editors simply leave, which only amplifies the prevalence of Russian POV. In the end, instead of being a source of reliable information, Wikipedia may fail into the hands of such majority groups. This is the challenge that Wikipedia is facing. --<a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 03:06, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Standard argument, that is half full of lies... anyway talking about NPOVs and integrities then I invite anyone to take a look on my contributions for the period that KPbIC was absent October and November... I knew he was gone, so had I wanted to choose to troll and <i>russify</i> articles, would I not take advantage of not having a stalker? Please if anyone finds anything in my contributions of that time then his argument might stand...however so far there is really is nothing for him to bite into... which immediately discredits every comment about <i>russification</i> which I must say is an extremely abstarct term, and in some cases is actually offensive if <b>all</b> my actions (according to him) are Russification. So that means, hypotherically every article I edit that is related to Ukraine is Russification...</dd>
<dd>As for Kharkiv Metro stations, then I agree with Alex Bakharev and actually with the moves... and as explained above it was but a simple provocation, to test whether KPbIC has grown up since his departure in October...I even told him on his talk page that should he raise the issue on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Talk%7EKharkiv_Metro_fbd9.html" title="Talk:Kharkiv Metro">Talk:Kharkiv Metro</a> without first reverting, as a proof to me, then I would support him. One needs not be an expert to deduce that he has not.</dd>
<dd>Just to be clear, if there is a dispute on articles, I, unlike KPbIC prefer not to edit war if the people approach with necessary comments on a talk page... There is a <a href="../../../e/q/_/WP%7EEQ_4006.html" title="WP:EQ">WP:EQ</a> which I strive to follow... yet some people, like him do not.</dd>
<dd>Finally, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> clearly states that insulted national conscience (his second argument) is no reason to harass other users by stalking on their edits... and the same goes with the <i>integrity and NPOV</i> arguments that he brought up... And just for the record, there are plenty of Ukrainian users contributing, yet so far only one seems to be harassing a Russian user by stalking his edits and then doing a big-bully accusation. I wonder why noone of the "Russian majority" is not extending him such a favour...And that is not because only 10% of his other edits are useful, i.e. as opposed to the 90% of them being reverts of mine. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 18:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Here is a recent example <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>, a very charged topic, there was a very lengthy discussion on whether or not to include a controversial category. Even KPbIC participated, in the talk page and the dominating consensus was not to include it as genocide. However new users are often oblivious to this and sometimes this POV-pushing takes place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=92574338&amp;oldid=92448388" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=92574338&amp;oldid=92448388" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. However, per all consensus on talk pages when thousands of people revert this its ok for KPbIC, when I do it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92576568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92576568" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, its obviously not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92577113" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92577113" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Like I said, I was patient for a long time, but its wearing thin, and frankly at times like these I ask that an admin takes serious action. Not just for the edits over the last two days, but for everything in the past. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 18:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are two issues here. One is the move war over the names for the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv_Metro_94cb.html" title="Kharkiv Metro">Kharkiv Metro</a> stations. I think <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlexandr_Kravchuk_b9de.html" title="User:Olexandr Kravchuk">User:Olexandr Kravchuk</a> and <a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">User:KPbIC</a> are right here. <a href="../../../d/d/i/User%7EDDima_3374.html" title="User:DDima">User:DDima</a> and Kuban kazak wrote nice articles about these stations but the name should be based on the rules of Ukrainian language not on a strange Russian/Ukrainian mix. I have moveprotected the articles in the Ukrainian version. If Kazak or somebody else wants to move them back he can file <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> but I doubt it would succeed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second issue is that I agree that KPbIC (when he is onwiki) appears to stalk Kuban kazak and <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a>. E.g. I strongly suspect that even in this case he became involved into the move war of Kuban kazak vs Olexandr Kravchuk not because he had the Kharkiv metros stations on his watchlist but because he monitors all Kazak's edits. This is a recurring pattern and in the most cases (unlike the Kharkiv Metro names) it leads only to a petty harassment of Kazak without any benefit to the project. I have my own history of conflicts with KPbIC, so I might be biased in my assessment of the situation but I ask an uninvolved admin to look into the stalking allegations. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 06:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issues here have to be separated. As far as moves where concerned, those where indeed not "unexplained" as KK claimed when reverting them, but simply "unproposed". Unproposed, at least informally at talk, moves are generally a bad idea, but should not be automatically reverted. Those moves were sensible. As the articles are now at those sensible locations, the issue is moot.</p>
<p>The core of KK's complaint is that KPbIC habitually stalks his edits and reverts, picks fights and edit wars in various articles. I can ascertain that this is true. The editor indeed stalks KK (and myself) and while I find being stalked amusing and even thrilling to be that editor's obsession, I can see that Kazak has no obligation to take the stalker with a similar humor and can be, as such, annoyed by him. Stalking is really an issue here. KPbIC' response is basically off-topic. He has grievances about Wikipedia's systemic bias, he has his eternal grievances against "the Russians" in general, he invokes some unrelated issues in Ukrainian politics, etc. This all does not belong to WP:ANI.</p>
<p>Kuban kazak complains that he is being stalked for many months by user:KPbIC. I can certify that this is true. The only issue here is whether the KPbIC' habit in question falls under Harassment ("following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor" , "stalking another editor who is acting in good faith" and "constantly nit-picking in violation of required courtesy") or it is a legitimate activity of correcting the problem editor. In my opinion KK is not a problem editor but a committed contributor (not without the fault like all of us) and KPbIC' activity qualifies as Harassment. I can tell because I am also an object of KPbIC stalking. I simply take it with pity rather than with anger. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 05:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>*sigh* Stalking is a big deal. To answer Kuban's original question, and I do think Alex's and Irpen's agreement that it is stalking is convincing (and therefore worrying), this noticeboard probably won't solve this kind of problem. Your best chance would be to file an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> and go to arbitration if the behavior doesn't change, or perhaps even make an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">arbitration request</a> immediately. Arbcom has banned people for stalking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Locke_Cole#Locke_Cole_banned_for_a_month_for_harassment" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Locke_Cole#Locke_Cole_banned_for_a_month_for_harassment" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring#Skyring_banned_for_wikistalking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring#Skyring_banned_for_wikistalking" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, but, based upon severity and the offender's productivity, it has also devised useful remedies for preventing harassment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Moby_Dick#Moby_Dick_may_be_blocked_for_continuing_to_harass" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Moby_Dick#Moby_Dick_may_be_blocked_for_continuing_to_harass" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Locke_Cole#Netoholic_and_Locke_Cole_not_to_interact_with_each_other" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Locke_Cole#Netoholic_and_Locke_Cole_not_to_interact_with_each_other" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

<dd>All the conflicts I had with <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> were caused by his attempts of Russification. On <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev_Metro_585c.html" title="Kiev Metro">Kiev Metro</a> he was pushing for the Russian language map. He did the same on <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryvyi_Rih_Metrotram_8dfc.html" title="Kryvyi Rih Metrotram">Kryvyi Rih Metrotram</a>. He attempted to impose the Russian spelling for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maladzyechna.html" title="Maladzyechna">Maladzyechna</a>. Exactly as he moved the 4 articles on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv_Metro_94cb.html" title="Kharkiv Metro">Kharkiv Metro</a> to the Russian spelling.</dd>

<dd>I'm primary interested in contributing on the topics of my country, Ukraine. I check the Ukrainian new article announcement portal, Ukrainian projects on subdivisions and language, and I do check contributions of users that are know of being involved in Ukrainian topics, and Kuban kazak is among them. Nonetheless, I decline the alleged accusations of me wikistalking Kuban kazak. I'm not following him from article to article. Kuban kazak had conflicts and problems on other issues (like on <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_metro.html" title="Moscow metro">Moscow metro</a>), which I don't care of. Having no significant interest in Russia, I'm not getting involved in his other conflicts. I'm not supporting his opponents based on the "enemy of my enemy is my friend" principle. But when Kuban kazak comes to Ukrainian articles being in Russification mood, here I get involved. I did found out that Kuban kazak moved 4 articles (not 3 or 5) by checking his contributions. But this is the common approach to respond to vandalism issues. When I notice, someone vandalized a page, I fix it, and I check vandal’s contributions to find out whether the other articles were vandalized. As a vandal probably getting pleasure out of vandalizing the wikipedia, possibly Kuban kazak is pleased by his Russification attempts. When disagreement is expressed with his attempts, he may be under negative emotion. Yet, there is no valid reason to put the cart in front of the horse. It’s his attempts to Russificate the articles of the neighbors of Russia, predominantly Ukraine that when discovered, may cause his dissatisfaction. It’s not the other way around. What should I do, keep my eyes closed when someone is damaging the articles, compromizing the neutrality of them? My advice to Kuban would be to leave the Russification spirit out, and I’m always open to cooperate on improving the encyclopedia.</dd>

<p>That reply above does not really need a comment. It supports the point about the user's attitude well enough. But I will comment on the previous proposal, especially since Kuban kazak asked me to. I know that Krys makes occasional useful contribtuions and find his stalking of myself really just a rather minor neucsance. I got used to being stalked from time to time and mostly ignore it unless the stalkers' actions go beyond bugging me but causes a major damage to encyclopedia and is a large scale harassment, like in some cases <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive153_32e8.html#Personal_attacks.2C_harassment.2C_baiting_and_pestering_by_user:Oden" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive153">this</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOden%2FArchive_2&amp;diff=93358630&amp;oldid=93015856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOden%2FArchive_2&amp;diff=93358630&amp;oldid=93015856" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>) or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_b366.html#Wikistalking_Is_Never_Acceptable" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abu badali">this</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Abu_badali#WikiStalking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Abu_badali#WikiStalking" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAbu_badali&amp;diff=93112664&amp;oldid=93090828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAbu_badali&amp;diff=93112664&amp;oldid=93090828" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>).

<dd>I must say, the arrogance displayed by KPbIC is extreme, but not surprising. The point is its not as easy as to say Russification of Ukrainian articles must be allowed. For example, <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg_I_of_Chernigov_e8de.html" title="Oleg I of Chernigov">Oleg I of Chernigov</a>, this actually was a source of previous vote fraud, when an infamous archtroll <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">User:AndriyK</a> moved it with no consesnsus to its twisted Ukrainian name Oleg of Chernihiv. Then vote frauded the request to move it back. In fact one of his first edits was (a stalk on my contribs) a revert of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oleg_I_of_Chernigov&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50108028" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oleg_I_of_Chernigov&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50108028" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> the return to the move, that is despite the fact that the article was moved shortly afterwards anyway, by an admin... Disregard to consensus, disregard to other users... a classic patter of his. Or the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Square_%28Kiev%29_4e8e.html" title="European Square (Kiev)">European Square (Kiev)</a>, where he twice reverted me by arguing that I was russifying the article. Ok, I must say this, Ukraine was privledged and fortunate (or in KPbIC's view un-) to be united with Russia for over three and a half centuries. I mean even my ancestors, <a href="../../../k/u/b/Kuban_Cossacks_1735.html" title="Kuban Cossacks">Kuban Cossacks</a> came from <b>the</b> Ukraine and in KPbIC's views, must be still Ukrainian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ukrainian_historical_regions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67520848" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ukrainian_historical_regions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67520848" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, so if such, that means his claim that I have no right to edit Ukrainian articles is even more absurd. Taking this extremely contradictive logic further, that means, my homeland, Kuban is Ukraine (again I did not say this, I am just following his thoughts). So, again according to KPbIC, I am now actually in Ukraine, whilst he is in Minnesota and hence (again according to him) I have more rights to edit Ukrainian articles and stop Ukrainisation attacks on shared history. (Such as historical names for <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Square_%28Kiev%29_4e8e.html" title="European Square (Kiev)">European Square (Kiev)</a>). However the part of that statement that is true is the shared history. In particular the events that happened to the land that make up today's Ukraine, (not only <i>the</i> Ukraine, but other neighbouring lands that were incorporated into the republic over the course of the 20th century), what heritage have they took from the pre-Ukrainian times etc, and as it turns out to be that heritage is much MUCH stronger than anyone things it is. For example why would in the course of last spring/summer over 10 regional governments elevate Russian as an official language? Why indeed do the people of those areas almost exclussively speak Russian? So why should wikipedia be biased against those people? The city of <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkov.html" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> is a perfect example of this, and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv_Metro_94cb.html" title="Kharkiv Metro">Kharkiv Metro</a> should also be. Is that Russification? Not really, it is my attempt for wikipedia to be fair towards everyone. For example nobody is trying to get me to move all of the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Category%7EKiev_Metro_stations_2f88.html" title="Category:Kiev Metro stations">Kiev Metro stations</a> to their Russian names (articles which I alone wrote). Now before KPbIC shall start arguing about what is what and that I am not from Ukraine so hence I cannot make those decisions, let I remind that Minnesota is much farther away from Ukraine than I am (three hours drive to reach the Kerch Straight)</dd>
<dd>Now then, continuing to make sense of his extremely contradictive views, how, and for what reason did he become involved with <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>. The latter country, unlike Ukraine, actually has Russian as its <b>primary</b> state language. Now there are Belarusian users on wikipedia, some very useful contributors, <a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">some</a> I must say are not useful at all, except for starting disputes and edit wars. However that does not stop KPbIC from trolling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brest%2C_Belarus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67521089" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brest%2C_Belarus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67521089" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, POV pushing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Marynich&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49914258" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Marynich&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49914258" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Na%C5%A1a_Niva&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49913956" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Na%C5%A1a_Niva&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49913956" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and of course the circuis around <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maladzyechna.html" title="Maladzyechna">Maladzyechna</a>, which I must say I did not move to <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molodechno.html" title="Molodechno">Molodechno</a> (the Russian name) but to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maladzechna.html" title="Maladzechna">Maladzechna</a>, a different variant of the Belarusian transliteration (a system which was a mess, as there was <b>no</b> guideline whatsoever on how to title articles now has order partly due to my efforts on <a href="../../../c/y/r/WP%7ECYR_e0ca.html" title="WP:CYR">WP:CYR</a> which KPbIC VIGOROUSLY opposed). Last and not least in almost all cases here is his claim that I had no such rights as I was from Russia not Belarus... Well KPbIC, I must stress this, and break you some news...even though being born and living most of my life in my dear Varenikovskaya, my mother happens to be from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polotsk.html" title="Polotsk">Polotsk</a>...

<p>Despite repeated warnings user Tvoz has repeatedly violated the WP:Living rule regarding the <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> entry. At the time of Rockefeller's death in 1979 there was much speculation, but no facts, regarding what happened. Tvoz had made multiple attempts to add salacious rumors to the effect there was a young women (he names her) involved, she had an adulterous relationship (this story follows details on his marriage), she helped cause his death from heart attack during sex, she had a motive for seeing him dead (named in his will), and she tried to cover up the episode and mislead police. There was no official report or criminal charge or lawsuit and no witnesses--it's all gossip--and it clearly violates our policy about negative statements and insinuations about living people (the women is in her mid 50s now). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The blocking administrator, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">User:Philwelch</a> (redlink is correct), is aware of the unblock request and has posted his views on the userpage, so the block is ready to be reviewed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There's discussion on the talk page, and it's clear that ThuranX's edit summaries <i>are</i> deceptive, and that his use of the deletion debate is incorrect. I'd feel better if somebody else had blocked, but I see no reason to overturn. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 01:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll admit I'm surprised by that analysis. It appears to me that Philwelch, in his capacity as an editor, blanked an entire article after talkpage discussion that elicited mixed views and turned it into a redirect. ThuranX disagreed with that action and reverted with an edit summary "rv vandalism." That was less than helpful but I can't see it as warranting a 24-hour block, particularly by the administrator who was engaged in an ongoing content dispute with the editor. Granted the user has some rough edges and some history. Anyway, I just wanted to make sure someone looked at it. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:59, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>From the talk page there seemed to be agreement that a merge was a good idea, and that it wasn't just Philwelch in favour of the idea. I'm not one to count heads, but 3-1 with the 1 maintaining that the AfD result was a binding reason to do nothing...granted, Philwelch certainly shouldn't have made the block. We need another opinion here. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 02:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>II am second that Philwelch shouldn't have made the block. Thuran was incivil and was already warned for incivility, but Philwelch should not have blocked him. IMHO blocking for rvv in summary is warranted after a few specific warnings and there was non. If nobody objected I would give Thuran a stern warnings and unblock him. Also a warning for Phil is IMHO warranted as well <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 03:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've unblocked and asked him, ThuranX, to engage on the talk page (you're right, Brad, that <i>was</i> somewhat out-of-character for me). Whether Phil needs to be engaged further on this matter remains an open question, and perhaps one best pursued by ThuronX himself. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 03:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

You have drawn the attention of someone who didn't like what you did in the past, and who quite rightly alerts the community when you do similar things again later.

<dd>I always assume good faith, even when the going gets really sticky&#160;:). I have been watching this with some concern, especially since the article edit history is now containing the words "responsible authority". Of course the problems are not insurmountable, and of course this editor has the right to edit unless proven otherwise. I was looking at "dymanic IP", and of course it is likely to be. But it held steady for a long time and now has started flitting about. To be fair my neck hair was raised by the "possible sock puppet" warning on a couple of the talk pages, plus a somewhat intractable attitude displayed, hence my initial request for an experienced eye. I'd appreciate it if that eye stayed looking for a while, please. I don't have any particular interest in the article.

<p>is tagging ips by sockpuppet tags really acceptable? I observed the following recent tags: <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.60.190.93.html" title="User:82.60.190.93">User:82.60.190.93</a>, <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.60.190.93.html" title="User talk:82.60.190.93">User_talk:82.60.190.93</a>. At least it may lead to impractical results: an ip may next time be someone else's ip, and however there is a ready tag, then totally misleadingly labeling another editor as someone's sock. Then, I am not aware how that sock accusation is based: where are the grounds actually to make such tag - are taggers not at all required to document grounds for their accusations; both regarding the actual identification, and also regarding the reasons why the sock allegedly is an abuse case. Then, a small side concern: sockpuppet tagging is a way to make personal insult to someone, and rather lomg-term one, perhaps permanent in record here, so: is the tagging not qualified in any way?. Should sockp tagging be assessed as any other personal attack, and if not, why. Well, and finally, admin intervention is needed if those now tagged pages are to be deleted, or otherwise refactored to erase attacks and insults etc. Knowing that the editor who made the tagging, is not willing to listen to reason in many cases, some admin sanctions would be needed if that person is desired to get to listen. <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObRoy_0a03.html" title="User:ObRoy">ObRoy</a> 21:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to bother everyone, but I wanted to inform the admins of what has been occurring here. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> have been in a disagreement over Messianic Judaism. While both are entitled to their opinion, <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> has remained calm and mature about this while <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> feels the need to belittle <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a>. This disagreement has been quiet for about a week as <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> has not been editing since then, but <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> felt that he needed to stir the pot a bit and state today: "Keep us posted on any other special messages Hashem sends you, while here on Earth all the other good Jews wait for the real Jewish Messiah to show up. IZAK 10:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC) Personally I find <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a>'s behavior immature and childish. He has a history of being uncivil when someone disagrees with him. I am a complete outsider in this except that I have emailed <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> about 2 weeks ago just to say to keep his chin up in all this. My issue here is that I have seen countless times on here that when people disagree, instead of doing it the right way, it leads to childish and immature behavior. Shouldn't we leave the games to the kids? Anyway, thank you for your time. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 19:02, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Religious propaganda of <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">user:inigmatus</a>, as exemplified in the section you qouted, has absolutely no place in wikipedia. We are here to edit encyclopedia, not to provide "this frontline position for Messianic Judaism". Also, his claim "I am stepping down as project leader <i>at the immediate direction of the Lord himself</i>" makes me question either his sanity or neutrality: I would certainly strongly object to have editors here who in their editing are guided by some foreign God rather than by rules of wikipedia. Not to say that we have <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> to guide and direct us.&#160;:-) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 20:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mikkalai, <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a>'s sanity is not the issue here.

Nor can I see how a fervent believer expressing his beliefs on a project discussion page regarding his project-related activities necessarily qualifies as insanity or lack of judgement, just sincere belief. However, I really can't take too many shots at <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a>'s actions either, as I have a rather sick sense of humor and might have made similar comments in the past myself. Personally, I think we're all best served if we approach all subjects in wikipedia from as fair and objective a position in possible, and that includes each other's comments, and while I do not in any way fault Inigmatus's actions, I acknowledge that they were almost certainly a driving force behind IZAK's criticizable actions. Unfortunately, I can't really see any other way of avoiding the subject than by trying to avoid using religiously-loaded language, on either article, talk, or project pages, and actually only using it when absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your last suggestion sounds reasonable, with a word of caution, though. There are some seemeingly religious phrases that are just a matter of speech, kind of "oh, God" or "Allah forbid!"

<dd>It comes to my mind that filing such complaints on behalf of a third person looks like a harassment to me, especially keeping in mind the mildness of the quoted IZAK's quip. If the other side feels insulted, it may demand an apology, and it is quite possible IZAK will withdraw his commment. If he will refuse, then we have a case, but not before. We are people here not robots, and running around and unnecessarily policing other people speech should be frowned upon. There is a blurred bounday betwen jokes and insults, and only the receiving side has the right to decide, unless we have clear cut cases such as "you moron" or "your fascist edits". `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 19:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it comes to my mind that when I see someone being uncivil on here, even if I am a third-party, that it should be reported on here. Why should we turn a blind eye to it? If you see an old lady fall down in the street, would you turn your back on her? C'mon Mikkalai....be reasonable. IZAK was clearly acting like a child, regardless of what ignimatus said and the fact that you are actually justifying his actions is ridiculous. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 20:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When you see someone uncivil, why don't you talk to the person privately first? Even anon vandals are supposed to be warned before being blocked. And I am not "actually justifying". Too bad that you seem to have a bad habit to read between lines. And I guess it is quite useless to tell you to stop unwarranted policing and talk to people instead. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 21:29, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no request for arbitration from IZAK or inigmatus, and I am free to express opinions about any of them just as you did. Since I am not a Jew, believe me, their intersectarian squabbles are indifferent to me. At the same time I express an opinion that yours looks like harassment and spamming the admin's noticeboard, since you did not provide any evidence of attempts to resolve the issue amicably. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 22:37, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Looks like harassment??"" So you don't agree that IZAK was being rude to inigmatus? He has been provoking him for several weeks now and I am surprised at you, being at admin, that you are attempting to turn it around to make me look like the bad guy where all I am trying to do was show what was occurring. And to consider this "spam" is ridiculous!! As I clearly stated in my last messages, I am done talking to you.

<p>If I may. I was not aware of a process to forward complaints about rude behavior to admins... though I am now. I tend to be very lenient with those who I believe sincerely misunderstand me or what I believe, so I would not have submitted this particular request for review, but I am glad it's here for the record. IZAK has crossed the line of civility with me several times in my opinion, and if anything I'd like this discussion to be kept on file as an archive that proves that his comments towards me are quite distracting and offensive to other people as well as myself. Personally, I don't think it really is helpful to engage in such character-smashing and nitpicking; especially on a talk page for a project that has nothing immediately to do with the character-smashing. I provided in the same discussion a reasonable explanation of what I meant when I wrote the "frontline" phrase. To be honest though, I am a little concerned that my work on wikipedia seems to be policed by IZAK for practically any WP violation, when I've done my best to read up on process, be courteous, and contribute to an NPOV standard for the articles I'm engaged in. As I implied above, I believe IZAK misunderstand me and my beliefs, and that is why I have not pursued a complaint process such as this admin notice board. But again, I'm glad it's here for the record. Sincerely, <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 23:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Inigmatus....I knew you weren't going to complain about IZAK, but I just could not sit by and watch him bully you any longer. All one has to do is look at his user contributions to see the snide comments he puts on his edit summaries regarding you and it is obvious he has been policing your work. Personally, I have nothing against IZAK. I just feel that his actions are taking away from your work, which contrary to his beliefs, are important. I am glad to see you are acting as the better person here and I apologize if I overstepped by reporting this here without discussing it with you first. It needed to be on record as you stated. It's a shame that other people on here don't feel that way.

<dd>You still continue to miss my main point, although now you yourself agree with it: before grabbing big guns, talk to involved people first. By the way, did you inform IZAK about your proxy axe grinding? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not missing your point because you don't have one. If you read what I wrote to Ingimatus, I clearly stated that I was going to report IZAK's behavior regardless. And yes, I am sure IZAK knows about this as I linked this to the talk page where this was being discussed. Anything else I missed? Unless I'm mistaken, isn't it your job as an admin to stop editors from harassing others as IZAK has been doing?? It shouldn't matter who reports the incident. It was an infraction that I noticed so I reported it. Maybe you should re-read some of the words I have written above because it seems like you are missing MY main point <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 01:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well he's exhausting my patience. Can't speak for the community. He got his second 3RR violation in 4 days today (I haven't checked to see if he has been blocked yet for todays violation). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WarHawkSP&amp;diff=93522494&amp;oldid=93489530" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WarHawkSP&amp;diff=93522494&amp;oldid=93489530" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. He's been blocked before for vandalism to that article, which is his only article-space entry he has edited( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/WarHawkSP" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/WarHawkSP" rel="nofollow">see here.</a>). The only other edits he has are to AN/I regarding edit wars on that page, and to his own user/talk pages.</p>
<p>This is such a rampant case of repeated POV pushing and blatant disregard for policy, I believe administrative action is necessary.<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 06:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: He's been reported at 3RR, and after being told he violated 3RR in the above diff, he's proceed to revert up to his 6th revert, and then filed a request for page protection on his version. I should note here that his reverts are removing multiple sourced materials that there is talk page consensus to include (his grounds for doing so are allegations that newsgroup postings, even those verified to be from the subject of the article and on a subject inherently notable to the topic at hand, are not reliable sources. There is considerable consensus on the article talk page that in this instance they meet all criteria for inclusion, especially given the notoriety of the subject for engaging in flame wars on usenet, to the point where Daily Victim did a comic on it and it became a notable web meme. It should be further noted that the link to the daily victim comic, and link to a less than flattering article on Opposable Thumbs at <a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Technica_7ea3.html" title="Ars Technica">Ars Technica</a> were also repeatedly removed by WarkHawkSP.)</p>
<p>At this point, I'm requesting a block on WarHawkSP for exhausting the community's patience. I find it ironic that his user page notes the "SP" as standing for "Sock puppet", when in this case it should be more like "single purpose".<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 13:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Update 2: He's removed the 4RR warning and another vandalism warning from his talk page. As I'm not sure what the current status on policy regarding removing warnings is, I won't re-add them, but he was notified of a 12hr block. I'm not sure exactly how long is left on it, I think around 6 hrs, but I believe it to be an insufficient cool off period, especially given the time it was issued (3am eastern time? Midnight pacific? He'll be asleep for that whole period). Seems to me if a 12 hour block were to be effective, it would need to start around 10am EST, which correlates to 1500 UTC, which should cover the most primetime editing periods, yet leave him sufficient time should he indeed decide to be constructive to do SOME editing between the hours of 10 and midnight eastern. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 13:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Supreme Cmdr also edits from bellsouth out of florida - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.155.235.198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.155.235.198" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>As mentioned before, Derek Smart's screen name is Supreme Cmdr (across the internet, not necessarily here), and his offices are in Ft. Lauderdale, something that WarHawkSP has also tried to conceal by removing from the article.

<dd>I think what hasn't been mentioned is that "both" Supreme Cmdr and Warhawk seem to have the fine art of "rules-lawyering" down pat. Either poster is quick to mention any and all relevant Wiki policies they can cling to in order to justify their edits and reverts. To be sure, this sort of person would also be aware of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, though they would never mention it. It would also explain why You-Know-Who will never fess up to being <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupreme_Cmdr_e687.html" title="User:Supreme Cmdr">You-Know-Who</a> <i>or</i> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarHawkSP_5e39.html" title="User:WarHawkSP">You-Know-Who</a>. Or in other words, if Derek Smart <i>were</i> hypothetically editing his posts, because of his careful study of the rules, he knows that he would always have to appear to be someone who isn't Derek Smart or all of his changes could be dismissed and reverted. <a href="http://www.3000ad.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=003919;p=1#000012" class="external text" title="http://www.3000ad.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=003919;p=1#000012" rel="nofollow">Even if he was painfully aware of the existence of an article related to himself</a>, he could never get involved (much less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Derek_Smart/Archive4&amp;t&amp;section=6#Comments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Derek_Smart/Archive4&amp;t&amp;section=6#Comments" rel="nofollow">own up</a> to it).

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>In the past few days, this guy made some highly incivil edits. The first one was on <a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">User_talk:Khoikhoi</a>, where he apparently has the pretention to teach an admin how to do his job. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93624512" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93624512" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></p>
<p>Here are some "nice" stuff from the diff. "Your failure to participate in that thread is, in my opinion, further indicative of a disregard of Wikipedia's guidelines on etiquette.", "I fail to see how you can serve any real use on Wikipedia." and above all, "the next RfC you will be reading might not be someone elses', but your own". The user apparently fails to grasp the principles of wikipedia, and threatening someone with an RfC borderlines on trolling.</p>
<p>The second "nice" edit was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGrafikm_fr&amp;diff=93617773&amp;oldid=93566228" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGrafikm_fr&amp;diff=93617773&amp;oldid=93566228" rel="nofollow">my own talk</a>, where the user basically threatens to "review my contributions", that is to say, to stalk someone else's past edits because he fancies to. I find such an attitude highly disturbing.</p>
<p>He got an informal warning from Inshaneee and Alex Bakharev on his talk, but I think a further reflection on the matter and a potential enforcement might be necessary on the present page. I hope it will get some more attention than the previous one, too.

<dd>Great. But please, remember that not all publicity images are acceptable on Wikipedia. Per <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> item #1, we only use unfree images when it's not possible to create a free one. Note that, in cases where no free replacement is known to exists, but could be created, we stick to using no image at all instead of using a replaceable unfree image. This pretty much rules out images of active music performers. Yes, this is the most abused criterion on <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, but it's still policy, and has be supported by Jimbo himself. --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 18:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've managed to save something like 4 photos, one album cover, one logo and two group photos where there is no chance at all of Free Use image being created. The remaining images are all copyright violations and I've tagged them for speedy deletion as such, they're not even lifted from the artists websites, just random webpages, mainly music magazine sites - some were even lifted from Photobucket. What was more annoying was the fact most of the images were actually unused. There's one image that is missing a source altogether so if an admin wants to delete that too, that would be much appreciated. <font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 18:54, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What Tom said. Speaking as the non-arbitrator in question, it seems to me to be necessarily implied by the Arb Comm decision as it currently stands.

In that instance MONGO unprotected a page which he had <b>not</b> been editing at all recently (if ever). It had previously been protected three days prior by Seabhcan, but subsequently unprotected and reprotected by two other admins. This might thus be called a 'wheel war' and the ArbCom is apparently assuming MONGO's action was motivated by his ongoing conflict with Seabhcan elsewhere... but it could also have been a good faith unprotection on the assumption that the dispute was resolved. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>seeing as RunedChozo has come to AN/I, i think it would be appropriate to mention that this user has been aggressively revert warring, for which he has been blocked several times. he has also been blocked before for exhibiting the same behaviour as soon as his block has expired. he was recently blocked for three days for revert warring, and as soon as his block has expired he is back, doing the exact same things again. as for my apparent lying, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_as_a_diplomat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92473890" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_as_a_diplomat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92473890" rel="nofollow">he had inserted his own OR</a>, and every revert since then has been to that version. and i have been involved in every discussion on the talk page, while RunedChozo has been involved in not one of substance. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:19, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Itaqallah starts lying by calling a properly sourced item in the article "Original Research", doesn't mention his own constant edit-warring and POV-pushing that I've been trying to counteract so that the articles are actually fair and neutral (let's face it, "Mohammed the Diplomat" right now is a joke, nothing more than "mohammed was so great let's all worship him" fluff).

<p>This is not cool. Please cease lengthening his block if all he's doing is aruging on his talk page. Nobody's going to unblock him until it's over; admins need to walk away and let situations cool down rather than continue to provoke them with multiple (what, three now?) block extensions when the only offense is arguing on the talk page. He may be too disruptive to be a Wikipedia participant, but the lot of you should be ashamed of yourselves for this. For shame.

<dd>The results of the checkuser have come in with the conclusion being <i>possible</i>. Nevertheless, let me make a case for why the IP address in question that led to the extended block is most likely <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERunedChozo_5acb.html" title="User talk:RunedChozo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RunedChozo_de2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RunedChozo">contribs</a>). First, note the previous request for checkuser that came back confirmed. The IP address from that confirmed IP address comes from Houston, Texas (see <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=129.7.35.126" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=129.7.35.126" rel="nofollow">WHOIS lookup</a>). Both IP addresses part of the more recent checkuser (the one the ended as only <i>possible</i>) come from Houston as well (see <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=70.114.237.14" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=70.114.237.14" rel="nofollow">WHOIS lookup one</a> and <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=70.114.236.109" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=70.114.236.109" rel="nofollow">two</a>).

<p>Hypothetical question: If I were to add the statement "Damon is referred to as "the clown prince of porn" for his comic sensibility and "The Hedgehog" because of his hairy body." to the article on Matt Damon, would that be a BLP violation? How is it any less of one because it's Ron Jeremy? If it's common knowledge, it should be easy to source. If it isn't able to be sourced, it shouldn't be in the article. That's not to say that each and every living person article should be stubbed, of course, but in this case there is too much bad mixed in with the good.

<dd>I can't speak for any other editor but myself. Why do I find Frise's actions problematic? One, he's removing accurate-but-unsourced content, rather than taking the time to source it himself. He's not removing inaccurate content, according to the sample at which I looked. Two, he's doing it quickly, meaning that lots of accurate content will be lost, because it's faster to run around deleting than it is to run around sourcing. Three, he's using a cleaver when he needs a paring knife, and has caught up a lot of innocuous info in his deletions (e.g., in the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Jude_Law_af73.html" title="Jude Law">Jude Law</a> deletion, he took out simple details like the fact that Law was married and divorced, has several children, was engaged to Sienna Miller, etc.). And finally, this still looks like <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to me - particularly the part about coming here to talk about his actions.

<dd>I think it's more to do with editors wanting to improve an article having to rummage through the page history to see if there are possibly unsourced bits that were removed earlier, that would in fact be easy to source. Many editors prefer to see articles gradually build up the way we are used to seeing the wiki-process work. Editor A adds this bit, Editor B adds this bit, Editor C adds a fair use image, Editor D adds sources for the bits that Editor A and B added, Editor E replaces the fair use image with a free image, and so on. This process is being short-circuited (for good reasons) for articles about living people where the material may be libellous or without sources. Obviously it would help if those removing unsourced material and those wanting to re-add the material, could work <i>together</i> to find sources. I once saw a suggestion for a voluntary code where everyone who removes a piece of unsourced material should try to counterbalance that with adding a source for another piece of material (not necessarily in the same area). That would ensure productiveness in the addition of sources, as well as productiveness in the removal of unsourced material. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The solution to this perceived problem is quite simple: don't add unsourced information to articles in the first place. Adding the unsourced information is the problem, removing unsourced information is a solution. WP:V is very clear on these points: adding unsourced information is a violation of policy, removing it is not. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 22:09, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Adding unsourced information is not a violation of policy. People do this all the time throughout the encyclopedia. If they stopped, the encylopedia would cease to grow. What <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> actually says is that editors <i>should not</i> (not <i>must not</i>) add unsourced material. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is stricter and says that adding unsourced material to articles about living people is really bad and should be stomped on. Outside of article about living people, there is a long tradition of people coming along later and tidying up material and adding sources. That is what the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag is for. You also seem to fail to realise that I support <i>both</i> stances on this issue. Adding sources when adding new material is the ideal, but I also support the "let the sources accumulate later" model. Drawing the line is a matter of judgment. Merely undoing good-faith additions is not the best solution. Again, I would appeal to those removing unsourced material, and those adding unsourced material, to <b>work together</b>. Any individual from either side should balance any removal of any unsourced material with the provision of a source somewhere else. Build at the same time as pruning. Always, of course, excepting <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which is a special case. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:53, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Between those two policies, it seems clear to me that the proper course of action when one finds unsourced, non-controversial content is to tag it as unsourced to give other editors a chance to provide references (or, better, to source it oneself), or to remove it to the article's talk page for the same purpose, but not to delete it entirely.

<dd>I'm not sure why you would object to me removing those warnings from my talk page, considering that they were reviewed and dismissed by an uninvolved admin and even Jimbo stepped in to say that I had done the right thing. They were obviously without merit; What possible purpose would leaving them serve? The reason for insisting on having the conversation here is so that it is out in the open and everyone can weigh in and benefit from it. ANI has a much wider audience than my talk page, after all. Given that Jimbo agreed that stubbing the article was the right thing to do, it would seem that there are quite a few people here that could stand to benefit from this discussion. Since you also disagreed, I would respectfully suggest you stop for a moment and carefully re-evaluate your understanding of the verifiability and BLP policies. We might have to agree to disagree, which probably happens hundreds of times a day on Wikipedia and not worth getting upset over. Quality, not quantity. Verifiability, not truth. If we are going to represent a living person's number one result in a Google search, then they deserve the strictest interpretation of our core policies and an article that is rock-solid.<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFrise_d673.html" title="User talk:Frise">Frise</a> 19:54, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your criticism is respectfully noted. I intend to adhere to policy, so you need not worry. As far as improving the articles, pruning of unsourced information is an improvement. Removing is better than nothing, and it's still safely in the page history so it can be restored with sources later. Your allegation that I am unwilling to discuss my actions on my talk page is a bit misleading. There is already a lengthy discussion taking place here. Splitting the same issue across two different pages wouldn't make much sense. If you feel it's more appropriate that the discussion actually take place on my talk page, just say the word and I'll copy the whole mess over there. However, I feel that the discussion itself is far more important than where it actually takes place. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFrise_d673.html" title="User talk:Frise">Frise</a> 20:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict - response after Morven)I have to say that your comments mirror my own thoughts exactly. The idea of the site is to create an encyclopedia - removing unsourced information is A Good Thing as far as I'm concerned. My grief is that the methods of doing so are confrontational and dismissive of the work of those who have added sourced information to articles. The way to improve the site is not to delete content, it is to add sources and remove false information. If we went through the entire site and simply deleted all information that was unsourced the site would shrink hugely - and upset a large number of editors whose work was deleted in the crossfire. Instead, what most editors do is see unsourced tags and go off and find sources (at least that is what I do). If the unsourced information is unverified after having done a bit or looking for sources, yes, you should move it to the talk page - deleting it outright just because you think it is nonsense just means that you don't have a source - but someone else might.</dd>
<dd>With regards to the BLP - I 100% agree that all contentious information should be removed if it is unsourced. There is no argument here.</dd>
<dd>I disagree with your (Frise) and Jimbo's blanking of the Ron Jeremy article still - as it is using a slegdehammmer to crack a nut (leaving a single line is not a stub, it is a blanked article). Both Frise and Jimbo saw that there were a collection of willing editors trying to improve the article so should have let nature take it's course for the references and should have simply deleted the contentious and stupid material in the article, and moved anything they saw as unsourced to the talk page (as there were sources there for some of it).</dd>

<dd>As far as I can tell from the relevant talk pages, it has not been established that user:Frise is a single-purpose secondary account of an established user. Assuming for the sake of discussion that this assumption is true, Frise has pointed out two (of several) uses that are explictly sanctioned by policy and that would be appropriate in this situation. Use of a secondary account in these explicitly sanctioned ways is hardly violates the spirit of the policy. The policy doesn't say anything about "admitted socks." User Frise has definitely left an audit trail in regard to this matter and does not appear to have made any attempt to avoid scrutiny. Quite the opoosite, as a matter of fact, Frise has invited scrutiny by first bringing this matter to AN/I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93681548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93681548" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and by suggesting RFC.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive156_ce2e.html" title="Edit section: How to differentiate real stubs and cut-down stubs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How to differentiate real stubs and cut-down stubs</span></h3>
<p>One of the problems here is that this action of pruning to a stub (<i>which is quite proper for articles on living people where there are problems</i>) fails to differentiate between articles that are a stub and always have been a stub, and those stubs that are the remnants left behind after pruning (what I call a pruned or cut-down stub). Ideally, anyone expanding a stub will first check the page history to find out whether the stub is a genuine stub (usually shown by a stub template) or whether it is a stub that has been cut-down from an earlier version. Often though, a cut-down stub gets expanded from scratch, and previous effort is wasted. It is sometimes more efficient to build on previous material, adding sources, rather than building up again from scratch. Sometimes, of course, it is more efficient to build up again from scratch. <b>It depends on the article.</b> I have a proposal that I hope will avoid well-intentioned editors coming along later and rebuilding from scratch and duplicating previous work (they might, for instance, add a stub template, re-inforcing the impression that a stub was all that ever existed). My proposal is to have a template that people can use if they are pruning down to a stub, and this puts a stub-like template at the bottom of the article that explains what has happened, places the article in a category of articles that have been 'pruned', and either gives the date(s) when the pruning(s) took place, or a link to the version just after pruning (those that know how can then skip back a version to review the material and decide whether any material is worth is rescuing). This is what I would call thoughtful and constructive pruning, leaving the path open for rebuilding and regrowth, as opposed to lazy, quick, 'blunt hacking' type of pruning that is destructive and sometimes tramples roughshod over previous work (some of which was added in good faith and is perfectly OK).</p>
<p>What do people think of this idea? I'm not that good at creating and implementing such templates. Can anyone create or find such a 'pruning' template? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 08:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then what is the point of {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} and its numerous variants in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Category%7EStubs_b4e0.html" title="Category:Stubs">Category:Stubs</a>? They all speak to the editor, not the reader. What I am proposing is merely another type of stub template, but a template to label <b>pruned</b> stubs, instead of labelling fresh stubs created from scratch. Do you see the difference? A normal stub template says:
<ul>
<li>"this is a stub - expand me".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>A 'pruned stub' template would say
<ul>
<li>"this is a stub - I got cut down to size from a larger version - expand me - consider rescuing material from previous versions of this article, but don't repeat the mistakes people made before".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Both templates talk about the editing process, appealing to the editors, not the readers. Is that any clearer now? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that direct mentioning of this would be a bad thing. That is why indirect and vague language can be used. Just to tip off editors that there is a <i>bit of history</i> to this article. If you've ever gone through the history of an article (and I really hope that experienced editors don't ignore article history), you will know that it is sometimes possible to find material that it is quite easy to re-add to the article and provide sources for.</dd>
<dd>Another thing. What I am writing here is an attempt to be constructive. It is annoying when someone responds by picking out the negative stuff without acknowledging whether there are any valid points. There is a genuine concern that excessive and aggressive pruning of articles loses genuine and valid content, and what I am proposing is an attempt to acknowledge and address this problem. It would be very easy to prune Wikipedia down to a few hundred thousand articles if the "remove unsourced material" concept was taken to its logical conclusion (and again, in case anyone missed it, I know that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is an exception where unsourced material should be aggressively removed). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thing is, if material has been pruned from an article, we shouldn't want it simply being added in again. If it can't be sourced, it should be gone for good. If it can be sourced, it would be better that editors add the material while referring to reliable sources. In fact, I would favor a warning not to use material from the history, but to be sure to use only material from reliable sources. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 15:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings. I would like to request that the admins would monitor the editing activity currently going on in the "Homosexuality" article. A known vandalizer, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIzanbardprince_2eb7.html" title="User:Izanbardprince">Izanbardprince</a> has been placing his virulent pro-homosexual bias into his edits of the "behavioural modification" section of the article. I myself probably also need monitoring as I am prone to rash action at times and relatedly, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIzanbardprince_2eb7.html" title="User:Izanbardprince">Izanbardprince</a> has also vandalized my user page in the past because he disagrees with me. Thank you.</p>

<dd>It appears that there is no vandalism going on in the article, but rather a content dispute which has resulted in the blocking of two users involved. <a href="../../../i/m/g/User%7EImgi12_9733.html" title="User:Imgi12">Imgi12</a> and <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIzanbardprince_2eb7.html" title="User:Izanbardprince">Izanbardprince</a> have both falsely accused others of vandalism on the article, in what appears to be a misunderstanding of the differences between <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">vandalism</a>.
