<li>He has been making good-faith contributions to article space, but many are highly dubious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamization&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57502100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamization&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57502100" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>

<p>Going back through his other recent contributions will find similarly dubious edits.

<p>The May 14th activity at this (<a href="../../../n/a/t/Jennifer_Government%7E_NationStates_7777.html" title="Jennifer Government: NationStates">Jennifer Government: NationStates</a>) article seems fishy, but unless this sysop <b>knew</b> the user requesting the edit was banned and helped him <b>intentionally</b> in a manner that <b>harmed</b> the wiki (not just the article, but the safety/security/operation of the wiki itself, the the whole thing is dumb. There is no mechcanism in place which can prevent a banned user from getting a new ISP and starting a new account. Tht being the case, what's to be gained by the banned user by going through the sysop? Unless sysop powers were needed (and given) towards a '<b>nefarious'</b> end, then this penalty is excessive. Even so, a time-limited demotion is better. This admin shouldd be restored automatically after X period of time. If not, then ban the admin too. If it's so bad that an indef/permanent desysopping is warranted, the a banning is warranted to. If not, then a time-certain restoration of NSLE to admin is in order. <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.232.205.18.html" title="User:72.232.205.18">72.232.205.18</a> 01:53, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for the record, I have personally asked NSLE to make a comprehensive public statement about this matter, and as far as I know he is still thinking about whether or not to do so. I hope that he will. The decision about whether or not to go public with the details is his, and one of the reasons the ArbCom kept their statement short and sweet is out of respect for NSLE's own choice so far not to make a public statement. If he wants to tell people about it, he can.&#160;:) He's a very good guy, I like him very much, and his record as an admin has been good, other than what the evidence in this case strongly suggests (sockpuppeting). --24.144.77.195 00:02, 12 June 2006 (UTC) (It is suspected this edit is actually from <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>

He's also been making personal attacks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gwernol&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57718603" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gwernol&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57718603" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and is generally uncivil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:J.smith&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57717657" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:J.smith&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57717657" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I am wondering if an indef block would be appropriate in this case – if he continues to edit, chances are he'll create more websites which bypass the spam blacklist, and will continue with his trolling.

<dd>Just for some local color. I've spent some considerable energy trying to reason with this user. He seems determined to be disruptive and uncivil and persistently resorts to personal attacks at any perceived slight. I haven't seen evidence that he's willing to work within the framework of Wikipedia's policy and guidelines. At the least he needs to be watched as his editing can be quite offensive and certainly disruptive. I might suggest starting with a medium-length block (1 week? 2 weeks) to see if that helps him cool off a little. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 19:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have also had discussions with this user, mostly over the verifibility policy. He does appear to think that information should remain in until it's a "properly proven errors", and seems to take removal of uncited (or unencyclopediac) material as a personal affront. His own autobiographic article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_G%C3%B6l%C3%B6k_Zolt%C3%A1n_Buday_dda3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gölök Zoltán Buday">was deleted</a> which, at the end, had about 32 redirects pointing to it from various titles/mispellings. He has also created articles for his father <a href="../../../z/o/l/Zolt%C3%A1n_Buday_017e.html" title="Zoltán Buday">Zoltán Buday</a> and grandfather <a href="../../../l/%C3%A1/s/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Buday_6e2b.html" title="László Buday">László Buday</a>. I did trim the former article, removing things like a long list of name misspellings. The page <a href="../../../z/o/l/Talk%7EZolt%C3%A1n_Buday_d307.html" title="Talk:Zoltán Buday">Talk:Zoltán Buday</a> is a reasonable summary of his general interaction, and you can see on the talk page the long list of (mostly irrelevant) external links he inserted as a response to a reminder of the verifibility policy. My own feeling is that he does not yet understand what wikipedia is not, and is treating it somewhat like a free web host. I don't think blocking is necessary at this point, and may just inflame the situation, but it would be useful if the articles in questions were trimmed and he was pointed to policy by other editors, as I think if the same people keep telling him, he may think it's personal, and not because of wikipolicy.

<p>I request one of the admins please look into them objectively. The key word here is objective. First off, he continuously falsely accused me of being user Bucsrsafe when it was found the guy is not even in my continent, and this speculation led to unfair blocks on me for weeks. Now, because he is upset I am only posting the truth and making the Kobe Bryant article and others amazing (please check the kobe bryant history, I added a lot of great info there about the past), Simishag attacks me here ON THE ARTICLE ISTELF. Please check it out:</p>

<p>I've never done anything this bad, actually attack other users on the articles themselves. I would like to ask someone keep a close watch on this user and make sure some justice is served here.

<dd>Some of Simi's criticisms of Hganesan, who has disrupted several NBA-related articles (at the very least, the harms caused by his POV-pushing and revert-warring have outweighed the benefits to the project from his substantive contributions), are valid; Hg is altogether correct, though, that Simi too has engaged in <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and his disruption of <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe_Bryant_69d8.html" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, illustrated by the diffs Hg adduces, is in contravention of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and, more importantly, common sense. Neither of the two users seems inclined to partake of the collaborative aspect of the project, but at least in this instance Hg appears to be the wronged party; more to the point, Simi appears to have disrupted the project by inserting attacks against another editor and the latter's POV into mainspace. I left him a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimishag&amp;diff=58699005&amp;oldid=58685015" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimishag&amp;diff=58699005&amp;oldid=58685015" rel="nofollow">note</a> to the effect that his conduct isn't helpful and that he might seek to make his arguments in other ways, those that eschew personal attacks and disruption and focus on improving the project and fostering a collegial atmosphere. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:11, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct. I apologize for my actions. I was attempting to be as non-disruptive as possible; there was already an edit war ongoing. My comments were intended as parody, but I realize this is not appropriate. I do object to the claim of "personal attacks." I don't believe I said anything that wasn't both true and easily verifiable.</dd>
<dd>I will accept whatever punishment the admins deem necessary. I hope, however, that this will at least shed a little more light on what I and other NBA-page editors have had to deal with over the last month.

<dd>Same here. I can't confirm the sock, but the rest (unprotecting an article in a quid pro quo exchange) is damningly proven publicly.

<dd>Actually, practically anything more said here would be a dead giveaway, and would be quite damning for NSLE. So I'm clamming my lips shut too.

<dl>
<dd>So question then... If it wasn't really NSLE's fault, then why the desysophood? Wouldn't a "Geez, NSLE, you messed that one up. Don't do it again." be in order?

<p>If the ArbCom members think it's to the advantage of the project to make this public, they'll presumably do so. It's presumably very difficult to become an arbcom member, so I think we should trust the people we've chosen, if they feel it's better to keep it confidential. After all, checkuser results aren't made public either, but only very trustworthy Wikipedians are granted checkuser privileges. I'd feel more comfortable if we could drop the speculation, hints, and half hints. I know nothing about this case. I don't want to know, unless NSLE or the committee chooses to make it public. I found him a conscientious admin. I'm sure it's horrible to be de-sysopped, so I'd like to give him as much support and sympathy as possible, while still respecting the integrity of the members of the ArbCom. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 22:16, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know what this is about (unless there was some <i>other</i> page unprotection involving NSLE and a banned user), but am not sure why it amounts to a desysoping. Nor do I understand the need for secrecy. The unprotection doesn't seem to have been unreasonable... is it the action on behalf of a banned user which is objectionable? That certainly <i>could</i> cause problems... but I don't see where it did any harm in this case. If a banned user asked me to correct a factual error, which I could verify to be an error, I would probably do it. Why not? Obviously that's not a direct parallel as the change here was not an unambiguous improvement... but nor was it in any way obviously harmful. Just a fairly generic edit which people might asthetically agree or disagree with like any other. For the record, I don't know much about NSLE except for vaguely recalling a couple sysop actions which I disagreed with (easier to remember those than others) - so my comments are not motivated by any sort of personal connection. I think alot of us have an instinctive aversion to 'secret trials' with 'secret evidence', but even knowing the details I'm not sure what was driving this desysoping. The idea of 'exchanging favors' with a banned user absolutely <b>could</b> be a very bad thing... I just don't see where it actually <i>was</i> in this case. Very dangerous / questionable ground to stray out onto, but what actual harm was done? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 23:03, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>C'mon Tony, that's hyperbole. If it had been a "very grave abuse of admin powers" you would think someone would have reversed it... rather than this 'horiffic' admin action standing unchallenged to this day. The 'in service of a banned user' part seems to be the actual complaint and I can see cause for <i>concern</i> there, but don't make false claims about the actual action itself having been harmful or abusive. It was a perfectly routine and reasonable unprotect that nobody objected to <i>until</i> they found out that 'the banned user' had requested it. The upshot seems to be - 'don't do things asked for by banned users even if they cause no apparent harm to Wikipedia'. Or perhaps just, 'do not offend the PTB'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 23:59, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The bottom line is, if a banned user contacts you and asks you to make a change to a protected article (or allow one to be made), and you happen to think the banned user's request is reasonable, the correct thing to do is <i>bring it here</i> and ask the community how they think you should proceed. <i>Our</i> actions must be transparent as well. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 23:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

This may lead to wild, unfounded rumors and conspiracy theories. I don't think that anything else needs to be said about the confidential aspects. With a project like Wikipedia, I think that disclosure is usually the least harmful way to go. In extreme cases where something needs to be kept confidential, don't encourage speculation. They did do the right thing in giving a general idea of what happened, otherwise speculation would be much worse. Still, I suspect that it may become a widely known "secret". Too many people already know, interest is very high and in my experience the vast majority of people are incapable of keeping secrets, especially when the truth getting out won't be harmful to them personally. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I learned about this via the <i>Signpost</i>, and after reading through this entire section, I have to agree with <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a>. After reading what was posted here, even though I had no previous knowledge of any of the parties or the article involved, it took me all of 2 minutes to discover the details via Google. And if I can do it, surely anyone reading this can, as well; therefore it seems to me in the interests of Wikipedia to simply air the facts in a fully transparent, NPOV, and dispassionate manner, rather than stimulate endless speculation. No, I won't do it myself, because there seems to be a near-consensus that it would be a bad idea, but I believe I can make a good argument that secrecy in this case actually <i>increases</i> the likelihood of harm to Wikipedia and recurrence of the problem. And more importantly, the immediate background of the issue (as opposed to whether <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSLE</a>'s conduct warranted desysopping or milder censure) is something that <i>should</i> be discussed openly on Wikipedia (probably not here, but somewhere in the project namespace).

<dd>Except that, having read the background of the case via a Google search, I still do not see the need for confidentiality regarding the background and circumstances of the case. Yes, the case <i>indirectly</i> involves something that should remain confidential -- NSLE's identity and personal details -- but <i>much</i> more information about the case, specifically, the article and edits involved, the identity of the banned user involved, the specific conduct NSLE was accused of, the specific nature of the evidence, etc., could all be disclosed without compromising NSLE's privacy. However, ArbCom and others have clamped a complete veil of secrecy over the whole thing. It's not that I don't believe they came to the correct decision or that NSLE did not receive due process, it's that the secrecy has prevented any sort of discussion of the policy and process issues involved, or of how to prevent a similar threat to Wikipedia's integrity in the future. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 16:25, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can definately see how he's being uncooperative and yet he seems to have a really good grasp of wikisyntax, so its hard to think that this is out of ignorance. In the interest of assuming good faith, I'm going to try a 24 hour block to get his attention and see if that might get him talking. I'm amazed he's been here 6 months and never once used any talk page.

<p>The page in question is Sohh.com, a seemingly notable web forum for the hip-hop community.

<p>I was contacted personally by a person in a position of public office that I had released information (to the wikipedia) about. My feeling at the time was that this information was insignificant. The person in question asked that I redact the information on the basis that the security detail (in this case, united states federal law enforcement) assigned to them felt it would compromise their security. I can imagine a way or two in which this could be the case, however remote.</p>
<p>So, I am wondering what the policy is on redacting information on public articles (this is not a "right to disappear" issue). It seems to me that it would be hard to entirely remove such information as we have mirrors, caches, etc. However, I am convinced that the person in question is correct.</p>
<p>Lastly, I feel confident that I can go and remove that information (from our local copy, which should eventually propagate to all those mirrors and caches) without arousing attention directed at it (thus invalidating the whole procedure of removing it anyways). <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 19:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Pgk. Where the information is verifiable and notable, the prospective security risks, as a wholly unencyclopedic concern, ought not to militate against our removing it. Even <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (which is, of course, only a guideline and not policy) isn't intended to address situations in which physical harm may befall a subject, and so I think no further action on our part to be necessary (as avriette and Pgk intimate, though, one imagines that if the information is sourced, it will be otherwise publicly available; Wikipedia and its mirrors, to be sure, happen to be more readily reached via Internet searches, but if one who is intent on assaulting a given public official likely isn't going to be deterred by his/her having to sift through several pages of Google returns). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:40, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reported this on long-term abuse, but I think it needs to be considered that this user is blocked from any further editing until this is sorted out. The user has expressed on their talk page they don't care about wikipedia policy and will do what they want. The user has a very long history of over-linking pages. Essentially going in and linking every word he can find and marking every single edit he makes as minor. <a href="../../../e/e/p/User%7EEep%C2%B2_d759.html" title="User:Eep²">User:Eep²</a> is the user, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eep%C2%B2_7951.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eep²">Special:Contributions/Eep²</a> are his contribs. I've been going through trying to clean it up, but honestly its probably going to take a team of at least a dozen to go through and clean this up.

As I understand the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_name_f43b.html" title="Wikipedia:User name">user name policy</a>, this name might be misleading since the user isn't actually a bot. Since I don't have any practical experience in dealing with questionable user names, I haven't contacted the user about this issue.

<dd>Essentially there has to be a consensus that the username violates the policy for it to be changed against their will. Best of course in all cases is to ask them first very politely to consider the policy and how their name might be a problem. In this case if it was DrLeeBOT I could see a problem, but as it is I don't, so no need to even ask them to change it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 21:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for replying. That's exactly what I wanted to know. I didn't know how strict "the community" might be on this issue. The wording of the policy leaves plenty of room for interpretation, so I thought I should ask here before even suggesting that the user change his or her name.

<dd>I'd be more concerned by the fact that an account with less than a page of contributions has not only found AFD, but decided to vote in it, then with the confusing nature of the name--<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.200.html" title="User:152.163.100.200">152.163.100.200</a> 15:27, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not surprising, since pages nominated for deletion have prominent links to their respective AfD subpages. I'd be more concerned about an unregistered anon who has already found the admins' noticeboard, knows how to use Special:Contributions, and is familiar with the deletion process.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#CD6600;">Tantalum</span><span style="color:#000080;">Telluride</span></a> 16:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is baloney. I was not spamming anybody. I was trying to find one advocate who knew the subject matter, agreed with my position, and had the time to help me. I was also trying to get more responsible, intelligent Wikipedians involved in the article, and the issue at hand. I do not know why I should not be allowed to find a sympathetic advocate or mediator. I have been trying to get an advocate and mediation for over a month. I emailed the Wikipedia foundation, posted my request on notice boards all to no avail. My time is valuable. I get the feeling like this is some kind of game, and I don't have time for playing games. There should be someone at Wikipedia who would help editors like me find a suitable advocate. I don't know who Lethe is or why he has so much power. But it is clear he is violating Wikipedia policy.

<p>So I stumbled upon this today: User_talk:Srose/Love. It is a dedicated talk page intended to be used by two otherwise upstanding users, <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> and <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose">Srose</a>, for the sole purpose of repeatedly telling each other how much one loves the other (seriously: Quoth: I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! Srose 16:52, 1 June 2006 (UTC) -- I LOVE YOU, TOOOOOOO! Yanksox 16:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC) - and it manages to get worse), and carying on inane small talk not dissimilar to a chat room (in terms of frequency and meaningfulness of posts). The type of activity here is best suited to IRC or IM or whatever kids use these days (hello, telephones?), and has no place in a discussion forum meant for encyclopedia editors. Mind you, Wikipedians have (somehow) carried out more useless and rediculous conversations in the past (to say the least), but to have a page dedicated to such drivel seems over the top, and although harmless and in the userspace, it simply doesn't belong here and violates the spirit of our talk page guidlines. I was going to MfD it and warn the users, but on the inside I am an unsentimental old man with a hardened little grinch heart with no patience for such poppycock, so I'll see if others aggree first before dashing their puppy love forum on the jaged rocks of wikipolicy like so many discarded Hollywood hookers. --Jeffrey O.

<p>Lethe is an administrator yet violates all these Wikipedia policies and rules. Is there anything that can be done about this? He is extremely patronizing. He never apologizes for his his mistakes. Time and again he wrongly accuses me of writing something patently false, that later turns out to be an undisputed truth. He reverts everything I add in its entirety. If another adds the exact same thing, he does not revert it.</p>
<p>To assume good faith is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia. As we allow anyone to edit, it follows that we assume that most people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it. If this weren't true, a project like Wikipedia would be doomed from the beginning.</p>
<p>So, when you can reasonably assume that something is a well-intentioned error, correct it without just reverting it or labeling it as vandalism.</p>
<p>Especially, remember to be patient with newcomers, who will be unfamiliar with Wikipedia's culture and rules. Correcting a newly added sentence that you know to be wrong is also much better than simply deleting it.</p>
<p>You should not act like their mistake was deliberate. Correct, but don't scold.</p>
<p>Avoidance The best way to resolve a dispute is to avoid it in the first place.</p>
<p>Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: Do not simply revert changes in a dispute. When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, improve the edit, rather than reverting it. Provide a good edit summary when making significant changes that other users might object to.</p>

<p>I came across a user who is using absolutely-positined <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s to "replace" the title on his <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon">user</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon">talk</a> pages. I think it's a cool hack, but I think it's ultimately a bad idea. I believe users should have relatively wide latitude in how they decorate their user pages, but I think that obscuring the title or any part of the standard layout is a bad idea (I have no problem with the little tabs people use to indicate their online status or such). Normally if I saw someone hacking their user page in this manner, I would edit it and leave him a note, but in this case it's a well-established editor. I requested he change it, but he politely declined. Am I overreacting to a minor issue? This case is relatively innocuous, though if others engage in this practice, it could be confusing (and I can think of some malicious uses for this sort of hack). What do others think? — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 05:04, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand that that hack doesn't work on non-standard skins, but if Moe doesn't mind that, I don't see a problem.

<p>This page was under edit war previously, then I protected it and requested discussion, no discussion ensued, I then unprotected the page and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASerbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=55275051&amp;oldid=54730960" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASerbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=55275051&amp;oldid=54730960" rel="nofollow">promised to block next person to make undiscussed revert</a>, and I just did that as you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASerbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=57881655&amp;oldid=57803467" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASerbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=57881655&amp;oldid=57803467" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

And protecting of the page didn't help. As being new and underexpirienced administrator, I request help from mode experienced ones. What is to be done? Protect the page? Make <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">WP:RfAr</a>? Block everybody for a week and get drunk?

<dd>I strongly support the blockings, and I'd suggest longer blockings (a week or more) if they return after 24 hours and continue revert-warring. I'm currently having to put up with complaints because I protected <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">Bormalagurski</a>'s user page - see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Bormalagurski_and_fair_use_image" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">above</a> - because he can't be trusted not to fill it with abuse of other nationalities and nationalist sloganeering. Bormalagurski is one of the people Dijxtra has just blocked. There are far too many people from the former Yugoslavia who seem to see Wikipedia as a chance to continue the wars of the 1990s by other means, and it needs to be made absolutely clear to them that this is not acceptable. There does seem to be some reasonable editing of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs_of_Croatia_ada9.html" title="Serbs of Croatia">Serbs of Croatia</a> going on, so I think the solution of blocking the revert-warriors is the right one. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s hard work on improving wikipedia, but I feel like that this time, he has been manipulated by <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c97d.html" title="User:Luka Jačov">User:Luka Jačov</a>.</p>
<p>The text we are edit-waring about is this:</p>

<dd><i>According to the Croatian census 2001 <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_census_2001"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive45_7ceb.html#endnote_census_2001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive45_7ceb.html#endnote_census_2001" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></sup></span>, most Serbs of Croatia declared that they speak <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_language.html" title="Croatian language">Croatian</a>.

<p>Let's make detailed chronology of edit war on.</p>
<p><a name="Timeline" id="Timeline"></a></p>

<p>First, I must remind you that <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s rule was introdiced primarily because of Jacov's behaviour. Jacov was also responsile for blocking the article in the first place, see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbs_of_Croatia_cf56.html#accuracy_disputed_.28Luka_Ja.C4.8Dov_deleting_references.29" title="Talk:Serbs of Croatia">Talk:Serbs of Croatia#accuracy disputed (Luka Jačov deleting references)</a></p>
<p>After the page has been unlocked, Jacov started reverting changes without even trying to discuss it:</p>
<ul>
<li>04:43, 24 May 2006 Jacov <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=54839354&amp;oldid=54731047" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=54839354&amp;oldid=54731047" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> the article with comment "<i>no time 2 disscuss</i>"</li>

</ul>
<p>I called <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> and this led to this new rule by Dijxtra.</p>

<p>Now, <b>regarding the edit-war after setting the rule</b>:</p>
<p>Technically speaking, I (Ante Perkovic) <b>did</b>, at 18:06, 9 June 2006, make revert without changing any talk page.</p>
<p>I must admit that Jacov <b>did</b> make a change to some talk page every time he made a change to the article.</p>
<p>So, technically speaking, I did break the <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s self-invented rule, and Jacov didn't.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly, Jacov's "changes" were almost completely limited to reverting page to is last version regardles of the fact that, in the meantime, some people made considerable effort to improve the article. As an example, see his change from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=57929178&amp;oldid=57803915" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbs_of_Croatia&amp;diff=57929178&amp;oldid=57803915" rel="nofollow">20:51, 10 June 2006</a>. This is not the first time he showed disrespect for other user's contributions.</p>
<p><b>Regarding commenting changes</b>:</p>
<p>First, I must admit that I totally overlooked "<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s rule". Zmaj, who was yesterday banned for the <b>first time in his 16 month</b> of contributing this wikipedia (he joined us 18 February 2004) also privately told me that he actually overlooked this "warning", which is no miracle considering intensity of our activities here.</p>
<p>I commented my previous changes not because <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> told me to but because I do it anyway, most of the time.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> set the rule, I made alltogether 4 changes to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs_of_Croatia_ada9.html" title="Serbs of Croatia">Serbs of Croatia</a>.</p>
<p>First <b>3 changes</b> were accompanied with alltogether <b>3 comments</b> to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbs_of_Croatia_cf56.html" title="Talk:Serbs of Croatia">Talk:Serbs of Croatia</a> and <b>additional 3 comments</b> to <a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c0f7.html" title="User talk:Luka Jačov">User talk:Luka Jačov</a>. Since Jacov kept ignoring my questions on his talk page (see timeline), I made one last (4th) revert without any comment on any talk page. I wrote the only reasonably comment I could think of at that time - "<i>REV, Jacov <a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c0f7.html#I_need_some_explanation_of_your_edit" title="User talk:Luka Jačov">keeps avoiding</a> my simple yes/no questions</i>"</p>
<p>On the oter side, Jacov decided to "play by the rules". He did remember the rule set by <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> and decided to make a "trap" for me by making endless reverts with poor (but regular) explanations until I, having nothing to add without senslessly repeating myself, made a revert without actually changing any talk page (but, I <b>did</b> write a comment, by the way!). When that finally happened, Jacov quickly contacted <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADijxtra&amp;diff=57748622&amp;oldid=57542024" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADijxtra&amp;diff=57748622&amp;oldid=57542024" rel="nofollow">reminded him</a> about his rule. Dijxtra had no choise, but to block a few users, despite his feeling of "being manipulated by Luka Jacov" (<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s own words).</p>
<p>What strikes me even more here is that, if I just copied some of previous explanations to the bottom of the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbs_of_Croatia_cf56.html" title="Talk:Serbs of Croatia">Talk:Serbs of Croatia</a>, I guess I wouldn't be blocked! You must agree that this is absurd!</p>

<p>Since entire croatian comunity here feels disturbed by Jacov's behaviour, and since even <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> admitted that he felt manipulated by the Jacov, I'm thinking of making <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> or some other procedure on this issue. I would kindly ask administrators to take a look at my talk page and give me an advice about what to do next.

<p>Regarding <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a>'s feeling of being manipulated bu Jacov, he is right. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c0f7.html" title="User talk:Luka Jačov">Jačov</a>'s behaviour is called "gaming the system" and is strictly prohibited by wikipedia rules.

<p>Ante has a point here. Several points, in fact. My recent reflections on that matter can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADijxtra&amp;diff=58052985&amp;oldid=58050389" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADijxtra&amp;diff=58052985&amp;oldid=58050389" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnte_Perkovic&amp;diff=58050555&amp;oldid=58047879" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAnte_Perkovic&amp;diff=58050555&amp;oldid=58047879" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I urge some more experienced administrator to help me deremine if <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuka_Jacov_c901.html" title="User:Luka Jacov">User:Luka Jacov</a> is breaking <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, since I'm not fully neutral here. I share some views with Luka but I also feel he acts disruptive. I have some disaccord with views of Ante but I also feel he is acting in good faith. Therefore, I'm not quite the person to deal with this situation and I therefore request fellow administrators to advise me on this situation. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 17:27, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a comment on <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> and the role of administrators. He was a bit heavy-handed in blocking, but his intention was noble. Wikipedia says "be bold", which is what Dijxtra was, and I (one of the people he blocked) can only commend him for it. We need such dedicated people to help us with disputes in numerous Croatia-related articles. Dijxtra, I do not think you lack neutrality. Some administrators believe they can be impartial only if they are uninformed about the topic. That is so wrong. There is no way administrators can help in complex disputes unless they know in detail what is being discussed. I am not talking about 3RR, vandalism and similar clear-cut cases. I am talking about undue weight, gaming the system, slippery slopes and similar insidious techniques. I am aware of official procedures such as RfC or RfA, but honestly, it seems nothing beats the personal dedication of an administrator. --<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">Zmaj</a> 19:09, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I need the help of some admin(s). The matter relates to <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a>.</p>
<p>A dispute arose some time ago relating to the insertion by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a> of an external link into the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Technical_High_School_3e7a.html" title="Sydney Technical High School">Sydney Technical High School</a> page: see <a href="../../../s/y/d/Talk%7ESydney_Technical_High_School_6de3.html" title="Talk:Sydney Technical High School">Talk:Sydney Technical High School</a>.</p>
<p>During this time, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a> made a number of personal attacks against several users, myself included. Afterwards, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a> began selectively taking quotes, out of context, from my old personal website, from many years ago: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sumple#Quote_of_the_moment" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sumple#Quote_of_the_moment" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. He arranged these quotes, from my personal opinion <s>from about 10 years ago</s> from up to 10 years ago (when I was about 12 years old), and added commentary in a manner designed to damage my reputation on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>After warning him to stop, he has edited his post to add more material. I am finding it difficult to deal with the continued harassment from this user. I'm requesting that he be banned because his actions now are adversely affecting my ability to edit in Wikipedia. Warnings by several administrators in the past do not appear to have made him understand Wikipedia policies relating to civility and harassment (not to mention NPOV and editing policies) - see <a href="../../../s/y/d/Talk%7ESydney_Technical_High_School_6de3.html" title="Talk:Sydney Technical High School">Talk:Sydney Technical High School</a>, for one of several examples. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 06:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I endorse Sumple's account here - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a> has gone one step too far. As an admin involved in a current mediation with him, I do not feel that it is appropriate for me to enact any block on him, but I ask that other administrators consider this case and its history seriously.

<dd>I've just blocked <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">User:Andrewjens</a> for 24 hours - he had expressed defiance on his talk page when a warning template was put there. A block will at least stop this in the interim. I welcome comments about what further action should be taken to sort out the damage. I know nothing about the underlying dispute or who is ultimately to blame for the sorry state of affairs here, but there was no excuse for the immediate attack behaviour, nor any sign that it was about to cease. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks.

He's gotten all angry and mediation and pleas for him to be reasonable have seemed to have failed. We'll see how he goes after the block ends, but if this happens again, I would say that an indefinite block is not out of the question? <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 12:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe some more experienced admins can think about that overnight (my time) and comment here. The main thing was to stop his immediate attacks on <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a>'s talk page. But I'd certainly support some kind of firm action if he remains defiant on his own talk page or resumes attacks when he returns in 24 hours. We can't allow this sort of behaviour to go on and on. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 12:08, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have had an exchange with him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Andrewjens#Block" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Andrewjens#Block" rel="nofollow">here</a>, in which I have tried to spell out the problem after his initial reaction to the 24-hour block. If he responds in a way that shows he simply does not accept our policy against personal attacks, then I am inclined to take him at his word and impose an indefinite block. It's up to him to decide whether or not Wikipedia is for him. If anyone thinks there is a better way to handle the matter, would you please comment here. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:19, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is very weird, I noticed on Bengali wiki that an AOL IP 64.* renamed the Interwiki link to the en wiki page <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> to <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Of_Arc_6e6a.html" title="Joan Of Arc">Joan Of Arc</a>. However, the one with "Of" is a complete duplicate of the "of" page, the original article. Investigating furter, I see that the same anon IP (64.12.116.* , 64.12.116.68 etc.) has gone through ALL the different language wikis and changed the interwiki links to the duplicate article (which was created May 29th). I redirected "Of" to the original article, but the anon aol IP reverted it to the duplicate version.</p>
<p>Now, I've fixed some of the iw links in other wikis, but the whole purpose or intent of the anon is quite intriguing. Also, the remaining interwiki links in other wikis need to be fixed. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:40, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cyde Weys has blocked the user for 48h for disruption, which I understand is the current operational block. I'm wondering now if the user's pushing to the stage where people are becoming tired of him, and considering opening a request for comment. What triggered Cyde's block in the short term, I think, is the comment he left opposing a self-nominated request for adminship, which was the same act that caused me further concern.</p>

<dd>It strikes me I should emphasise something at this point. I don't think the user is acting in bad faith, at least not at this time; right now, I'd like to think that the problems s/he has caused/is encountering is due to a lack of complete comprehension as to how Wikipedia works - a "clueless" newbie, if you like - ultimately wants to do the right thing, but is confused as hell and doesn't seem to appreciate how we deal with various aspects of day to day interaction, etc. around here. Perhaps someone could take the user under their arm, wing or prosthetic implement? <b><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">robchurch</a></b> | <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">talk</a> 15:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been aware of "Myrtone the Strict Australian Wikipedian" for some time, and I've never quite been able to work out whether it's someone who feels the occasional need to troll, or someone who is genuinely an oddball. The "reverting of unexplained edits" has been going on for a while (he/she feels that when there are no edit summaries it's fine to revert anything), and there was a campaign to remove all swearing from the encyclopaedia, too. There is, as far as I can tell from my non-tram-obsessed perspective, some good editing mixed up with the eccentricity. But I think after six months of heavy activity, most people would have gathered more about how to do things here, which is why I wonder how much of the "eccentricity" is actually trolling. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 23:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm seconding the "clueless" notion, I don't think he has an intent to troll, just an unfortunate way of coming across as rude.

<p>In recent months I have seen a massive growth in article page templates. While these often add useful information to article and help group articles with their like-minded kin, the design aspects of where these templates are placed are often quite bad. For example, in the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_for_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;oldid=59528365" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_for_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;oldid=59528365" rel="nofollow">Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks</a> a vertical and a horizontal template intersect at the top of the page, breaking up the lead in an awful way. My question is this: Are there accepted Wikipedia standards on the placement of article templates? If so, where are they? (I searched all over and couldn't find them.) If these standards don't exist, are any other admins irritated by the way article templates are beginning to dominate articles here and willing to work with me on developing some consensus on their placement? Thanks for any info or comments. Best, --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:12, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a> hasn't been updated for these that I know of, but the general tendency I have observed has been to put 'vertical' (and small) templates towards the upper right and 'horizontal' templates towards the bottom center. Multiple horizontal templates are generally no problem as they can be 'stacked' atop each other - usually as a sort of categorized 'See also' section of navigation boxes. Multiple small and vertical templates on the same page, or such in conjunction with images, can get messy though. All of these tend to be placed in the upper right corner and sometimes you will have things 'double parked' or the entire right hand border taken up by one box/image after another. That said, I haven't seen such problems on alot of pages, most of them were actually more due to trying to stick a template in amongst an overload of images, and they can usually be fixed quickly. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:53, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not convinced of its use myself, why would a blocked user be interested in autoblocks generated as a result of their block? It won't affect them since they are blocked anyway. Regardless is such a thing were included you'd want the time range to be last 24 hours, autoblocks expire after 24 hours so anything older is irrelevant. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm reluctant to post much of the evidence against current socks here, since he is a known persistent sneaky vandal who attempts not to be noticed. Right now we have 3 socks/meats operating, one on an IP, two under user accounts.</p>
<p>The problem is that since he's a "block on characteristic behavior" vandal/sock master, I don't know where to take it. It basically needs blocking, up front, before it deteriorates. Probably will need ongoing blocking of more subtle forms of approach as it continues.</p>

<p>I reported his latest socks on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> but was told with only one or few edits apiece (which would only be obviously vandalistic in the context of previous activity and <i>modus operandi</i>) to take it to <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kcordina&amp;diff=59786901&amp;oldid=59785628" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kcordina&amp;diff=59786901&amp;oldid=59785628" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> However, a sock check is likely to reveal nothing per David Gerard and sockcheck isn't whats being sought. <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> also seems inappropriate as watchlists aren't the issue, blocking the new sock/meatpuppets on behavior is.</p>
<p>What's perhaps needed is a more experienced admin willing to be long-term familiar with the article's vandalism history (ie not a page editor or content contributor), to whom future events or suspicious aspects of behavior can be notified to for fast judgement of blocking. It should be noted that as with many sneaky repeat vandals and sock users, the evidence will be slender and therefore good judgement of handling problematic cases is likely to be needed. Communication by email will probably be preferred.</p>
<p>Apologies for the above approach, however this article is an exceptionally problematic case. It's just been trashed by a year in which about 10-20 socks and meats played POV warrior with it (all blocked), and all mentors were driven off the article by the wiki-stress of it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FT2&amp;diff=59622961&amp;oldid=59534540" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FT2&amp;diff=59622961&amp;oldid=59534540" rel="nofollow">Woohookitty's comment</a>), and days later we now have 3 new sock/meats (2 obvious, 1 subtle) starting all over again.</p>

<dd>Done it a week or so back. RFCU failed -- he's switched to using other IPs. If it had succeeded he'd be blocked by now.

<p>Filling wikipedia with one liner articles like these, and also on <a href="../../../i/n/d/India_%28cat%29.html" title="India (cat)">some presidential pets</a> is really a bad idea.

<p>Here's my thoughts. I realize how it might be more essential to merge the pages, but I would like until the 14th to try to find enought information on them to make them more than stubs and to make them separate enough from each other. If I cannot accomplish that, then yes, merging will be required.

<dd>YOU are spreading lies and libel as for quite a while about me. On your user-page i have taken the LIBERTY to correct a spelling mistake (your mistake: "indefinate"/my correction: indefinite), ironically at the same TIME STAMP instant as you have subsequently changed your previous MISSPELLED posting.

<dd>No, you reverted the page back serveral revisions and changed the spelling. Thereby removing another user's comments and reverting my edits, since the prior revision I had changed "indefinite" to "a month". Given your previous actions, I think it's safe to say you were screwing around with my page and passing it off as an innocent edit. Why else would you had reverted back several revisions instead of just editing the word? In addition, your edit was over 2 hours after mine.

<dd>I made one single entry and did not REVERT at all, there may have been a timelag though between making the correction and SAVE PAGE action. So no need to spread further libel.

<dd>Setting the page back to a previous state is reverting. Given your previous statements, I think you are lying when you expect us to believe you waited over two hours to save your edits.

<dd>I reached your miss-spelled entry over my page watch and it has been your last entry, at the time I chanced upon it. All i did was change the spelling, so don't construe anything!

<dd>Editing talk pages in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines is not harrassment. I doubt you'll find an admin who'll object to me removing personal attacks against me from an indefinitely banned user. As for you editing my page when I was the last editor, what you said is impossible as it would have resulted in an edit conflict warning preventing you from accidentally overwritting what had been written. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 02:33, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reconstructing the events, I agree that, in fact, THERE HAS BEEN an editing conflict warning (in connection with "show preview"), which i did not attribute to an edit concerning this matter, after a considerable break in editing, having done other work for more than 2 hours. I understood only after your verbose accusations that the said SAVE PAGE action had obviously triggered then only (I presume admin can ascertain this in due course). I do not accept your renewed false accusations, especially not in light of your continuous attempts at defaming me. It was due to the fact that i found you on my watchlist today (and reading your contributions log) that I came to know about your relentless bickering on this board and your userpage. My spelling correction was meant as a reminder for you to see I am on top of your pranks. My first impression regarding "same instance" editing was based on comparing your TIME STAMP before and after my edit, which shows the same time. In any event: Say what you want; I merely attempted to correct your spelling of the word indefinite. The ensuing mishap has not been my intention.<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPantherarosa_c18e.html" title="User:Pantherarosa">Pantherarosa</a> 03:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Except the fact you can't accidentally overwrite suceeding edits in an edit conflict without cutting and pasting your edits from the bottom text box to the top. So either you did it on purpose or you just intentionally bypassed warning messages without looking at what they said. As for <i>your relentless bickering on this board and your userpage</i> and <i>I am on top of your pranks</i>, those aren't personal attacks, but they definately violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a></dd>

<dd>Pantherarosa, I see this as a simple question of whether you realise that your comments could be understood as demeaning and/or a personal attack. Whatever Paul Cyr's age is, it does not mean you should make fun of it. You may be right or wrong about the edit conflict (I had a problem with overwriting newer versions by mistake myself) but that does not excuse the language you have been using to refer to another member of the wikipedia community.

<p>There's 5 days of AFD pages backlogged at the moment. People seem to close the easy ones, then skip over any that involve a modicum of effort (such as merging, or transwiki-ing).

<dd>I have no problems with closing contentious or tough AfDs, and I very rarely "skip" an AfD, but I simply don't have the continuous time it takes to close 50+ AfDs in succession. Usually when I see the AfDs for a particular day drop down to around 20 or 30, that's when I'll get cracking on closing the rest of them, so it would be great if we have a lot of volunteers just close a few to bring it down to this level. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:24, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Out of interest, how other admins deal with merge results? As it's basically a keep, do you just declare it as keep, declare as keep but also add merge tags on or what? Just out of interest as I've done very little AFD work (and not really been around there much recently), but would be useful to know as this as it seems to be the number 1 reason for non-closure of the older AFD's. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 18:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you prefer. Personally, if I think the result is merge I say so. If I can execute the merge, I do, if I don't feel qualified I don't, note that fact on the AfD and add merge tags as needed. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 18:42, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also tend to find merge results hard to deal with. Usually merging requires some expertise in the subject matter, and if I have significant expertise in the subject matter I tend to vote on the AfD rather than closing it. So for me, it's generally merge tags. I think that's about all that can be expected of the closing admin. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 19:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(shift left) If there are several merge and keep votes together, I usually just close the AfD as a <b>Keep</b> or <b>Not delete</b>, and close the article as per a <b>keep</b> result, making a note that Keep vs. Merge debates can be handled out of AfD. For merge results, I usually try to do the merge myself, but if the subject matter is too difficult, the work required is extensive, or if I'm simply too lazy (that happens on occasion), I just apply the merge tags to the AfDed article and the target article. I make sure to pass, as the second parameter, the proper talk page to discuss the merge (the talk page of the AfDed article is most appropriate, I think).</p>
<p>For example: {{mergeto|Target article|Talk:AfDed article}} and {{mergefrom|AfDed article|Talk:AfDed article}}. That's just how I do it, I don't know how other AfD closers do it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Relisting restarts the 5 day counter? I thought relisting just made sure you were able to reach a concensus by giving it exposure and didn't extend the length of the actual discussion? --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It basically restarts the counter, as they are placed on the same page as the other 'brand new' AFD nominations. However, they can get closed in less than the extra five says if consensus becomes clear. The exposure happens by being put back on the 'front page' and having the length of discussion extended. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 22:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Either way, it'll be closed in time. Despite the fact that having that AfD notice up on an article can be stressful, these things get closed in time, and there's no harm in having it up for a little longer, especially when you consider how overworked some of our AfD closers are. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its not a matter of stress per se. Just closing the AFD in time to ensure a proper process. When it comes to deleting someone's work, or keeping something controversial, I think the process has to be transparent, and abnormally long AFDs and other things can lead to people questioning that process. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I agree. Unfortunately, AfD closers are volunteers. Just earlier, I closed an AfD that took me almost thirty minutes to complete. And there are tonnes of AfDs to close. In an ideal world, AfD closers would swoop in and close all the AfDs within the space of twelve hours after they have expired. Unfortunately, they are not. In addition, proper process doesn't actually give a maximum time limit into when an AfD has to be closed. It only says that AfDs <i>may</i> be closed after five days, but may sit in the back log for several more days.</dd>
<dd>But in any case, you have a valid complaint. AfDs can sometimes sit in a backlog for a while. Perhaps you'd like to help control the backlog by helping us close AfDs? If you're not an admin, but still want to help clear our AfD backlog, take a look at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-Administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">here</a> to see how you can help.

<dd>Thanks Deathphoenix, I'll have a look at that. I'm not an admin currently, but if I can close unanimous keeps then that might help when I come across them. I'll go through and read the proper process. Is there anything in particular I should tag the closing with to indicate I'm not an admin when doing so? --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:01, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, there's no need to do so. Just remember that you can only close AfDs that are very unanimously a Keep (or Merge, or Redirect). A good rule of thumb (someone else could correct me if they wish) would be at least four Keeps (or Merges, or Redirects), and maybe 90% consensus. Anything else might be a little too contentious for anyone but an admin to close. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I started closing AfDs (as a non-admin), but found that I was scrolling through the whole lot searching for near-unanimous keeps and not finding many. There were others where I would have closed and made a decision, but didn't want to overstep the mark. I understand in the past there was more leeway for non-admins closing with "no consensus" or whatever. If this were approved, it would share the workload (and non-admin closures are subject to review anyway as a safeguard).</dd>
<dd>On the subject of difficult merges after an AfD, would it be an acceptable solution to change the article into a redirect to the second article, and paste the contents of the first article on the talk page of the second article, making it clear that this was material from the first article that needed to be merged? The editing history would of course still be preserved with the first article.</dd>

<dd>That's for speedy delete, but most articles for deletion don't meet speedy criteria, which is why they're put on AfD in the first place, so that tag would be misleading. Non-admins can't complete the process, even if there is a (near-)unanimous consensus for delete. However, they could close "no consensus, keep" AfDs. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:25, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure non-admins should be closing close (i.e. no consensus) keeps. I don't have too much problem with them closing obvious deletes and than tagging with db|(afd link), but that wouldn't really save admins any work as they would still have to check the afd was valid etc as it is the deleting admin that has to 'take the blame' in case of future questions. Closing clear delete afd's hardly takes any time at all anyway. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 16:34, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Any and all votes to overturn a copyvio deketion should be ignored unless a persuasive fair use argument or proof of a free license release can be provided, but AFAIK this have not been a problem with copyright infrindging text, so I don't think it copyvios getting undeleted will be a huge problem with images either.

<p>Greetings Administrators,</p>
<p><b>&gt; Can you provide evidence to these accusations? Naconkantari 18:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>Yes, I can. Can you please email me at MichaelDWolok@aol.com</p>
<p>Please look at the Many-Worlds article. And read Lethe's comments on the article's talk page from the time I made my first edit.</p>
<p><b>&gt; This editor seems to be somewhat confused. From the low volume and quality of</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; his edits [56] and the high number of blocks he has nevertheless attracted [57]</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; I expect that he has come to harbor a grudge against administrators.</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; --Tony Sidaway 22:55, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>I harbor no grudge against anyone. I certainly harbor no grudge against any Wikipedia administrator. Accusations like this make me wonder about the accuser.</p>
<p>The high number of blocks I have are because I post from AOL. All but three or four of those blocks were intended for others, not me. Two of those three blocks that were intended for me were put in place by Lethe. Both were for violating the 3RR.</p>
<p>The fisrt time he issued the block, it was my very first day editing Wikipedia. I did not know there was a 3RR. Instead of identifying himself and explaining the rule to me, he just blocked me for twenty-four hours. The second time he blocked me for 3RR, I don't believe I violated the rule. I did not revert the same material three times in one day. The material I reverted remains reverted. Other editors agreed with me that there is no known category called "Gray Rape." A Google search of "Gray Rape" only turned up the Wikipedia article that described it. I have made dozens of other important contributions. Other editors have described the quality of my contributions as "excellent."</p>
<p>For some reason, Sam Blanning and Lethe think their personal opinions are infallible.</p>
<p>Only one other block was intended for me. That was by Sam Blanning for putting commentary into an article. I realized someone would see the commentary and correct an error in the article. I was afraid to correct it myself as Lethe was reverting every edit I made. Someone did read the commentary and made the change I requested. Again, this was on one of the first days I was editing Wikipedia, and did not know it was wrong.</p>
<p>Instead of Sam Blanning introducing himself and explaining the error I had made, like Lethe he just blocked for 24 hours, and left a nasty note on my talk page. At the time, I didn't even know I had a talk page.</p>
<p>Lethe and Sam Blanning were both as nasty as can be. They were patronizing, condescending and scolding like school marms with PMS. They insulted my writing ability, and belittled my talent.</p>
<p>With administrators like these, it seems to me Wikipedia is hell-bent an making enemies and doing all it can to discourage new editors.</p>
<p><b>&gt; I'm not sure what Michael is spefically referring to, but I'm</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; not surprised he's being reverted for edits like these (I myself</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; reverted him twice when he was inserting commentary into</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; that article). He would be better off trying to understand the</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; policy of verifiability instead of spamming everyone in sight</b></p>
<p><b>&gt; looking for an "advocate". --Sam Blanning(talk) 22:54, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>I understand the Wikipedia policy of verifiability very well. I have reliable sources for everything I have added to Wikipedia. Just about all my edits have remained in place. Most of what I wanted to get into the Many Worlds article is now there, despite the fact that Lethe assailed everything I added as patently false, and reverted all of it in its entirety.</p>
<p>Now, Sam Blanning and Lethe continue their personal, petty war against me, attacking me every chance they get and making snide remarks.</p>
<p>I thank you for your time, consideration and patience</p>
<p>Warmest and kindest regards, Michael D. Wolok</p>

Then I gave him a 3RR warning for other edits which was already too late.

<p>Dear Wikipedian Administrators,</p>
<p>I could be mistaken but I thought I read somewhere in Wikipedia that blocking an AOL IP never targets the intended user. I can't find that reference. Maybe, I am mistaken. I just know, my IP is blocked many times a day, and the block is always for some other user who has done this, that or the other.</p>
<p>I wish someone could help me set up an account that will not mistakenly get blocked, with blocks intended for other users.</p>

<dd>Unfortunatly AOL users are common vandals and AOL IPs have to be blocked to protect us from harm. However, these blocks almost always last no longer than 15 minutes, at which time you should be able to work again. Because of technical limitations currently we can not setup special accounts to let those legitimate users continue their work - even admins.</dd>
<dd>If you can, changing your ISP will stop your blocking as AOL is setup in a strange way that lends itself to being abused. --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 02:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me expand on what you said. Vandals can be found at AOL just as they can be found at every other ISP. A large group of Wikipedians who are fortunate to not have AOL don't really care about good editors being blocked, and would rather block lots of good editors than have to deal with reverting vandalism. We need admins with empathy and admins who want to help good editors edit. Tooo many people here would rather kill off good editors as long as some vandels get killed at the same time. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHort_Graz_fa66.html" title="User:Hort Graz">Hort Graz</a> 10:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I can't seem to find the place now, but I am sure I read somewhere on Wikipedia that when you block an AOL IP you NEVER target the intended user, that someone else is always blocked, not the intended objective of the block. For some reason, I can't find this place. I think this place also stated AOL blocks should not last more than 15 minutes. Does anyone know where on Wikipedia I can find this information again?</p>
<p>I have repeatedly had my AOL IP blocked for over twelve hours at at time. I find my AOL IP blocked on different user discussion pages by different administrators. I can still edit articles but find my AOL IP blocked by administrators who left the Wikipedia project months ago. For example, I tried to edit Garzo's discussion page, but found my AOL IP blocked by "Lucky 6.9". When I went to Lucky 6.9's talk page, it was blank. There was just a notice saying he had left the Wikipedia project and everyone should leave his talk page blank. In the meantime, I was still able to edit articles.</p>
<p>That block lasted over twelve hours. I tried editing Joanne's discussion page, but found my AOL IP blocked by another administrator. None of these blocks had anything to do with me. All the blocks I encounter now are intended for other users.</p>
<p>AOL has a lot of members so it doesn't surprise me that a lot of vandalism comes from AOL. It seems to me everyone should have to log in with a screen name and password. That wouldn't identify anyone, and would control vandalism. The idea of blocking a range of AOL IPs is worse than any evil that might result from having all users log in with a password.</p>
<p>Your objective to be more inclusive is backfiring!</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to expect AOL users to change their ISP for Wikipedia. To the best of my knowlege Wikipedia is the only web site on the Internet that gives AOL users a problem.</p>

<dd>We don't have an AOL problem, we have a lazy admin problem. Too many would rather block good users than do the work that could let good editers edit while stopping vandals. A single admin can get frustrated with AOL and ZAP hundreds of good editors at once. That is a lazy and bad admin. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHort_Graz_fa66.html" title="User:Hort Graz">Hort Graz</a> 11:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When we block someone vandalising wikipedia they maybe editing without logging in, if so we know their IP address and normally don't block for more than 15 minutes, we do however sometimes need to block a given address for longer if it is a sustained attack when the initial block (s) finish, normally however the 15 minutes suffices. The blocks I have seen you get caught up in are those where the user vandalises logged in, we block the username. Admins have no way of telling that the username wwas using AOL. The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoblock_1669.html" title="Wikipedia:Autoblock">autoblock</a> feature of mediawiki may then cause the IP address to be blocked until manually unblocked. There is no way for an admin to avoid blocking such users, since we simply don't know if it will further affect AOL users.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate you see it as unrealistic to expect AOL users to change ISP (to a greater or lesser degree I would agree), but it is also unrealistic to expect admins to let vandalism go unabated. As to if wikipedia is the only site which gets problems from AOL, we are large and certainly attract an amount of negative attention from certain AOL users but the aim of the project has always been to be open and so we keep the doors open, if you like those abusing this are the equivelant of those in society who mug old ladies, i.e. they go for a soft target. This doesn't mean that no effort is being expended on trying to resolve the problem, the elusive bug 550 is being worked on to rework the blocking system entirely which will hopefully go someway to sidestepping some of the problems. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 06:59, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems like autoblock does as much harm as it does good, perhaps more. Besides blocking innocent users, it forces them to reveal their IP address to be unblocked, whereas we go to extreme lengths to avoid divulging the IP address of vandals. Perhaps the autoblock should be shutoff until bug 550 is fixed. If the vandal makes a new account, it could simply be blocked when it starts vandalizing. If they edit by IP address instead of creating a new account, they can be given a 15 minute block, repeated as necessary. Alternatively, the autoblock time could be reduced to 15 minutes, which would frustrate vandalizers, but allow innocent users to simply wait it out instead of revealing their IP address. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:49, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you inform someone quick enough, then you don't need to reveal your IP. Admins can go to <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> and look up the autoblock, and unblock the autoblock ID, which is just a number, not an IP address. However, if you sit around for a while before doing anything about it, then you do have to reveal your IP. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">I VALUE YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 13:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How quick do they have to be? If it very quickly becomes too late (10 to 30 minutes), then even making a long edit without loading any pages may force the person to reveal his or her IP address. However, there is a very good chance that the person will not even be editing at the time of the block. If he or she starts editing 2, 8 or 16 hours later, will it be too late? Also, the instructions on the block message tell you to reveal your IP address, I think, because it says "IP address that is reported in the block text", not the masked number.</dd>
<dd>Blocking a user who is unaware of autoblocking is particularly bad, since they may think that they have been blocked for making perfectly good edits or that they have been blocked for making an unintentional mistake. While some indication of an autoblock may be given, it's best not to overestimate the knowledge of users, their technical competence and the probability that they will read <i>and</i> understand notices, instructions and warnings. I had to constantly reword and otherwise modify the somewhat popular website I run (9,000 members, many thousands of relevant, unique Google results and tens of million of visitors (I'm the sole admin, but did not create the site)) because of this problem. It has been refined about as much as possible, but a few people still manage to screw things up, although the frequency has been greatly reduced.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the Autoblock page says that IP blocks are sometimes extremely long, even indefinite, if the account has been indefinitely blocked. Except for open proxies, indefinite bans on IP addresses are prohibited. It would be necessary for a user to reveal his or her IP address to get such a long block removed, unless they happened to be around when it occurred and knew that it isn't necessary to reveal your IP address if you act quickly, as waiting it out would not be an option.</dd>
<dd>Luckily for me, my ISPs have given me a new IP address whenever the old one has been exposed and I have been able to change ISPs when necessary. Perhaps autoblocked users who want to keep their IP address private should be told to ask their ISP to give them a new IP address after it has been revealed in order to remove an autoblock. The disadvantage of this is that some information about the person may be attainable with the old IP address, such as the ISP and the user's general location. They could also change it to simply avoid the autoblock. Doing that won't help vandals much, since it usually takes a while to get it changed and an ISP is unlikely to constantly change a user's IP address. Another solution would be to have a form that a user enters his or her IP address into that gives a masked number that could be used in an unblock request. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh please. You people act like this is all that comes out of AOL. The <b>vast majority</b> of AOL edits are good edits. Blocking that is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I've done my share of vandal fighting, it's expected of everyone. But when all you do all day is look for vandals then all you ever see are vandals. This us vs. them philosophy is fundamentally wrong. It fosters an attitude of 'were better then everyone else'. Everyone is who is building this encyclopedia. We have vandals, yes, but we have many more good edits, orders of magnitude more, coming from these IP's and its this elitism thats dangerous to this project, not these common, come and go vandals that are easily reverted. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 11:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Here is an update on this: I got an email this morning from JumpTV's online marketing division. The Director of online marketing apologized for the behavior of Headeditor42 (<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeadeditor42_a883.html" title="User talk:Headeditor42">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Headeditor42_a787.html" title="Special:Contributions/Headeditor42">contribs</a>) (who is an employee of JumpTV). However, the Director also requested whether an internal link to <a href="../../../j/u/m/JumpTV_84ef.html" title="JumpTV">JumpTV</a> can be provided in the "existing" TV station related pages, since JumpTV is the only online Internet TV provider for the corresponding TV channels. Now, what's the policy on such links? It would be great if other admins could look into the links , and whether this request from the director is ok regarding internal links to <a href="../../../j/u/m/JumpTV_84ef.html" title="JumpTV">JumpTV</a> in the "see also" sections of TV channel pages.

<p>I have a similar issues. I posted about 6-9 links to "Podcasts Related to &lt;foo&gt;" in the external links sections of Wines, Pokers, Dogs, Anime, and one or two others. These do not go to the homepage of the site, they go to an internal page that lists all podcasts that users have tagged as Wine, Dogs, etc. Since these links are to content that are directly related to the wikipedia source, I felt this was OK. I do own the site itself, but only posted to wikipedia artcles where I am personally knowledgeable, e.g., I am a wine lover, dog owner, etc., and know that other people like me would find access to podcasts related to these topics of interest.</p>
<p>This was deleted as spam and the editor are publicly lambasted me as a spammer and made several threats about putting the site on the world wide blocking list, banning me, etc. He has been extremely heavy handed and incivil. I am an enthusiast about podcasts and sincerely believe there needs to be a way for someone who is, for example, reading the wine wikipedia so realize that there are podcast channels/episodes related to wine tasting, growing, etc., that would be useful and relevant to them.</p>
<p>There must be a way to do this that isn't spam and a way to do this that is spam. There needs to be some direction around this so people know what to do.</p>
<p>Also, we can't have editors acting heavy handed and insulting people in public. That creates a perception, that I am beginning to share, that there is a group of wiki-elite that seem to think they are above everyone else. That isn't community and will turn people off and damage wikipedia's credibility. my 2 cents.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd just like to add, in my own defense, as <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> feels so strongly that what I was trying to do was completely wrong, without ever trying to assist me and maybe set me on the right path, that after he had discussions regarding the situation with the director of online marketing for JumpTV, that a decision was reached regarding posting of information about JumpTV Inc. This decision, from the best of my knowledge, was that information was allowed to be posted on the talk page as to inspire other wikipedia users not affiliated with JumpTV to take from that information and post on the the main JumpTV page, as to expand on the "single promo paragraph and a huge list of a large number of TV channels" that <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> still complains about. Furthermore, the only reason those channel pages, like Balle Balle, had no information on them is because <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> felt it necessary to remove any and all information that I attempted to post, in some cases deleting all the information altogether. I'd like to help contribute information to both the main JumpTV page and have informative pages on the channels that are offered not only by JumpTV but as services through public websites. With the way <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> is behaving, that is becoming an impossible task. I would greatly appreciate any and all other admins to look into this situation and please let me know what the best course of action is in this situation, as <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> seems to be making it his mission to personally attack each and every edit I make. I have currently submitted this case to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-07-03_JumpTV_0537.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-07-03 JumpTV">informal mediation</a>, and hope to receive further information from other admins soon.

<p>I think an admin needs to review the behaviour of <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">User:PierreLarcin2</a> and his IPs in relation to the edit war on <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_International_bc14.html" title="Rotary International">Rotary International</a>, and consider a block.

<dd>Excuse me--vandalism? I merely made a notation on the page about the probable use of sockpuppets in the voting so that if the article comes up for another AfD editors can be aware of the sockpuppets (which voted in both of the last two AfDs for the article and have made few other edits to Wikipedia). While it is not standard procedure to edit an AfD after it is closed, in this case I felt it was warranted and I added a notice of what I'd done to the closing editor's talk page (see the note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJohnleemk&amp;diff=59833734&amp;oldid=59479895" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJohnleemk&amp;diff=59833734&amp;oldid=59479895" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I also can not be said to be <a href="../../../e/w/_/WP%7EEW_c046.html" title="WP:EW">edit-warring</a> over the item because I have not reverted <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a>'s deletion. Because this possible sockpuppet use has occured with both AfDs on this article, I felt the talk page was not an appropriate place to put the notice. That said, if the consensus is that this is not appropriate I will accept that consensus. I must protest the vandalism charge and feel it is wrong to make that claim against me. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate that. Since you object to adding that information to the AfD page, its fine with me if it stays off that page. Instead, I will place information about the use of sockpuppets and other AfD irregularities on the talk pages of The White Rose Society (website) and Ben Burch. This way future editors will know of this information if they bring an AfD up on either of these articles.

<dd>It's too late, Joe. I appreciate your comments and wish you had been the person to bring this up in the first place. I completely melted down on my Discussion page which only gave CrazyRussian another excuse to talk tough with me. I wish I had not exploded like that but I really felt like someone came from out of nowhere and treated me as if I had been doing something wrong, and that I needed to have immediate pressure applied to me. That was never the case. Thanks again, Joe, for acting like a thoughtful Wiki-citizen. I appreciate it. <a href="../../../r/b/a/User%7ERbanzai_70cb.html" title="User:Rbanzai">Anon Y.

<dd>These categories were red and hence attracted attention of people who could fix them. Also sometimes this user made wrong categories, like putting fish into people (probably cut and paste in wrong place, so I guess it was a semi-bot). So speedily deleting them is not evil. However if you can place them it is useful. So I suggest
<ol>
<li>Check is this user is the only editor of the category (i.e., the "(top)" label in his contribution list is not enough)</li>
<li>Try to place it</li>
<li>If you cannot fix it quickly, just delete it.</li>

<dd>I'm working on these -- about half of them are good categories that need placing, and about half are duplicates (i.e. "French singer" for "French singers") that need emptying and speedying. These don't strictly meet the speedy criterion (i.e., empty for 4 days) but I have had good luck getting them speedied if you mark them "circular category, emptied and deleted" or the like. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 19:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They <b>have</b> to be speedied because they are resut of the work of a vandal bot, not a honest editor. The longer bad category remains <b>blue</b> the higher is chance that it becomes more populated and hence more work to undo it (if a category is <b>red</b> when I type it, I know something is wrong (like with your "French singer" example), but if it is blue, I suspect nothing wrong).

<dd>I gave the account an indefinite block. His first edits were for his own RfA, indicating he is familiar with Wikipedia. Then he added some accounts to Johhny the Vandal's long term abuse page.
