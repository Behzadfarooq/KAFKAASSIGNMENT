<h2><span class="mw-headline">Working TOO well</span></h2>
<p>I'm concerned this page might be working TOO well. The latest report on it was blocked by 3 administrators, with only 1 minute of separation (00:49, 26 Jun 2005, 00:50, 26 Jun 2005, 00:51, 26 Jun 2005). If this trend continues, we'll have things like 10 or more different admins blocking the same user at the same time. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:56, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose the solution should be to publicise it more so we get more reports. I should think many of us find <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress</a> huge and unwieldy, with alerts that are out of date and not worth doing anything about by the time we find them. A system like this where many admins have the page on their watchlists and people report vandalism that really <i>is</i> in progress leads to good results. I've bolded the link on VIP and tried to encourage people to come here a bit more. Judging by the number of admins who act when this page is edited I think we could easily deal with many more reports here. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 01:16, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a good thing. Before I became an admin I found <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> to be too unwieldly to effectively use for people that obviously need to be blocked. I recall having to wait for the huge page to load, find the right section, fill in the form, hit "Save page" - oops, edit conflict, figure out where to add the report again, save the page, re-edit the page again to fix a formatting error I made, etc., and then the vandal often wouldn't get blocked on a timely basis anyway. I think that, if multiple admins are blocking at the same time, that's much better than hardcore vandals not getting blocked. As long as people don't start reporting non-vandalism here, I think things are coming along well. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 17:09, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Test4?</span></h2>
<p>The header on this page suggests that editors use the {{test4}} warning before reporting vandals here. I'm not sure that this is advisable, as a non-admin cannot follow up on this warning. Before I was an admin I would always stop and seek admin assistance after test3. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 1 July 2005 05:29 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that non-admins should stop at test3. It's no good people making threats to vandals that can't be followed through. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 1 July 2005 09:12 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. I think AIV is the reason that such threats <b>can</b> be followed through. I see that as the basic point. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 1 July 2005 09:46 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there is a problem with using test4 unless it is <i>definitely</i> going to be followed through. Because someone who isn't an admin might have a different interpretation of what's a blockable offence than the admin consensus, I'd rather they didn't use test4 at all, even if by reporting it here they really were able to get someone blocked straight away. To me, test4 means "I am sitting here with my finger on the block button giving you one last chance and waiting to see if you vandalise again, at which point I will immediately block you." This can only really come from an admin, with the ability to block without having to wait for someone else to see the request, review the evidence, and agree that a test4-style warning was appropriate. Also, {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} is quite strongly worded and sufficient for most purposes, I would have thought. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 1 July 2005 11:02 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I dunno about reg. users using test4. Personally, I am okay with it, but it's up to you guys (I'm an admin so I use test4 anyways) — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="color:gray;">Ilγαηερ</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="color: #333333;">(Tαlκ)</span></a> 1 July 2005 18:36 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before I became an admin I didn't use test4 much (and if I did, it was usually after reporting on <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>, but I'm okay with non-admins using test4 in situations where they <i>know</i> that an admin would block the user. Knowing whether an admin would block might require a fair bit of experience fighting vandalism on the part of the non-admin posting the test4 though, so I'd rather that casual users who don't have much vandalism-fighting experience not use test4. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 3 July 2005 13:53 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Adminship is about having extra tools. If non-admins can't be trusted with test4, they can't be trusted with test 1-3 either. Can't you place a test4 either if you're going away from the computer and nobody might notice the next vandalism and administer the block? Let's not limit vandal fighters further. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 3 July 2005 17:36 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that non-admins shouldn't use test4—I think that that is up to the individual user. I simply feel that this page shouldn't make giving a test4 warning one of the pre-requisites for reporting a vandal here. My reason for this it that when I was a non-admin (not very long ago) I would have personally felt very uncomfortable about using the test4 message. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 4 July 2005 02:14 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>test4 is troublesome for use by non-admins because the time between a report to AIV and actual blocking by an administrator can easily be hours, depending on administrator availability. During that time the vandal in question can make quite a number of edits, making the "next time you block" part of the template a very empty threat. As people should not make empty threats, test4 is less useful for non-admins than, say, test3, which simply warns of blocking at some indeterminate time in the future. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECollabi_ffaf.html" title="User:Collabi">Collabi</a> 11:53, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Personally, I will not block someone who has not yet received the test4 template, not to mention all the others. I would suggest that all users apply this template before bringing the case here. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:18, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personally don't mind if people post here after they've given out 3 warnings, culminating with ((test3)). An admin can then monitor the situation and issue a ((test4)), if needed, and then block the vandal quickly if he continues. It's a matter of judgement really: if a vandal has clearly ignored all warnings up to ((test3)), and it's likely that they will continue immediately and will have to be warned a fourth time, why not bring this to the attention of admins right after the ((test3))? However, if the vandalism happens only sporadically, over the course of several hours, days, or longer, then please warn with ((test4)) first and perhaps even wait until further vandalism does indeed occur before posting here. As I see it, AIV is basically about fast responses, and thus has two uses: when someone can be blocked immediately (five instances of vandalism, four warnings), or when instances of vandalism and warnings are happening in quick succession (what some people call "in real time"). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a> 04:03, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that it's working extremely well! I've used it several times and have seen the effectiveness of it. However, what I'm saying is that the VIP page was intended to be like this, right? (correct me if I'm wrong,&#160;:)) Therefore, admins need to keep up their excellent work and make sure no backlogs develop, otherwise AIV would turn into a backlogged VIP page. (Here's a wish that I know will never come true: having both AIV and VIP become obsolete because of the lack of vandalism...) <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 2 July 2005 21:50 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was discussing on IRC with <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a>, who overhauled VIP recently, how the vandal reporting system might be reformed. A well-thought out arrangement could lead to massive benefits in tackling vandalism. My idea was to have a three-pillared system, where AIV was for vandalism that was happening right as it was reported, and was dealt with immediately (either by blocking or rejection as an inappropriate report) and removed from the page straight away so there would never be a backlog, VIP for vandalism that had been happening on and off for a few days or maybe weeks, and a long-term alerts page for people like Willy on Wheels. VIP does appear to be working a little better now, but perhaps we need a clearer delineation between AIV and VIP, so that they don't duplicate each other's function. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 3 July 2005 00:04 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with that—we need a distinction between the two.

However, didn't see any discussion there of <i>where</i> to put such a tool. I know that when I do RC patrol, I keep AIAV open in Firefox (I have to have some tab open, why not AIAV), and I thought it might be useful to include this tool here for ease of use. Perhaps it could be changed to give a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} warning instead (i.e., you list the user here and give a test4 at the same time) or if it wouldn't clutter things up too much, all five test warnings could be included here (as I understand it, a different box would be needed for each.)

<p>If you use messages preset in your user subspace, you could add a similar box to your user/talk page and input your subpage instead of the test message.</p>
<p>I was thinking of it here because my system is usually to copy the username (or more often, IP) of the offender from the history of the vandalized page, click over to this tab, paste it into the {{user|Username}} template, paste it into the edit summary box, and click save. With it already present on the clipboard, it would be two more clicks to automatically test4 them from here. I don't know if others use a similar system, but I thought it might be helpful.</p>
<p>Another thought that comes to mind is using something similar on the block pages for admins to auto test5 any user they block. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 16:16, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes! That's exactly what I was thinking, except in a place that's more visable, like AIAV (because you don't really want everyone running off to your subspace to warn people, do you?). I figured AIAV was a good place, since it's fairly well known and well used, and would be convenient for everyone. Really, I think just test4 would work, becasue that is the most relevant to AIAV (and maybe test5 for the blocking admin, and like I said, maybe that should be on the blockpage). -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 16:38, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope those boxes aren't a drain on the servers! I did something similar in one of my sandboxes, and created one for welcoming new users (one of my hobbies).

<p>The box looks good, but it could use a pull-down menu with the warnings, and perhaps short descriptions of them, on the left. The User talk: could probably be assumed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Public machines and shared IPs</span></h2>
<p>The AIAV works great, except when it comes to school IPs and other public machines. Admins are reluctant to block such IPs, and they often become a haven for vandals. In some cases (such as the New South Wales High Schools: <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.234.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.234">1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.235.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.235">2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.236.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.236">3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.237.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.237">4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.238.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.238">5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.239.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.239">6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.166.96.240.html" title="User talk:203.166.96.240">7</a>), over one hundred warnings and numerous short-term blocks have been issued by admins, yet anonymous users of these machines continue vandalizing pages with impunity.</p>
<p>I understand the reluctance to ban anonymous contributions from an IP possibly shared by legitimate users. However, when a machine is the source of constant vandalism, is it too much to ask legitimate users to spend the 30 seconds needed to register? I'm sure almost all serious Wiki contributors are registered users anyway; I don't think I'm going overboard by expecting all contributors using public PCs to log in. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">OwenX</a> 20:11, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's a good example of the problem with not blocking IPs that belong to schools, JUST because it's a college IP. See 62.171.194.10. <b>NOTHING</b> but vandalism for some time, yet admins refuse to block (even for a short time) for the off chance that 1 out of 100 edits may be so useful as to overcome the fact that the remaining 99 edits are destroying the project. I say, block it (not forever, just for a short time) and don' let these vandal scum hide behind the fact that they use a shared computer. Other students would still be able to use Wikipedia, just not edit! What is the big deal?! Cost benefit analysis says that it's better to temporarily stop a vandal under this circumstance than let him have free license to vandalise in the false hope that someone might have the holy grail of edits and make ot all worth while.

<p>The individuals involved in the vandalism are mainly Gifted and Talented Education students, and many of them consider it fun or fail to realize that the Wikipedia doesn't exist just for their own enjoyment. Temporary IP bans don't seem to solve anything, as the guy on the computer next to me just vandalized the article on Hong Kong despite the fact that his vandalism has resulted in temporary bans in the past, similar for others. When asked about it, he said that "If they don't want us to do it, then they shouldn't let us edit it"</p>

<p>Once again, the system of short-term blocks on shared IPs simply isn't working. If the Wiki engine allowed registered users to post from blocked IPs, these shared IPs could be blocked permanently, for the benefit of all--legitimate school contributors and the rest of us. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 20:24, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So vandals would just be forced to register accounts and be able to blend into the crowd even better. What we need is a differentiated recent changes system whereby edits from blocked IPs come on a different list (and in an ideal world, the worst few categories of edits (from blocked IPs, page moves by new users) would need their edit to be approved by a trusted user.

<p>If a vandal who has previously been warned and blocked returns after their block expires to commit the same vandalism, is it necessary to warn them again, or should we just report it immediately? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 16:50, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the most part, I'd say yes, but it depends on how long after the vandal's previous block expired, and the behaviour in this time. If the vandal's block expired a month ago, and has made useful contributions before making a questionable edit, then I'd say a warning might be a appropriate. If the vandal immediately vandalises an article after the block expires (or even does nothing for, say, a month, then the first edit is vandalism), I would think that it's appropriate to just report it immediately. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:29, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general I'd say reblocking immediately is fine, though if at all possible you should make sure it's the same vandal and not just someone using the same IP. I generally only immediately reblock returning vandals if the content or style of their vandalism is recognisably the same. Be on the lookout for school IPs which might look like persistent vandals but have many more newbie-test-style edits and sometimes even some good edits mixed in. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 17:39, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any sort of interface between Wikipedia and related projects to deal with vandals moving from one project to another? User:70.29.3.3 , having been blocked from Wikipedia on October 21, 2005, has proceeded to vandalize 70 pages on Wikiquote in the space of a single day (October 23). Although an IP is involved, the vandalism is exactly the same on the Wikiquote pages as the ones on Wikipedia. Since this person is new to Wikiquote, does that mean that he/she gets to start afresh, going through all the warning stages before being blocked on Wikiquote; or does it mean that blocking can be applied on Wikiquote based on this person's record on Wikipedia? To vandalize 70 pages in one day is so extreme that this person could do a lot of disruption unless the customary grace period would be skipped on Wikiquote. I have informed the Wikiquote administrators of the vandalism but thought that I should mention it here also. I'm aware that this is not the page for reporting someone's vandalism, but I write here because I'm asking a policy question and wished to provide an example. Also, since this user is temporarily blocked on Wikipedia, it wouldn't be a Wikipedia "vandalism in progress" case. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvisibleSun_3081.html" title="User:InvisibleSun">InvisibleSun</a> 08:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There aren't any mechanism for administrators on one wiki-project to block IP's on others. I'm an administrator here on the english wikipedia, but I don't have any powers on any other wiki. And the other way around. The many hundred different wikipedias are completely separate web sites in this (and many other) respects. There are also different blocking-policies among the wikis with some being more tollerable to newbie-testing etc than others, so allowing admins on one project to block users on a different wikipedia is probably not a good idea. It might seem like it on clear cut vandalism like you refer to, but there will always be borderline cases. Whether admins on other projects check IP-history on the english wikipedia before blocking, I don't know. I doubt it. At least I never bother to check any history on other wikis. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 08:47, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

There are cases where posting a test5-message is not on top of an admins to-do list (e.g. reverting the vandalism is more important) and sometimes one just forgets. And the user:talk pages are really primarily meant for messages to the user in question. And, in that regard, a test5 is slightly redundant as he'll get the message anyway when he tries to edit after being blocked. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 06:42, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm fairly new to Wikipedia but I'm amazed at how short the bans are for vandalism. Surely a first ban should be short, but a subsequent one should be a month or more. I've tried doing a bit of editing and started a few articles, but why should editors have to waste time on removing the puerile drivel of sad idiots with nothing better to do than wrecking? <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwaka_Lumpa_0a5e.html" title="User:Gwaka Lumpa">Gwaka Lumpa</a> 19:01, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am, generally, in agreement with you. If a 24 hour block doesn't work, why would another one do it, and thena nother then 31 hours (like 7 more hours will do it) It should be 24, 48, week then month in my opinion and that's with ana non user a registered user deserves less sympathy ion my book and should be indefiantely banned if the account is obviosuly only for vandalism. Just my thoughts, many otehrs are much more lenient than I.Gator (talk) 19:10, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I add my agreement to this. It is frustrating to see and revert vandalism from the same user over and over. However, I think anonymous users should be swiftly dealth with and given at least a 48 hour block on first offense to discourage them from coming back for more of the same behavior; might be less likely that they will "learn the ropes". <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> 19:30, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is collateral damage. Blocking an anon IP often also blocks other legitimate editors. Static IP can (and often are) blocked for a month or more, but most IPs are dynamic, which means that you'll be punishing innocent editors far more often than actually blocking vandals. Also, our primary goal is to get those vandals to become constructive editors whenever possible, not to kick them all out. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 19:51, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what of anonymous IPs like 207.217.218.1, where the same user has been repeating the same vandalism from (exclusively) the same address for two months, all the evidence points to it being a static IP, and no legitimate contributions have ever been made from that address? I eventually got this user blocked once (for a period of 1 hour, which wasn't much use in itself, but was probably necessary before longer blocks were given). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=32147579" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=32147579" rel="nofollow">next time I put it in</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=32149745&amp;oldid=32149248" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=32149745&amp;oldid=32149248" rel="nofollow">it was removed</a>. I understand the reasons against and risks inherent in blocking IPs for more than a short period, but I thought this was a strong case for an extended (*not* indefinite) block. Evidently not. Enough; constantly rvv-ing and giving out warnings when it's clear that nothing of note will ever get done is simply playing into his/her hands and wasting time that could be better spent making positive contributions. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 20:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is reasonably clear it is a static address, longer blocks are appropriate. If I can be sure it's static so there won't be collateral damage, I'll go something like 24hr, 48hr, week, month for the blocks. But I'll escalate faster if it's really obvious like vandalizing immediately after the block expires or something else that shows similar intent. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:53, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>See I totally agree. Just look at the history of the IP, just don;t assume its not static adn give a weak block (if any). If it's nothing but vandalism for some time then logic suggests that it will continue to be nothing but vandalism for some time to come unless a long block is administered. In those cases, an admin would be right to judge that there will likely be little collateral damage and will, likely, only stop a repeat vandal from coming back for a month or so. Go ahead and take the chance! In other words, don<i>t give an IP leeway JUST because their an IP (thus, rewarding vandals for not registering), take a look at the user history before deciding whether to cut the user some slack.</i> We need to ask ourselves, in general, what is more damaging to Wikiepdia, accidentally blocking a good user (who refuses to register) for a short time or allowing vandals continued freedom tom destroy our hard work. I know what I would say.Gator (talk) 20:48, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, some dynamic IP's will exhibit repeated vandalism too. So you have to look at the patterns.

<li>I assume that the bots are using the same IP to create these multitudes of username. There should be a way to restrict the amount of usernames created in a given time period. (eg: One username per hour per IP address) I assume the framework is already setup since Admins (which I hope to be one day) can block an IP for a set amount of time.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reduce Vandalism</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I love that Wikipedia is an open, free encyclopedia but wouldn't it it still be open and free if one were required to have a free user account to edit a page? Wouldn't this cut down the amount of vandalism since most is done by non-registered users anyhow? Plus, it would eliminate the issue of multiple users on one IP address. Of course, a vandal could create new usernames but this would require a little more effort on their part and would inevitably result in less vandalism and less time resolving the issues they've created making for a better organized, more accountable Wikipedia.. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPattersonc_dcf3.html" title="User:Pattersonc">Pattersonc</a> 15:41, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This issue is perenially brought up, and has never garnered much support. Primarily, the idea of requiring user registration runs contrary to the concept of a wiki, and there have been some fantastic contributions from anonymous editors. In addition, people often do not wish to sign up for an account, but they're fine with editing. Any restrictions on anonymous editing will inevitably lower the amount of vandalism...but it will also lower the amount of truly good contributions. In fact, I have seen lots of spelling errors and typos fixed by anons while on RC patrol. The point is valid, but it's an undue burden on the user to require registration. In my opinion, of course. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 15:53, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I agree that anon users do make excellent contributions, registration is a painless process that still preserves one's anonymity (more so, since your IP is no longer visible to non-admins). In my experience, about 50% of edits by anon users are vandalism, and about 90% of vandalism comes from anon users. If Wikipedia is serious about curbing vandalism, blocking anon edits would be the quickest way to instantly reduce it. See: <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_Gripes_About_Wikipedia_Why_are_anonymous_edits_allowed__0c09.html" title="User:MisterHand/Gripes About Wikipedia/Why are anonymous edits allowed?">User:MisterHand/Gripes About Wikipedia/Why are anonymous edits allowed?</a> -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 16:11, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure it's a painless process. Does everyone who visits Wikipedia realize that? Obviously not, because some people are tireless anon contributors. Forcing it might drive them away. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 16:13, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you all for your replies. The arguments for both sides are quite valid. Though I don't feel a free registration is contrary to concept of Wikipedia, I do agree that many non-registered readers make countless typo edits which is an added value to this site. I can only imagine such a decison will only be warranted if, and only if, vandalism becomes so rampant that it is nearly uncontrolable. I hope that is never the case. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPattersonc_dcf3.html" title="User:Pattersonc">Pattersonc</a> 17:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, registering is a painless process, but it would be an equally painless process for vandals. Requiring people to register might deter the very laziest anon vandals, but other vandals would just register and vandalise. In the meantime, you would lose the good editors that don't wish to register. If 90% of vandalism comes from anon users, that to me is an arguement to <b>keep</b> anon edits, as anon edits often come under more scrutiny. Forcing everyone to register would simply push the anon vandalism into non-anon vandalism, where it might get lost in the traffic. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:53, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just can't believe how feeble the measures against vandals, and especially <i>habitual</i> vandals, are. A clear case of vandalism should result in the IP being blocked for a serious amount of time without warning. I mean, are we an encyclopedia or some form of chat room? What I find especially bizarre is that when I spot a vandal and his history shows that he has been at it repeatedly, i. e. it wasn't just an isolated case of "newbie sandboxing", then there is still all this red tape before the culprit sees even the slightest form of forfeit. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikel_c22c.html" title="User:Maikel">Maikel</a> 20:45, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this vandalism?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure if the following counts as vandalism or a content dispute. Someone deleted about half of an article I wrote (after flagging it as POV first) and when the ensuing discussion didn't resolve it I put up an rfc. Six other people joined in and none of them agreed with the other guy. Still, he persists in deleting large chunks of text. I am inclined to call this vandalism, so I put up a warning on his talk page (not an official template because I wasn't sure). To no avail. Actually, it's a bit silly not to mention what this is about.

<dd>It's a tricky one. Coming from an impartial view, everyone has all got a bit het up about it. I'm inclined to say not vandalism, just good old stubborness. A suggestion to you - put the NPOV tag on the section, and let the discussion continue. While I understand your reluctance for the NPOV tag, bear in mind that the tag says the POV is <i>disputed</i>, it is not a clear statement that the article has a POV. That will let the text stand and give time for discussion to arrive at a final version. I have to say, however, that the fact that Cubdriver lost most credence in the discussion when it transpired that they hadn't seen the film, and then then shot themself in the foot by their mailicious edit to the comment tag in the last edit - that, I think, is more likely vandalism, and above all is childish.

<p>In the past I have had to revert some changes that <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> made to various articles. I placed warnings on their talk page as a result. They also provide a number of good edits as well though. Now just recently they have blanked out the warnings that were put on their talk page by me. I have since reverted that change. If this was done as some sort of change in the user's attitude, that they wanted to sort of clean up their act or whatever, then I'd be fine with them as an editor. But when they make these nonsense edits while also adding good edits they seem more like either a schizophrenic or a troll. So, what can/should be done?

<li>While I am not yet an admin, I have experience in this. Blanking talk pages <b>IS</b> vandalism. I would issue him another warning, preferably using the "final warning" template if you are at that point. If this were an IP and not a registered user, I would suggest that the IP is shared. However, since the user is logged in, it seems like there are either two users using this, or that the user has the "save my password" function enabled. I would issue him a warning, and watch him. If he vandalizes again, please post him here for a block. Thanks&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/n/t/User%7EKntrabssi_cb78.html" title="User:Kntrabssi">Kntrabssi</a> 22:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=43372350&amp;oldid=43370660" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=43372350&amp;oldid=43370660" rel="nofollow">listed</a> a vandal who'd left an abusive edit summary on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Australian Greens</a> about 16 hours previously, after having been warned and blocked some days back. This was removed with comment 'no action--no edits in last 16 hours'. How recent does vandalism have to be to qualify for action? I appreciate that there's not much to be gained by blocking anon IPs for ancient edits, but the only time period mentioned on the project page is 24 hours. (Note also that the edit on the Greens page took place about 11 pm on a Saturday night Australian time, which probably has something to do with why nobody noticed it immediately.) --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:21, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I think the "24 hour" notice should be changed. I see this as an emergency hotline - stop that vandal now!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's also the problem with IP addresses that some (many?) of them are shared, so we can't block for long. If the most we can do is block for a few hours, then 16 hours later is actually longer than the period of time they would have been blocked for.</dd>

<dd>All that said, I'm a new admin and my interpretation of what should go here and what shouldn't is maybe best sent to /dev/null&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 03:06, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Keep in mind the point of this page is not to punish vandals, it's to keep vandals from continuing their vandalism. If they've stopped vandalizing for the time being -- and 16 hours is pretty clearly a cessation -- then banning them serves no point. Persistant vandalism over a long period of time is a different problem. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 03:24, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From a newbie's perspective, it isn't at all clear how to deal with this sort of thing. I first came here via <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>, which says "If the vandal strikes again [after receiving warning templates], list them at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a>", without any indication that this is only for vandalism in the last few hours. The intro to this page says that it is "intended to get administrator attention quickly when dealing with persistent vandals", and while it does say "within the last few hours", the only hint as to how big that 'few' might be is the subsequent mention of "last 24 hours". If you view the page as being for dealing with vandalism in progress, context suggests that that 'few' might be just a couple of hours, but without that context all a newbie has to go on is the "last 24 hours".</dd>

<dd>Perhaps somebody familiar with how the vandalism process works could review <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> and adjust them so they better reflect that process?

<p>To be honest, my own personal policy about it is that if I find recent vandalism, I report it here if there have been previous warnings or bannings (if there is a history of it). Its up to the admins as to what to do about them - I only report what I find. If this is not Wiki policy, or is inconvenient for admins, I'm sure before too long one of them will be kind enough to leave me a nice message directing me to the correct methodology. The problem is, as I see it, that there are many policy procedures - not all of them are clear cut - and many different warning (etc) templates that can be used. That's not a bad thing in my opinion, as it can cover all bases and is useful in specifying what a given problem is.</p>
<p>Kingboyk, you mentioned that shared IPs can only be blocked for short periods of time. I'm personally concerned about this. Some of these IPs seem to be particularly persistant and sometimes quite damaging to Wikipedia. My suggestion would be that, while we should perhaps show *slightly* more leniency for shared IPs, if vandalism is persistant from a certain IP, it should be blocked indefinately. If its a school's IP, then its the problem of the school - not of Wikipedia. Of course, the school should probably be entitled to appeal the block and promise to clamp down on vandalism. It is a waste of time to be going about reverting edits along the lines of "My teacher/Sarah Smith looks like a potato" etc, when editors such as myself could best serve Wiki by improving and creating articles, rather than undoing the work of immature 'pranksters'. I've never been banned, but I assume some kind of message is created automatically for people who attempt to edit Wikipedia from blocked IPs, explaining the reason, and outlining a way to appeal the deicision made? That should be where, in my opinion, Wikipedia's responsibility ends. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 04:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archive procedure proposal</span></h2>
<p>The current management of items that were dealt with is difficult to follow; this page could use more transparency, by means of archiving. It's impossible to get an easy notion of how requests are handled. When an item is removed from the alerts, one has to go back to an earlier revision just to check the blocklog link. Try finding out whether there was a comment given in an incident that happened only yesterday.</p>
<p>It should not be expected from people who have listed an item that they go rooting through the edit history for possible replies. The edit summaries are not the best place for comments, especially for advice directed at inexperienced users who may never see it. Thus the suggestion is to add the following footer (the instructions in the header will have to be changed accordingly, too):</p>
<p><big><b>Done</b></big> (or some other heading)</p>
<hr />
<p><small>Move items that were dealt with below here. Archive when appropriate: Put the current pageID in the revision link, delete the old requests, put "archive" in the edit summary.&#160;—&#160;Revision prior to last archive: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=???????" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=???????" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></small></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
"<i>List empty</i>" does not have to mean "<i>page empty</i>". The additional keystrokes for the copy&amp;paste of (re)moved items are more than offset by not having to explain every action. The edit summary for the basic 'done' removal can be as simple as "<i>rm</i>" or "<i>one done, 2 alerts remain</i>". The revision links will create a continuous chain of archive pages. (Should these prove cumbersome or of little use, skip that part, then one still would have only to seek the archive summaries in the edit history). It becomes possible to add later clarifications. All content that is related to an alert stays together and comments remain retraceable at a glance. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 19:32, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My main intention was not creating an archive, but making it possible to keep the reports and their comments together. Maybe I'm just strange, but does nobody want to check the blocklog links to see what happened? How much time do you spend waiting for an earlier revision with the links or the edit history to come up?</p>
<p>Frankly I have no idea how much a certain amount of convenience is worth, compared to an uncertain amount of potential waste. How much time do admins spend typing "<i>rm, blocked</i>" or c&amp;p'ing the removed IPs into the edit summary? These explanations seem like unnecessary work because it's obvious that when a report is removed, it is done - unless there remains no trace of it. The six or seven keystrokes for the move appear rather insignificant compared to the earlier work of going through the contributions, blocking, explaining the block, and all. If there's little need to delve into the archives, why do you spend time on detailed edit summaries that many people may never go look for? <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 20:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What if the user doesn't vandalize often, but it appears that every edit over the past few months has been vandalism? They have recieved 9 warnings, never responded, and have been temporarily blocked. I would list on the page, but it doesn't seem to fall under the specific criteria.

<p>Not every edit is vandalism. I just checked. Most, but not all. If it were all, I would eventually indef block as it was clear that the account was being used only to vandalise. As it stands, I would block the next time he vandalises. Let me know and I'll do it.Gator (talk) 19:30, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have recent changes patrollers who spot a lot of vandalism even if the page isn't watched (and there's bots and IRC feeds too). The problem with "stale" reports is that they are often for IP addresses, and quite often shared IPs. In the latter case we can't really block them hours after the event, and we are cautious with regards to any IP address. The extra burden on admins having to review and dismiss stale reports is not <b>imho</b> offset by the small number of rampant vandals caught through those reports. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:32, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say that you should gather evidence that (either) all recent edits or all edits (full stop) are vandalism, and include it with your report here. If it's clear from the style/targets of the vandalism that it's the same person who's been vandalising from that IP in all cases (implying a static or near-static IP), include that information too.

<dd>Not quite; what I had in mind was specifically for anonymous IP editors who had a fair number of edits, all of which were vandalism (either in the past few months or since they started). This is more important for IPs because, as we know, they can be shared by valid users and we have to be sure before blocking them. One variant I have in mind may include wording to the effect that "the pattern of edits indicates the same user or group of users, indicating a static IP", but I'm not too happy with the wording.

<p>...in time at which to start a new line of warnings? Before, they told me it was each month. Judging by the results of me spamming the place, it's not enough by a long shot.</p>
<p>So what do I do if an IP vandalises 2, 3, or 5 days after the "last chance" they were given? Give them <i>another</i> one? Or thank them for experimenting with Wikipedia? Or just revert their crap, leaving their talk page to rot with no warnings, after which they are asked nicely to stop vandalising by the next admin who comes along and sees that the vandal hasn't been warned for an entire week? I know IP blocking isn't a punitive measure, but think what the vandals learn from this: vandalise every few days, and it's OK.</p>
<p>So once again. Into sections of what lengh should the warnings on a persistent vandal's talk page be divided? Months? Days? Hours?</p>

Tomorrow, the guy will come back from school and vandalize some more, to which a new pack of very serious warnings will follow. The vandalism is pretty static, he vandalises at his leisure, not straining himself. Maybe even doing his homework in between. But he will not be blocked, because you have to really <i>ask</i> for it. I'm telling you, the system is flawed. P.S.

<dd>We really need to change the so-called "Last Warning" template, to make it clear that it is a "If-you-do-more-vandalism-in-the-next-few-hours,-you-will-be-blocked." <b>not</b> "If-this-account(or-IP-address)-<i>ever</i>-does-any-more-vandalism,-you-will-be-blocked."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Appropriate for Non-Admins to Remove Alerts?</span></h2>
<p>I frequently notice alerts being added to this page about users who clearly do not meet the criteria for administrative intervention (i.e. have not vandalized in 24hrs, have barely vandalized at all, are involved in a content dispute rather than vandalism, etc.), and I was wondering if would be considered appropriate for a non-admin such as myself to remove these alerts? (Naturally I would leave an edit summary explaining the reasons for removing the alert.) Typically, I just leave them alone and wait for admins to go through the list and clear each user; however, there are many times, such as today, when there is an enormous backlog of alerts, many of which do not really require admin intervention, and it seems that removing the unnecessary alerts would allow for admins to deal with the real vandals more promptly. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 21:03, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would definatly be approprite for non-admins to remove users who have been blocked. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 21:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but what about users who have not been blocked, yet whom there is clearly no reason to block nor for an admin to investigate? For instance, 129.170.202.3 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.170.202.3.html" title="User talk:129.170.202.3">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.170.202.3_5d3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.170.202.3">contribs</a>) was just listed as having vandalized past his final warning, yet he has not been warned nor has he vandalized since the 23rd of April, and it is a shared IP registered to Dartmouth College--clearly no reason for an admin to intervene just yet, and sysops could spend more time dealing with actual vandalism in progress. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 21:16, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't object to you and other <i>trustworthy</i> non-admins remove users who do not meet the criteria the page requires, namely: The vandal has to have been warned and the vandal has to have vandalized within the last few hours and after the final warning. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 21:21, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An admin would still need to check if the block has been applied so not much work is saved by removing the entry by a non-admin.

<dd>I don't know that there would be any need to check that a block had been applied if an established user puts in the edit summary something like; <i>Remove 14.329.86.47, blocked by Curps, 24 hrs. List NOT EMPTY.</i> I see such edit summmaries frequently, and often I don't <i>know</i> if the editor in question is an admin or not.

<dd>Okay, that seems reasonable. I certainly wouldn't remove any borderline vandals or anything an admin might want to look at--i.e., an admin may want to get involved in a content dispute. I would just remove alerts that clearly do not belong per Prodego's reasoning above. Thanks! I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't cause more stress for myself and anothers as a result of my ignorance about some rule regarding AIV, when I really just want to alleviate a tid bit of stress off the admins. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 21:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having non-admins flag up the less obvious block cases with a comment could certainly be helpful. This allows the obvious cases to get first priority attention, and once they are all blocked an admin can look at the less obvious cases and deal with them as they feel appropriate. Please do remove blocked users though, that helps a lot (unless I'm being continually edit conflicted as happened earlier today&#160;;-) ). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:36, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is <b>very</b> appropriate for non-admins to do as many admin tasks as possible. Everybody should act like an admin. Admins are nothing special: we're just editors with an extra button and feature or two. Adminship is no big deal. So, yes, please do follow the same protocols as admins should do and do all the admin jobs that you can do without the extra button. Everyone will benefit from this. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">R</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_Esperanza_f04c.html" title="User:Redvers/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">DVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 21:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see no reason why <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> shouldn't be treated like <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a>, signed in non-admins may close deletion discussions which a) don't require admin tools (i.e. haven't resulted in 'delete') and b) are uncontroversial. I wholeheartedly endorse applying the same procedure to AIV submissions. At the very least non-admins should feel free to hold entries ("hasn't vandalised since last warning, leaving on for a bit") and then remove them when they reach a reasonable threshhold. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:12, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, more work from non admins would be great as long as it's done well. A number of tasks could be handled, such as noting editors that have not vandalized since the last warning, but hold them on the page for follow up checking, removing obvious non blocking candidates, etc. But keep in mind that doing so one is taking responsibility for that editors edits if one falsely removes an entry with bad faith. In fact doing that after a warning is very blockworthy. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:02, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that this is a good idea, as long as it is done properly. My big concern here is that vandals could potentially remove themselves or other vandals from the <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> page. Perhaps there should be a request page, where people could put themselves down for this responsibility. However, this could also have the same issue that <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> has, in that it would require an admin to watch it, and approve users. So, I guess I'm split on this. On one hand, I like the idea, but on the other hand, it could be tricky to make it work.--<em><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_b457.html" title="User:Digitalme">digital_me</a></em><sub><span style="color:#007700; cursor: crosshair;">(</span><a href="../../../d/i/g/User_talk%7EDigitalme_e893.html" title="User talk:Digitalme"><span style="color:#007700; cursor: crosshair;">Talk</span></a><span style="color:#007700; cursor: crosshair;">)</span><em>(</em><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Digitalme_d720.html" title="Special:Contributions/Digitalme"><em>Contribs</em></a><em>)</em></sub> 03:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a good point. It might not be worth the extra overhead. How about no removing by non admins, just commenting. That's still pretty helpful, and we could still block people that try to use the page for ill. Either way messing with this page would be a pretty quick way to get blocked. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, well as there didn't seem to be much objection to my helping out with this, I've already removed a few alerts. If anyone disagrees with any of my actions or finds it inappropriate for me to be doing this, please drop a note on my talk page and I will stop at once. I've had AIV on my watchlist for some time and have made a habit out of helping other non-admins to hold off vandalism onslaughts while we wait for an admin to arrive, so I think I have a decent idea of what vandals truly need administrator attention and which ones don't (as I believe many non-admins do). I personally agree that this should be dealt with in much the same way as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, that if an action does not require administrator tools there is no problem for non-admins to act, so long as their actions are appropriate. This page is pretty closely monitored, so I think that any questionable removals will be spotted, and users whose actions are not helpful will be told to stop; thus, I don't think there is really any need for more overhead. But anyway, I just want to help out here, so if my actions are found to be unhelpful I will have no problem stopping at once. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:00, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also strongly support you (and anyone else) doing this sort of work. I don't think it's right to make a rule that only admins can remove entries; if a vandal removes themselves, list them on WP:AN/I (where entries are <i>never</i> removed, they are archived), and it will be dealt with. The principle on Wikipedia is that anyone can do anything, until they show themselves to be screwing it up too much. The only reason we even <i>have</i> the sysop bit is that some abilities are too hard to quickly fix if they are misused, so we restrict who has access to them. Admins <b>are not smarter than anyone else</b> and it's great that you are helping out in this way. Thanks for asking, though - more discussion is also always a good and useful thing. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 22:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
