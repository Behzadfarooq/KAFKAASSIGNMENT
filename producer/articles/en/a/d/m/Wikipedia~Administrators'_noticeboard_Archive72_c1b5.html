<dd>I lost two minutes of my life watching that thing, and would remove it just because of the anger I feel within myself&#160;;-) My rule of thumb: when in doubt, remove it. If the copyright is not clear, remove it. Note that, while promotional videos are supposedly promotional, companies exert a pretty hard control over them. In example, Japanese record companies do not allow these promotional videos to appear in YouTube, in example, and request their deletion in a daily manner. Personally, I only leave links to videos if they are in the artist or discography sites. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 13:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think you should both stop revert-warring and discuss the pros and cons of both versions on the talk page of the articles, and try to work it out, rather than constantly reverting "vandalism" which isn't vandalism and making comments - like the above - that only antagonisethe situation. I'll <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">request full-protection</a> to force you to discuss, if ned be, though I'd rather not&#160;:) Cheers, <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a></b> 01:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I have yelled once, but that's it. If you care to have a look at Highshines edits, you will realise that this is a disruptive editor, who refuses to engage in any serious discussion about his/her edits. I can give you numerous examples of this, but I'm getting tired. Some else with administrative powers will have to take care of this, because I'm giving up. I'll unmark these pages from my watch list and let Highshines ruin the pages. Good bye.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 01:53, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's something must be made clear: Niohe even repeatedly deletes relevant, valuable historical images from non-image-heavy articles, even from articles with only 2 images. For instance, see the history of <a href="../../../y/i/x/Yixin%2C_Prince_Gong_566b.html" title="Yixin, Prince Gong">Yixin, Prince Gong</a>, <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xian_Chun_4b66.html" title="Xiao Xian Chun">Empress Xiao Xian Chun</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Noble_Consort_Hui_Xian_43ea.html" title="Imperial Noble Consort Hui Xian">Imperial Noble Consort Hui Xian</a>. None of the images are identical, and they were all painted or photographed in different years. It can do no harm to leave these images on the articles, and even if these images should be removed, Niohe should have previous noticed me the uploader so that I could move the images to WikiCommons. The example Niohe provided <a href="../../../e/m/p/Talk%7EEmpress_Dowager_Cixi_Archives_1_5333.html#This_article_is_image_heavy" title="Talk:Empress Dowager Cixi/Archives 1">Talk:Empress_Dowager_Cixi/Archives_1#This_article_is_image_heavy</a> is just an extreme case where it was indeed image-heavy, and I have agreed and removed several images myself. There is absolutely no user complaints on all the rest of the articles. Also, I'm not editing images against <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">image use policy</a>, because I have resized all my images so that they do not exceed the maximum width it states (550px). Actually, most of them are within 300px wide and many of them are even smaller.</p>
<p>Look at these valuable historical images of extreme high quality and resolution that Niohe has been trying hard to destroy: (They have all belonged to different articles, and thus not space-occupying or redundant.)</p>

<li>It is the responsibility of the administrators and other responsible parties to close extended policy discussions they are involved in, such as this dispute. Closing consists of announcing the decision at the locations of the discussion and briefly explaining the basis for closing it in the way it is being closed; further, to change any policy pages, guidelines or naming conventions to conform with the decision; and finally, to enforce the decision with respect to recalcitrant users who violate the decision, after reminding them and warning them.</li>

However, the enforcement provision applies to "this matter." In other words, the arbitration committee doesn't want to permanently enshrine the current TV episode naming convention, but doesn't want to open the door to wikilawyering in a month that <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_can_change_5953.html" title="WP:Consensus can change">WP:Consensus can change</a>.

<dd>In this case, the committee recognizes that a consensus to disambiguate TV episode names <i>only when needed</i> exists but was not recognized by all involved.

<dd>Yes, however remember that decisions create precedents. From what I see and understand, it is allowing administrators and others (in example, an informal mediator who had been called upon an issue who may not be administrators) to close discussions looking for consensus, not only for moves but for any discussion (in example, "Which image we should use for this article?", "Should we shrink the plot even more?", "Should we add more external links?", etc). I was asking about the period grace because it would be pretty helpful in any case when the "closure" is applied (who hasn't been inside a discussion that ended, just to begin again on the following week?). While 180 days is explicit for this case, it would be useful for those closing debates to establish a period during which the consensus is accepted, so that the article can move forward (discussions looking for consensus usually impact negatively on the article, as editors focus on dicussing instead of improving it). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 05:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you can set a calendar on consensus. The period during which consensus is accepted is the period during which it is accepted, however long that is. (Wonderful circular logic.) If, after a discussion closes, one person wants to reopen it against the majority that is happy with the outcome, that's obviously a no-go, no matter how long it has been. If enough people have changed their minds that a consensus no longer exists, then the discussion needs to be reopened, no matter how long it has been. Consensus lasts however long it lasts, in other words. I read the ruling to give admins broad discretion. Anyone who can't handle it shouldn't be an admin, or at least leave these situations to others.</dd>
<dd>I would also be cautious in applying the arbitration committee's ruling, which mentions policies and guidelines, to more minor issues such as the ones you suggested. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I understand. The examples I gave are very simple ones, I was thinking in an extremely complex one. There is this concept that japanese articles should be in uppercase if they are written in a determined way, thus you may end up with many articles with titles like <a href="../../../c/o/l/COLORS_51bf.html" title="COLORS">COLORS</a>. Trying to move it to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colors_%28Utada_Hikaru%29_4b26.html" title="Colors (Utada Hikaru)">Colors (Utada Hikaru)</a> may make others move it back to <a href="../../../c/o/l/COLORS_51bf.html" title="COLORS">COLORS</a>. If you move it to the correct location, people would just change the name from "Colors" to "COLORS" inside the article. In any case this is an extremely complex issue. I was thinking that, in seven months, people would be free to move the articles again to the "(Buffy episode)", since the period would have ended, and one would have to search for consensus again.

<dd>My understanding of the ruling is that people would be free to move articles to the "(Buffy episode)" naming pattern <b>if and only if</b> consensus at <a href="../../../t/v/-/WP%7ETV-NC_c23a.html" title="WP:TV-NC">WP:TV-NC</a> changed; and the "closing" part of the ruling is, as Thatcher131 indicates, meant to give the current consensus "time to settle". Of course consensus can change, but it can't be in a <i>constant</i> state of change — otherwise, it's not much of a consensus.

<li>"Consensus can change" does not mean "ignore consensus if you disagree with it", although certain people have been wikilawyering that way. If you believe that consensus has changed, the burden is on you to demonstrate that, generally through dialogue.

<p>Niohe even repeatedly deletes relevant, valuable historical images from non-image-heavy articles, even from articles with only 2 images. For instance, see the history of <a href="../../../y/i/x/Yixin%2C_Prince_Gong_566b.html" title="Yixin, Prince Gong">Yixin, Prince Gong</a>, <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xian_Chun_4b66.html" title="Xiao Xian Chun">Empress Xiao Xian Chun</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Noble_Consort_Hui_Xian_43ea.html" title="Imperial Noble Consort Hui Xian">Imperial Noble Consort Hui Xian</a>. None of the images are identical, and they were all painted or photographed in different years. It can do no harm to leave these images on the articles, and even if these images should be removed, Niohe should have previous noticed me the uploader so that I could move the images to WikiCommons. The example Niohe provided <a href="../../../e/m/p/Talk%7EEmpress_Dowager_Cixi_Archives_1_5333.html#This_article_is_image_heavy" title="Talk:Empress Dowager Cixi/Archives 1">Talk:Empress_Dowager_Cixi/Archives_1#This_article_is_image_heavy</a> is just an extreme case where it was indeed image-heavy, and I have agreed and removed several images myself. There is absolutely no user complaints on all the rest of the articles. Also, I'm not editing images against <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">image use policy</a>, because I have resized all my images so that they do not exceed the maximum width it states (550px). Actually, most of them are within 300px wide and many of them are even smaller.</p>
<p>Look at these valuable historical images of extreme high quality and resolution that Niohe has been trying hard to destroy: (They have all belonged to different articles, and thus not space-occupying or redundant.)</p>

<dd>I have went through a number of the articles that Highshines contributes to and have fixed up the images to use thumbnails (rather than frames) and to remove explicit sizes where they are not required (and it's very rare that explicit sizes are required).

<dd>Actually, looking at the user's seemingly productive contributions so far, it seems that the user might be using his/her user name to demonstrate that he or she is, in fact, the <i>opposite</i> of a vandalizer. Reading the user page, I see that the user has been frustrated when editing in the past from public computers that had been blocked because of other people's vandalism. So, frankly, I see this choice of a user name as a way to demonstrate that he or she is actually interested in contributing constructively. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 03:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Today I extended a 24 hour block against this editor into a 1 week block. The situation is sensitive for several reasons and I would like to get some feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blocked editor is the successful defendant in a case that went before the California state supreme court.</li>
<li>The blocked editor alleges that <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a>, another editor in her Wikipedia dispute, is an employee of the other side from her court case.</li>
<li>Fyslee denies that this is true. He says he used to volunteer for that person's website and stopped volunteering a while ago.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">User:Wizardry Dragon</a>, Ilena's informal mentor, has been a heartfelt advocate for her. Unfortunately that advocacy, in my opinion, has become so counterproductive that I left a request at his user talk to change his approach or recuse himself.</li>
<li>Ilena's post that prompted the block extension included a link to her personal website in which she identified Fyslee by his real world name. I consider that post to justify the block extension on several grounds - this element is particularly troubling.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two bright spots here. First, no one appears to have crossed the line into a blockable legal threat. Second, Fyslee has been cooperative about retracting objectionable statements when requested and generally responding well to feedback. <a href="../../../i/l/e/User_talk%7EIlena_10cb.html" title="User talk:Ilena">User talk:Ilena</a> and its tangled archive are relevant reading for this.</p>
<p>Have I handled this appropriately? I welcome suggestions. This is a tough nut to crack. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 22:58, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess I should give the question its section. I understand the limits of Wikipedia sysop authority and understand this is bannable. Due to the surrounding fireworks I didn't want to be the sole admin to make that call so I gave a comfortable margin for decision making. My opinion is that a Usenet veteran who carries all the baggage that implies and hasn't adjusted to this site in over half a year has already been handled with kid gloves far too long. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 01:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rather unfortunate. Clearly a talented person and could be a valuable contributor. But, it's just not that hard to get along. If not an indef block, how about a quickly escalating one? Looking through her talk page it doesn't seem she makes much effort to get along, nor understands the give and take of a collaborative site. Assuming that continues and she demonstrates no desire to change that by discussion on her talk page, then perhaps go with the indef block before the week is up. Linking to an editor's real name is unacceptable, so the one week block to sort it out is a good call. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:25, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not see that she has been here a year and a half - I looked at her contrib. and it looks like she has been here since July 06. So about 6 months. Maybe suggest she try editing some different articles. And Durova's invitation seems like a good way forward.Jance 05:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"over half a year" was the wording above. She has also edited under many different IPs (especially from Costa Rica), so it's hard to really know for sure how long she's been here, but she is definitely not a newbie, unknowing about how to make a diff, how to provide evidence, or how to make severe enough accusations about others that it got her sued for libel. The only reason she won is because of a totally new application of a new law that protects republishers of even the most defamatory material. No matter how unethical and immoral it is to do so, she and any other republisher is now totally protected. (The original publisher in this case is now awaiting an upcoming trial. Original publishers are not protected.) -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 05:53, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>BTW, I don't support an immediate indefinite block, even though I am currently the primary target of her accusations here. The suggestion of a "quickly escalating one" sounds good, with an increase in increments from the current one to a month, then to six months. After that an indefinite block or permanent block, considering the severity of the offenses, and in the light of the fact that likely no other user has ever gotten away with so much for so long after so many warnings. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 07:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't support an indefinite block at this stage, much less a ban. I encroached on this territory when trying to mediate <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">Breast implants</a> and I don't think either side has behaved very well. Ilena's bad behaviour has been well documented, however, Fyslee, for his part, has editorialised about Ilena, accused her of "hate speech", posted links to a blog that attacks her and generally provoked and aggravated the situation. He didn't even try to pretend the blog was posted for any constructive purpose but acknowledged he was posting it for other editors' "enlightenment and enjoyment". The edits identifying Fyslee should be oversighted but if Ilena indicates that she understands posting other editor's possible real life identities is completely unacceptable and may result in an indefinite block, and if she promises not to do it again and agrees to follow policy, I think she should be allowed to return when the current block expires. I hope all parties become willing to participate in Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Barrett v. Rosenthal that Peter has started up and that they understand that we are not looking for a slanted or sanitised article but an accurate and unbiased one. <b>Sarah</b> 11:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sarah, this is a much broader issue than a content dispute on Barrett v. Rosenthal. It includes many other barrett related pages. In its current name this mediation request makes little sense. Especially since the disputes on the Barrett v. Rosenthal article are cleared up. Why not an RfC or does everyone seem to think these are too negative? It seems like a much better forum for such a discussion. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 19:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hey David. I do agree that the problem is far more widespread than just <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett_v._Rosenthal</a>. In fact, it was actually on the talk page of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud_ce1a.html" title="The National Council Against Health Fraud">The National Council Against Health Fraud</a> that I first encountered them, having stumbled across from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">Breast implants</a>. I had a poke around and also discovered them bickering at <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStephen_Barrett_8e9f.html" title="Talk:Stephen Barrett">Talk:Stephen Barrett</a>. I would favour giving mediation a go first and failing that, I would support an RFC. I just haven't seen many RfCs actually achieve anything. They seem to generate a lot of words, but in the end they just sort of die off without any conclusion and everyone goes back to where they were when it started. Maybe I just haven't been involved in the right ones, I don't know. I understand what you're saying about the mediation request as it stands, but it can be renamed and refactored to include a far broader and more appropriate scope. <b>Sarah</b> 22:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This user's behaviour is deplorable on occasion, but as Sarah mentions, by the same token so has Fyslee on occasion also. Provocation is a bad thing on Wikipedia, especially when dealing with a touchy sitatuion like this.</dd>
<dd>I think that both users, but esp. Ilena, should be told in black-and-white that if they do this sort of higher-end naughtiness, for want of a better word, again - ie. linking to attack blogs<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Links_to_attack_site" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Links_to_attack_site" rel="nofollow"><i>"Deliberately linking to an attack site may be grounds for blocking"</i></a>, Arbitration Committee in /MONGO, October 2006</sup>, speculation about real life identities<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment" rel="nofollow"><i>"Posting another person's personal information ... regardless of whether or not the information is actually correct is harassment"</i></a>, <i>Harassment</i> guideline, January 2007</sup> <i>et al</i> - they will be blocked for an appropriate period of time, even up to indefinite.

<dd>For what it's worth, her response at her user talk is entirely in line with her pre-blocking norm: it boils down to accusing Wikipedia of persecuting her.

She hasn't supplied any additional evidence for her previous allegations or rescinded anything. It's as if she expects this site to accept <i>proof by assertion</i> or else Wikipedia must be biased against her. Per the discussion here I won't extend to indef at this point, but I hope some of the experienced editors at this thread drop a few words at her user page.

<li>Her behaviour has gotten both better and worse. When I first encountered Ilena, she was little more than a POV-pushing, linkspamming, edit-warring user. Since she's at least taken my suggestion to take disputes to talk pages, although her conduct there has been less than desirable. She has been responsive to my prompts, for some reason, and it's more or less why I have tried to mentor her, since she's been unresponsive and sometimes hostile to other's attempts at mentorship. Now since Durova appears to be threatening me with a block, I'm left in a bit of a conflict - do I keep on trying to improve a user's conduct to the betterment of the encyclopedia, and risk a block, or to "give in" and allow the encyclopedia be damaged by the actions of a heavy-handed administrator. *sigh* Cheers, ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon"><font color="#696">Peter M Dodge</font></a> ( <a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon"><font color="#696">Talk to Me</font></a> • <a href="../../../w/n/p/WP%7EWNP_d2ca.html" title="WP:WNP"><font color="#696">Neutrality Project</font></a> )</span> 04:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

In light of that I've withdrawn the suggestion - which seemed at the time to be the only practical <i>alternative</i> to a block warning. I've been perfectly candid about this with Peter. He has challenged my administrative judgement repeatedly and I have invited him to raise his questions here (or in RFC - he knows I'm open to recall).

<dd>Is challenging "administrative judgement" a violation of a policy?

<dd>That question seems to be rhetorical. This will probably get discussed in greater depth at arbitration, but of course editors are welcome to challenge my actions. Several times at Ilena's and Peter's user talk pages I informed them of several meaningful ways they could do so. I even initiated this thread in order to request community review of my decisions. That particular diff may look a bit awkward out of context, and if so I apologize. One of my trademarks when some thread gets particularly contentious is to <i>blow the referee whistle</i>, which often succeeds in getting people to cool down. I don't know of any other editor besides myself who does that habitually so Peter's post did raise my eyebrow. It looked like an attempt to intimidate Fyslee on a very minor point, although as you can see I also asked Fyslee to comply in good faith. Peter took other and stronger actions at that page that did lead me to question his judgement and ask him to recuse himself. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 02:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Barrett v. Rosenthal was rejected as Fyslee disagreed to mediation. I have been doing some further reading over the last two-three hours, and although I wasn't in the mood to compile them all, I believe that they both acted as bad as one another (literally, in no way metaphoric). Both have made problematic and/or disruptive edits to similar degrees at similar frequency, and without a formal place to discuss any solution I'm at a loss as to what to do next.</p>
<p>For me, there's only two options: <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> them both, maybe even together (if at all possible), as well as some of the side-users to this who may ormay not have acted inappropriately. The other obvious one is <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">RFAR</a>, and for me this is becoming more and more applicable given the attitude of Fyslee towards optional mediation (which Ilena may or may not share, I don't know - she didn't give a statement of intent at RFM).</p>
<p>I'm at a loss here, but I'll sleep on it and see if I have any other ideas in the morning. With this recent rejection by RFM due to the situation, I honestly can't see this being resolved outside of blocking/banning (whether full or certain actions/pages)/one user leaving the project without the assistance of the upper ends of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">DR</a>. Of course, I'm sure everyone wants to avoid those three possibilities, and look for the common ground solution, for which I personally feel a RFC or RFAR will be needed to do.</p>

<p>Here are my statements in chronological order with the diffs (taken out of context, and without the edit summaries):</p>
<ul>
<li>1. If I am not to be allowed to provide the requested evidence of my attempts to deal with her attacks, then what's going on? Have I misunderstood your RfM? It was made in the specific context of her personal attacks on myself, so why is it described as an RfM regarding <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett v. Rosenthal</a>? That is not currently an issue under discussion. If I'm not to be allowed to discuss the current problem, then maybe you shouldn't have added my name and obligated me to a lot more wasted time. Please explain and maybe I'll withdraw. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 23:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101444539" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101444539" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. Okay, I misunderstood. In the context it seemed like it would deal with the current, rather than (relatively) ancient B v. R discussion, but you're probably right. Unfortunately this RfM will divert attention from the basic issue underlying all of her presence here, which is to carry her Usenet personal attacks to wikipedia. They got her sued before, and because she was reposting what someone else wrote, she got away with it. Now she thinks she can continue here. Oh well, I'll just withdraw. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 23:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101446810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101446810" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3. <b>Do not agree</b>. This is an unnecessary revival (IOW recreating) of a not currently active issue, thus creating more controversy and wasting more time. It has been a problem, and if it becomes active again, then this might be valid. At present this functions as a diversion from the real and very serious current issue, which is an undeclared RfC on Ilena's conduct towards other editors. She is currently blocked for that behavior. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 10:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101975218" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101975218" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4. Peter (Wizardry), I believe you have some serious misunderstandings and assumptions about this issue. <i>To the best of my knowledge</i>, Barrett and Rosenthal have never had any serious discussions over the issue of breast implants. Barrett doesn't even comment on them or write about them, or even criticize Rosenthal's position on the issue. (Barrett may have at some long distant point in the past expressed views common among MDs, but he's never made it an issue in his activities. He concentrates on other subjects.) I personally support much of her position on the subject, but find her activities to be very damaging to her cause.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The attacks made by Bolen and Rosenthal against Barrett (that have led to libel lawsuits) have <b>nothing to do with the breast implant issues</b>, but are regarding Barrett's anti-quackery activism. Bolen admits that he is paid by alternative medicine practitioners (who have run afoul of the law) to defend them. He does this primarily by spamming (yes the anti-spam community is very much against him) a newsletter which he himself describes as "opinion pieces". They are filled with conspiracy theory rhetoric, ad hominem attacks, straw man attacks, and other forms of serious personal attacks, including libelous statements for which he is now awaiting trial. (Under deposition he had to admit that very concrete statements presented as absolute fact were nothing more than "euphemism".)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The whole issue is about alternative medicine practitioners, producers, and scammers, who don't like their methods getting exposed to criticism on Quackwatch. Rosenthal is among those who doesn't like those methods being criticized, and without herself being criticized first, has gone on the warpath against Barrett. Anyone who happens to share Barrett's (which are essentially mainstream POV) viewpoints then gets attacked as "Barrett syncophants" or other epithets that are designed to make it appear that we are all working directly with or for Barrett, and are paid by the pharmaceutical industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 10:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101975393" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101975393" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101976991" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101976991" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></dd>

<dd>If there is to be any RfM regarding Ilena and the breast implant issue, then <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett v.

<dl>
<dd>This current RfM is totally off-base. It was announced and presented on the page and in the middle of a discussion of Ilena's personal behavior here at Wikipedia, which had nothing to do with breast implants, so when I followed the link and ended here, I was baffled. There was no "connect" between the current controversy, the situation in which it was announced, the place it was announced, or the reality of the situation. It was like a long dead ghost was suddenly being introduced into another discussion. The proper thing would have been to create an RfC:</dd>

<p>This RfM was simply the wrong venue and misapplied, so the error was not mine, but the error of the one who started the RfM in the first place. It should have never been raised, but something does need to be done, likely an RfC. That would indeed be appropriate. The issue is her attitude and behavior anywhere at Wikipedia, not the content of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett v. Rosenthal</a> article. Content matters can always be worked out through collaborative editing. Editors who refuse to collaborate need to have their attitude and behavior subjected to an RfC. That's the issue here. Wikipedia should not be used to further her Usenet wars, especially since I have never participated in them.</p>

<dd>Is this unnecessary and unprovoked escalation really necessary? I suggest that it be withdrawn and that the proposer (the same one who improperly proposed the RfM) disengage as he is not an impartial party to this matter, but has all too often favorized and defended Ilena in her actions, contrary to the first stated personal "philosophy" on his own user page: "I avoid taking sides in disputes." He has even prevented me from providing evidence in the form of diffs, and deleted them. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 01:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Every user has a right to request Arbitration on any issue. Mostly, it is people engaged in the dispute who file them.

<p>In reply to <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a>, I was under the impression that the normal "chain of steps" would include an RfC, before the ill-fated RfM. I have attempted to deal with this situation by providing Ilena with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee#My_offer_to_Ilena_-_2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee#My_offer_to_Ilena_-_2" rel="nofollow">opportunity</a> to document her serious allegations against me. She has not only refused my requests to provide documentation, she has also refused everyone else's requests to do so (and many have done so), and considers repetitions of the same allegations as the same as documentation. They are not. They are continued attacks. I dispute her allegations. That does not mean I deny that they may be based on some fact in reality. I consider them to be her gross misrepresentations designed to damage my reputation. She does this on her websites and here at Wikipedia, and such behavior is not allowed here. The editor who voluntarily (and commendably!) chose to mentor her unfortunately ended up favorizing her and thus "aided and abetted" her in her course of action, and even immediately deleted (before examining her allegation) my provision of documentation for one of her clear untruths. I then reworded it and added it back, where it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ilena#Documentation_of_inaccuracies_by_Ilena" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ilena#Documentation_of_inaccuracies_by_Ilena" rel="nofollow">remains</a>. It was a classic example of her typical method of misrepresenting matters. After he did that, I lost faith in his neutrality and in any hope of my being able to defend myself properly. This left her allegations standing without any real defense from my side. They are still there, and she knows perfectly well that having them at Wikipedia will cause search engines to help her in her agenda against me. Undocumented charges should not be allowed to be made or left standing. Please read them, and <b>do not believe them</b> before examining my side of the story, which I will gladly provide once she has provided evidence. Right now the allegations are so jumbled a mess that it is nearly impossible to be sure where to start. If she will follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee#My_offer_to_Ilena_-_2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee#My_offer_to_Ilena_-_2" rel="nofollow">steps outlined on my talk page</a>, then I will have a starting point. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 10:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Favoritizing"? I'm sorry, but after reading all this I'm going to stick you in the exact same catagory as Ilena. And when you start tossing out words like favoritizing, I tend to see someone not assuming good faith. Should I blindly accuse Durova of "favoritizing" you? What a crock. RfAr can be brought by anyone who feels it's neccessary. If the ArbCom thinks differently, they won't accept it. If they accept it, and if you "really" did all you good to fix this dispute, then you have nothing to worry about. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 10:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>We requested page protection to end the reverts during our dispute resolution and mediation. Why are we reverting the protected version? This seems inappropiate. I believe the version initially found just before page protection should stay untill we can discuss this on the talk page.

<dd>Um, guys, how is putting his birthday as July 17 "potentially libelous"? Worse, after another admin reverted Cbrown, he reverted back <i>again</i>. Navou is right, the change on this page is totally inappropriate, an Cbrown should undo himself. <i>Airing on the side of caution</i> does not mean removing a <i>birthdate</i> as libelous, and seems to go against the spirit of <a href="../../../w/v/_/WP%7EWV_9809.html" title="WP:WV">WP:WV</a>, using one's admin priveledges to circumvent this problem.

<dd>I quote <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date.</p>
</blockquote>
I have absolutely no involvement in this, and yes, maybe Cbrown1023 was wrong to essentially wheel war, but this is what Wikipedia official policy says, and in this case, with how BLP can have potential real-world issues, it's better to err on the side of caution. However, I'm not Cbrown, so I won't speculate about his full reasoning; I just thought that paragraph would be interesting and relevant.

Some of them are alos incorrectly archived talk pages, or redirects to those talk pages (which can mostly be deleted as R3's. There's no conceivable good reason for a talk page archive redirect).

<p>I came across <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">User:Wizardry Dragon</a> in the thread above, and thought something was a little odd.... He's self-listed as the 'head' of the <a href="../../../w/n/p/WP%7EWNP_d2ca.html" title="WP:WNP">WP:WNP</a> - which seems to have some odd instructions on it (ie. don't edit this bit, wait until the co-ordinator or chairperson has done something or other...) - he also self-identifies as holding the responsibility of a Clerk office for CheckUser, and I found it a little odd that he also seems to have the same text about page vandalism as Jimbo.</p>
<p>Nothing massively untoward, but it seems to me that he's projecting false authority in about the nicest way i've ever seen it done...... perhaps this isn't at all un-wiki-ish and its all in my head, what do you think? <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurples_ea12.html" title="User:Purples">Purples</a> 07:02, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wish people would actually read the text of things before they complained about it. Really, it would make for a lot less hurt feelings and cooler heads. The text is taken from Jimbo's page (it's actualy templated somewheres, but I took the template code and changed it to fit my userpage). Jimbo's perfectly okay with this. Perhaps some attribution is in order though - I have no problem with that whatsoever.</p>
<p>Secondly, as the "head" (the title that was given was "chairperson", and it's actually mostly in jest per some early discussion on the matter when the project was still in the proposal stage) I have asserted numerous times on the talk page of the WNP that the WNP has no special weight in the matter, nor do I, myself. I'm just another guy. Really, really. My own role is mostly trying to keep the whole thing together and coordinated, I leave the "in the trenches" editing to subject experts and only reply to WNP requests for areas in my own area of expertise.</p>
<p>Just to be completely clear: <b>The Wikipedia Neutrality Project has no special weight or authority.</b> Consensus rules wikipedia, not a small group with similar interests - maintaining NPOV. Anyone who asserts the WNP has special authority is wrong.</p>

<dd>As a RFCU clerk, I have absolutely no say in RFCU matters. That is the purview of the presiding checkuser. My only function is to organise requests, format them as appropriate, fulfill occasional requests for additional informations given by the checkusers, and archive cases when they are completed. It is a conflict of interest to voice opinions on listed or potential cases, and I have no authority to encourage certain descisions, challenge them, or overturn them. In short my authority on RFCU is nil. I just have knoweldge of that process that users may find useful, and therefore welcome approaches from users for help listing their cases.</dd>

<li>What about (probably) the most successful one? I believe they are having elections right now. I think a properly handled hierarchy <i>can</i> work, but it has to be a very flat, decentralised one. I guess most times things can be handled by people volunteering for stuff and working together. Sometimes, though, leadership can keep things moving forwards, but I agree that formalising such things is often bad. There are also problems when too many people volunteer for a particular position. Usually the conclusion is that elections are needed to decide who gets the position, but actually, the conclusion should usually be that the position is popular because too much power has been centred in one position. Instead of holding elections, the position should be split up among the volunteers following discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:36, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. There's far too much throwing of templates on user talk pages going on at Wikipedia. And people are also too hasty to use the word "vandalism". Going against consensus is not vandalism. It's edit warring, and it's a Bad Thing, but it's not vandalism. Removing or adding POV tags is not vandalism, though there are times when it could be justifiable to roll them back or to revert without counting towards 3RR. (For example, if a user or an IP went to <i><b>every</b></i> article about every religion, and added {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} on the grounds that all religions are POV and that articles about them can't be neutral, I wouldn't hesitate to use rollback.) But generally, content-dispute pettty squabbles should not involve hurling the word "vandalism" around. By the way, you say "none of these things are <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>." I'd say they're "not <i>necessarily</i> vandalism". Under certain circumstances, they might be. For example, the "not censored" one. If you edit war at <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">Feces</a> to remove an image, against consensus, because you feel it shouldn't be there, then regardless of what others say, it's not vandalism, though you can still be justifiably blocked for edit warring. But if some anon or newly-registered user blanks the whole article on <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">Toilet</a>, with an edit summary saying that it's indecent to mention such things, I think that troll can certainly be treated as a vandal. But a standard vandalism warning template would be appropriate. There's no reason for the {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-vandalism4_d2a2.html" title="Template:Uw-vandalism4">uw-vandalism4</a>}} one. If it's a new user, put a {{<a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3RR_aefa.html" title="Template:3RR">3RR</a>}} on his talk page. If he's not reverting fast enough to warrant a 3RR block, then the established Wikipedians should have time to write a short <i>personal</i> message, referring him (with a link) to the appropriate section of the page on the policy that he's inadvertently breaking. I get increasingly concerned at the proliferation of templates used as black marks to be publicly displayed on the page of someone who has been naughty, rather than to make someone aware of a policy in order to help him. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 11:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

Both purport to be pages that help new users towards overall constructive behavior, and eventually adminship. <b>However</b>, both have gotten out of hand. They now steer people towards socially acceptable behavior as judged by the alleged RFA crowd. Thus, they reenforce editcountitis, as well as all sorts of arbitrary criteria like "an admin candidate must put X amount of work in AFD/RC patrol/AIV/whatever".

<dd>Personally (having spent a good time doing editor reviews), I agree with Proto that ER used to be useful. While in the beginning most asked for counsel about how they handled a particular situation, what they could do to complement their current self, and why determined areas were useful. Nowadays, most ask advice about how to become admins. I am not sure, but "I think" it is because now the RFA page advertises it. While many would have posted their [unlikely successful] RFA, now they read the line that says <i>If you are unsure about nominating yourself for adminship, you may wish to try an editor review first.</i> and ask the same in the editor review. Maybe, and it is a big maybe, if we change that line to <i>If you are unsure about nominating yourself for adminship, you may wish to try to get advice at Admin coaching</i> then ER would go back to what it used to be. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 12:38, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Admin school has serious issues, and I'm not sure they can be "fixed" - which would render ReyBrujo's well reasoned suggestion ineffective. An Mfd may be the solution; whether an Esperanza solution is adopted or not, the attention and input would be beneficial. I concur with Proto that Editor review has the potential to be a useful tool, but I'd like to hear ideas on how to redefine it effectively. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 12:40, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We can't say "Don't ask about becoming an administrator", can we? We can't put a minimum threshold (5,000 edits or over), can we? We can't remove editor reviews that ask whether the subject would pass a RFA at this time, can we? Well, what we can is to turn the "unfriendly" switch to the maximum, don't praise users but criticize them, so hard that they will think twice before asking for another editor review or RFA. "I want to be an administrator, what do you think?" "With only 7 Wikipedia namespace edits?

<p>As a relative newcomer, I've just signed up for editor review because I'd like to be a better editor. I've made a specific request for advice in my submission. If people use it to fit RfA better, why not? Then again, if they use it to improve themselves, why not? What's the big deal. No need to delete it. The biggest problem I see with it is lack of participation from the experienced users, actually reviewing us. It takes a certain amount of guts to put oneself in the stocks... it's a bit disconcerting when few people can be bothered to throw tomatoes. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 13:21, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The point is that the <i>intent</i> of the page is good (indeed, encouraging people to be better editors is obviously a good thing) but what the page <i>actually does</i> is not good (in that it actually encourages people to mold themselves to arbitrary standards that are allegedly but not really required to pass RFA). In that, it is gaming the system: it's going by the letter of the (perceived) rules rather than the spirit. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My own opinion of admin school is that it's basically telling people what to say at RFA. Nothing wrong with that if the person in question really <i>should</i> be an admin, but I think it's too easy to abuse to push unsuitable people through RFA and to trick, so to speak, the RFA voters. I would certainly vote delete at MFD. Editor review I think is O.K, if only as a way of preventing RFAs that are never going to pass in a million years. And it is useful, on occasion. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 13:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I have seen a fair few editor reviews that go like "I'm about to run at RFA tomorrow!!! Any last-minute tips????" - followed by "You're a complete newbie. You haven't got a hope in hell at RFA, and you need to seriously rethink your attitude towards adminship". That sort of thing is useful, I think, to avoid clueless newbie RFAs.

<p>One possibility is that the concept of improving as an editor (and possibly being more suited to being an admin) is becoming too focused on editor review and the concept of an admin school. There are many different ways of improving as a Wikipedia editor. Recently I tried to list some of the more interactive methods at <a href="../../../c/o/a/Wikipedia%7ECoaching_83df.html" title="Wikipedia:Coaching">Wikipedia:Coaching</a>. Maybe that would be a good link to have in the <i>"If you are unsure about nominating yourself for adminship, you may wish to try ... first."</i> bit? i.e <i>"If you are unsure about nominating yourself for adminship, you may wish to try one of the options at <a href="../../../c/o/a/Wikipedia%7ECoaching_83df.html" title="Wikipedia:Coaching">Wikipedia:Coaching</a> first."</i> Though I've always been more in favour of the concept of learning by yourself, and improving by experience. Indeed, I was recently complimented on this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Enculturation really just needs people to talk more and demonstrate how they do things (rather than just doing them). Takes certain types of people to be role models. Actually following someone's edits, or meeting in person and watching how they do things, can be very instructive."</i> (Carcharoth)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My point is that there are many ways to learn. If we work to diversify the options, that might help any one area degrading and becoming unacceptable.</p>
<p>Right, now I'm off to post this in the other two threads on this matter. Please focus this thread on specific things, um to do with the Administrators noticeboard? Why the hell is this thread on this noticeboard anyway? &lt;sigh&gt; Gathering admin views on what to do with admin coaching and editor review? Fair enough, but this thread really needs to be focused and directed towards the places where the discussion should <i>really</i> be happening (and that is also an apology for lengthening the thread). Probably best to close this thread and direct discussion to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EEditor_review_90f0.html#Something_has_gone_horribly_wrong..." title="Wikipedia talk:Editor review">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html#Editor_review_.28and_admin_school.29.2C_and_RFA" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">here</a>.

<p>Yes, I worry about the quality of some <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> nominations that succeed. Part of what it takes to be an administrator just can't be taught: it's about temperament and judgement. I waited until I had 9000 edits, three featured pages, and shared authorship of a guideline before I thought I was ready. Yet there just <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_non-admins_with_high_edit_counts_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:List of non-admins with high edit counts">aren't enough people</a> to keep this site running if we set the bar that high. <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">WP:ER</a> and admin school have their flaws.

<p>Though the discussions will likely move elsewhere, I'd like to add a couple of things about <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdmin_coaching_a473.html" title="Wikipedia:Admin coaching">Wikipedia:Admin coaching</a> (I am not much familiar with Editor Review). Admin Coaching clearly states, and has always stated, that it is not for the purpose of teaching someone how to do well in an RfA, or to teach someone what is needed to pass an RfA. It is about learning the skills that administrators use, so that when/if an editor does become an administrator, they are well prepared to use their new tools. How many of us felt nervous to delete our first page of nonsense, block our first vandalizing user, or protect our first page undergoing an edit war? Admin coaching helps editors understand the tools of administrators, and to learn their usage. Those editors undergoing admin coaching are able to practice deciding if something is appropriate to be deleted under the CSD, to learn when to and when not to protect a page, and to become confident and deciding what is vandalism and what is not. These skills mean that if an editor goes through an RfA and is successful, they will be well-versed in the tools they have acquired, and will be able to benefit the encyclopedia by using them in the best fashion possible. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly<font color="green">a</font></a> 17:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I for one would like real action and not cheap talk. The way to get ready for admin, and an effective admin, is to do RC or CVU and you will know how to deal with the vandals and dubious material. And to get involved in image tagging. Talking about it doesn't prove anything, my RfA participation works upon "<a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs on the board</a>", not because somebody did a theory "Q&amp;A answer" - I think that for anybody who even played sport or music at an amateur or school level, their coach or teacher would have said that what you gain in 15 minutes of actual playing time on the field or stage, can't be substituted for lots of practice. Personally, as soon as Essjay tweaked my access, I slaughtered about 50 pieces of rubbish in the first two or three hours <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=7400&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Blnguyen&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=7400&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Blnguyen&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. A lot of people don't have any proven skill in the mopwork and pass simply by giving the "politically correct" answers and then don't use them much anyway. In any case, if they get too smooth sounding without actually having done anything, I am likely to ignore their RfA and perhaps even oppose it. I would have to say that no practical skill improvement is gained from AC from observing the coaches, only PC, PR and toilet training. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 00:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oooh er, Natalya, I'm not sure. The damn thing even has a disclaimer: "Admin Coaching does not guarantee that you will pass the RfA. Ultimately, this is your responsibility, not the responsibility of your coach. So if you come here looking for a personal coach in order to pass RFA, you're at the wrong place." Either this needs serious rewording or it does make it sound as though the whole point is to get you through RFA, as does language like "Admin Coaching is a program for people who would like the special attention that only one-on-one coaching can provide" - and the purpose of the coaching is to get you through RFA, eh? I remember looking at <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_Admin_coaching_e601.html" title="User:Riana dzasta/Admin coaching">User:Riana dzasta/Admin coaching</a> - I mean, at one point, semi-ironically, Glen says "Depends if you want the "RfA" answer, or my real thoughts".

<p>Part of the problem with fishing through the high edit count list is that a lot of the people who are on it don't wan't adminship or have failed nominations - or haven't tried because they know nomination wouldn't succeed. It's the people who registered last July and who raised a couple of pages to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">GA</a> and are becoming active in one of the WikiProjects that we should look at, but mostly they aren't on our radar yet. So a couple of people have set up places where they can go. I applaud that. <i>We</i> need to be there too and honestly tell some of them they're good editors but maybe not cut out for this and foster the ones who seem to have the right stuff. If these efforts are undermanned - and a lot of things are undermanned because sysops are scarce - then of course they don't work so well. Now I'll put my money where my mouth is (or where my typing fingers are) and go follow my own advice.

<dd>RFA is so broken that experienced editors are scared to go near it until they're 100% sure they'll pass. This, in effect, delays potential admins for several months.

<dd>That is true though, RfA is a very scary procedure to go through, because, if you fail, you are probably going to have to wait about 3 months before trying again. RfA is 'broken' only because there are too many people. RfA is more effective when the 'voters' actually know what the person they are 'voting' on's character is from personal experience, rather then using edit count and other arbitrary factors to try and guess. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 01:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I sometimes wonder if it would offer some real insight if it were possible to run a small experiment. Simply pick a pre-rfa candidate about to "run the gauntlet", (secretly, so as not to affect the outcome) collect opinions from existing admins on whether or not the candidate should pass if RfA were running perfectly and as it should <i>ideally</i> be (or perhaps based on <a href="../../../s/y/s/WP%7ESYSOP_9bfc.html" title="WP:SYSOP">WP:SYSOP</a> alone rather than any arbitary criteria), and then compare that with the actual result. Maybe even repeat it a few times. The results may then be evidence either of a problem, or of the lack of a problem. I'm not saying that it could or should be done. I have no opinion there. It's just an idea I've thought on a few times. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 01:14, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think admin coaching, etc. shouldn't be about the RFA but about all that comes afterward, as in what the tools are for and what sort of stresses go with them and whether the kind of participation someone wants to do would really be helped by that - and getting to know the site well enough that they'll use the tools correctly. If they've learned Wikipedia well enough that they're ready for adminship and they've got the right temperament for this, then RFA shouldn't be a problem.

<li>See, I have a problem with the whole concept of admin coaching. Mentoring, yes, but being an admin is not something one should aspire to and work towards, it's something that should be suggested by others based on how they see you working within the project. Self-noms based on technical needs (template Wikignomes and so on) are fine, but "make me a sysop, I'll block vandals and delete everything emanating from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">the firehose of crap</a>" is a seriously bad rationale. Anyone who actively sets out to be an admin may not be here to build a great encyclopaedia.

<dd>I'd rather turn admin coaching into something positive then. Somewhere along the line each of us sysops learned what adminship is about and decided that was where we want to be, but the site isn't particularly user-friendly for editors who are interested in exploring that option. Rather than proceeding from a presumption that an editor ought to get sysopped and showing them how to jump through certain hoops, let's make it a place where they can genuinely learn what we do and see whether this is the right fit for their styles. Plenty of good editors are better off writing articles. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 21:29, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I just thought I would pop by an place a slightly different perspective on this. I am someone who works with SEO, but have never spammed Wikipedia, in fact the main reason I created this account in the past was to remove spam from entries I saw.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are legitimate ways to SEO websites without spamming. The rules of the contest very clearly stipulate that any "blackhat" methods are forbidden. Any site entering the contest even has to list full contact details on the site. The websites that might win the contest most likely will be high quality sites that have gained links legitimately by creative techniques that encourage other people to link to you, such as maybe competitions of their own, or providing excellent content worth linking to. The change made will have a dramatic effect on search results unless Google decide to ignore NoFollow for this domain and there are other ways to control this. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrzejBroda_0906.html" title="User:AndrzejBroda">AndrzejBroda</a></p>

<li>Note that per Jimbo's request to Brion, rel=nofollow is now set for links in all Wikipedia mainspace articles.

Once word gets out this should reduce the sneaky linkspam, like we recently saw on stub templates, HOWEVER, linkspamming Wikipedia will still be attractive for two reasons: 1) direct sales - like at the bottom of the <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicle_insurance.html" title="Vehicle insurance">vehicle insurance</a> article the section called <b>Cheap insurance quotes</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_insurance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101501622" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_insurance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101501622" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, and 2) the nofollow tag is not used by all search engines, and most Wikipedia mirrors (of which there are many) will strip the tag anyway. It's probably a step forward but not a silver bullet. -- <a href="../../../z/z/u/User%7EZzuuzz_ab5e.html" title="User:Zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/z/u/User_talk%7EZzuuzz_d9bf.html" title="User talk:Zzuuzz">(talk)</a></sup> 16:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Google has asked us in the past to nofollow user submitted links. None of the search engines take it as gospel (which is yet another reason why nofollow isn't a replacement for the SBL), they simply use it as another factor in their analysis. In the future we'll be able to do better: Someday we plan on having some systems for content approval (not-vandalized flag, stable versions, etc.. there are many proposals)... such systems will ultimately allow us to have the community collectively approve links which are good. Until then we should be good netizens and tag our user submitted links as such. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 22:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen Matt Cutts (he is notable again now) suggest there should be a way to have some untrusted links nofollow, but not all. One thing I think is overlooked is that followable links are one of the factors in determining duplicate content and the original source for information. By adding nofollow, it might be looked on that you are not citing your sources correctly in an ethical manner. Last time I checked, Yahoo still followed and indexed nofollow pages, MSN and Google do not <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrzejBroda_0906.html" title="User:AndrzejBroda">AndrzejBroda</a> 15:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Metric buttload! That's a good one. Calton, don't you see? It's so easy to keep contributing to Wikipedia when there are so many hypocrites offering themselves up for correction. You, like so many others, haven't even READ what Jimmy Wales did to MyWikiBiz, have you? Would it be so difficult to learn the whole story? You know, the one where MWB created a company based on the tenets of the Reward Board, then acted in the bright light of full disclosure, formed a mutual agreement with Jimmy Wales, then the community literally changed the rules by creating a "conflict of interest" policy out of thin air, which Jimmy then got behind and dismissed MyWikiBiz, then defaced MWB's user page, thus running off their business, all while promoting a donation-supported environment that serves as a link-farm for his for-profit Wikia.com?

<p><b>A different question:</b> Bottom line is this. Wikipedians are given userspace to assist the project and to help them work with other users. Yes, we don't have too many rules - and Wikipedians have latitude, but if something isn't going to help the project or user relations then any good wikipedian should stay clear of it. This is obviously going to be inflammatory and at very least discussing it will be a distraction from important things. Thus, Jasper23, if you are here to serve this project, you will want to remove it, and anything similar, regardless of what the letter of policy might say. A good wikipedian will not want to take the chance of distracting us from real encyclopedic work. So the question is not 'is this allowed?', it is 'are you a good wikipedian'? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 01:01, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, just to clarify in case anyone missed this earlier, these are not Jasper's userboxes, they are copied from another user page and he is asking for discussion. I found the original source's userpage with about 2 minutes of digging through and cross-referencing the images used in the boxes. The userpage in question also has a rather soapbox-y rant against Bill Maher and claims him to be in cahoots with Osama Bin Laden. It's rather intriguing, actually.

<dd>From someone who endorsed the community ban at ANI. For starters, it should be <b>all</b> articles even faintly associated with ID. Secondly, mentoring has had mixed results, as on occasion I have seen for myself. Thirdly, the problem is not merely one of bias. This fellow used an extremely unpleasant editing style: blocks for 3RR,WP:POINT violations, and on occasion some extremely unpleasant personal attacks. This sort of thing is likely to follow an editor around whatever they edit.

<p>i am watching an interesting case unfold with respect to the definition of a reliable source.</p>
<ol>
<li>An editor wishes to add some content they consider notable. But there are no reliable sources.</li>
<li>After the fact, a blog is opened by a credible journalist with content that could be used as a source.</li>
<li>Editor claims to know the journalist.</li>
<li>Editor claims it is a reliable source since wikipedia accepts quotes written in blogs by credible journalists.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would discount this blog as a reliable source since it seems just too convenient that the blog appeared with the required information during the dispute on wikipedia. How should one deal with such a case? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 17:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this the journalist's personal blog or a publishing sponsored blog... i.e. Journalist X has a regular blog that he writes for and is hosted on Time.com? If this is a personal blog I don't think it matters if the journalist is credible or not... There is nothing in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that suggests this is in any way an acceptable source. In fact it says "<b>When a well-known, professional researcher writing within his or her field of expertise</b>, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material, these <i>may</i> be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications." If this has never been previously published I would say this is not a reliable source. Whether or not the editor knows the journalist is besides the point. If this is an "official" blog, I'd say it <i>might</i> pass muster, but again I don't think writing an article on one journalist's blog posting is the right way to go. I'd request additional sources. Of course it is hard to say in this specific situation without actually seeing the article, source, and journalist in question with diffs.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Note: RS does not state that the journalist in question must have published the specific piece of wriitng elsewhere: else we would never accept self-published material from professional journalists, but always use the cite from the the "credible third party publication" instead. Admitting self-published material by professional journalists makes a distinction between the 60 million bloggers who are not professional journalists, and the slim minority who are. When they self-publish, they put their professional credibility on the line, in a way that the mass of bloggers do not. This credibility is determined by whether or not they have been published in credible third party publications. In this case, the journalist has self-published something in the area of their experise: language. While the specific material noted has not been published elsewhere, other similar specific material has been published in credible third party publications, and no reason has been offered to doubt the claims asserted by the author.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I could give you the specifics but i didn't want to drag people into the argument. The blog is not an official blog, in fact, it is not even the journalists primary blog. I think you make a good point re: the third party publication. it is possible that the blog is a fake too, although that would be stretching AGF at this point. I think requesting additional sources is the best way to go. Thus the arguments about RS and the legitimacy of the blog can be dropped. thanks for your input. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 17:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>"it is possible that the blog is a fake too, although that would be stretching AGF at this point."</i> There's your answer right there. AGF is irrelevant. We cannot absolutely verify that the named journalist is the author: it is not a reliable source. If it's on some site like blogspot, they have no way to verify authorship, and neither do we. Period.

<p>Interesting development that needs further input:</p>
<p>The journalist has two blogs, one is an official blog. The second blog (blogspot), with the disputed <i>facts</i>, was started on Jan 15th 2007. The journalist has linked to the blogspot entry from his official blog, however, the link has been incorporated into a entry he made on Dec 12th 2006. To me (not assuming good faith here) it seems a lot like trying get vanity facts (in this cases specific examples of graffiti) into wikipedia by getting them a seal of approval from authority (the journalist in this case). I see this as exploiting a loophole in the guidelines. Is this any different to than writing ones own personal web site and then using it as a primary source? I am assuming that there needs to be an independant source in this situation. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 22:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if the information were on the person's primary blog, its value would be dubious, as for all blogs.

Second, he honestly thinks Wikipedia is in business to attract companies to create articles. He thinks that we are failing in a findamental aim because we erect barriers to companies creating PR articles on themselves. In other words, he simple <i>does not get it</i>, despite having had the conept of Wikipedia explained ot him multiple times. Third, he keeps lapsing into vanity and spamming of his own websites. Fourth, he keeps trolling. Fifth, he is selling Wikipedia articles. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good job on being bold! However, you might want to have left this for an admin to sort out because there were a number of <i>delete</i> motions. As <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELPRO_aee5.html" title="WP:DELPRO">WP:DELPRO</a> says, "Non-administrators may only close decisions which are unambiguous "keep" [or redirect and merge] decisions. Close calls and controversial or ambiguous decisions should be left to an administrator." It say this was kind of a close call due to previous AfDs. Anybody else have any comments? <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 02:23, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That looks to me like a fair close, but in the future, I'd really recommend holding off on closing something that is that borderline. Not because you can't do it correctly, but because it tends to cause more problems than it solves. If all of AfD is that backlogged, then I'd drop a note on WP:AN and if it's just one article drop a note on an admin you know to be around. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 02:30, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you! In the future, I'll make sure they are a little more obvious (ie. something like 16 merge/redirect, 2 delete, 2 keep). Maybe the lenghty little conclusion explaining how I came to the decision was a good hint that it may be ambiguous. But then again I though it helped explain how it was unambigous.

<p><b>Notice</b>: <b>Help</b>! I was hopping to simply do the changes as per the request. But I suddenly noticed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Cheetah_Girls_%28girl_group%29&amp;diff=102814264&amp;oldid=102807048" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Cheetah_Girls_%28girl_group%29&amp;diff=102814264&amp;oldid=102807048" rel="nofollow">all or most of the information I merged was deleted from the article</a>. Which leaves me wondering if this doesn't go against the spirit of the decision from the AFD, that it be merged vs deleted. I figured I should stay at, ironically, "arms lenght" on this one. But my gut is telling me that it didn't have enough sources and the editor is removing the inform to keep his POV instead of finding sources (which I know exist). Good luck! I'm like I said. I think I should leave this one up to someone else. Its a sad story.--<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 04:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

This must involve the <i>same</i> dispute with a <i>single</i> user, not different disputes or multiple users. The persons complaining must provide evidence of their efforts, and each of them must certify it by signing this page with ~~~~. If this does not happen within 48 hours of the creation of this dispute page (which was: 20:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)), the page will be deleted.

<p>Not a bad idea except you did not preserve the edit history in your split. The proper way to do it, in my view, was a delete/partial restore/move/restore-the-rest action, rather than just a copy/paste move. If you're not sure how to do that, you might try asking Kylu how on IRC, she's an expert at it and often available that way to help people out, and I expect she would be happy to walk you through it step by step in real time, as she's quite good at it. I'd favour reverting this change of yours, and trying again. But this is a high traffic page so it might be tricky to do it cleanly. Still, having no edit history whatever over there is not very useful, in my view.. did you ask around before you did it? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>From a nontechnical angle my hunch is it's one person. A group of people would manifest a variety of writing styles. Yes, this means prolific and dedicated effort from one individual, but some irrational people are prolific and dedicated.

However, noticing how the sockpuppets try to insert the text in as many sections as possible reflects careful planning.

<dd>That "Revert" looks a litter questionable: I've never seen a template with that long a name. As to the warning, if it misusing a phrase in an inflammatory way (EG. Overbroad application of "vandalism"/"vandal"), I could understand a warning.

<dd>I wouldn't consider that misuse of the term "wikifying", and certainly not harmful misuse; I'd include general fiddling with the order and formatting of the article to get it to match standard Wikipedia format as "wikifying", particularly when it's the order of templates or other wiki-syntax. And from an easy-of-editing prospective, I'd prefer {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EList_of_people_K_efc3.html" title="Template:List of people K">List of people K</a>}}, as easier to work with than the cryptically-named {{<a href="../../../l/o/p/Template%7ELopbn_p_3a42.html" title="Template:Lopbn p">Lopbn p</a>}}, which also has no documentation, and appears to take some strange arguments (and a large number of them). <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMairi_7ec6.html" title="User:Mairi">Mairi</a> 23:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recently created a page on the wild beasts, a band from Leeds who are now notable. The band are friends of mine and many a time have I used wikipedia from their house on their computer. One of the statements that I added was that they had just signed a deal with domino records. Infact, this deal has not been officially announced (yes, I understand that this should not have been added as their are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, however the band took it upon themselves to vandalise the page (probably inadvertidly to remove the domino records statement (they simply blanked the page)), and as I have used their computer previously to use wikipedia, it has been registered that the edits came from my account. Infact, when the edits were made (At 5am UK time!) I was fast asleep in bed. This led to me recieving 2 vandilism warnings and vandilism showing up in my contribs and talk page. Is there any admin interaction that can be done to merge the history of wild beasts and my talk page so they do not show? I totally condone vandalism to wikipedia and to be honest, I'm normally the one giving the warnings. I don't want vandalism being attributed to my account.

<li>Aaaaaargh! No! There is <i>endless</i> precedent for not having, creating, keeping, encouraging or permitting Wikiprojects which advocate <i>one side</i> of a debate. All it does is polarise. It doesn't help that one of these had only three edits, one of which was from Greg Kohs. A meta-debate on meta-advertising, whether, and in what form, and so on, is fine, of course. Kohs seems to have interpreted it as implying we should have ads in mainspace though... <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:33, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactly, so it's harmless to those that agree with it. As JzG said, there is longstanding precedent that one sided advocacy is not a good thing. WP:CSB is totally different because it is directly working on improving the project by fixing a current problem. Obviously Wikipedia:WikiProject Yes ads is Pointy, but the point is actually valid.

<dd>There don't have to be better ways to do it for it not to be something that we want to have here (ie not meet our policies and goals). But a non partisan factual discussion of the pro's and con's of accepting advertising would be better than the current AVOID ADS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY type of thing currently there. But do we even need that? Meta is more the place for that type of thing. Personally I think it's amusing people are willing to let mirrors get advertising income on their work, but not the Wikimedia Foundation. At any rate policy is fairly clear that partisan things like this are not what we are here for, and I would say the same thing about a similar page for the opposing view. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>While I have a certain conceptual amount of agreement, I'm wondering how much of a real difference would be made by more or less retitling the above group to WikiProject Ad Analysis or something of the like. Given the prevailing sentiment, it seems like even if based in non-advocacy the discussion would be largely the same. Heck, it may be that allowing this as an avenue for the expression of some pretty strong feelings may even better allow for a separate project or discussion to be more neutrally grounded. Isn't this something where we'd be served to not only look at the strict sense, but also the context and cost/benefit as a whole? <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 15:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been asked, by several editors on my talk page and by email, to commence an <a href="../../../r/f/c/Wp%7Erfc.html" title="Wp:rfc">wp:rfc</a> on <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">user:Ludvikus</a>. However, I think that there may be enough evidence to implement a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Community_ban" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">community ban</a> for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html#Definition_of_disruptive_editing_and_editors" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Disruptive editing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>His editing of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> is tendentious. The talk page amply demonstrates that there is little support for his views. Furthermore his affectation of martyrdom is tedious.</li>
<li>He is campaigning to drive away productive contributors. His actions on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> make that page unlikely to attract new editors. His insults on <a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_J_King_1cef.html" title="User talk:Peter J King">user talk:Peter J King</a> clearly had a strong influence on Peter's removing himself from the Wikipedia. His comments on <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">user:Mel Etitis</a> are another example, including the disruptive posts for which I blocked him; indeed, his obnoxious approach to other editors in general, and the sheer volume of tendentious material he posts, "operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors".</li>

<blockquote>
<p>...One has only to compare the excellent Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy to Wikipedia's Philosophy section. From the point of view of a specialist, let's just say that Wikipedia needs a lot of work.</p>
<p>There are many ways to explain this problem, and I will start with just one. Far too much credence and respect accorded to people who in other Internet contexts would be labelled "trolls." There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups and mailing lists that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you attempt to take trolls to task or demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry "censorship," attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. This drama has played out thousands of times over the years on unmoderated Internet groups, and since about the fall of 2001 on the unmoderated Wikipedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another case in point. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have implemented the ban, then asked the questions. This would have provided the needed support to the <i>competent</i> editors. My bad. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 23:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that it's worth correcting the false impression that some editors seem to have gained that the problem lies merely in Ludvikus being in a minority. The main problem is that he makes a vast number of low-quality edits, which he defends with a volubility and aggression that make it difficult if not impossible for most other editors to get a word in or to edit sensibly. He makes little sense on the Talk page (aside from his sarcasm, bluster, and personal attacks), but he does so at inordinate length. He only has one block for two reasons: first, the blocking rules don't really cover the sort of disruption in which he specialises, though it's worse and more frustrating than much that is clearly blockable; secondly, just about the only admins who have any interest in the area are already editing at the article.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I had various run-ins with Sanger before Wikipedia was created, and didn't think much of him — but I have to agree with his analysis as quoted above. The <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> article, which should be one of Wikipedia's flagship articles, is a laughing stock. As a professional philosopher myself, I find it deeply embarrassing --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I suspect it may have possibly been an ego confrontation that sparked the disruption.</li>
<li>If he aplogizes to me much progress can be had.</li>
<li>I am perfectly capable of letting by-gones be by-gones.</li>
<li>I sincerely hope it is possible to restore good faith between us. He is the best writer I have come accross on Wikipedia - and appears quite intelligent. I only hope he is capable of a reconciliation, as I believe I am. I hope he also has the security to acknowledge my intelligence as well. I'm hoping we can both be equally forgiving men, as regards one another.</li>

<p>There is alot of truth on both sides of this issue. I have not involved myself in the mud-slinging but I have as a result received some in the background and do not find this dispute between the two sides to be very fruitful. I would not single out one person in the above but each has gone through their amateur dramatics, use of offensive language on both sides, over-zealous editing (on one side it is from speaking too much on the other a kind of childish huffy threat of withdrawal and denial of what the volumous one says).</p>
<p>Against one, you might say annoying behaviour (see some long-winded edits on philosophy talk), on the other, when not in a huffy mood its more like group bullying (see coordination on talk pages) of a largely unaware, new person. Not sure which is worse but for me I have some facility in ignoring volumous talk but find the more bitter language less easy to brush over. Note, I take some risk in making this statement as I believe some of the mob types have quite a nice corner-thing going here.</p>
<p>On the matter raised as to whether the online Stanford Philosophy site is better than wiki, I think most of it would be disallowed here as being Original Research or Essay. So in that sense wiki's philosophy is better. It also has alot more than Stanford.</p>

  who is the primary, if not the exclusive, agent of the alleged disruption.
  *Or are you saying that it is Wikipedia policy to punish an editor twice for the same offense?
  *One act in question is the use of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">Bristol Stool Chart</a>
  - which is naturally construed as shouting "SHIT" at an editor - to evaluate an editor.
  *May I ask - should that not be the only disruption to be considered now?

<p>It has been established, to a high degree of probability, that no sources currently exist on which we can base an article. Every one he's brought so far turns out to say a whole lot less than he claims, and a whole lot less credibly. He's been consistently argumentative and vexatious.

<p>So: Wikipedia's Lee Nysted Experience has been canonical <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>, and if we hadn't already coined that term we'd have had to for this guy.

Forgive the tetchy tone, but I have had enough of him, and if anyone ever offers me one of his CDs free and for nothing I wouldn't even use it as a beermat. I propose that if he doesn't shut up in the next - oh, ten minutes or so, that we ban his argumentative vainglorious ass. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question is whether we consider these things to be "A polite, coherent complaint".

<dd>Unless I am confused, the issue here is that Catbird222 wants to use Wikipedia to publish claims that a third party, has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nancy_Steinbeck&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100184941" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nancy_Steinbeck&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100184941" rel="nofollow">engaged in fraud</a>, and is removing the trivia section from <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_of_Eden_1931.html" title="East of Eden">East of Eden</a> because the recording artists listed there infringed on copyright by mentioning the book or its author, but is not claiming that any Wikipedia article infringes on their copyright. As for <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>, as far as I know, Catbird222 is not making threats against Wikipedia users, just asserting that there are legal issues with third parties.

<dd>It's better not to reinsert a warning after the editor has removed it. That looks like edit warring. The warning itself remains in the history and you can refer to it in a diff if necessary. The removal demonstrates that the warning has been read. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 00:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok thanks, but I'm afraid I dont think he understands it, therefore, has not read it.

<p>I was looking at now-banned <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossBuckle_Swami_fa57.html" title="User:JossBuckle Swami">User:JossBuckle Swami</a>'s user page, when I noticed the category above that it was a part of. Suspicious, I clicked, and found a bunch of names on it.</p>
<p>While it's a legitimate category (in that it was not created by JossBuckle Swami, but by Jeffrey O. Gustafson (<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O.

Though created on October 31, 2006, its members only began adding themselves on January 3rd (including JossBuckle Swami). And while I'm sure most are legitimate editors, the timing, as well as the edit histories and some odd gaps therein some raise red flags for me: not enough for Checkuser, but enough to ask some questions, especially about the first two:</p>

<dd>Calton asserted above that "it's a legitimate category", so presumably whatever user division it creates, both userboxes would need to go. I'm not sure I disagree with either deletion, but any nom would reasonably apply to both. A side note, I don't believe 'being attached to a wikiproject' is a requirement for a userbox, but userfication of both might be appropriate. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 04:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I think the stance (and thus the opinion) is a reasonable one, and thus shouldn't be destroyed by nature of what it is. WMF is forgoing about $200 million annually by <i>not</i> having ads.

<dd>Then if a group of active and not-suspiciously-like-sockpuppet Wikipedians decide to recreate the category, they're free to do so. I don't propose salting the earth.

<li>The cited "sources" are threads which make this an attack, so I deleted it as such. That is (hopefully) not the intent of the author, and there is a place for philosophical debate on this subject albeit possily not at this ;;precise <i>title, which is rather judgmental.

<dd>Astrotrain has been a long term contributor since July 2003... Vintagekits has been here since August 2006. This is not wikistalking, this is a difference of opinion over notability. It also appears to be a British vs. Irish sympathy issue.

<p>As the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_investigation_6b25.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Requests for investigation">current voting</a> goes, it seems <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> is going to follow the ill-famed <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> into history. There are almost no strong objections among the voters but some concerns were raised about making general reordering of the house. Here is the idea.</p>
<p>The first thing would be to rename <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> to WP:RTB (Wikipedia:request to block) since that's already what it is. Not every action that requires immediate block are limited to simple vandalism. If the user goes apeshit posting horrific racist attacks all over talk pages, creates inflammatory usernames or does similarly blatant and obvious disruption, such user should be blocked on the spot similar to the blanking, penis or moving vandals. Such reports are already posted to WP:AIV and are acted upon by its watchers. The message on top of the renamed board should clearly state that only complaints against such blatant abuse should be brought there and the reports on the established content writers should be never placed there (not to repeat the painful PAIN and RFI experience).</p>
<p>The second step that would reduce the load of WP:ANI, the concern some users expressed, would be a sub-board where all the user complaints that don't belong to WP:RTB will be posted. The message on top of such board should say that no block should be imposed on a user before at least one full hour commences between the filing of the complaint and the blocking action. Such delay would allow to gauge something close to a consensus on whether the block is warranted. Since urgent requests will all go to WP:RTB, there will be no harm in one hour delay. Of course <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> will continue to run its course. Also, blocking per individual admin discretion case by case is allowed and no one is going to change that.</p>

<li>The idea has its merits. My only concern at the moment is the further fragmenting of the noticeboard and the creation of another layer of bureaucracy which might be confusing to new users (who, for that matter, might not realize that they're in a dispute with an established editor). This almost sounds like the return of Quickpolls, but I'm certainly game for an attempt. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. AIV is not just about blocks, it could be for urgent page protection, spam blacklist requests or some such.

<li>The only issue I have is that blocks are preventative, not punitive. As such, immediate action should be taken by an admin when a block falls under the blocking policy. To impose a time restriction is to tie a hand behind a back in <i>preventing</i> future disruptions. Other than those sorts of details, I've long thought AIV should be renamed and the reorganization could be very useful. Why not set up a talk page and work out a format that'll encompass all the guidelines on blocking, go from there? <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 19:32, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To supplement: sysops have three special tools (block, protect, delete). We have a specific process for requesting protection and deletions; there is no such process for blocking. If you follow through the logs for protection and deletion you can relatively trace where, if you are curious, the decision came from. Blocks are much more indiscriminate, from username to vandalism to 3rr to socks...a format would be nice for non-sysops to post their requests in a system that doesn't span five different community spaces. I don't want more process imposed on blocking, just a system for admins to follow up on user requests. Reiterating that: no more process, we already have it spelled out. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 19:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the Sturm und Drang surrounding this user's block, I was mildly surprised to see that he was unblocked with apparently no on-wiki community input.

<p>Ouch. Considering the circumstances around his blocking, that really should have been discussed. He did cause people to leave because of their feelings concerning his behavior (which doesn't really need to get dredged up here again).

<p>Although this was a community block and by rights should be discussed openly here. I think that's not wise. There are real people here and real issues. I'm taking no view either way on what's right or wrong. But having accusations, information and counter-claims examined here is unlikely to be in the interests of any party (and some are minors). Whatever is said here is pretty much published and permanent. I'd like to move that this decision be referred to arbcom, and invite all parties to submit their evidence to them. I know closed discussions aren't the wiki-way, but this looks like an exception.

<p>(edit conflict) I have no familiarity with the circumstances underlying this situation, apart from what I read on AN or ANI as a relative newbie back in August. However, I urge all concerned to exercise extreme sensitivity and discretion in discussing this matter on-wiki. It is obvious that the situation involves extremely sensitive emotional matters involving several editors and former editors, some of whom are minors. In addition to prior discussions of the matter on Wikipedia, which were probably excessive, these editors are the subject of attack pages on another website which will be trawling any drama that may take place here for material. I am not trying to pretermit community discussion, but please bear this in mind. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nathanrdotcom does not have to be unblocked to participate. He can e-mail his evidence and statements to an arbitrator, arbcom-L, or a clerk. There have also been circumstances where an editor was unblocked to participate in arbitration on condition that he/she edit only arbitration case pages, with immediate blocking the consequence for going beyond that. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The original situation and the ill-feeling it created was very unfortunate. We aren't equipped to deal with issues like this. Some time has passed, hopefully enough for some perspective. Since there's still too much bad blood for us to discuss this without getting upset, I agree with Doc's sugestion that the arbcomm consider this, although given the original situation, it might be better if a lot of the "evidence" is kept off-Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 00:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow, this is so super secretive. I just read Sceptre's second RFA and I'm befuddled - Benon's userspace link has long since been gone, and comments indicate that the nature of this affair is so sensitive that us uninvolved parties will never know what ever took place. ED isn't being helpful, either... <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 01:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well now im back a touch of clarification, the userspace User:Benon/sceptre had *nothing* to do with nathanrdotcom, it was a completley diffrent incident, I had it deleted after a rather messy <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EBenon_sceptre_1ebd.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Benon/sceptre">MFD</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have no qualms about an admin reversing my speedy deleteion of the page if it is deemed nessasry, its really not at all that intresting to be honest. The "incident" was quite sensitve having gone so far as being disatisfied with the arbcom's response involved parties passed it up to Jimbo. The "secrecy" was to protect another anonomyus party who wanted to remain out of this whole thing and any further involvment. If you *really* want to know the whole story go ask jimbo, the arbcom or else google it. In summary Sceptre did some bad things a while back that got him --&gt; &lt;-- this close to being removed from wikipedia permanatly, to many established contributors myself included. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 03:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's an ongoing situation that a few of us would appreciate some advice on how to deal with more effectively. Starting in November of last year, an anonymous user started targeting the article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheri_DiNovo_8589.html" title="Cheri DiNovo">Cheri DiNovo</a>, a Canadian politician, with unsourced allegations that both violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and would be highly libellous if left to stand. This led to an extended revert war which lasted until the article was sprotected on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>; the user then began targetting the <i>talk</i> page with personal attacks against the Wikipedia administrators involved in the issue, which they did so persistently that the <i>talk</i> page had to be sprotected by <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>. The anon editor then started a tit-for-tat game on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Prue_ffc1.html" title="Michael Prue">Michael Prue</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hunter_%28journalist%29_40df.html" title="Robert Hunter (journalist)">Robert Hunter</a>, again using unsourced BLP violations to discredit Prue. Again, they were so persistent that Prue was sprotected on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">January 21</a> and Hunter was sprotected on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>. The user has also inserted the same sets of allegations into <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvia_Watson_01da.html" title="Sylvia Watson">Sylvia Watson</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Lankin_c500.html" title="Frances Lankin">Frances Lankin</a>, although as of today neither of those articles has had to be sprotected.</p>
<p>In addition, the same user has also done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>inserted their allegations about Prue and DiNovo into <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smear_campaign.html" title="Smear campaign">smear campaign</a>.</li>
<li>created a special talk subpage at Talk:Cheri DiNovo/Comments just to reinsert their personal attacks against WP editors after being blocked from that talk page; they later did the same thing at Talk:Michael Prue/Comments even though that talk page was never actually sprotected.</li>
<li>inserted "Cherry DeNude, famous Toronto strip-tease artist in 1970's" into <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Cherry (disambiguation)">Cherry (disambiguation)</a>.</li>
<li>inserted DiNovo into <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> as a contributor (she never was), and then turned around and used the fact that she was wrongly listed there as an attempted swipe at <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">User:Durin</a>'s credibility. They also added DiNovo to the list of past members of the band <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%2C_Wind_%26_Fire_a87c.html" title="Earth, Wind &amp; Fire">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a> and to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_on_stamps_of_Costa_Rica_4290.html" title="List of people on stamps of Costa Rica">List of people on stamps of Costa Rica</a>, presumably toward the same purpose.</li>
<li>attempted to erase the notice of the DiNovo dispute that was posted at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard</a>.</li>
<li>repeatedly and persistently vandalized the talk and/or user pages of administrators who've gotten involved in the matter, often calling us either "fascists" or "NDP attack queers". This has included me, <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">User:CJCurrie</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">User:Durin</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">User:Bucketsofg</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_Peters_7b3c.html" title="User:Pete Peters">User:Pete Peters</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">User:BostonMA</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">User:Imjustmatthew</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue520_f758.html" title="User:Blue520">User:Blue520</a>.</li>
<li>inserted personal attacks against Durin into <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durian.html" title="Durian">durian</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has happened under a variety of IP numbers, all of which resolve to <a href="../../../a/p/n/APNIC_b282.html" title="APNIC">APNIC</a>. (Virtually the same allegations against DiNovo have also been posted to <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabble.html" title="Rabble">Rabble</a>'s discussion board and as responses to a number of blog entries on the Internet, albeit still without any sources. The poster of many of those comments self-identified as a resident of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, so it's likely that this is the same person.) Having to constantly revert this crap is, needless to say, getting tiresome, but since they're on a dynamic IP range there's no easy way to block them. I've tried addressing the matters of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> with them — if such a notice is addressed on an IP number's talk page, then it just gets ignored since they may never even see that IP number again, and if it's addressed on an article talk page, then they repeatedly <i>delete</i> it when posting new personal attacks against Wikipedia administrators.</p>
<p>This whole thing has now been going on for over two months, and it really has to stop. Sticking it out in the hopes that they'll eventually get tired and go away simply isn't working...so what, if anything, can we <i>do</i> about this? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mentioning it here, and getting some other people to help, is probably the best thing you can do.

I like <a href="../../../r/b/i/WP%7ERBI_37b3.html" title="WP:RBI">WP:RBI</a> for this kind of thing, but sometimes it takes a while to bore them to the point they leave you alone. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 04:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently i got blocked not once but twice for things i did not do. Firstly i would like to know how this could happen. It seems that the admins are trigger happy. The first block was labeled with "with an expiry time of indefinite (Probably User:Dick Witham)" So if your not 100% sure why block, No checkuser was performed just a block. What happened to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presumption_of_innocence.html" title="Presumption of innocence">Presumption of innocence</a>?</p>
<p>The second one was for "with an expiry time of 48 hours (Continuing violations of Wikipedia image copyright and fair-use policies)" I got blocked for reverting an image i did not uploaded it and one thing i cant figure out is how is one image Continuing violations?, Wouldn't it be violating images copyright as i wikipedia does not hold the copyright for that image <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_eb93.html" title="WWE">WWE</a> does. Also even if i did upload that image i got given 0 mins at all to fix it cause the tags were placed on my talkpage the same time that the block was given.</p>
<p>So in conclusion i would like a review on both <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> &amp; <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> to ensure that there has been no abuse of power and to ensure that there is no other <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collateral_damage.html" title="Collateral damage">collateral damage</a>, I also request that the two block/unblock actions are struck from the block log. <a href="../../../d/x/r/User%7EDXRAW_bfe0.html" title="User:DXRAW">DXRAW</a> 22:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without commenting on the first issue, the second thing will just not happen.

<dd>As I understand it, JzG thought you were someone else, and Yamla thought that you had taken a different action than you did. They were wrong, and quickly fixed it (Yamla within the same minute). That's why it happened - I fail to see what additional explanation you're looking for. Will it ever happen again? Until we perfect AdminBot 2.0, there's a possibility that it might (and even then, it may). If it does, you should assume good faith and remember that no one here is infallible. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DXRAW, is there a specific resolution you're looking for? Everyone seems to have acknowledged that mistakes were made, you received an apology, but you're continuing to ask for more.

<p>To answer why a CheckUser was not done, CheckUsers are not an automatic thing when it comes to sockpuppetry. Sockpuppetry is, first and foremost, proven in actions and behavioral patterns. In fact, unless things have changed recently, CheckUser only works on very recent edits, so if both accounts have not edited within a month or so (or perhaps even less than that, I'm not a CU or dev), it would be impossible to determine via CU, as this data would have been discarded. Guy incorrectly read the evidence, unblocked, and apologized. Seriously, what more do you want? We aren't perfect.

<ul>
<li>I can answer one specific question: no checkuser was performed before blocking because it can take days to get checkuser results back and in some cases the checkusers refuse anyway. If these were the only blocks in your history, or if they'd been allowed to stand after being challenged, then you might have a case, but neither of these is the case. The only people who are likely to look at your block log are admins, and the block/unblock summaries are clear enough that no mistaken inferences are likely to be drawn. You have been told that the devs refuse to remove or facilitate the removal of blocks from the block log, so really that is the end of the matter: you are asking us to do something that can't be done in order to fix a problem we tell you is not a problem, in that we will not draw unwarranted inferences from these blocks. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the past few weeks I've noticed several threads take a similar shape:</p>
<p>1. An editor starts a discussion with <i>I did X. Is X all right?</i></p>
<p>2. One or two people give a very hot response. <i>That's <b>Y</b>! Y is wrong!</i></p>
<p>3. The original editor comes back with. <i>Actually I did X.</i></p>
<p>4. The hot responses continue. <i>Y violates policy. Y is misconduct!</i></p>
<p>5. Some AN and ANI regulars browse by and add. <i>Yup, Y is wrong.</i></p>
<p>6. The editor who started the thread remains civil yet has clearly become frustrated. <i>What evidence do you need for me to persuade you that I did X? Could I please have some feedback on X?</i></p>
<p>Or to be more specific, one discussion I've seen play out several times is:</p>
<p>A. <i>I gave Joe Wikischmoe a 48 hour block for vandalism.</i></p>
<p>B. <i>That's a punitive block. We don't do that!</i></p>
<p>That's a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> foul: B can't intuit A's motivation. So try some better alternatives.</p>
<p>B. <i>My first reaction is that looks like a punitive block.</i></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>B. <i>Could you explain how that's preventative?</i></p>
<p>These calmer responses invite A to respond without putting A on the defensive. So if the block really was punitive A gets the chance to fix things without getting put on the spot, if A had good reasoning A's reputation doesn't get dented, and everybody comes away with a little less Wikistress.</p>
<p>I've seen other variations on that theme (maybe I'll write an essay on the subject when my computer is fixed) but the basic theme is, try not to let an assumption of good faith toward one Wikipedian morph into an assumption of bad faith toward another. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 23:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Despite his comments, it still seems to me that this template should be userfied - it certainly would be in keeping with the manner in which the "userbox" debates were resolved and the reasoning discussed at the TfD. However, I am left with the problem of how to resolve this matter. I don't think it's a proper matter to discuss at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>; likewise, I can't just migrate it over to userspace (that would require a co-operative host, and I'm not exactly inclined to do so given my position on the template).

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been having problems with a particular user who has been engaged in sock puppetry, trolling, personal attacks, and vandalism of a couple of topic pages, topic talk pages, my user talk page, and another user talk page. I have already discussed this with the user. Several times I have had sincere discussions with the user about his conduct and have even warned him a few times of his behavior. However, nothing seems to sink in. Please let me know what the next step I should take.

<dd>I quite like the protected redirect option. It has all the benefits of salting a page (that is, it keeps vandalism, hoaxes, and attack pages from being recreated), and eliminates the major drawback of salted pages (Special:Randompage running into salted pages, mostly). The only other problem with salted pages – which would still exist with the protected redirects – is that they prevent a real article from being created at the article name. I suspect that this is a desirable outcome at a vanishingly small percentage of salted articles; in any case, the project space target of the redirect can certainly contain detailed instructions for editors who wish to see a page unsalted. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Generally not. But we need common sense here. Most vandal page creators move on quickly and so 2-3 weeks will suffice. But others are slow burning, and get recreated every month. MOstly if the deleted page is deleted and the things gets recreated, the harm is low. But if we've got someone posting a libellous article every few months to some obscure name, then we'd probably want to protect for a long time. And then there is Male bikini-wearing. I recently had someone repeatedly creating a redirect from a name to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>. Basically, deleting protected pages is fine, as long as the admin looks at the reason for protection, the deletion history, and engages his brain. Automatically deleting something after x days is unacceptable. Cases will vary.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 16:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I even recall seeing some complaints of a recently salted article perhaps being unsalted too quickly by another admin who was cleaning things up.

<dd>The current listing is actually more useful, as it includes links to the talk page and to the deletion log.

<dd>The heading, in fact, should be More MSJapan! This user has a "problem" with me because I pointed out problems with articles edited by self proclaimed freemasons, which effects Wikipedia adversely by putting out mason propaganda. He has been trolling my pages and been heading a campaign against me ever since. As these exact same type of tactics have been used by freemasons for centuries it's really no surprise. This user, who has reported falsely in his statements against me in previous attacks has never denied that his statements were false after I pointed out that they were. MSJapan has made a mistake, he has identified himself as the person who as gone off Wikipedia and called me a "**bleep** idiot." I knew that if a gave a good response I had a chance of finding out who would act this. His bringing up my response is pretty good proof that drtroll and MSJapan are on in the same person.

Many thanks for your time in this matter. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 16:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since my above message another change has been made removing some of the article as it stood wothout any comment why in the edit summary and another question has popped to mind, in that, if this editor is adding passages from their published works is there a copyvio problem on the horizon. Again, I could be off base but I wanted to make you aware of all of this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 17:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Being bold is one thing but taking over an article and not allowing for any corrections is another and I hope that this editor, with some a ssistance, can become a valuable member of the wikipedia community, but, as a wikignome, I don't know where to begin to offer that help so I am hoping that you all will be able to do what is needed</p>

<p>I am really not sure what is going on here- User:Augmon92 is adding {{subst:Welcome}} to many pages, but, despite the fact that there have been no edits afterwards, they are coming out as displaying a strange message. Two examples of where he has done this are <a href="../../../s/a/o/User_talk%7ESaowanee.alexander_abb8.html" title="User talk:Saowanee.alexander">User_talk:Saowanee.alexander</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/h/User_talk%7EExhead_8a5a.html" title="User talk:Exhead">User_talk:Exhead</a>. I may be making a false accusation here, but something strange is going on, that needs to be stopped, preferably quickly. Those two pages are the ones I came across because I was posting on them for another reason. If you take a look at Augmon92's contributions, there have been A LOT of welcome messages of late, but the most recent few show up as normal, when I checked them. It is worth noting that Augmon92 has recieved a lot of warnings in the past. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not really sure how to handle this situation: User:The-princess-georgie and User:The-princess-georgie-gallery are apparently being used as a web site host. The former account has made 3 edits outside the userspace, and the latter has made edits only to the aforementioned user pages. The gallery page says, "This is my gallery for my site The Princess Georgie" and The Princess Georgie links to the other user page.

<dd>I think the best answer is to take it out. I think we can say what she does for a living without saying where she does it. (The current version handles that well, I think.) This can sometimes be a balancing act, of course - but I think this information isn't so vital that the article can't live without it, and is sensitive enough that we should respect her concerns. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 23:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I think the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7ECheckuserblock_bb3f.html" title="Template:Checkuserblock">Template:Checkuserblock</a> is seriously broken, or it is used wrongly. The template was apparently desigend to be placed on an IP's talk page by the blocker. Okay. However, checkusers these days seem frequently to be placing the template into their block log messages instead. Its code is seems not to be designed for that use. Its text contains instructions about using "{{unblock}}". When a blocked user follows the instruction given to them on the "you have been blocked" page, they will automatically have this text copied, without the "nowiki"'s, <i>into</i> their own {{unblock}} template, leading to multiple transclusion of the unblock template inside itself. The result is this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aepryus&amp;diff=103646413&amp;oldid=68431603" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aepryus&amp;diff=103646413&amp;oldid=68431603" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. It's too late now here for me to either understand the case of that particular checkuserblock victim, or to think up a way how to fix the template, but I'd be grateful if someone could have a look. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 01:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no doubt user 88.109 and user ahwaz are the same people and he has had ample enough warning not to edit war and also the 3RR is more severe (meaning it does not have to 4) if a user has been constantly doing it. Also I believe you are a good admin, I think it is wrong to take sides on a hotly debated issue without really knowing all the facts involved. Thus the article should be unlocked and I am open for discussion on the talk page as I have been so far.
