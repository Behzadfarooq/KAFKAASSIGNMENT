<p>I suppose the notice on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentchanges_8e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentchanges">Wikipedia:Recentchanges</a> refers to User:Vandal high school!. Indeed he used the old trick of having a monobook.js that filled-in the content in the edit box <i>and submitted the form</i> upon the "onload" event. That does indeed speed up a vandal a bit, because any red link or other edit-link clicked or otherwise submitted fills or overwrites the target page automatically: no need to actually visit these pages and click the "Save page" button. Such JavaScript-assisted vandal attacks have occurred several times in the past few months, and they invariable used this scheme. How about doing something against this? I have experimented with an approach that disables all calls to the critical submit-function, but only if that function is called from within an "onload" handler. The code is <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_Test_js_code_b6e8.html" title="User:Lupo Test/js code">here</a>. I have tested this on Mozilla only, but if other JavaScript-savvy people could test it (and take a look at it and maybe improve it), we could add this code to <a href="../../../m/o/n/MediaWiki%7EMonobook.js_362e.html" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.js">our site-wide JavaScript file</a>. If I got it right, that would effectively counter this vandal attack scheme. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 11:34, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, I was wondering what you were up to. I'm not sure we should be adding complexity for this though, as if we disable this method there are a million similar (and probably faster) methods to be used. Also, the vandals could just use <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greasemonkey.html" title="Greasemonkey">greasemonkey</a> if they really wanted to use javascript. See also <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/17573|the" class="external text" title="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/17573|the" rel="nofollow">wikitech-l discussion on this</a>. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 11:42, 2005 May 25 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I only just discovred how to use the .js (by copying and testing the vandals' scripts). I think they could be useful for non-vandals (monotonous tasks) and I'd be sad to see them blocked just as I discovered them. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 11:59, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lupo's proposal is merely to disable hitting submit on page load. I don't think you want to do that without a bot flag anyway. Anything else would still be fine. By the way, Lupo: how would you handle things like timers that hit submit 1ms after page load and such? --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 12:14, 2005 May 25 (UTC)

<dd>Dunno, haven't looked into it. I am well aware that starting to counteract common vandal tactics might lead to an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_race.html" title="Arms race">arms race</a>. My little experiment was designed only to put an end to this particular scheme.

<p>User:Oceanographer is a new account whose only work has been to create a lengthy article on Uwe Kils (in other words, <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_f4a7.html" title="User:Kils">User:Kils</a> from Wikipedia history). Whether or not Oceanographer is in fact Kils, I consider the article effectively a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">vanity page</a> because it seems to be created entirely from the links to CV and biographical information Kils left on his user page. Accordingly, I moved the article to Oceanographer's user space, a solution I consider appropriate for vanity pages. Oceanographer reverted this.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances (brand new account, Kils' history), I think this also could fall under the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a> as a new account that may be blocked for disruption. I haven't blocked yet, but will consider it if problems continue. Feedback and assistance in dealing with this situation is welcome, particularly from old hands familiar with Kils. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:48, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Did <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_f4a7.html" title="User:Kils">User:Kils</a> have a history of writing vanity articles? I cursory glance suggests he's important to his field. The links needs to be fixed to point to internal stuff though... <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:06, May 25, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BTW, I don't support blocking unless you we can get undeniable proof it's Kils himself. Have you explained why you think the article doesn't belong here? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:08, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Writing a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">vanity page</a> is not a blockable offense. That said, the current page on <a href="../../../u/w/e/Uwe_Kils_f239.html" title="Uwe Kils">Uwe Kils</a> <i>is</i> a vanity page. However, as <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a> has pointed out, it seems that he <i>is</i> noteable enough to be covered in this encyclopedia. But not in this way. This needs a <i>massive</i> rewrite (wikification, de-hype, general tone-down, removal of some images, removal of his activities on Wikipedia). As to whether User:Oceanographer is a sockpuppet: I have no proof, but I would think he's either Kils himself or someone close to him. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_f4a7.html" title="User:Kils">User:Kils</a> has made only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Kils&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Kils&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">sporadic edits in 2005 so far</a>. Then on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, he becomes suddenly very active, putting together <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_evaluation1_bf51.html" title="User:Kils/evaluation1">User:Kils/evaluation1</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_cv_a366.html" title="User:Kils/cv">User:Kils/cv</a>, and <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_testimony_35e8.html" title="User:Kils/testimony">User:Kils/testimony</a>. The latter can be found <i>verbatim</i> in the article <a href="../../../u/w/e/Uwe_Kils_f239.html" title="Uwe Kils">Uwe Kils</a>. Kils is done with this work at 12:55, 24 March 2005 (UTC), and a mere three hours later, User:Oceanographer appears and puts together the article at User:Oceanographer/Uwe Kils, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Oceanographer/Uwe_Kils&amp;oldid=14165647" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Oceanographer/Uwe_Kils&amp;oldid=14165647" rel="nofollow">very first version</a> already including all of <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_testimony_35e8.html" title="User:Kils/testimony">User:Kils/testimony</a>. That shows two things: (1) Oceanographer knows quite well how the Wikipedia works. Too well to be a newbie. (2) He was fully aware of what Kils was doing on Wikipedia on May 23/24, 2005. I don't believe in coincidences. But all that is of no great importance, I'd say. All that is needed is a <b><a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">nice big edit</a></b> over at the article <a href="../../../u/w/e/Uwe_Kils_f239.html" title="Uwe Kils">Uwe Kils</a>, unless we discover that here someone was bolstering up his achievements. But somehow I doubt that is the case. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 19:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is Kils, as Lupo seems to suggest, then I'm less inclined to consider this disruption for blocking purposes (someone impersonating Kils is much more disruptive). But as for the article, the content is not just vanity, it's unverifiable. Basically, all the external links in the article that mention Kils come from his personal pages. That stuff can't be considered verifiable without finding confirmation for it elsewhere. The only verifiable fact I can trace to a reliable outside source is that Kils is an Associate Professor in planktology at the IMCS at Rutgers University. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:55, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael Snow asked me to weigh in on this and provide historical perspective, so here I am. First, I'd encourage everyone to remember that the policy on vanity pages is relatively new and has been adopted since Kils left (or sharply curtailed his editing, at least). Second, Kils had a number of sock puppets, and it was his abuse of socks that got him de-admined (combined with purporting to have additional authority by virtue of being an admin -- something that seems to pass without so much as a raised eyebrow today). It would not take a large stretch of the imagination to believe that he might be editing with a sock today. I would think that blocking him would be premature; better to VfD the article and leave it at that. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 20:30, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A "pseudo-vanity" article (I assume on the author's PhD supervisor) which was copied to user space (User:Oceanographer/Uwe Kils) by <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichael_Snow_bc07.html" title="User talk:Michael Snow">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Michael_Snow_61f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Michael Snow">contribs</a>), who created a redirect to this page. The user has been warned that the content of the article may not be suitable for wikipedia, but makes reference to a discussion on notablity criteria where one user suggests that "tenured faculty at four year colleges and graduate schools" are sufficiently notable for inclusion as justification for their reverts. To be fair to them, they are new to wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnilocra_a4d1.html" title="User:Anilocra">Anilocra</a> 21:00, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

He has used sockpuppets, engaged in revert wars, and has been blocked three times for 3RR, and while he's made some normal edits, most of his time here is spent fighting. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:56, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are not supposed to block for personal attacks, and if ElKabong were blocked for that reason, I'd probably unblock him—as annoying as he is, the limits on sysop authority ought to be respected. That said, unless he shapes up soon, I see an open-and-shut arbitration case in his immediate future. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 22:40, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input. I'd say he's doing it deliberately to disrupt, because he's having no other effect. He's had several admins and editors running around trying to sort out the various sockpuppet issues, revert the abuse, protect pages, block him for 3RR, deal with his abusive e-mailed denials etc. Before we can go to the arbcom, we'd have to do an RfC; it seems absurd to go through all that with a user as disruptive as this. I won't take it upon myself, however, to block him for this unless others support it.<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:25, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I did not see SlimVrigin's Talk:Islamofascism diff she cites above prior to commenting on this user's talk page.

I beleive this, but then, he proceeded to delete my article Hacienda Toscana which was about roughly the same topic but more accurate and based on fact, not fiction. The information in my aricle came from a book called "The Future of the Past" with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-330-37534-2</a>. He then said that the ISBN didnt exist because he didnt find it on Amazon.com, and gave me two other ISBNs without even checking my ISBN. Then he said that I wrote Fortress Blakeley and that I was responsible for it, and that I should be "pulling someone elses' legs". Then he deleted the articles on the presumption that it was a recreation of a former fake article. My article is real, however. Please help. Kaschner 22:27, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That ISBN (0-330-37534-2) is indeed a valid ISBN for The Future of the Past, so if Amazon doesn't have it, it's a bad way to check for valid ISBNs! - or perhaps someone mistyped something.

<dd>It's definitely a violation. I'd prefer if someone else could look at this and do the block, as I've blocked Yuber twice already for 3RR, and he'll start to think it's personal; however, if no one has within the next hour or two, I'll come back and do it. He's been warned a lot, on top of the previous blocks: I've warned him on his talk page and several times by e-mail. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:41, May 26, 2005 (UTC)

<p>WMC is subject to a temporary injunction barring him from more than one revert in a 24 hour period. Furthermore, it requires each revert to be backed up on the relevant talk page. WMC has failed to do so - the whole of his supporting documentation is "I've reverted, of course." In addition, I'd like to point out that WMC has engaged in grotesque incivility - referring to another users edits as "foolishness". According to the terms of the injunction, Administrators are requested to consider these as violations of the 3RR. As they will also note, there are other examples of his refusal to abide by wikipedia rules in this area. Please ban him accordingly. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 00:59, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He did fail to back up his reverts as required in the injunction (the incivility and the repitious nature of the act could be seen to compound the violation).

<p>I'm a little amused that <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> should think that calling another editor's work "foolishness" is "grotesque incivility". How, then (especially in light of the injunction relating to his own behaviour), would he describe this: "I mean it sounds as though you're talking through your hat but if you are actually an editor of a publication similar to Nature, then you might be in a position to make these sort of comments. If not, then they're a joke." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoss_McKitrick&amp;diff=14228564&amp;oldid=14216028" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoss_McKitrick&amp;diff=14228564&amp;oldid=14216028" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>). I must admit that when he addressed this comment to me I didn't think of it as "grotesque incivility", but perhaps I should reevaluate it? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:32, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll explain the difference Mel, when I was speaking to you I made it clear that I was expressing my personal opinion (i.e. <i>it sounds as though</i>) and I made it clear that if you actually had experience as an editor it would be a different matter entirely. WMC on the other hand, denounces things as "foolishness", "pointless" or "nonsense" as though these were unequivocal fact when they are simply his opinions and worth no more or less than those than those opinions he rudely dismisses. He behaves more like a cult member than a scientists - furiously denouncing and belittling those who question his version of the truth or the version he has accepted as the "revealed word". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonGwynne_a2ab.html" title="User talk:JonGwynne">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonGwynne_e11b.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonGwynne">contribs</a>) 07:51, 28 May 2005 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Ah, more incivility from WMC.

<p>Admin (<a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a>), who is involved in a dispute over BC/AD, BCE/CE, has protected <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_kings_of_Persia_6065.html" title="List of kings of Persia">List of kings of Persia</a>. This page protection is contrary to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a>, which clearly states in its instructions on how to protect pages: "Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over."</p>
<p>Despite her protestations to the contrary, there can be little doubt of violet/riga's involvement in this dispute. For example, on the page in question, she reverted twice, both times to support a particular POV:</p>
<pre>
07:40, 2005 May 22 Violetriga (Reverted edits by Slrubenstein to last version by Violetriga)
07:25, 2005 May 22 Slrubenstein (Reverted edits by Violetriga to last version by SouthernComfort)
06:30, 2005 May 22 Violetriga (Reverted edits by SouthernComfort to last version by Jguk 
</pre>
<p>Violet/riga's POV is evident in this statement on the talk page: "This article originally used BC/AD and not BCE/CE. We do not have a policy to use BCE/CE and to change it from one to another is not really appropriate. I suggest people continue to discuss this rather than perpetuate a revert war. violet/riga (t) 14:39, 22 May 2005 (UTC)."</p>
<p>These pages have relied extensively on the 1911 <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, which used BC/AD notation exclusively in that edition. (Interestingly, <i>Britannica</i> now uses BCE/CE in some of its articles). Use of BCE/CE is perfectly acceptable according to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Eras" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia: Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Eras</a> and there is ample precedent for this (e.g., the series of articles on <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>). Many of the pages on Persia are in dire need of clean-up. Several editors are working on this. One of these editors, <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> began to make the change to BCE/CE. This prompted <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a> (not an editor of these pages) to begin the revert war.</p>
<p>Despite the continued reverts on this and other Persian pages, discussion was, and is, occurring. There is no need whatsoever for the page protection. In fact, it is arbitrary and capricious. The problem stems from one user ( Jguk) who was the first to revert and has continued a campaign of reverts, supported by two admins: <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> (who has since relented) and violet/riga. All but one of the current authors of the pages on Persia (i.e., five out of six who have spoken), have indicated their agreement that the pages should use BCE/CE notation since these are non-Christian topics relating to a non-Christian region of the world.</p>
<p>I have made repeated requests to violet/riga to unprotect the page (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_kings_of_Persia_fe75.html#Protecting_this_page_is_out_of_line" title="Talk:List of kings of Persia">Talk: List of kings of Persia#Protecting this page is out of line</a>). I request that the page be unprotected. We are sorting it out. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 09:04, 2005 May 27 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've unprotected the page, as the original protection was indeed made in violation of policy. I doubt that I'll be the only watchful eye, so any signs of edit-warring should be studiously avoided. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:17, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>It wasn't a violation of policy - my contributions have been to settle the dispute and to compromise.

<p>Looking at the history of the page, it seems that a number of editors wanted to use the BCE/CE system, while one editor (an admin) wanted to retain BC/AD; suddenly other editors appeared, at least two of them also admins), reverting changes to BCE/CE (sometimes referring to the BCE/CE form as "improper"), and then one of them protected the page. All that might be entirely innocent and above board, and the people who were involved might well have been unaware of how their actions would look to others — but it <i>appeared</i> unfair and a violation at least of the spirit if not the letter of policy, and no-one seems to have tried to dispel that appearance.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>One</b></i> editor? You count jguk, myself and violet/riga as one person? Please note that none of this mass reversion from BC/AD to BCE/CE occurred until <i><b>after</b></i> Slrubenstein's attempt to force his own personal view as policy, and <i><b>lost</b></i> that vote. Then the mass changing began, directly in the face of a lack of consensus vote. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:26, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure, incidentally, to which attempted compromise violet/riga refers; I haven't looked at every edit in detail, but there's no sign of compromise in the Talk page — vioet/riga simply seems to have insisted that the dates not be changed, and that use of BCE/CE is PoV (though I'm not sure what PoV that would be; one other editor involved in the reverts seems to think that the system was the invention of Marxists &amp; "minimalists" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACodex_Sinaiticus&amp;diff=13499895&amp;oldid=13381245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACodex_Sinaiticus&amp;diff=13499895&amp;oldid=13381245" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, and there were other conspiracy theories being offered in all seriousness). The simple fact is that violet/riga weighed in on one side of the debate, making reverts, and then protected the page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:02, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you say, you haven't looked in detail. My first talk page comment was "I suggest people continue to discuss this" and my reversions were <i>to the original version</i> of the dating scheme - which that was does not matter. Next you'll say<a href="../../../e/r/a/Wikipedia%7EEras_01f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Eras">Wikipedia:Eras</a> is not an attempt (by me!) at sorting out a compromise. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:21, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In other words you took sides. Of course, you took sides because you thought that you'd chosen the right side, in line with Wikipedia policy, but nothing that you did differed from <i>any</i> editor's becoming involved in a dispute. Suggesting that people discuss matters is fine, but doesn't count as significant "effort I've put in to resolve the issues and come up with an acceptable compromise". What you've done on <a href="../../../e/r/a/Wikipedia%7EEras_01f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Eras">Wikipedia:Eras</a> doesn't affect the judgement as to what you did here; you can't build up credit for mediation on one page, and then spend it on another by revert-warring. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:53, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One side wanted BC/AD, the other wanted BCE/CE. I don't mind either, and wanted the article back to a state before the edit war happened - one that was accepted by everyone there until people started to argue. Only then could the compromising begin and that was the only fair way. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:04, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Me? Frankly, I think I've done more than my fair share of helping out with the BC/E dispute (and it isn't as if I stopped, like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommon_Era_f491.html#First_use" title="Talk:Common Era">5 minutes ago</a>), but I have never reverted anything to either AD/BC or BCE/CE. And, moreover, you still failed to explain (yesterday) why protecting was so urgent. We've been through this, but I recall not being entirely satisfied with your answers. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 12:39, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I can see why you misunderstood my meaning there. I didn't mean "<i>you</i> try and and help out", it was to be read as me getting aggrevated at being blasted for trying to help. To answer your question, the article was undergoing a major edit war - it had been reverted five times just in the 12 hours prior to me protecting it and it'd been going back and forth for five days. To me that is ridiculous, especially considering there was supposed to be ongoing discussions on the talk page and WP:Eras. Revert wars should not be allowed and are a waste of time - they were distracting from the discussions and were just annoying those involved. I protected it just before going to bed as I didn't want to wake up in the morning and see that it had gone on through the night. I'm quite happy with the present situation as the revert war seems to have ceased, at least for now:

<dd><i>The "revert war" on the Persian pages is now over and clearly the evidence from those pages is that there is no need for a change.</i></dd>

<dd>The revert war did not cease because of the page protection, IMO. Quite simply the casualties of this war became too high. A very thoughtful new contributor (SouthernComfort) was driven off and other regular editors of the pages on Persia were sorely taxed by the incessent reverts. It became absurd and everyone stopped, allowing Jguk to have his way in most of the articles. And that's the truth! <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 17:56, 2005 May 27 (UTC)</dd>

I take it that there's no claim that he <i>didn't</i> revert four times, nor that he's a new user who didn't know any better. His claim, in an e-mail to me, that one of the reverts doesn't count because he meant it as a compromise seems to be the only possible reason, and I can't see that that makes any difference, especially as we're in no position to judge claims of that sort. I only know that he's been unblocked because of his crowing e-mail to me, incidentally (though his attempt to rub my nose in his Houdini-skills (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASam_Spade&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14309381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASam_Spade&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14309381" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>) would have alerted me anyway).</dd>

<p>The same text was removed four times in a row; that's reverting. As has been repeated many times above, and is made clear elsewhere, the reverts don't have to be identical (otherwise anyone could revert as many times as they wanted, just my making a different extra change each time).

<p>His behaviour doesn't indicate that he's likely to cool off (see my message above); he treats your action as a victory over me. Moreover, the same could be said for the majority of people who violate 3RR — they'll "cool off", until the next time. SS is a well-known barrack-room lawyer, constantly harrassing other editors with his (sometimes odd interpretations of) policy; I don't think that it's appropriate to let him off with a grin and a wink and a "don't let me catch you doing it again, you little scamp". <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:49, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>David: Yes, I complimented him for making a good qualification for Italian fascism as being corportist, but I still opposed the edit, as a revert. <u>That was not a comrpomise</u>, it was just an immediately useful addition — which, incidentally, is no longer necessary. With the improved passage as it is now, there is no need for a corportist qualification, since it only speaks of Italin fascism as the first form of fascism, without touching on the thematic titles for the particularities of the two forms (<i>i.e.</i> the corportist and hitlerian/nazi kind). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 11:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why is it that some get blocked for 24 hours, and some for a couple? There is no consisency. Either make it a hard rule that it's 24 hours unless it can be proved without doubt that you didn't break 3RR, or give up on the whole thing. This page takes up a lot of time for a lot of people. 24 hours isn't actually a long time, I'm sure the people who are blocked will survive it. I can't see that Sam was warned he was about to break the rule. The following shows how another long time user who hadn't been warned was unblocked:</li>

<dd>The only way to avoid this nonsense is to be honest and admit that blocking for making four reverts is a punishment. Once we admit that, we can establish the principle that <i>everyone</i> gets 24h no matter what. Unless we do that, there is one rule for people with admin friends, and one rule for others. We need the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>, not rule of cliques.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This proposal aside, let me point out that Sam Spade made a promise not to revert, and to stay away from that article for a while. With the rule as it stands at the moment, that is sufficient to allow unblocking. Those who complain about the unblocking are being hypocritical unless they protested (as I did) against Slrubenstein's recent unblocking, which was without any such promises and indeed he <del>immediately resumed reverting</del> <ins>resumed his POV-pushing in the article less than 48h later, and proceded to make personal attacks</ins>). I repeat: as the policy stands, there is nothing wrong with unblocking Sam Spade (even though his reverts to <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism_and_religion</a> were pretty stupid). — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 15:04, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That comaprison draws a crude parallel between the two cases. Silversmith possibly still thinks that I was unfair in my support to reduce SlR's 3RR block, but if this is the case, she is mistaken. In the case of SlR, there was a heated and pressing discussion involving many people who wished to rely on his expertise, a discussion that could —and I argue did— end up benefiting from him being unblocked and intensively tackling the material on the talk page. In the case of Sam, he was the only one challenging that passage, the only one reverting everyone else. And most of the editors in the discussion found his explantions and expertise with the material wanting. As well, we have the snide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASam_Spade&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14309381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASam_Spade&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14309381" rel="nofollow">certainly</a>. Silversmith is more than free to offer to reduce a 3RR block if she finds it would benefit Wikipedia, and admins may act on that or not. But to speak abstractly on consistency and such, well, I argue that there is such a consistency, except its geared to the benefit of Wikipedia and it isn't inflexibly rigid. If there are good grounds to unblock Sam Spade, anyone is free to present these, or if they are an admin, unblock him. This, after all, is how the wiki runs, and anyone is free to propose policy for it to run otherwise, too. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 15:16, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd><s>So are you are saying that his unblock wasn't due to his not being warned, but because his opinions and arguments were valuable, where as Sam's are not? In your opinion that is. It seems that the policy as it stands is too open to bias. And I don't see the "certainly" comment as snide. It isn't very fair to make assumptions like that, particularly when Sam isn't here to defend himself. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversmith_d59b.html" title="User:Silversmith"><font color="#A29EBA"><b>Silversmith</b></font></a></s> <small><a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESilversmith_89c3.html" title="User talk:Silversmith">Hewwo</a></small> 16:12, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any person who cares so little about the hurt caused other people by Sam's insults, contempt of policy and attempts at gaming the system to cover it all up that they aid Sam in obscuring his history thus permitting Sam another day of abuse at wikipedia... either through direct intervention or by inaction. Such editors need to be aware that they are improving neither their own image and outlook, nor the wiki community. Time and again Sam's actions have shown him to be completely refractory; his own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=0" rel="nofollow">statements</a> show he willfully remains unaccquainted with remorse or shame. Given that, two obvious questions for those who abett Sam Spade are just what has Sam to done to justify the many opportunities he's been given, and does his squandering so many opportunities justify yet one more. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 18:07, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair enough. I thought it worth trying as an alternative to the page protection that has also been requested, and wanted the judgement of an independent admin. Gump clearly knew he was reinserting this 666 recommendation, indeed he was reinserting it <b>because</b> it had been there before from what I can gather. The fact that he hasn't reverted again is in his favour, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:47, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note in particular that he is removing all references to matrixwatch.org, despite the fact that I've cited it as a source used in working on the article. This is deliberate, as the edit summaries indicate. Also note that all editors were warned about the 3RR when <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">User:Phils</a> put the NPOV tag on the article.</li>

<dd>Carnildo, I looked at the history and I can't see a violation. Can you supply the correct diffs and times; if they're partial reverts, give an example of the text being added or deleted; and also show the diff for the version s/he's reverting back to? I'm sorry if it's obvious, but I'm just not seeing it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:55, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Carnildo. As he's a new user, at least using that IP address, and as there's no history of violations, I've left him a warning. I'll put the page on my watchlist and if he violates it again, he'll be blocked the next time. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:18, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article has been speedy deleted three times, twice after VfD debates. Now it has come back for the fourth time and I have nominated for speedy deletion this time around. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">User:Mike Rosoft</a> wants some of it merged with the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> article however, and I don't really know what to do. Merge and delete is not really allowed under GFDL, yet I see that the main JW article links to it. After that rant on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Critical_Information_on_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses2_1a5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Critical Information on Jehovah's Witnesses2">vfd debate</a> I want to see the article go soon. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:53, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Give him a few dates to put it in <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> (that should satisfy GFDL) and delete it in a few days. If it's deleted earlier, we can send him a copy from the deletion log by email for personal use. Or perhaps he could keep a copy in his userspace? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:46, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>On Uncle G's talk page you posted the following</p>
<p><i>Not having a user page disrupts:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>all talk pages with red links</li>
<li>lists of most wanted pages</li>
<li>the time administrators take repeatedly deleting your page</li>
</ul>
<p>Not having a userpage doesn't disrupt. And here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redlinks only show a page doesn't exist. It would be more disruptive if he created nonsense to fill the page just to have one.</li>
<li>Userpages aren't included in the most wanted pages.</li>
<li>Deleting his userpage takes about 3 seconds. Solving disputes (which most of the time shouldn't have started anyway) takes far more time. Besides, admins aren't obliged to delete anything if they don't want to either. The whole project is on a voluntary basis.</li>
<li>Userpages are for personal information. Within the existing guidelines it's for Uncle G to use as he pleases. If he chooses not to take advantage of that, we can't force him.<br /></li>

<li>So, I may have been wrong about it not being included in most wanted pages. But I still don't see how not having a userpage is such a big problem.

<li>I dont understand what contributes to an outright revert, but from what i see, he has reverted to his own version 6 times, despite 4 of us trying to reinstate 1 version. --<a href="../../../e/2E/a/User%7EE.A_0364.html" title="User:E.A">E.A</a> 12:23, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I looked at this, too, but held off from acting because I couldn't really make out more than three reverts (but I was feeling tired, and didn't want to rule out the possibility that I was missing something). For edits to count as the same reverts, the same text must be added or removed each time. If the editor changes to his version, but uses different language each time, the 3RR isn't violated (it's can still be annoying, and might be grounds for asking for page protection, though much depends on the circumstances). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:52, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So a user can revert, but modify the text slightly and avoid a 3RR ban? I would think a revert would count as any major change from a version the majority of editors are trying to reinstate?

<p>Yes; changing the text slightly doesn't do it — but in this case I thought (as did <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a>) that the edits were significantly different. Simply chaning from a certain version isn't enough — it has to be (or to include) the <i>same</i> change from that version. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:35, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This arose because I blocked him on a 3RR violation; he e-mailed me to say, <i>inter alia</i>: "I think I can do more for the project by getting you and a few others de-sysopped than by clarifying minor matters of NPOV." personally I found his page amusing rather than offensive, and I suspect that it will do him much more damage than it does anyone else; on the other hand, I can see El C's point.

<p>Sam Spade has, as long as I have known him, been unpredictable. He sometimes offers genuine praise and is able to engage in a productive conversation. However, when something arouses his ire, he seems to operate with blinders on. His list of rogua admins includes people who have made very valuable contributions to this project and who are well-respected (including, by the way, people I have vociferously disagreed with in the past). The very concept of a "rogue's list" is to my way of thinking offensive. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. And if someone does some consistently outrageous things in a variety of contexts over some time, we certainly should consider desysoping them — but only after a fair amount of discussion and hopefully something close to consensus. Sam's list, personal and ad hoc as it is, has no place in the process I just described. It serves no constructive purpose and seems to me to be just a way to antagonize others. Folks, lwt's stick to writing an encyclopedia. I am in no position to throw stomes, but I know that Sam isn't either. I ask him, and all I can do is appeal to his better nature, to get rid of that ersatz hit-list. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:43, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is absolutely absurd. How much longer is behavior like this going to be tolerated from him? What is so awful about the normal channels (and, forgive me, but the normal rules of behavior and dignity to boot) that Sam feels he must totally subvert them and pursue his own vendettas? The sig is just part of this — the fact that he keeps such a page and engages in vigilantism on, apparently, his own behalf, merely shows for all to see the contempt he holds for the way this project does things.

<p>No, I don't think we should forget about the abuse of El C on the ground that Sam changed his sig back or that he has issues with Mel Etitis.

It's the very same list, it's apparently been copied verbatim from the RFA to your Rogue Admin userpage. How could it possibly work in both contexts? When El C points out above that the "evidence" comes from his RFA and thus predates his adminship altogether, you reply <b>"That may be true, until I can show otherwise, I have removed you from the list."</b> I assure you it <b>is</b> true, it took me maybe a minute to check it out. You remove El C from that list, but you imply he's making it up? That is just abuse. If you forgot about your own actions, could you have checked what he said and then apologized? Are you planning to apologize anytime soon?</p>
<p>I don't understand how El C can be expected to laugh off this kind of stuff, I know I couldn't. Disclosure, btw: yes, er, I have indeed asked El C to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14157879" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14157879" rel="nofollow">marry me</a>&#160;:-), and yeah, that was a joke. I was expressing relief at his intervention in an edit war where I had jumped in with too much optimism and (as a green admin) too little dispute resolution skill. I didn't know him—I'd spoken to him briefly—though I'd been very impressed by the support votes and positive comments at his RFA from users with political opinions at variance with his. (Heck, who wouldn't marry a guy with that much respect in the community?) Anyway, even though he in fact declined my proposal (in a gracious manner), I think it would be terrible if he left the project over this. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:29, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My experience with Sam Spade is that he acts like a bully and is abusive, and then switches gears and claims he is an innocent victim of vast conspiracies against him. I really do not understand why he is allowed to be so disruptive and abusive. El C has my sympathy and support, as do other Admins who have had to deal with Sam Spade. I really think the Wiki community needs to take seriously this type of pattern of aggressive activity. Sam Spade is a rogue editor.

<dd>The issue isn't so much that Sam Spade's actions are once again uncivil, manipulative, and sociopathically aggressive... as that they're so knowingly, cynically, avoidably so. When you come up against a editor such as Sam who views <a href="../../../f/e/l/User_talk%7EFeloniousMonk_476a.html#Sam_Spade.27s_email" title="User talk:FeloniousMonk">insults</a> and other forms of personal attack as the proper means of relating to other editors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13288873" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13288873" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, you know that this is a person who holds the values and policies of the community in contempt; someone who views the values and conventions here as subordinate to their own whims and personal needs, suspensible at will. This is a person for whom operating within the bounds of community is only a pretense, and hence is outside the realm of the community's morality. And once outside, moral conventions and principles have no place; appealing to these will have no effect with this editor, as we have seen over and over. Sam's continuing abusive, manipulative behavior undercuts and betrays his own supporters while bolstering that of his gainsayers. Time and again we've seen Sam cynically manipulate the system to side-step policy and deliver personal attacks, introduce POV content into articles with no more support than his personal idea of morality and revert-warring when his POV fails to make consensus, and attempts at covering up the evidence by gaming the system. The only responsible conclusion is that such an editor is morally bereft, beyond redemption, and his continued presence is counter to the best interests of the community. It is a sad indictment of wikipedia that he hasn't been banned yet. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 04:19, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding my past issues with Sam, <a href="../../../f/e/l/User_talk%7EFeloniousMonk_476a.html#Sam_Spade.27s_email" title="User talk:FeloniousMonk">the facts</a> suffice to conclude in good faith that Sam's bad acts are sufficient grounds for banning: he intentionally abused and attacked a fellow editor in a manner prohibited by wikipedia policy and intentionally attempted to side-step policy to do it. Both facts he admits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13289052" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13289052" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. This conclusion and the evidence from which it is drawn neither relies upon nor is comprised of "petty disagreements and personality feuds." My drawing that conclusion and stating it is less shameful than the acts of those who have repeatedly excused Sam's past bad behavior, which have allowed things to get to this point. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 08:39, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very well put. Sam Spade must be made to pay the consequences; someone must finally take him to arbitration before he is allowed to drive off other contributors. For instance, Sam Spade did more than any other contributor to generate hostility against me-- I think even more than fellow trolls Silverback and Netolithic-- leading me to leave Wikipedia as a regular contributor in March. I did not get the outpouring of support that El C has been getting, so I had no choice but to leave. But Sam Spade has a tendency to wear down his chosen enemies, so such support might prove unreliable for editors like El C, as it was for me, in the future. Thus, action against him needs to be taken sooner rather than later. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:04, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam isn't the only user with such a <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_Sandpit1_ebbf.html" title="User:TDC/Sandpit1">page</a>. Sure he might be the only one who has a page focused on admins instead of individuals, but to the individuals such pages are offensive and distressing. Should such pages be allowed on WP at all? Or would banning them be an unfair opression? The most harmful thing about such pages is that anyone who comes across them reads information out of context, and they only get one side of the story. Perhaps banning isn't such a bad thing when you consider that the information can always be saved outside of WP, and copied in if the user ever feels the need. Sam can also have anyone report "rogue admins" to him by e-mail. These pages really are just giant personal attacks, which we claim not to tollerate here. There is no point just deleting Sam's page; there will be others, and not just by him. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversmith_d59b.html" title="User:Silversmith"><font color="#A29EBA"><b>Silversmith</b></font></a> <small><a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESilversmith_89c3.html" title="User talk:Silversmith">Hewwo</a></small> 09:58, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My post above, calling for an apology from Sam to El C, got no reply from Sam or anybody else. I though it was important, so I'm putting in a headline there to focus the message and make it easier to find. Sam, I would really appreciate it if you took another look at that message. It's addressed to you, though I posted it here, to hopefully get community comments too. It's distressing to me to see you accuse a user of lying when he's obviously telling the truth. When he points out the facts, you ignore him, and you're ignoring me also, though I can't believe that's deliberate. I do understand that with all the comments about your "Rogue admin" page in different places, you haven't time or inclination to reply to it all, but I appeal to you to read my post again, and respond. I can't believe you're not going to apologize to El C. Higher up in this section, you express a value for "doing the honest thing", and the honest thing would be to have some human respect, if not for him, then for yourself. And for everybody listening, too. El C sounds about ready to leave the project, and you laugh in his face and offer a $50 donation? That makes me ashamed. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:14, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw it. I reject your characterization of the situation, and I most certainly will not apologize for the imagined slights. At the moment I am deciding between a short list of options, none of which involve groveling before those who have strove to make editing here unpleasant and unrewarding. Changes need made, and this situation is particularly indicative of that. Users and anons can be blocked with impunity, on the whim of a "Class A citizens", regardless of policy. While their wrongs are smoothed over with cronyism and corruption, my attempt to bring in the light of day is hounded and harried, apologies demanded for my impertinence.

<dd>My sense is that while the community does put some value in productive contributions, there isn't a linear relationship between productive work, and the amount of grief they are willing to put up with from someone. In other words, If they are willing to put up with X amount of grief from a new user (one with, say, 100 edits - let's call that unit an "Arb"), that doesn't mean that someone with 10,000 edits can get away with 100 Arbs of grief - it's more likely to be 10 or so. This pattern has been repeated with several users (e.g. Wik, although I'm not trying to say that this situation is exactly analogous to that one). This makes a certain amount of sense, from a practical point of view, given that we have lots of editors who put in less work, but also don't cause big scenes. It's a lot easier to put up with 10 low-key small-volume contributors than one editor who does a lot but also causes stress. I'm also going to point to what DAB says below, which I think is well put, and with which I basically concur. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:38, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The hate Sam club assumes the worst about Sam whenever he communicates. Even they admit this. He does return sarcasm and sardonic contempt to those who serve it up to him while claiming their sainthood. My advice&#160;: Try reading wit, humor, irony etc into what he says when you can and respond in the same vein. Try it. What do you have to lose? How many can see some of the above as dramatic irony? as poetic exaggeration? (<i>God help us all.</i>) Pathos? (<i>I expect to be banned at any moment.</i>) OK, now assume the worst - evil troll&#160;!!!! The choice of interpretation lies in your minds, fellow virtual citizens. One last thing. Many of us get along just fine with Sam. You lie when you claim otherwise. He often gives tit for tat. What does that say about the minority who get in these stupid back and forths with him? No that doesn't say great things for Sam either, but when I see a bunch of people, some with color of authority all ganging up on one guy, who is the bully and who is the bullied? 4.250.168.100 01:07, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correcto. I am not saying folks on the left and right cannot be good editors, all I am saying is that as a lefty editor who tries to be NPOV, I seem to incur the POV wrath of Sam Spade over political struggles. I cite a lefty Oxford University Press scholar, and Sam counters with material from some highly POV right-wing website diatribe, as if they were equivalent. In one case, out of pure frustration, I went and dug up legitimate conservatve scholarship to balance something I had inserted into the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">Political correctness</a> page.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 16:02, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>fwiiw, I'd like to appreciate Sam has returned to a plain vanilla sig. Sam is a decent editor <i>unless</i> he goes into "persecution mode" which, sadly, seems to be becoming his default mode. Sam has clearly abused signature customization in a disruptive and insulting manner. Sam should take note how much good it does anybody for him to shove his wikilawyering into everybody's face. Take the modest and unobtrusive route of a humble RfC, like everybody else, and try to accept that your concerns are not more important than other people's. Apologize if you really want to show style and grace, but it's also good enough to stop pretending that you are right all the time in the face of community opinion. Sam is not bullied by anyone. He has been shown an extraordinary amount of indulgence by the community seeing his often difficult behaviour (Which is to the credit of said community, I should add, I am not suggesting he should be shown less). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:10, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Speaking as someone who thought his old sig was utterly harmless (although I admittedly have a fondness for activist approaches to situations, which isn't popular on Wikipedia), I'd like to know what Sam has done that means we have shown extraordinary indulgence in letting him stay. In my experience, indulging our volunteers is not something we do very much of. I know he's been in some revert wars, but then so has everybody. I'd have to be convinced that he's done more harm than good. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:41, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Frankly, (and I've said this before, during my last adminship election / trial) if I've done more harm than good in my nearly two years, and over 20,000 edits (#158 in Article edits, #43 in total edits, as of 27 April 2005), I need to be banned FAST. If I've done more good than harm, on the other hand, i deserve WAY better treatment for all the volunteer work I've done here. The fact that I complain loud and long about fraud, waste and abuse <i>should</i> reflect positively on me, esp. when compared to how I respond to polite requests from friendly, well meaning contributors. Maybe <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a> would be willing to write an editorial for the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">signpost</a> on how the Wikipedia responds to <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistleblower.html" title="Whistleblower">whistleblowers</a>? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:31, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is that there are other users with a similar number of edits who don't cause this much upset, and you need to be comparing yourself with them. And I'm simply put aback by your comments about "fraud, waste and abuse"; how on earth is anyone making themselves rich from Wikipedia? If it was just colourful hyperbole, you show poor judgement in flinging this kind of term around in this atmosphere, and if you meant it seriously, this is the kind of over-the-top stuff that upsets people. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 05:21, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue with Sam Spade is his "persecution mode" where he loses his temper and becomes an aggressive and abusive bully. I am hardly the only vo;unteer editor who has experienced this version of his approach. When in "persecution mode" he does not engage in constructive collaborative editing, but engages in pointless conforntations, name calling, revert wars, and rewrites based on what he calls NPOV, and which are actually lifted from highly POV websites rather than material that tracks back to serious scholarship or reliable published material. If Sam Spade was sanctioned more often by Admins, with 24 or 48 hour suspensions, it is likely he would learn some anger management and the ratio of consructive editing to abusive disruption would shift in a positive direction. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 19:42, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The difference, I think, between Sam and the people he goes up against is that, occasionally, they intend to be funny. And I like that an anon whose been editing here for, oh, a day, suddenly leaps into what for a non-Wikipedian is a very esoteric debate.
