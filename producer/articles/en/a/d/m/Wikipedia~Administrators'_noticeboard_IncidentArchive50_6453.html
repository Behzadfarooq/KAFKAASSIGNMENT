<p><a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">User:Karmafist</a> recently blocked me, on a false allegation of vandalism. He continues to defend his actions, on this page (above) and various talk pages, adding further false allegations and ad hominem attacks. He reverted <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill%2C_Warwickshire_f364.html" title="Coleshill, Warwickshire">Coleshill, Warwickshire</a>, a page on which we disagreed, and which he had previously protected, to an old edit which included redundant links, having previously claimed that his suggested text was an agreed consensus, despite no such consesnus existing and despite me having sugegested a more accurate alternative; and he did so with personal abuse in his edit suammry. He further falsely accused me of breaching 3RR, but took no action against the efitor who actually did so. He has also falseley accused me of sending him threatening e-mail. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 11:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A simple analysis of the article's <a href="../../../c/o/l/Talk%7EColeshill%2C_Warwickshire_fd6a.html" title="Talk:Coleshill, Warwickshire">Talk Page</a> and its discussion leads me to believe otherwise, Andy. Karmafist treated you and the other involved part friendly and with respect, which unfortunately you didn't. You agreed yourself to the solution that was achieved through his mediation. You were fairly warned of breaking said consensus after engaging in an edit war and breaking 3RR. Most likely, I would have done the same as he did, given the situation.<br /></dd>
<dd>In my humble opinion, you've chosen the wrong approach. I'm positive that you believe your contributions to be correct, so there are other ways in which this matter can be solved. Gather a couple of sources to endorse your view, quote them and reference them at the article. That will strengthen you opinion. Talk with the parts involved; discuss and debate are positive. If you need help, I even offer myself to mediate between you and <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a>, and to achieve a more solid consensus. The whole issue isn't that serious to get so upset, dear. Karma has acted correctly as an admin, and I beg you, don't even think he has a personal dislike of you. It's all in the manner we propose our contributions that an agreement can be reached, and I know that sometimes we can all feel frustrated and get angry; we're only human. Calm down, relax, take a deep breath and let's build together. That's what we're all here for.

<p>It almost seems to me that you have it in for Karmafist, rather than the other way round. I'm afraid I dont see any personal attacks at the other end of those links you provided. As far as I can see, Karmafist has acted within policy. I attempted to mediate between you two and even then you were unco-operative. Also, please stop assuming everyone here is out to get you. Neither Shauri, nor Linuxbeak, Karmafist, or myself is trying to make you angry. Another thing, continuessly italasizing other people's comments and typos is considered impolite, and is exactly what one of your complaints of Karmafist were. <i><b><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes"><font color="darkblue">Ban</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes"><font color="darkblue">s</font></a></b></i> 13:56, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Karmafist called your editing "vandalism" once, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=26041144&amp;oldid=25991895" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=26041144&amp;oldid=25991895" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This was wrong, but incidentally: the only reason the word "vandalism" was included was that it is an automatic part of the standard {{test5}} block template. Karmafist also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=26449982&amp;oldid=26395075" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=26449982&amp;oldid=26395075" rel="nofollow">continued</a> calling you "Pigs" despite your wish to be called Andy Mabbett. You are reacting with aggression that is way out of proportion to such a tiny thing. In every other action Karmafist has been exemplary. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 14:53, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As with all banned users who try to edit Wikipedia, he is violating laws forbidding "unauthorised access to computer systems", which is a criminal offence in a great many places (I'm almost certain that this is so in the US, for instance; in the UK it is covered by the Computer Misuse Act 1992) - the fact that there aren't any technical measures in place to prevent this does not mean that it isn't such an access. Use of an ISP to aid criminal activities is absolutely not going to be within the AUP of an ISP ('cos otherwise they might be held liable).</dd>

<p>The discussion over the title of the <i><a href="../../../%C3%BA/b/e/%C3%9Abeda.html" title="Úbeda">Úbeda</a></i> article is deadlocked, but one or more users are trying to change the article themselves.

<dd>I hadn't spotted the anagrams (slow) but, with that, you were correct to block, IMHO. It's not really deadlocked, not with a 14 to 6 vote, but as one of the participants in the debate I'm not going to move it -- I'd rather leave the job to an outsider. This revert warring on the intro is, I think, independent of where the article ends up: Craticidi/Ozrag/Orgaz's arguments (same person as Kolokol?) seem to be with how to word the article's introduction, not its location (he/she/they haven't bothered voting). And until the whole diacrit question is settled, we can look forward to two, three, many such Việt Nams.

<p>While I think diacritics in English article titles are almost always unhelpful, I'm indifferent to this place name having one in its WP title if consensus swings that way. For me the problem is wholly with the tactics of the anagram socks, which should be resolved before the article is re-named (given the apparent consensus to do so). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The atrocious tactics of this vandal notwithstanding, it is long past time to rename the article back to <a href="../../../%C3%BA/b/e/%C3%9Abeda.html" title="Úbeda">Úbeda</a>. Note, this was in fact the original title until March 2005, when a five-day WP:RM vote was held with 6-3 in favor of renaming to <a href="../../../u/b/e/Ubeda.html" title="Ubeda">Ubeda</a>. The current vote has now lasted more than ten days and is currently 12-7 in favor of renaming back to the original title (and note, one of the original voters in the March WP:RM has changed his vote). The basis for moving the page back to its original title is thus at least as solid as the basis for moving it to the current title seven months ago, and there is little point letting the situtation fester. Could some admin kindly close the WP:RM and move the page without too much further delay.</dd>

<dd>It should be pointed out as well that not long after the original WP:RM vote a survey was held at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_b8b0.html#Proposal_and_straw_poll_regarding_place_names_with_diacritical_marks" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)">long-running survey on diacritic use</a>, and after 3 1/2 months there was a 70%-30% majority in favor of diacritics. The voting has continued and the majority is now just under 60%. There have been more than a hundred votes, plenty of discussion, and the survey has run more than six months. The goal of the survey was to establish some kind of global policy that would obviate the need for case-by-case voting at individual articles. Unfortunately, the existence of the prior WP:RM vote was claimed by some to overrule the global survey and a new WP:RM vote was demanded before renaming the page back to its original name. That WP:RM has now been held and is now running overtime well past its normal duration.</dd>

<p>Firstly, he has used IPs and phoney sockpuppet usernames to harrass one female user, accusing her of travelling to his house, stand outside and stalk him. (A complete fiction which upset the user.) He has posted personal attacks on over twenty talk pages on the basis that the victim of his attacks (me) had edited the pages. (He was originally banned for a year for stalking me.) He has also deleted a copyright violation notice, which could have had repercussions for wikipedia if his action meant that a potentially illegal image survived on wikipedia and left us open to a breach of copyright legal case. He has also used people's email links to spam users with unwanted messages.</p>
<p>Secondly, under Wikipedia rules a banned user cannot edit here. They are not allowed to so much a correct a spelling mistake. If bullyboy actions and threats allowed him to in effect overrule the arbcom ruling, and Jimbo who at one stage personally blocked him, then the arbcom would lose any power it has to control vandals and stalkers. You would be inviting a free-for-all in which people could vandalise what they want and stalk whomever they want in the knowledge that if they make themselves enough of a nuisance they'll be allowed to get away with it. The bottom line is simple: since September 2005 Skyring is <i>persona non grata</i> on Wikipedia and every edit he makes under any identity will be removed, without exception. Wikipedia has had to deal with similar assholes before, from <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">User:DW</a> to a host of others who have threatened the use of law, stalked people, abused people and vandalised articles. The DW case was a classic example. Everything he touched under his various identities was reverted or deleted, including a large number of articles. Eventually he got the message that he was banned and no longer welcome on Wikipedia, and left.

<p>Ok, calm down everyone!! I didn't mean that a plot is imminent, or that even one is fully planned. I just wanted to alert everyone that the people are getting in place to disrupt Wikipedia from their admin positions. The discussions that I saw involved a coordinated attack with blocking and re-blocking admins, massive file and image deletion, confusing page merges and vandalizing and locking the main pages. But nonetheless, even if this attack is still in the planning stages, these sleepers are still subtly disrupting Wikipedia by opposing obviously good young admin candidates, closing out AfD's against consensus, and defending/unblocking obvious trolls and disruptive editors.</p>
<p>I would also keep a <i>close eye</i> on the upcoming Arbcom elections this fall, especially on the newer faces in the race. Just a tip.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiphilosopher_a3eb.html" title="User:Wikiphilosopher">Wikiphilosopher</a> 13:55, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikiphilosopher, are all your friends quite so honorable? Infiltration is a two-way street. Not to mention, fundraising would raise a financial reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for such an attack. The post-9/11 security overreaction to anything resembling sleeper cells and carefully planned coordinated large-scale attacks is likely to be severe. The hypothetical attack you're describing would certainly get the attention of law enforcement and you'd be surprised how quickly chat transcripts and e-mails would be produced as if by magic.

<dd>By the way, the threat of loss of Internet connection can be a surprisingly effective deterrent. Most vandals use their ISP for other non-vandal activities and having to change e-mail address or explain to family members why the "Internet stopped working" (or worse yet, having to explain themselves to their school or employer) is not worth their while. In the case of anonymous IP vandals who use an IP range, ToSsing the vandal (reporting Terms of Service violation) is a viable option that should be tried a little more often and more systematically. I have an idea in mind for this: write a little script to extract contribution history and prepare a nicely formatted evidence page with all IPs and timestamps converted to the ISP's local timezone and display the ISP's abuse contact phone and e-mail (from ARIN or RIPE or APNIC), and then any user who's sufficiently motivated or annoyed by the vandal's conduct can take it upon themselves to contact the ISP and provide them with a link to the evidence page. I have a test case in mind. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Curps, please dont let this rub you wrong, but get a grip! Comparing what we're talking about to 9/11 is almost sickening. And your suggestion that the Department of Homeland Security would take <i>any</i> interest whatsoever in the possible hi-jinks of rouge editors and admins on Wikipedia is one sign that you perhaps need to re-evaluate your perceptions of the importance of this site. And David Gerard is right. Teenage/College-age bored computer kids will spend no small amount of time on here to acheive their prankster goals. (Not that it takes that much time, I mean, a good "sleeper" will have 10 edits a day, and over weeks that adds up. It should only take 30 mins a day, and even less with a high speed internet connection, which most college campuses offer now).<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiphilosopher_a3eb.html" title="User:Wikiphilosopher">Wikiphilosopher</a> 17:39, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Wikiphilosopher, my apologies for expressing myself poorly. I am in no way comparing the gravity and tragedy of 9/11 with vandalism of Wikipedia. Here's what I'm saying: post-9/11, there is a tendency among law enforcement to overreact to any perceived threat ("not on my watch" syndrome). Nowadays, people who crack jokes about having a bomb in their luggage at the airport aren't just removed from flights, in a few cases some have actually served short prison sentences... for cracking a joke.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anything to do with sleeper cells waking up to conduct coordinated mass attacks (reminiscent of al-Qaeda tactics) will automatically involve great suspicion... law enforcement would find it hard to believe that so many months of planning and effort and preparation would go into merely disrupting Wikipedia, and would probably consider that it was a dress rehearsal for attacks on far more vital computing infrastructure. They would spend a lot of time and effort investigating, and they <i>hate</i> to do that and walk away empty-handed. Even if they found there was nothing to it but vandalizing Wikipedia, they would file charges for <i>something</i>, make a big case out of it and make it stick.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since Wikipedia is based in the US, American prosecutors and law enforcement would get involved. If anyone's unfamiliar with the American system, district attorneys (prosecutors), attorneys general, and even the local sheriff's office are very often elected positions, and are stepping stones for higher political office (consider <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Giuliani_d5f0.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_Spitzer_3963.html" title="Eliot Spitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a>). For such people, a high-profile case can be a godsend, a golden opportunity to be seized, a chance to get camera time and media exposure at press conferences and establish a reputation for expertise in new emerging areas such as cyberspace. There are a lot of excessively ambitious type-A personalities out there looking for their big break, something that could advance their career or make their career.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A hypothetical massive attack on Wikipedia that resulted in more than a few days' downtime would be very widely discussed in the blogosphere. There's a relatively new phenomenon of blogs keeping a story alive and reviving it after it's been forgotten or ignored by the traditional media (consider the political downfall of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_Lott_dcd8.html" title="Trent Lott">Trent Lott</a>), and that would apply here. Also, I guarantee you that a five-figure reward would be raised for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the culprits, which would generate more buzz in its own right. News producers for the mainstream media are always looking for a story, law enforcement and prosecutorial officers are always looking for a high-profile case, and if one or more take the bait you'd be surprised how fast the thing could snowball under the right circumstances. If criminal records result from silly youthful pranks that perhaps didn't merit it, well, it wouldn't be the first time that's happened.</dd>

<p>all I can see here is Wikiphilosopher trying to make himself seem important or interesting. This is all childish. So some kids try to damage wikipedia. How is that new? Rogue admins will be de-adminned quickly. If we get admins who are not really rogues but just turn out to be generally trollish, we'll need a de-admining procedure to de-admin people with whom the community is fed up. Nickptar is right, we may need bureaucrats to be able to de-admin, so <i>hypothetical</i> vandal-admins can be quickly dealt with. How the sybillic comments of Wikiphilosopher have any bearing on this is beyond me. Anyone can create an account and claim to be in the know about serious complots.

<p>I think we should take heed of what David Gerard said. He knows this site and its characters better than just about anyone. Anyway, I should tell more about the "sleeper troll" admins that I know of. Just look for admins that:</p>
<ul>
<li>whose accounts are about 6 months old</li>
<li>are between 17-20 years old or so</li>
<li>whose vast majority of edits have been to talk pages and Wikipedia non-article space</li>
<li>who lack substantial article contributions, or whose article contributions mostly consist of minor edits</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributions of this kind allow the user to keep a high edit count and get his name known through community interaction without actually having to contribute much time or substance to Wikipedia.

<dd>Wikiphilosopher, you are right that Wikipedia does not (yet?) have the importance that many of us hope it will have in the future, and I have a realistic understanding of this. It's not the importance of the target, it's the alleged tactics that would get attention. This would be the equivalent of <a href="../../../t/p/_/TP_0a41.html" title="TP">TPing</a> the school principal's house, except then you find out that the vandals rented office space, trucks, and a warehouse full of industrial supplies and conducted months of reconnaissance and preparation, got jobs in the local police department, etc. You'd wonder, why the implausibly elaborate planning and more importantly, if they're willing to go that far, what else are they planning in the future? Your "step back and reconsider how important" advice would best apply to anyone who would spend months of their lives to plan such a scheme with nothing to gain. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:16, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So, any block against an IP of more than 24 hour duration is in reality just a 24 hour block?

<dd>I have no idea why the IP wouldn't be staying blocked, but the passage you quoted says when a <i>username</i> is blocked indefinitely, the IP autoblock associated with its username will only stay blocked for 24 hours.

<dd>Someone who knows the deeper working of MediaWiki bugs may be more help, but I've noticed a few anecdotal comments about a double block bug. These, from memory appeared to indicate an occasional need to lift all such blocks if they have been doubled up on, and then re-block just once. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:04, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>From my own experience IPs that are blocked should stay blocked for the specified duration. The 24 hour thing is only for IP autoblocks associated with blocks on usernames. My guess would be it's a doubleblock bug, or perhaps they were somehow unblocked... - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:38, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's not a double block problem; the user was blocked for 1 month, and made edits after that point (as noted above) before Drini placed the second, 24 hour block. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:21, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I compared the IP's contributions and block log, and found that in every case but two, the IP has not edited before the expiry of the block. In the first case, he/she made two edits to the IP's talk page; the software permits blocked IPs and users to do this, so it's nothing to worry about. The second case involves the 1-month block. It seems that at some point shortly before or after the IP was blocked, a user logged in from the same IP, was blocked, and triggered the autoblocker on his IP. When the autoblock expired after 24 hours, the 1-month block expired as well, since at the conclusion of the shortest block, all other blocks are always cleared. Everything appears to be working as intended. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 20:38, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That particular IP has been problematic, harrassing NickBush24, who attends the same university. I discussed it with Nick, who blieves he may know who the vandal is. My guess is that Nick (and any other legit contributor from that university) probably is assigned that IP on occasion, and that is tripping up our blocks. I'm monitoring it, as Nick's page is a pretty frequent target of vandalism, so if I see any problems, I'll clear out the blocks and set a new one. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><b>Essjay</b></a> <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA">·</a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 21:15, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So a blocked IP can log into a registered account, access a page, and trip the 24 autoblock on his IP thus clearing a longer duration block?

Since there is a project underway to delete unsourced images, this is of particular concern.

<p>So I <i>think</i> this is some kind of clickfarming, as (despite its name) ccbill.com doesn't appear to be concerned with credit card billing. I'd recommend folks seeing similar domain-name changes do a dig/whois to see if the old name and the new one really are operated by the same folks. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 19:18, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is not what happened. skyring targeted my page for repeat attacks. A host of users were involved in reverting the attacks. At one stage 18 sockpuppets attacks in 2 hours. I appreciated all the defence. I thought however that it was wrong to put users constantly in the position of protecting my page from Skyring attacks. After discussing it with Wikipedians off Wikipedia (discussions on Wikipedia are invariably gatecrashed by Skyring and his sockpuppet family — at one stage he was using a sockpuppet to defend himself, then reponding openly as himself —) I decided to protect it to take the pressure of users. Re Violetriga's comments, I replied privately by email and as the communications were private I removed the comment of my page, and explained to her the reasons why. Because she did not know what the page was protected I added in the vprotected template. It was not intended in any way to suggest that I was either censoring her comments or that her edit was vandalism, and she understands that. Users who have been at the receiving end of Skyring's stalking — and his behaviour has driven some people from Wikipedia. He level of nuttiness can be seen in the fact that he picked on an innocent user, began harrassing her and accused her of physically stalking outside his house and stalking <i>him</i>! — understand exactly what has been going on. Khaosworks clearly doesn't. Maybe unlike many others he never noticed. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="background-color: orange"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></font></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 19:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

<dd>These "repeat attacks" were me placing a message on your talk page, asking for your assistance in resolving our differences. OK, it was wrong of me to persevere if you didn't want to discuss those issues, and from this day forward I won't raise them again, despite how upset I was at the time. I won't ask you to forgive and forget, but can you find it in your heart to move forward on this?

<dd>Page protection exists for a limited set of purposes. <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">The protection policy</a> lists only three for temporary protection: edit wars, persistent vandalism, and software bugs. It moreover cautions that "[t]alk pages and user talk pages are not protected as a rule, except in extreme circumstances." There doesn't seem to be any discussion anywhere I can find about extending page protection to authorize administrators to protect their own user talk pages at will. So yes, this seems to be a use of admin powers for a purpose beyond administrator duties. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While it is true that Skyring, while banned, is not allowed to do any editing on Wikipedia, it should be pointed out that if he just made a few spelling corrections while editing from an IP address, nobody would know that it was Skyring, and nobody would go back and revert them. The problem is that he's not content to make just a few spelling corrections – it's his behaviour towards Jtdirl that identifies him. Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 02:37, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You will need to revert all of his edits and make them yourself (which should keep you busy enough anyway); merely rubberstamping isn't good enough since his edits <i>may not stand</i>. Otherwise we have to fight over whether a banned user's edits can or cannot be reverted on an edit-by-edit basis. Then, you'll have to work out whether each of his IPs is an open proxy, as many are, and indefintely block each of them. You will at times need to apply range blocks to non-open proxies to prevent him editing in the first place. You'll also need to determine which new accounts are his, block them, revert their edits and make them yourself. You'll need to tolerate the stalking and threats that come with doing all thist.

<dd>Well, if somebody was to leave me in charge, I'd say if someone's making good contributions, or even if only 2/3rds of their contributions are good, let them edit and ignore the suspicions.

<dd>But that is not his intent, Everyking. It is his malice which identifies him and which belies any claim that he simply wants to make "good edits". If he truly wanted, he could edit Wikipedia and we would be none the wiser. However, he wants blood: he edits here not because he has Wikipedia’s interests at heart, but because he wants to hit back at those who he deems responsible for his sanction by the ArbCom. Essentially, he refuses to accept responsibility for the actions that saw him punished. He is incapable of recognising his own faults, and thus seeks to invent or exaggerate those of others. Skyring is a bully and should not be tolerated.

Now, if Skyring were to correct spelling <i>and</i> explicitly harass Jtdirl, he should be blocked &amp; the harassment reverted &amp; his ban reset, but I see no reason to <b>damage the articles</b> by reverting the spelling corrections, or to take the exceedingly pointless action of reverting the corrections and then making them yourself. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 12:24, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that it would set a bad precedent allowing a hard-banned contributor to continue to edit "constructively" without modification of the ban (I understand that <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">the infamous Michael</a> managed to rehabilitate himself but there was a long carefully-managed process to it).

<dd>Wikipedia is full of "bad precedents" if you look for them. When you get down to bedrock, Wikipedia is a website with a bunch of people wondering how to cope with the demand and build for the future and while they are doing that, newcomers are laying down avenues, planting trees, raising barns, consecrating cathedrals and marking out circles in the sand for the two guys who are fighting over where to put the bull-ring. It's being built faster than it's being planned. The whole lot is jerry-built and it's a testament to co-operation that we've managed to get this far.</dd>
<dd>Forget the rules. Ignore all rules. It's just a website, not a religion, not a government, not a court of law. It's a website that allows anyone to edit.</dd>
<dd>What works is consensus. This community talks about issues, explores options, tries solutions and finds mechanisms that work. Common sense eventually prevails, even if it takes a few rounds in the bull-ring for the crowd to see who is in the right, rather than who has the bigger balls.</dd>
<dd>What's more important to Wikipedia? Encouraging constructive edits or enforcing website rules? Because when you get down to it, there is no "hard-banning". Wikipedia allows anybody to edit, and the world is full of Internet cafes. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummeryWarm_e7fe.html" title="User:SummeryWarm">SummeryWarm</a> 16:41, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The chief problem is not that Skyring keeps coming back to fix typos. Quite frankly, if he <i>did</i> take the opportunity to accept a clean slate and contribute productively, most people probably wouldn't be troubled by that. Further, nobody here–save for David Gerard–would have any way of knowing it was him again.</dd>
<dd>The problem is that Skyring was banned for harrassing stalking other editors (primarily Jtdirl). By following Jtdirl around and editing articles immediately after Jtdirl does, each new Skyring account is announcing "I'm still here; you can't get rid of me; I'll follow you around as much as I like and you can't do anything about it." In other words, it was the stalking which got Skyring banned in the first place, and it is the continued stalking that identifies each new Skyring sock.</dd>
<dd>Simply put, Skyring would be welcome if he were to use <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a>–or practically any other method besides Jtdirl's contributions list–to find articles with typos. While he continues to follow Jtdirl, he and his edits are barred. To do otherwise is to announce "As long as you're making productive edits, it's okay to harrass our other editors, ignore the ArbCom, and be an asshole." <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:17, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at the evidence, Skyring <b>is</b> using Random Page (or some other idiosyncratic method) to find articles to edit. jtdirl then comes along, reverts a good edit and blocks the account. Look at jtdirl's contributions and examine the history of the articles he's revert-warring. His edits <b>follow</b> Skyring's.

<p>I see that jtdirl has commenced editing for his usual session. Before this degenerates into yet another lame edit war (and I admit my obsessive behaviour is no better than anyone else's) can I ask that we both put aside our differences and find some way of co-existing that allows us both to make productive edits?</p>
<p>I would like to make a public apology to jtdirl for causing him distress. He is a good editor and this foolish conflict is a waste of his time. And mine, for what it's worth. I admit to being a pedantic prick, but I fancy that there is room for me to make good edits here, and I would like more than anything else here to find a solution.

<p>There are many other people who should also be apologised to for what they were put through. Your comments about Nixie were uncalled for, as were comments accusing Nickptar of being part of a "crusade of hatred" against you. Other users too suffered personal abuse and villification. Users left Wikipedia because of their experiences. I am perfectly willing to accept your apology. Please respect the decision of the arbcom. They alone can decide your status on here. They can ban and unban. Please respect their decision on behalf of the community. And when you are back, whether in the short term or after the year ban (whichever their decision is), respect other users and don't engage in the sort of conduct that led to your ban. You clearly have a lot of ability. Show that ability, and not scorn, to the Wikipedia community. To show good faith, please don't edit any more articles until either the ban ends or it is ended. That, more than words, would show that you want to work with, and not against, the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="background-color: orange"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></font></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 20:01, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<p>I did that earlier tonight. However remember that what was imposed by the arbcom was a ban, not a block. (Bans are implemented by blocks, but operate under different rules.) A standard block for, for example breaching 3RR, means that a user is blocked from editing articles for the duration of the block. They may however access their talk page and edit it, a decision taken after a debate on the issue some time ago. A ban however is a <i>ban from the website</i>, which means that for the duration of a ban <i>no</i> part of the website, and that includes one's own talk page, can be edited. Edits of a banned user's talk page by the banned user itself amounts to a breach of the ban and so triggers its renewal. It is of course open to the arbcom either to recind the ban, or to rephrase it to allow you to edit the talk page though that is problematical as a talk page is technically the property of the account so if the account is banned from use for a set period technically the talk page is too. But I'm sure it is an option that can be considered by them.</p>
<p>Banned and blocked users are explicitly prohibited from editing pages using secondary accounts because that act is seen as circumventing the ban or block imposed and so implicitly undermining the principles behind bans and blocks. In the case of bans (or what used to be called <i>hard bans</i>) longstanding precedent is that <i>all</i> edits by a secondary accounts are reverted on sight, because irrespective of quality their existence breaches a ban. In one case of a user <i>hard banned</i>, when he created a large number of new articles (all lists) they were all instantly deleted without debate by admins at the time, and his edits weren't simply reverted but in some cases deleted from the records. <i>That</i> was the reason for the reversions of your edits. It wasn't because they were by you, but that they were by <i>a</i> banned user who by definition was breaching the ban imposed by the arbcom by every edit. The same has been done to other secondary accounts of blocked or banned users. Such actions do not indicate that the edit is factually bad, but that the edit itself is invalid because it breaches the terms of the block or ban. If reverts aren't made it sends the message that a blocked user isn't <i>really</i> blocked and a ban by Jimbo or the arbcom isn't really a ban.</p>
<p>BTW the use of a secondary account is perfectly OK under Wikipedia rules under two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>they are not being used to circumvent a block or ban (ie, the user with the secondary account is not banned or blocked)</li>
<li>they are not used to distort (ie, not used by a user to have multiple votes, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, you seem convinced that I was using a secondary user account.I never have done so deliberately. I only ever used another name once and that was by accident; my flatmate at the time also used my computer to edit Wikipedia. He had logged me off and logged himself in once, then left the computer. I came back, did edits as what I thought was myself and then discovered I was in as him. That was two years ago.</p>
<p>To edit on Wikipedia you'll need to get the clearance of the arbcom. Only they or Jimbo can vary or recind the existing one year ban. The chances of doing so would be increased if until that happens to obey the ban they imposed. They were extremely annoyed at the breaches of the ban and said so quite plainly in various places. You need to reassure them that you are genuine in your desire to come back and work as part of the community rather than war with it. If they are satisfied with your bona fides I certainly won't stand in the way. But I won't pretend to be happy at the treatment you gave me, the comments you made about me, or your treatment of other honorable users like Nixie.</p>

<dd>If something is deleted, and then reappears in exactly the same form, I think it should be a candidate for speedy deletion. However, if someone recreates something in a different format, perhaps we should run it through the vot again. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 08:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criteria for speedy deletion do not specify how long does it take after the voting before the issue can be discussed again. I decided that, since more than 4 months have passed and most of the arguments against the template were proved absurd since then, recreation of the template is no harm to wikipedia. Especially that several wikipedians find the template useful and nice, and I don't see a reason why not to let them use it. Also, at the talk page of the template I explained why it is not eligible for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 10:15, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, Chris' allegations that I migrated the template to the commons in order to circumvent the voting are both wrong and offensive since they assume my bad will. I believe an apology would be in place. In reality the template was <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Support&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Support&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">created in commons in May</a> by <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">User:OldakQuill</a> and, as can be seen in history section, I had no influence over it whatsoever. Moreover, the usage of this template in voting on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Featured_picture_candidates" class="extiw" title="commons:Featured_picture_candidates">commons' FPC</a> is obligatory. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 10:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Policy is quite clear on this. If something is substantially identically recreated, under any title, it is a speedy.

There's no statute of limitations, at least not by any precedent I can locate. DRV will generally allow a re-run of the AfD on an article is much time has passed and something has happened in the intervening period to make a difference to the deletion. In the case of this template, I don't see how any length of time will make a difference.

<dd>A significan time has passed and I don't see how the arguments you use cannot be used to prove my point as well. Anyway, the criteria for speedy deletion do not mention such situation, in which case the vote should be repeated if someone really want it to be deleted or believes that wikipedia can only benefit from not allowing its users to use this template.

<dd>Actually, the problem is deeper. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">User:AndriyK</a> came to Wikipedia recently and immediately started the crusade to rename things from names they are known in English to the modern Ukrainian names. While a couple of renames he made were correct, the rest weren't and were reverted by consensus. He persistently reintroduces them antagonizing everyone at Wikipedia. He was spared by me from 3RR ban (now I regret that). Most disgustingly, he continued his crusade outside wikipedia at internet forums where he started an unspeakable campaign of slander and smear against established users and seaking for more hands to help him in reverts wars. The latter resulted, so far, in two sockpuppet accounts already (user:Geminifromukraine and user:MaryMaidan ). For more, check <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndriyK_309a.html" title="User talk:AndriyK">his</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/p/User_talk%7EIrpen_8b93.html#Discussion_on_maidanua.org" title="User talk:Irpen">my</a> talk pages as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=AndriyK" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=AndriyK" rel="nofollow">his contributions</a>. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:45, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I do not change the name that are known in English.

There was no conflict related to this my mistake.) Other my corrections either conform with creadible sources (like Encyclopaedia Britannica) or are not famouse enough to have common English names. All my corrections conform the WP guidelines concerning geographic names.</dd>
<dd>I have no connection to any sockpuppet accounts. User <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> lies.</dd>
<dd>I indeed used forum to urge people to joint Wikipedia team to improve Ukraine-related content of the resource and to make the information more neutral and balanced.</dd>
<dd>There is a groop of users that tries to use Wikipedia as propaganda machine by inserting information to articles that is not confirmed by any sources and serves etirely for propaganda purposes. I indeed informed the forum readers about such facts and provided detailed examples of unverified information and propaganda. I believe, I have a right to fight agains abuse of Wikipedia in such a way.</dd>
<dd>There was no slander frome my side. All what I wrote at the forum can be confirmed by analysis of article histories.</dd>
<dd>In contrast, user <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> tried several times to misinform other users and admins. I can provide examples.</dd>
<dd>I contributed to Wikipedia by writing a new article about <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volhynians.html" title="Volhynians">Volhynians</a>, by expandig essentially the section <b>Origin</b> in the article <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian language</a>, and section <b>De-Russification</b> in the article <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainization.html" title="Ukrainization">Ukrainization</a>.

<li>It seems that admins have different opinions on the matter. Some would block an account indefinitely right away if the only edits are vandalism. Others admins would give the account a second chance (especially if they suspect that the user is either a child who does not know any better or someone who might have a mental/physical disability)... but only a second chance. I personally go on a case by case basis. In this particular case, because this person created a sock puppet and blatantly vandalised user pages with attack messages, I would lean towards infinite blocks. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 18:38, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Judge the person:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has this editor done absolutely nothing that isn't clear, solid, absolute vandalism?</li>
<li>Or is this editor an absolutely solid waterproof sock of such a vandal?</li>
</ol>
<p>If there's any doubt, don't ever block indefinitely.</p>
<p>If it's an IP (and I erred considerably on this myself in the early days) never block indefinitely without solid evidence. A few minutes is enough to stop most vandals, and the few really determined vandals will use proxies anyway. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:46, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

They're protected. A vandalbot lies in wait for them to be unprotected, and then as soon as that happens (within a very short time) it reverts to an earlier version, using a throwaway username. We've been through this cycle quite a few times already.</p>
<p>As a taunting gesture, the throwaway usernames are usually <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anagram.html" title="Anagram">anagrams</a> of any user who reverts it. Similar tactics have been used at a few other articles.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that this is a bot (its reaction times are too quick).</p>
<p>Unless we are willing to settle for these articles to be permanently protected (and any other articles the vandalbot takes a fancy to), we should take a more proactive approach.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <b>I am hereby asking David Gerard to publicly reveal the IP addresses</b> used by the vandalbot sockpuppets for all edits to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> within the past week or so.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#Policy_on_release_of_data_derived_from_page_logs" class="extiw" title="m:Privacy_policy">Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy</a>, data in the server logs can be released under certain circumstances, including (item 5):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targetting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So this would be entirely in accordance with the existing privacy policy.</p>
<p>This option (publicly <b>r</b>evealing <b>IP</b> or <i>rIPping</i> a vandal) should not be used lightly, but should be available as an option in cases of the most disruptive vandalism that threatens the foundation of how Wikipedia works (and causing articles to be permanently protected certainly qualifies). This would serve as an alternative (or perhaps a supplement) to the earlier controversial proposal to give more users checkUser privilege, but with the crucial difference that the privacy of ordinary users (and even garden-variety vandals) would be as secure as before. Also see some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_34#.22Rip.22ping_and_ToSsing_major_.28Willy-style.29_vandals" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_34#.22Rip.22ping_and_ToSsing_major_.28Willy-style.29_vandals" rel="nofollow">earlier discussion</a>).</p>
<p>As provided for in the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, the IP information could serve as the basis for "ToSsing" the vandal (report a Terms of Service violation to the vandal's ISP). As things currently stand, this can only be done by David Gerard or developers, and they are often overworked and have little time to do the grunt work of drawing up an evidence page with links and timestamps and IP addresses and liaising with ISP's abuse contacts. If the IPs are public, however, this grunt work can be delegated to a "ToS committee" consisting of ordinary users (without checkuser privilege).</p>
<p>I believe that rIPping and ToSsing vandals can be a useful tool in deterring some persistent vandals. Note we would <i>not</i> be asking the ISPs to reveal the identity of the vandal — the worst consequence would be being dropped as a customer by the ISP, and that would be at the ISP's discretion. The ISP could also simply choose to issue a notification or warning to their customer. Note that many vandals use also their ISP accounts for everyday non-vandal Internet use, and the threat of potentially losing a longstanding e-mail address or having to explain loss of Internet connection to family members can be an effective deterrent.</p>
<p>Note, the above applies to disruptive vandals who use sockpuppets. However, in the case of vandals who use an anonymous IP range, the "rIP" part isn't necessary, the IP information is already publicly available and we can proceed directly to the "ToSs". I have a test case in mind, a "censorship" vandal who has been deleting sections from model-related articles on an almost daily basis since May and has ignored (and deleted) HMTL comments inserted into the articles warning him to stop and threatening to report him to his ISP. Since he has called the bluff, it seems necessary to followup.</p>

<dd>A range of anonymous IP addresses, like for instance 69.235.128.0 to 69.235.255.255. In the case of disruptive logged-in sockpuppets, we'd need the IPs to be revealed (rIP) in order to do effective ToS followup; however, in the case of disruptive vandals who use anonymous IP, we already have the publicly available IP information. So even while the "rIP" proposal is being debated we can go ahead and do the "ToS" part for anonymous IP vandals. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:55, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the overall idea is "vandal accountability", and sometimes that should mean stepping outside the sphere of Mediawiki software functionality and into the real-world sphere. Even if we can't cover all the bases yet, we should at least take some readily attainable steps.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, if it's Wik, he's escalating. Supposedly, he limited his earlier vandalism to admin-related pages in the Wikipedia space, which some claimed was a (warped?) way of showing his concern for Wikipedia and trying to get it to change its policies according to his prescriptions. But now he's using vandalbots for petty editwarring and reverting, not any kind of grand principles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes I'm a bit concerned that the highest levels at Wikipedia are not a little more involved in day-to-day operational issues and preserving the basis of how Wikipedia operates and the integrity of its contents. It doesn't do much good to be guardians of abstract philosophical principles when those principles can be circumvented without consequences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can we contract a third-party open-proxy blocking service? Surely Wikipedia isn't the first or only website to cope with this issue. Nearly all online forums that allow users to post comments have to deal with the growing issue of comment spam, and open proxies for comment spam are part of the same issue as open relays for e-mail spam. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:09, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incorrect.

<dd>The fact remains that Wikipedia does not call this country (simply) <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a></i>, because that is the name of a region spanning several countries - of which the denar is the currency of only one. The reason that we have <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">United States dollar</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_dollar.html" title="American dollar">American dollar</a> is that there are other countries that can and do call themselves <i>American</i>.

<dd>The World Bank would appear to disagree with you Theathenae. Macedonian denar is this currency's name. Why don't we move <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euro</a> to EU Euro?

<dd>Is Zen Master on probation for all articles, or just those that relate to "race and intelligence"? It isn't clear from the arbitration ruling.

<dd>Hm&#160;:) Guess this makes me a rouge admin. In all honesty, I looked at the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Admin_enforcement_requested_3ca6.html#Zen-master" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Admin enforcement requested">admin enforcement requests</a> page for Zen-master and and found: "Should any sysop feel that it is necessary that Zen-master be banned from an article where they are engaged in edit warring," and so assumed it was for any article. I'm quite surprised that Zen-master didn't contest it or point me to that decision. If anyone feels it was improper, I guess we should lift the ban, whatever, I'd like some more admin input now. But I do think going back to apply a 3RR block would be improper now, as Zen-master has stopped edit warring, thinking he was banned from the article. (And my "ever gone into effect" was meant to mean I can't see that a banning from an article has ever been done. Has it?) <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:09, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Well, it may look like edit warring I admit, but when I try to make changes/improvements I am often thwarted. My talk page discussion points are misdirected away from or ignored.

<b>Dear Admins</b>, please have a look at the article on <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral_ec25.html" title="St Volodymyr's Cathedral">St Volodymyr's Cathedral</a>. Less than two weeks ago this was a nicely-written article about the Cathedral, about the architecture, mosaics, frescoes, the history how the Cathedral was built etc. (see the last version of 00:03, 20 October 2005 by Mzajac <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=25962321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=25962321" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>)</p>
<p>At 15:06, 22 October 2005 <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">User:Kuban kazak</a> decided to use this preaty neutral and nice article to push his POV that is far from being neutral (see his contribution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;diff=26189124&amp;oldid=25962321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;diff=26189124&amp;oldid=25962321" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>). This stared a long-lasting edit war.</p>
<p>Even if his insertion were neutral (this was definitelly not the case) this is a serious question whether it is legal to use architecture, art, music etc. articles for advertising (or bringing attention to) political issues. Does it improve the Wikipedia content? Does it make the work of editors more productive? Is it not an abuse of Wikipedia for propaganda purposes?</p>
<p>It looks like this is a more broad issue. Inserting political stuff into initially quite neutral, nice and polpular articles is quite common in Wikipedia. I admit that the question is not simple. Sometimes political stuff is important and the article looks incomplete without it. But in most cases the politiocal stuff is irrelevant and just force the reader to spend time for reading the information s/he was not actually looking for. In my opinion, a serious discussion is needed.</p>

<dd>Yes I did originally wrote the article in hope that someone would water it down, which is what happened. Next since when can articles about buildings and structures cannot have references to events which proved quite important in later development in history, in our case the religious situation in Ukraine.

<li>Agriculture was blocked for creating a sockpuppet in order to (a) evade a negative reputation earned through repeated uncivil behavior (his contribution history is full of it, including plastering "FUCK YOU" and "SCREW YOU" in 30 point bold across his user page, and that's just for starters) and (b) create a false appearance of community support for sanctions against another editor in an RfC. These are both impermissible uses of multiple accounts. Radiant!, it was inappropriate of you to unblock Agriculture in this case without first consulting with David Gerard.

<li>I disagree with the first point, and so does <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">our sockpuppet policy</a> - if someone has a bad reputation and wishes to start fresh, that would hardly be an inappropriate reason for a new account.

<li>Radiant!, the sockpuppet policy in no way supports the use of sockpuppets to escape a negative reputation, although it does not explicitly forbid it. However, it <b>does</b> explicitly forbid using sockpuppets "for purposes of deception, or to create the illusion of broader support for a position."

<li>The fact that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheChief_2391.html" title="User:TheChief">User:TheChief</a> was the same editor was cogent information to reader's of that accounts output, and the accounts relationship was not explained before it was discovered by DG, which is classic sockpuppet behaviour.

<li>I've no objection to either block (<i>if</i> the allegation is true).

However, what is the evidence for sockpuppetry? <a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">Agriculture</a> denies it, and without evidence we should 'assume good faith'.

<li>I am willing to contemplate that possibility that TheChief is a meatpuppet, rather than a sockpuppet, recruited and directed by Agriculture to bolster his case against Tony. However, the use of meatpuppets to accomplish a goal which would prohibited if accomplished by sockpuppets is also prohibited by the sockpuppet policy Radiant! so kindly linked earlier. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 18:40, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I think not.

<dd>Plus edits in support of Agriculture in many other places.

<li>David Gerard says (on the RFC) that he did an IP check. Doc Glasgow raises a good point though when he asks <i>why</i>, since I have not seen vandalism, personal attacks or disruption from <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheChief_2391.html" title="User:TheChief">User:TheChief</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 19:14, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why not? Signing an RFC twice is not acceptable.

<ul>
<li>Because it's circular reasoning. Sockchecks should only be made with valid cause <i>before</i> the check, and that the RFC was signed twice by the same person is only apparent <i>after</i> the check. The reason I'm somewhat skeptical here is that in an unrelated case less than two weeks ago, somebody accused David of sockchecking without proper cause. I'm not saying that there's truth to that accusation because I don't know, but in these two cases I would appreciate it if David would explain his view. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:44, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why should sockchecks only be made with valid cause before the check?

<ul>
<li>And if the check doesn't turn up bad behaviour, all David has to do is fail to disclose the fact that he checked, and nobody ever knows- in other words, you're advocating that he should have the ability to check any of our IP addresses for <i>no reason whatsoever</i>.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 23:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>There are serious problems with that way of doing things. It can be safely assumed, for instance, that a certain percentage of sockpuppets do get through the checks and manage post to RFC/AfD/RFA-style debates. Now, catching those people would be good; but if we create a relatively small group of users and empower them to perform checks based entirely on their own judgement, then that will have a lopsided effect on debates that those users are involved in. Users are human; when involved in a contentious debate, even the most careful person is naturally going to be faster to spot signs of sockpuppetry from people they disagree with. This becomes even more problematic when combined with the risk of false positives. I've had several nasty run-ins with sockpuppeteers myself, and I certainly think there needs to be policies in place to catch them, but there also needs to be <i>transparency</i> in enforcing those policies. At the very least, there should be a requirement that users be informed when they've been checkuser'd, with the name of whoever checkusered them and the complete justification for the check, just like with blocking. This is only fair, since it gives them a chance to take issue with it if they feel it was inapproprate; possibly there could even be a requirement to inform them beforehand. There should probably also be public checkuser logs of some form, if there aren't already. But most importantly, there needs to be firmer policies indicating when a sockpuppet check <i>is</i> approprate. The only explaination I've heard from David Gerard so far is that an ArbCom member requested it; while that is enough to satisfy the bare minimum of our privacy policy, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of allowing ArbCom to request IP checks outside of their normal duties in resolving cases, at least without providing any warning or explaination. They were appointed and elected to serve as a final court of appeal, not a vigilante. Maybe we do want them to serve as a vigilante (to some extent, admins are already supposed to do that, and it does seem to work out); but there should be more discussion of it first. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 00:12, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can you set out non-specific details that would lay some doubts to rest? Obviously you can't say which city the IPs originate from, but how large (to the nearest million, or the nearest hundred thousand if less than a million) is it? If both IPs are from Toronto or London, for example, that doesn't say as much; if both are from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parma%2C_Ohio_fdad.html" title="Parma, Ohio">Parma, Ohio</a>, then it's a bit more suspicious. Again it's obvious that you can't say exactly where the IPs came from, but was one from somewhere (corporate office, institution, whatever) that's probably a workplace and the other from an ISP that provides home service? None of this is personally identifiable data, so there should be no problem with releasing it.</li>
<li>I have yet to see evidence that CheckUser has been abused, here or elsewhere, but the fact of conflict between the checker and the checkee in this case indicates a need for greater scrutiny, in my opinion. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 01:06, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Er, <i>what</i> conflict between the checker and the checkee? I had thankfully very little interaction with Agriculture before this. What did you have in mind? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 14:20, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It seems to me that two contributors with near-identical edit patterns from the same city, one coming through a home ISP the other through a work ISP is kind of a slam-dunk case regardless of the city. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:10, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes indeed, but the main overlap between their contributions relates to a conflict with Tony Sidaway—and just look at how many people have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Tony_Sidaway_2_7aba.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway 2">commented</a> on that. If the city is a large one, it's quite conceivable that two people from it could both take similar positions on an issue; that's why I'm asking. (And, to be clear, my doubts about sockpuppetry are not strong, but I do want to see a <i>little</i> bit more evidence before making a decision one way or another.) —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 01:26, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, actually, that's not the main overlap. There is substantial overlap between the topics edited by Agriculture and by his sock puppet, TheChief. They both seem to concentrate on articles related to the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, and other topics relevant to that region of Illinois. And the style of their edits and especially their edit summaries is very similar. And the edit times notch rather nicely (Agriculture mainly edits in the morning and evening, and TheChief during the day). <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 01:58, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The former indicates nothing; if they do live in the same area (I'm assuming that it's the Springfield area, but I don't know for sure), it's not the least bit surprising that they'd both edit topics related to it. However, I agree that the timing of their edits is suspicious, and if they are both editing from the Springfield area (as I assume they are), then if one's not a sockpuppet of the other then they probably know each other from outside Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 02:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've examined the contribution histories of both editors in detail. I don't edit, or even look at, articles related to Illinois on any regular basis (with the exception of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galesburg%2C_Illinois_e745.html" title="Galesburg, Illinois">Galesburg, Illinois</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy%2C_Illinois_71b1.html" title="Quincy, Illinois">Quincy, Illinois</a>, all of which I have watchlisted), and I discovered this pattern because I was already suspicious of TheChief for reasons unrelated to his edit pattern.

<li>Okay, since TheChief was putting together on a request for arbitration, I can understand that the ArbCom would have had reasons to call for a sockcheck, and that there is plausible evidence to show that this was, in fact, sockpuppetry. However, I do believe this underlines the principle that we should have two or three additional sockcheckers, because that would allow people to get a second opinion on the matter.

<li>This issue is bigger than just the current kerfuffle about Agriculture and the Chief. What frustrates me about this whole situation is how the current system lets one person act as judge, jury, and executioner in what amounts to a secret court. There is no transparency, no accountability, and no way to ensure that consensus is really being upheld. Many users apparently trust David, and that is fine, I have no particular reason not to myself. However, the fact that David had staked out an opposite position to Agri/Chief in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Tony_Sidaway_2_7aba.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway 2">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway 2</a> prior to blocking them, calling the whole Rfc "ridiculous" has, on the face of it, the appearance of a potential conflict of intrest. This is especially true insofar as David seems to have bent his normal policy of only running checkuser on users subject to Arbcom review. Please note that I'm not suggesting that there was any actual wrongdoing, or that David shouldn't have done what he did, I'm just saying it looks really bad, even if there is substantial merit to his claims. This is the opposite of the openness that should characterise wikipedia, and it leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth when pronouncements are made to 'take it or leave it'. Why at the very least are other members of the arbcom not allowed the same checkuser privilege?

<li>It seems to me that the right way to check the claims is for those who doubt DG's word to nominate their local friendly admin to go over the case with him.

<li>I don't think anyone really doubts David's word- it's just (I think) fairly obvious that he's slightly biased, and <i>at first glance</i> this looked like cabalism.

<li>As I understand it, the evidence amounts to 1) they do not have the same IP, but their IPs indicate that they are comming from connections in the same city; 2) they have edited a number of the same topics; 3) their style of edit summery is similar; 4) their log in times typcicall correspond in that one typically logs in during the day, and the other during the evening, in the area that their IPs indicate ther location to be; 5) both have taken strong issue with Tony Sideway and many of his actions and attitudes. As against this, 1) a city is not a small place and there are otehr wikipedia users in that general area; 2) editing on topics related to the area one resides is not all thst unusual; 3) TheChief has denied being a sockpuppet; 4) The two IDs took ratehr differetn attitudesa during Tony's RfC. -- All that sounds to me look good grounds for suspicion, but hardly a well-proved case. Since David G has not claimed that the IPs are identical, having soemone else check would hardly strengthen the case -- one can belive that everything he has said is strictly truthful (as i do) and that he acted in complete good faith (as I presume) and still feel that the above is not sufficient evidence to finally conclude that TheChief is a sockpuppet. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:10, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You missed grounds (6): TheChief's edits consisted of nothing but amplification of claims made by Agriculture. This is not normal behaviour of real editors. Furthermore, the defence claim #3 of not being a sockpuppet was made by <i>Agriculture</i> who claimed that he was not a sockpuppet of TheChief: a strange way of wording it, but one that appeals to the barracks-room-lawyer mentality of sockpuppetteers, who then later claim that what they said *was* true, it was TheChief that was the sockpuppet of Agriculture. It sounds daft, but sockpuppetteers really do this sort of thing. I am convinced that (i) the public evidence shows that TheChief is not a legitimate editor, and (ii) DG's claims cements the connection to Agriculture. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:51, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think a log is really neccessary - we trust David, and we must trust anyone subsequently given this power. A log may prejudice innocent parties, especially if the result is a 'not-proven' verdict. However, I would like a policy on the use of checkuser, so that when the checkinguser is challanged as to why he checked, he can point to the policy, and say 'User:X did action Y (e.g. filing an RfAr - getting blocked for vandalism, editing simmilar to a banned user), and under section Z of the policy that entitles me to check'. Also, it would enable innocent people to know that they would not be checked unless they were doing certain things.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:40, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>We trust admins to delete pages and even images, we trust beaurcrats to promote admins, but in each case there is a log. Trust, but verify. I don't quite see what prejudice a log such as <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">User:Scimitar</a> suggests would do that staements on talk pages such as "I think User:Foo is a sock of User:Bar." don't already do. There is no policy against making such statements as far as i know, (people certianly make them often enough) and the log entry merely shows that User:Checkerdude thought such a claim worth looking into. But in iny case I agree with <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">User:Doc glasgow</a> there there should be a policy on when this tool should, and should not, be used, and that use outside of situations covered in the policy should not be considered acceptable. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:11, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Two additional points: having such a log would improve transparency, which isn't a bad thing, as long as the IP addresses aren't being revealed. My second point has to do with the future- at some point (if not already) Wikipedia will be too big to limit the checkuser function to <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a>. At that point, it's perfectly conceivable that we'd have a few select people using checkuser on a relatively constant basis, and having the log would make it easier to implement this should it become neccessary.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 19:22, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, the wikiway of approaching this would be to gain consensus for running a checkuser with a "Votes for checkuser" page that would gather preliminary evidence that would suggest whether or not such a check is justified. If, following a period, a consensus exists that checkuser is justified, then it should be run, but not otherwise. A report about the general results would then be made. Rather like a grand jury returning an indictment. This would prevent fishing expeditions. There should be objective criteria that must be met before a user is even "nominatable" for Vfcu, and these should be stringent to avoid overwhelming those entrusted with running such a labour intensive chore. <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> 19:20, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree here. My first thought when I read Fawcett's suggestion is that it would be a good adjunct, but I wouldn't want to see it replace someone like David's judgment, not the least of the reasons why being the sheer amount of hoops it'd create. Of course the corollary here is that when someone is enabled to use judgment with the thought that it is useful not to get bogged down in overly cumbersome rules, there is generally also an expectation of transparency, which is, in this case, where the idea of a checkuser log comes in. I'd support that idea. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 19:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think a discussion and vote on each use of checkuser is a bit over-the-top, myself, but a log, perhaps limited to admins, could be used after the fact. The log should include a reason why the check is being made in general terms ("possible sock", "track vandal" or the like). If after the fact it seems that checkuser was used without "probable cause", then that might be grounds for removing the person who did this from the list of users permitted to use checkuser. Presumably the most common case will be vandal tracking, and the next most common checking if obviously disruptive users are socks, in which cases a vote or a public discussion seems over the top to me. In an RfC or de-checkuser discussion, issues of proper use can be raised when there is an actual case for them. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:51, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well, trolls are reading AN/I anyway, so the log is really no different from posting requests of "David, please check user X". The log will only show that he actually acted on the request. Regarding the 'vote for sockcheck' proposal, hell <i><b>no</b></i>. That's procedure creep. Don't vote on everything. The "wiki way" is: <i>everything is in the open</i>. I understand that many people edit from work, so yes, IPs should not be public, since public IPs would keep people from editing on company time, thus damaging the project. A "Userchecker" rank with three or four trusted holders will be fine. Viewing the log could be restricted to admins to reduce bitching about "why did you" or "why didn't you", but it will not contain any sensitive information. I really think a solution along these lines will be the best approach. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 83.79.181.171 20:47, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

And if I do, I'm dammed either way. If I resist it, then I've obviously got something to hide - and so the check will be justified. If I suport the check, then what's the point in the vote?

I fully support Carnildo's efforts to reduce the legal exposure of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. Finally, I would like to add my utter bewilderment at Jtdirl's outrageous assertion that edit warring is a perfectly valid strategy on Wikipedia. Edit warring is <b>never</b> acceptable behavior on Wikipedia. Do not edit war.

<dd>It must be said, it's an interesting point - a template <i>as it occurs on a clutch of articles</i> might well suffice for a Fair Use claim of using an image that unites said articles. However, does the template exist as a page in-and-of itself? (Similar to whether the Image: namespace pages exist as uses of the image - in which case they don't have claims to Fair Use, and we'd need to have a different means to use, store, and display images that are Fair Use - or are merely back-end views and so do not count as to whether or not a Fair Use argument for the image exists.) Certainly, I can't remember this point being settled (as opposed to abandoned&#160;;-)), so for policy to say that so explicitly, as if it has, is... intruiging.</dd>
<dd>OTOH, indeed, edit warring is evil and the 3RR is certainly not an entitlement. I'm pretty sure I've written a couple of Arbitration rulings points that included that.</dd>

<p>What Kelly said, to a T. On the issue of Carnildo's legal credentials and/or his "understanding of the law," the only laws he is required to understand and follow are <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Wikipedia's</a>. If there is a conflict between those rules, in particular <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyrights_5026.html" title="WP:Copyrights">WP:Copyrights</a>, and the law of the land applicable to the images in question, it should be taken up with the <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">appropriate</a> <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org" rel="nofollow">folks</a> and a solution reached thereat. If there is indeed a special circumstance with Australian images, this should be noted in an appropriate policy document.

<p>I would like to report the nationalistic behaviour of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a>. His contributions are clearly of nationalistic character and all his presence on Wikipedia is motivated by denying the existance of the Macedonian ethnicity.</p>
<p>His lattest try for a POV push was the following edit: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=26955952&amp;oldid=26932663" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=26955952&amp;oldid=26932663" rel="nofollow">| Taken from the history of the page 'Republic of Macedonia'</a>]. Without any proofs and sources he accuses this country for not recognising the Bulgarian and Greek minority. As a matter of fact, these 2 minorities are extremely little. Another fact is that anyone can clearly write his own nationality on a blank field on the Macedonian census. This census counts even the minorities with only 1 member (like my wife is, who is the only Mexican in Republic of Macedonia).</p>
<p>This accusations by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a> are clear reaction to the revealing of the poor treatment that the Macedonian minority has in Bulgaria and Greece, which is confirmed by any relevant human rights organizations in the world, also by the European Court for Human Rights.</p>
<p>As I already mentioned, this is not the first incident of this kind by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a>. For similar incidents like this, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a>'s account was already banned for life on the Swedish Wikipedia for "Spreading of Greek propaganda", as explained by the administrators.</p>
<p>I think that is about time the English Wikipedia checks his edits and react at his provocations. I will be glad to help in any kind of investigations of this kind.

I've added a warning of my own to the Anons page in the vain hope that more warnings means he take them more seriously. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 22:56, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thak you. I have never yet done a selctive undelete, and I guess my impressions were derived from what I had read at the page about fixing cut&amp;paste moves. Aslo when i wrote the talk page note, i hadn't yet looked at the article -- indeed i didn't yet know what article it was, and the phrase "personal attacks" made me think it might be a matter of stuff like "reverted edits by moron editor" or PoV satemetns in the summery. I guess I was overly hesitant about thsi. Anotehr time I will act more directly. Thanks again for pointers -- this is twice you have advised me helpfully in how to use admin functions. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:03, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Wait a minute... doesn't the new undelete page show the history (though not page contents) to even non-admins? ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 23:03, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just logged out and took a look, and yes it does. Which is a bit crap to say the least. I guess no one thought of that. Come to think of it what about copyvios? They will still be visible through the history too. Are we going to start getting floods of takedown notices? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 23:10, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Copy vios will only be visible to admins except for what ever is in the summery. I doubt many copyright holders will know or care enough to look there when google doesn't index such pages. The personal info is more of a problem, as are really nasty attaks in edit summeries. I think this would take direct database alteration to fix -- i hope i'm wrong. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:13, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, actually. I had to ask Tim Starling to do this for a vandal on a user page. Question: Could a dev possibly remove or disable the ability for non-admins to view deleted edits until a way is created for admins or bureaucrats to manually edit deleted Edit Summaries? <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 23:37, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would oppose that. I think the ability to view the history of delted pages is very valuabel, and the very few cases in which this has come up are not worth removing that ability. However, providing some way for soemone to edit such abusive dummeries should be seen as an urgent item. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:00, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Copperchair is also undergoing an arbitration case, apparently in relation to his George Lucas-related edits:</p>

</ul>
<p>I think we can all agree that this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, where a difference between two editors holds up all editing.</p>
<p>My idea is to unprotect these articles after warning both editors that if they continue to edit war on them they will be blocked for disruption. I envision short blocks sufficient to get the point across and obviate the need for reprotection. I've asked the administrator who protected the articles whether he'd mind if I did this. I'd also like to submit this plan, which is a bit unusual, for further review. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:57, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your response. Blocking, other than for vandalism, is bad, but protecting is worse. I think we could do with a speedy method of serving temporary injunctions on edit warriors banning them from certain articles for a week - perhaps on the agreement of three disinterested admins. Protection on popular articles is too blunt a tool. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 10:26, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I like Tony's idea, and think it should be used more widely, with careful dispensing of brief blocks. It is unfortunate when <i>all</i> editors must be prevented from editing for the dubious behaviour of a very small number. I also like Doc's idea, although it would need consultation with the Arbitrators. At present it takes infinitely long to get a simple temporary injunction, whereas quickly formed and quickly disbanded mini-groups of neutral admins could do the job more effectively. OTOH, Tony's single-admin approach, with consultation seems likely to work here, so perhaps there's no need to bureaucratise the process. I'm interested to hear how it works out, but will watchlist the articles. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:18, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I say, I think Tony's approach is good - and posting it here allows for any admin objections. But if this tool were to become widely used (and it has potential) we'd need a simply policy and workable check and balance (can't post them all here). I'd propose an 'Admin's injunction page' any <i>disinterested</i> admin can propose an injunction for edit warring (as an alternative to protecting the page). If seconded, it may be served (with a template on the user page). It stands for one week, or unless any two other admins call for it to be rescinded. Violations lead to an automatic 24 hr block.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whenever I se a fair-use image being used outisde its fair use conditions, I remove it with an edit summary explaining my action. Most editors understand and accept this, but one (<a href="../../../b/g/c/User%7EBGC_d645.html" title="User:BGC">BGC</a> (<a href="../../../b/g/c/User_talk%7EBGC_52ff.html" title="User talk:BGC">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BGC_6339.html" title="Special:Contributions/BGC">contribs</a>) insists on adding fair-use images of album covers to articles on other albums — e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/2E/a/L.A._%28Light_Album%29_7039.html" title="L.A. (Light Album)">L.A. (Light Album)</a></li>

<p>There are many others. This isn't just one misuse, but multiple misuses of each cover (the infobox style is also against the album Wikiproject, and has been criticised by many editors on the basis of its misuse of the images and its rather bloated appearance). BGC refuses to back down, and merely reverts my removal of the images, describing my edits as "vandalous". I've tried (as have others) explaining the situation, but he simply refuses to pay attention, simply claiming that he's using a template that has survived a TfD, and so the use of the images has been sanctioned. A TfD result doesn't alter copyright law, however, and I'd guess that the large number of articles to which he's addign this template would cause problems for any print-or disk-based version of Wikipedia (if not for the on-line version). Could someone else try to reason with him? he's not very amenable to reason, being prone to aggression (under this name and his previous identioty, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetSounds_8a7e.html" title="User:PetSounds">PetSounds</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPetSounds_93e3.html" title="User talk:PetSounds">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PetSounds_2320.html" title="Special:Contributions/PetSounds">contribs</a>)), but something needs to be done. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:06, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A bit borderline, I think. I'd like to see Kelly Martin's view of this. From sampling some of the above examples, the pictures seem to be over links to articles about the relevant albums, and only appear in articles about the group where the albums shown chronologically precede and follow the album written about in the current article. This certainly seems to be well within the spirit, if not the letter, of fair use principles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:53, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed_Poor</a> was the author of the evolution poll page more than a year ago which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Evolution_poll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Evolution_poll" rel="nofollow">successfully deleted</a> in October.

<dd>I might call this questionable judgement, but I wish the word "abuse" was not thrown around so casually.

The thing I find most troubling is not the use (or "abuse") of admin abilities, it's the apparent desire to create a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV fork</a> of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>.

Ed, I'm a bit confused by your comments. What I meant specifically was, the poll article was a POV fork and, as such, is undesirable. It was validly deleted via Afd. Your undeletion makes it look to me like you <i>want</i> a POV fork, and this is not a good thing. Reliably sourced info from polls belongs in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:08, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I glanced at the guideline page about "POV forks", and I assure you I have no intention of pushing any POV. Anyone accusing me of doing so is giving me a great insult. I am Wikipedia's foremost <b>defender</b> of NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am not the one pushing a POV. I am trying to defend an article worked on by multiple contributors which Joshua suddenly deleted when I mentioned it during a discussion on the ambiguity of the word "evolution". He seems to be trying to censor from Wikipedia any mention of the idea that "evolution" can mean different things to people, depending on what side of the creation-evolution controversy they're on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the information had been properly merged, with a REDIRECT to it, there would be no problem. But Joshua has gotten two different articles about the ambiguity problem deleted. So I created a third one (see <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terms_used_in_the_evolution_debate.html" title="Terms used in the evolution debate">Terms used in the evolution debate</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All of the information in this article is well-discussed in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>, an article <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed_Poor</a> seems to have avoided looking at before creating these new articles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 03:50, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, let me emphasize: I am not asserting ANY POINT OF VIEW on this controversy. I am not pushing anything, and I request that Joshua stop accusing me of this. I am only reporting what pollsters say. If pushers of the POV that evolution occurs without supernatural guidance keep trying to censor the opposite side, they are abusing the community processes of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a lot of confusion in the debate, and I am trying to write articles that make it clear. It is not a "POV fork" to create a sidebar article which treats one aspect of a controversy. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 21:20, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Ed, I have some issues with what you've done here and some questions. First of all, you restored an article deleted by consensus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>17:36, 1 November 2005 Ed Poor restored "Evolution poll</dd>
<dd>20:10, 6 October 2005 Jtkiefer deleted "Evolution poll" (as per Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Evolution poll)</dd>
</dl>
<p>After restoring it you moved it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>17:37, 1 November 2005 . . Ed Poor (Evolution poll moved to Creation-evolution poll: Was deleted in part because misnamed: "it is not a poll on evolution but rather a poll about the creation-evolution controversy")</dd>
</dl>
<p>That was not the outcome of the AfD. If you wanted to create a new article called "Creation-evolution poll" you should have done so. You should not unilaterally buck consensus and undelete an article properly deleted.</p>
<p>Second, What is a "sidebar article"? You tried linking to the term earlier but it was a red link. Is this an accepted Wikipedia concept? Is it discussed somewhere? I'd like to read what you are referring to in order to better understand your statement.</p>
<p>Last, your new article is sadly POV despite your claims. I could see <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terms_used_in_the_evolution_debate.html" title="Terms used in the evolution debate">Terms used in the evolution debate</a> being a useful article so I don't disagree that it should exist but it and Creation-evolution poll are skewed not in wording (which I think you avoided) but in content. I feel that Creation-evolution poll is beyond NPOV recovery but could be incorporated somewhere else with some heavy criticism. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terms_used_in_the_evolution_debate.html" title="Terms used in the evolution debate">Terms used in the evolution debate</a> can be restored if we can take it out of a creationist view trying to be PC in front of evolutionists. Both articles are clear PC versions of a creationist view based on chosen wording (in the poll itself) and explanatory content in the articles. (I'll discuss it more at <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerms_used_in_the_evolution_debate_ef83.html" title="Talk:Terms used in the evolution debate">Talk:Terms used in the evolution debate</a>). - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 21:42, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps I over-emphasize the value of keeping all articles' revision history. I hate to start fresh, without crediting other writers' work.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It also irks me that a small group of POV-pushing Wikipedians can go against the principles of this web site and (1) refer to their tyranny as "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>" merely on the basis of winning a majority vote on on obscure issue; and (2) delete information that allows the reader to see that their POV is not necessarily correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is particulary galling in light of the fact that there are other <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions.html" title="Definitions">Definitions</a> articles (as for music, Palestine, terrorism).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An encyclopedia should bring clarity. It should enable the reader to understand things quickly and easily.

<p>Albanian nationalist User:REX, who has an arbitration case pending against him at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_REX_1206.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/REX">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/REX</a>, is attempting to move <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_language.html" title="Arvanitic language">Arvanitic language</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a> in order to deny the basic right of the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>, who identify nationally as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>, to have their language called a "language" separate from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian</a>. Regardless of the politics of the situation, it is Wikipedia policy to use the word <i>language</i> in the names of such articles. For example, we have <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_language.html" title="Bosnian language">Bosnian language</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_language.html" title="Croatian language">Croatian language</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_language.html" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian language</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldovan_language.html" title="Moldovan language">Moldovan language</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegrin_language.html" title="Montenegrin language">Montenegrin language</a>, etc. despite their disputed status. After having his recent unilateral and arbitrary page move to <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a> reversed by neutral administrators, User:REX has now called a straw poll at <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanitic_language_720d.html" title="Talk:Arvanitic language">Talk:Arvanitic language</a>, and all the usual suspects (who have all had a bone to pick with Greeks in the past) have come to his aid. This is clearly not how such content disputes should be resolved on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 13:22, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is not true. Arvanitic is a dialect according to <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ohio_0121.html" title="University of Ohio">University of Ohio</a> and every other source on the planet. There are NO sources which deny the fact that Arvanitic is a seperate language from Albanian. This is one of Theathenae's POV-pushing tactics. I also think that I should inform you that the Arvanites of Northwestern Greece DO call themselves Albanians. It is only in Southern Greece where they say that it isn't. I am proposing the page move so that it can be like <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin (linguistics)</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Cantonese (linguistics)">Cantonese (linguistics)</a> etc. Where the status of a language is not clear you shouldn't prescribe what it should be. Wikipedia should be neutral. Calling it a language contradicts every single source we have (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Arvanitic (linguistics)">Arvanitic (linguistics)</a> is neutral as it doesn't take sides and doesn't exclude either possibility. it is the neutral way to do things. Theathenae has not provided a single source which says that it is not an ALbanian dialect (because none exists). It has nothing to do with nationalism, it is to do with facts. Theathenae's views are false, no scientific establishment supports his views. Is he saying that UNESCO, Britannica, the Uni of Ohio are trying to <i>deny the basic right of the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>, who identify nationally as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>, to have their language called a "language" separate from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian</a></i>? I don't think that that's possible. This is just a tactic of his. Are the Flemings of Belgium being denied their right to be Belgian if their language is called a dialect of Dutch (which is what Britannica and every linguist on earth), or are the Swiss Germans by the Swiss German being called a dialect of German? He is POV-pushing and using dishonest tactics. Why don't you find some sources Theathenae? REX 14:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
