<p>Just about every day, I revert vandalism on Wikipedia in my school library. Now, unfortunately, two of my classmates have seen me doing it, and have started vandalizing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The problem is, they keep putting my first and last name in articles (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Church_Slavonic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91373683" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Church_Slavonic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91373683" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monster_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91374578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monster_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91374578" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harwich&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91373220" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harwich&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91373220" rel="nofollow">3</a> for ones I definitely know about).</p>
<p>What I know is that they create accounts through the IP <a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.108.145.4.html" title="User talk:208.108.145.4">User_talk:208.108.145.4</a> and then vandalize Wikipedia with them, sometimes putting my name in articles.</p>
<p>I dont want to violate <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a> here (just trying to keep myself from getting banned), but could someone please delete those revisions and possibly block the IP for one month with account creation disabled to get them bored with vandalism?</p>

<dd>Both the school IPs are blocked, and I thank whoever blocked them. However, the two vandals continue to overload my userpages with hundreds of barnstars, and are creating accounts outside of school now. All I can think of is doing total protection of my userpages until they get bored with this (which I want to save as a last resort). I'd like peoples opinions on what they think I should do. I dont want to report this to the school authorities, because it may get Wikipedia blocked at my school. <a href="../../../n/w/w/User%7ENwwaew_aacb.html" title="User:Nwwaew">Nwwaew</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/w/w/User_talk%7ENwwaew_f1fd.html" title="User talk:Nwwaew">Talk Page</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nwwaew_3368.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nwwaew">Contribs</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Nwwaew_04d2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Nwwaew">E-mail me</a>)</small> 02:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Patstuart, I appreciate what you did. If that had been done a day ago when I originally pointed it out to Admins, I would never have had to contact an attorney and then followed her advice of notifying timecop that we were prepared to respond in a legal manner to his illegal behavior. My hope is that this will be the last note that I will be forced to leave on any page in Wikipedia. The debate of my entry was interesting, being libeled against was truly distressing. I hope that Wikipedia spends just as much energy taking care of users who actually break the law as they do upon new users/visitors who follow the instructions of their attorney during a very serious matter.

<dd>People say stupid things and act irrationally when they get upset. Tony is upset that his article is going, and at that from someone who's a self-admitted troll who's goal is the "war on blogs". This statement isn't, BTW, a backhanded attack on timecop; it's an explanation of Tony. Personally, while he's been a little silly about the resume, I understand why he's upset (even if he might not deserve an article). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 15:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He did this with no basis for either charge. He has admitted wrong-doing for the sockpuppet charge, and I am waiting for his reaction on the anti-American charge.

You assert that <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_Strong_Dark_Ale_e52d.html" title="Belgian Strong Dark Ale">Belgian Strong Dark Ale</a> is not a classification in use in Belgium, nor does it correspond to any Belgian classification. If that's correct, it certainly should be noted. However, if anyone else in the world DOES use it as a classification - and it appears that at least one brewing organisation in the US does - then what purpose is served by deleting it? Better that the article exist - since it is a term in use - but explicitly state who uses the classification and who does not. Belgian classification of their own beers is certainly very important, and it makes a lot of sense for the Belgian descriptions to be paramount, but this does not mean that nobody else in the world is entitled to describe and classify Belgian or Belgian-style beers.</dd>

Yes, they should treat things neutrally in the articles, but using an anti-American bias as a position for editing articles is not inappropriate, and is not wrong. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 16:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A good suggestion. And yes - while accusations of being anti-American may well be correct, in my experience they are rarely helpful and serve only to inflame the situation (as do most accusations of being anti-whatever). They should be thus avoided. I have not examined all the contributions of the users involved in this dispute to see who (if anyone) made any such allegations, but it's not in the best interests of the project to do so. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 16:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First thank you for all the helpful information that was posted here. There seems to be a misunderstanding about Belgian Strong Dark Ale: it is <b>solely</b> a classification for home-brewing competitions. That is, amateur brewers attempt to brew a certain recipe and then are marked on how close they come. This has nothing to do with commercial products. I know that it lists two commercial beers, but, if I call your child "Beatrix" does that change your child's name?</li>
<li>And for what it is worth: Osgoodelawyer has now apologised for calling our work "blatantly anti-American".</li>

<p>Wow. I apologized to Mikebe, he accepted it, and then his very next edit was to immediately file this complaint asking for my admin privileges to be revoked. That's not really what I'd consider an acceptance. I have apologized for accusing Patto1ro of sockpuppetry without enough evidence to go to a checkuser, although <i>at the time</i> the resemblance between the two users in question and the circumstantial evidence <i>was</i> pointing towards it. Clearly it was imprudent, and I have obviously learned from it. I have also since (prior to noticing this complaint), retracted my accusation of "Anti-Americanism" (albeit someone facetiously). I should note, though, that never did I complain that "Anti-Americanism" was grounds for action (nor do I think I even really accused Mikebe of being "an Anti-American"). In fact, the term "Anti-American" was simply being used to characterize <i>edits</i> made by both Mikebe and Patto1ro as being <i>similar</i> in a certain respect (that is, evidence to bring to a checkuser), when I was asked by another admin what I thought was the evidence for sockpuppetry. While I probably shouldn't have accused Patto1ro of sockpuppetry at the time I did, I certainly do not think it was an "abuse" of admin privileges. As noted above by others, this is really a content dispute that has gotten somewhat personal. As such, any further discussion from me will take place off AN/I. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 17:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On November 8, I ran across the <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tay_e8ae.html" title="Zoe Tay">Zoe Tay</a> article while doing Recent changes patrol. I had never heard of the person, but the article as I saw it at that time was incredibly peacockish. I put a {{pov}} tag on the article and explained my reasoning on the Talk page. User:Walaha2006 removed the tag and said on the Talk page, "The article is fine". Well, no, it wasn't fine. I explained to the user that removal of a pov tag without discussing the changes was not acceptable, and put the tag back on, but Walaha removed it again, and I blocked them temporarily and tried to explain that repeated removal of the POV tag was vandalism (all right, I admit, I should have gotten somebody else to do the blocking). So Walaha came in with a series of sock puppets to repeatedly remove the tag. I finally decided that I would stop just slapping the tag on the page, and made some rather extensive edits myself, to cut down on the fannishness, to remove some rather libelous comments, and to add "citation needed" tags on a lot of places in the article. Walaha reverted. Since that time, a large number of sock puppets have come in and repeatedly reverted any and all edits made by <i><b>anybody</b></i> to Walaha's preferred version. Each one has been indefinitely blocked. But now it's time to sprotect the page, and it's probably not me who should do it. Would anyone else care to look through the history of the article and let me know if my edits are wrong, and if they agree that the page should be sprotected, by someone other than me?

<p>Due to persistent trolling from a banned sockpuppet, <a href="../../../c/p/l/User%7ECplot_8bad.html" title="User:Cplot">User:Cplot</a>, on a certain ISP, we need a range block.</p>
<p>I've reinstated two from earlier this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>70.8.0.0/16</li>
<li>68.30.0.0/16</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think the user jumps around more on other ranges on the ISP, since those blocks were not entirely effective. A list of IP addresses used is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Cplot_1aac.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Cplot">here</a>. A whois query shows these net ranges:</p>

<li>70.0.0.0 - 70.14.255.255</li>
<li>68.24.0.0 - 68.31.255.255</li>

Blocks need to prevent these IP addresses from creating accounts. The ISP uses dynamic IPs, so the user keeps jumping around to different IP addresses. I have tried contacting the ISP multiple times, but no response yet. Please advise. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 03:04, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Judging by his first &lt;100 contribs, this guy is acting a way which perfectly defines "troll". His/her first edit(s) were to unilaterally copy-and-paste move <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humour.html" title="Humour">humour</a> to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humor.html" title="Humor">humor</a> - this debate, whilst only settled recently, was one of the most bitter I've ever read. His/her next action was to disrupt RfC - how on earth does a "newbie" find RfC so quickly, and understand how it works? Not only that, but a number of his/her comments were extremely disruptive and inflammatory, and he/she also (deliberately) removed other peoples' comments, admitting he/she'd never read the RfC anyways. Finally, to cap it all off, some more trolling at <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">User talk:Samir (The Scope)</a>.

<p>Elonka, could you spicify which policy was violated by Yaksha?

<p>I support these moves and strongly oppose any block. <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> says that moves may be simply moved by an editor if they are not controversial - I don't consider them controversial, since the moves follow WP:D, WP:NAME and consensus agreement at WP:TV-NAME I feel they do have consensus support. In the cases where a RM was used, there have been comments asking why it was needed. I consider one or two editors making a blanket declaration that a potential move of <i>any</i> TV article would be controversial to be a disruptive attempt to slow consensus action by making it as cumbersome as possible. On a similar RM that is going on now, MatthewFenton even went so far as to suggest that each page move should have a seperate RM with a separate discussion (even though there's currently a clear consensus to pass the move). I find it incredibly bad faith on Elonka's part to complain about unilateral page moves and then within minutes, start doing edits and page moves on those very same pages (with a "per ANI" edit summary, even though no admin here has given her permission to move pages back). And neither medcom nor medcab are in progress - medcom was attempted but multiple users, including myself, declined because of Elonka's continued evidence of bad faith. Elonka tried starting a medcab case, but I doubt it will go anywhere either for the same reasons. I don't see potential mediation as a reason to ignore wikipedia guidelines (particularly when, in the absence of WP:TV-NAME, the moves are still supported by WP:D and WP:NAME), if anything I see Elonka's "attempts" at mediation as an excuse to try to get a de-facto "injunction" and try and stop consensus moves. As were her attempts to unilaterally declare WP:TV-NAME "in dispute", even revert warring in an attempt to ad a "disputed" tag. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 20:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Demon, might I ask you to clarify your statement? It is being interpreted by Elonka as an official decree that there is no consensus for WP:TV-NAME.

<p>The page moves are not unilateral. Many editors have been helping with page moves since the start of the month. The mediation suddenly popping up shouldn't be an extra excuse for Elonka to complain about them. The moves do have consensus - this much is obvious from the results of the one Request Move entry which i did file (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_Episode_title_RfC_3_60ca.html#Requested_move" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)/Episode title RfC 3">here</a> is the Request Move entry which i filed, after Lost editors insisted there was consensus to not move the articles. We ended at 15 support vs. 3 oppose, and the RM closed with a "all moved"). They also directly follow naming conventions, not only <a href="../../../t/v/-/WP%7ETV-NC_c23a.html" title="WP:TV-NC">WP:TV-NC</a> (not the convention itself was never under debate, just the issue of whether and how to allow exceptions) but also <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D">WP:D</a>. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 00:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me? but since when did the MedCom have that kind of authority? You ask for me to be blocked, on the basis that i'm not going through Request Moves to make page moves. So i put one of the moves which you reverted through Request Moves, and you ask for it to be closed?</dd>
<dd>Exactly what are you trying to do? You complain about my page moves being non-consensus. When all the Request Moves filed so far show the moves to be very much pro-consensus. So you decide it's not good for your case and instead demand us close off the Request Moves?</dd>
<dd>So moving without Request MOves means you threaten to block me, and moving with Request Moves means you ask for speedy closes? Exactly how are we supposed to get anything moved?</dd>
<dd>Or is your entire tactic to simply delay the moving until we all get bored and decide to leave?</dd>
<dd>Seriously, all the Request Moves show clear consensus for moves.

<p>Once again, I am NOT endorsing the pages be one way or the other, NOR do I request that the moves go through a particular medium. However, I am notifying here in addition to at <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">WP:RFM</a> that the <i>mediation has been rejected.</i> I do not see mediation as being successful through our medium. I leave you with this: I suggest everyone involved stop what they're doing, calm down, then try to figure it out again. Massive page moving (whether with consensus or not) is not going to solve this debate.</p>

<dd>Let me just drop a clarification in here: A mediator may issue a request to a party in mediation to cease a certain behavior for the good of the mediation; it is not, however, an enforceable directive outside the mediation. Mediators do not have the power to order parties to do or not do certain things; mediations are always voluntary. What a mediator can do, and what this has forced ^demon to do, is close the mediation as a failure, if the parties are not willing to refrain from conduct that harms the mediation. So, to be clear: ^demon was within policy to make the request to cease, and he is within policy to close the mediation. Failure to abide by the mediator's request is not enforceable outside the mediation (Note to everyone involved: If you're trying to get anyone blocked based on this, stop, it isn't going to happen.); it is, however, cause for the mediation to be closed as failed. If the parties are still interested in settling the issue, they'll need to seek an RfC or arbitration.</dd>

<dd>Way to completely misrepresent my argument. At no point did I say "legalistic and bureaucratic guidelines are a good idea," I've merely said that the way we handle our guidelines and procedures are "instruction creepy," and that your tagging of <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> as a guideline is premature, lacks general consensus, and hasn't been approached properly.

<dd>Thus my complaint. You haven't had any objections because no one knew about it becoming a guideline with minimal discussion. Now that people are noticing it, they're coming out in opposition. That tends to happen. Considering WP:CREEP is linked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/WP:CREEP" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/WP:CREEP" rel="nofollow">less than 50 times</a> and the actual page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Avoid_instruction_creep" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Avoid_instruction_creep" rel="nofollow">less than 50 as well</a>, your claim of it being "heavily linked" also lacks merit. It especially lacks links to the various pumps, which is telling. The meta page may be linked a lot, but that doesn't make it guideline here without discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed we should. And we do. But I'm looking at the talk page of WP:CREEP and seeing very little discussion and <b>NO</b> consensus anywhere to make this a guideline. It doesn't matter if Radiant did this 3 months ago, he did it with almost no input from the community.

<dd>However, see the second section on its talk page, <i>"Wikipedians who have used "instruction creep""</i>. It shows usage by 36 users - hardly a lack of input.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, they have used it. And possibly did while it was <b>still</b> an essay. But no actually gave input, your claim that use is input on the question of changing this from an essay to a guideline is illogical. Additionally, You are missing that fact that I stated there was no input into the <b>change</b> from essay to guideline, I didn't say no one ever used it. Its the changing of the status with no input that is the issue here. (Not to mention 36 people is a trivial amount on Wikipedia. I'm quite sure our other guidelines have thousands of instances of use. More people believe in the flying spaghetti monster than 36.) A change like this without input or in case without even <b>an attempt</b> to get input deserves to be questioned as inappropriate. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 15:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just read <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> and I agree with most of what it says. The bit I disagree with is the last paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Page instructions should be pruned regularly. Gratuitous requirements should be removed as soon as they are added. All new policies should be regarded as instruction creep until firmly proven otherwise."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a classic case of over-generalisation, and may indeed be an example of instruction creep itself. Page instructions should be pruned <i>when needed</i>, not regularly. Not all new policies should be regarded as instruction creep. It should be easy to identify whether a new policy is instruction creep or not, without assuming it is guilty. It is much easier, and less derogatory, to consider whether a new policy is identical to, or an extension of, an existing guideline or policy, and then subsume the new policy under the old one by merging or redirecting. Slapping the derogatory label "instruction creep" on something is the wrong approach because, as the page says, the efforts are often "well-meaning".</p>
<p>More generally though, it is important to realise that the opposite process can happen. Just as instructions can get so bloated that they are useless, they can also be so excessively pruned that they are equally useless, something I've termed "anti-instruction creep creep" in the past. Maybe WP:PRUNE is needed?</p>
<p>The essence of the argument is that some people want detailed instructions, and some want brief, bullet-pointed nutshells that help them remember things. It should be obvious that the new editor will want something short and clear, the inexperienced editor will want more detailed explanations and instructions, and the experienced editor will want a brief summary with their own annotations added to make it as clear as possible to them. The trouble comes when people start adding what should be their own personal notes (which could be added to an 'examples' page) to the main document, lead to bloat and instruction creep.</p>
<p>It is also extremely important to distinguish between instruction creep and genuinely useful additions to a guideline. Sometimes a logical step is missing from a guideline or set of instructions, and adding it is simply filling in a gap and is not instruction creep. Also, it is invariably the case that someone expanding an instruction either finds it useful, or thinks someone else will find it useful. If you don't find it useful, ask yourself "can I put this somewhere else instead of just deleting it?" and "how can I make sure those reading the main guideline know how to find these extra instructions if they want them?" <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not <i>entirely</i> sure that the block on Elaragirl would not serve as a preventative measure, but I do think it is perhaps overkill (even though it's a mere 24 hours). While I have been bothered by the extremely acerbic nature of much of Elaragirl's commentary, she does generally keep it just this side of personal attacks and incivility (and I have to admit that often she puts people in their place). This edit was <i>clearly</i> over the line, though, and if such comments were made by some Joe Schmoe with fifty edits, I don't think anyone would have batted an eye. It's only because Elaragirl is so clearly visible on places like WP:AN (and has her fans), has, I think, there been a real issue with this block. But then, I might argue that being so visible causes the situation to actually <i>be</i> different than if it were a block of just some wanker. In closing (this comment sure ended up being a lot longer than I intended), I'm a wimp, so I'm not going to intervene. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 19:10, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I hate to do it, I believe Elaragirl may have stepped over the line this time. As Firsfron indicated, she has been warned to be careful in the past. This 24-hour block amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist, and I don't believe Firsforn overstepped any bounds by imposing it.

<dd>I'll echo what Cyde said. 24 hours is more than I'd've given, but not too much for an obviously unacceptable edit that I'd actually object to it. A mere warning would strike me as slightly ridiculous; I'm sure Elaragirl knows already that given her general demeanour she needs to be careful about crossing the line. Her general attitude I have no problem with, just with isolated mistakes like this. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 19:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Elaragirl herself has said she won't contest the block, and from what (relatively little) I've gathered about her personality, I think it's because she knows that she's broken her own rules and is ready to take her lumps.

My first approach was to discuss the use of the reference desk, and appropriate ways of regulating it; these discussions (with some users) were extensive, and resulted in me writing out a personal plan for removing highly inappropriate comments and discussion from the reference desk: <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_Reference_desk_removals_b045.html" title="User:SCZenz/Reference desk removals">User:SCZenz/Reference desk removals</a>. Applying this procedure worked fine until last night, when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AReference_desk%2FMiscellaneous&amp;diff=90615205&amp;oldid=90609729" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AReference_desk%2FMiscellaneous&amp;diff=90615205&amp;oldid=90609729" rel="nofollow">removed an entirely off-topic joke discussion</a>. I informed <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../d/i/r/User_talk%7EDirkvdM_68fa.html" title="User talk:DirkvdM">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DirkvdM_3b6a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DirkvdM">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <span class="plainlinks" style="color:#002bb8"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=DirkvdM&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=DirkvdM&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">count</a></span>) that I had done this, and he took exception. I spent a long period of time explaning why my actions follow from the spirit of Wikipedia policy and the purpose of the reference desk (see <a href="../../../d/i/r/User_talk%7EDirkvdM_68fa.html#Reference_desk_removal" title="User talk:DirkvdM">User talk:DirkvdM#Reference desk removal</a>), but he repeatedly reverted my edits even after I made it clear that (in my best judgement) his reversions were disruptive. I therefore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DirkvdM&amp;diff=90683217&amp;oldid=90682420" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DirkvdM&amp;diff=90683217&amp;oldid=90682420" rel="nofollow">warned him that he would be blocked</a> if he continued to disrupt the ref desk. He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90717186" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90717186" rel="nofollow">subsequently restored the comments</a>, so I blocked him for 12 hours to prevent further disruption.</p>
<p>Thus I have failed in my original plan to improve the reference desk through discussion; several other admins have tried before me, and run out of patience rather faster than I did. In my best judgement, drawing a line in the sand and saying "some comments can be, and will be, removed to keep the page on topic" was the only remaining approach. When DirkvdM became stubborn on this point, I couldn't see a better option than to block for disruption. However, I have blocked a generally good contributor for restoring that he believes was legitimate content, and my actions should be reviewed. I would appreciate any comments.

<dd>I think the idea of removing comments by another editor is generally a bad thing, but in the case of the reference desk I would support your actions as it is very easy to get sidetracked with irrelevant things. In order to keep the place in order and useful, the desk must be kept on the point. Each question and topic on the desk should stay within its boundaries else people will not think the desk is actually any use.</dd>
<dd>In this case, removing DirkvdM's irrelevant and off-topic comment was appropriate and his trying to force it back on, regardless of the purpose of the page was disruptive. It is a case of using your common sense to prevent the page losing focus. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I also concur with the removal and the block. SCZenz made an extraordinary effort to communicate with the user and explain exactly why it wasn't appropriate for the reference desk. As the first place many new Wikipedians go, it is important for it to maintain focus. Dirk claims that we are taking the fun out of Wikipedia, but there is no way irrelevent penis jokes on the reference desk make the encyclopedia better and he does not have an inalienble right to post them as his comments seem to indicate. Thank you SCZenz for tackling this tough area with patience and wisdom. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:56, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Things that should be removed would include death threats and racial slurs. Bad jokes, while they perhaps shouldn't be made in the first place, certainly do not rise to the level of something to be removed, and blocking a user over such an issue is absurd. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 00:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SCZ has written, and is operating by, his own guidelines on which he has failed to obtain consensus for acceptance. He is acting autocratically and is guilty of harrassment.

<dd>He is using common sense and a interpretation of our existing policies in order to keep an important area of the encyclopedia on task and focussed. Also, the user was blocked for edit warring with an admin - ok, this block should have been done by a seperate admin and the issue discussed in more detail elsewhere first, but the block did what it was supposed to do - stopped the edit war.</dd>
<dd>Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a discussion forum</a> - jokes do not come within the purpose of the site. The reference desk is one of the first points of contact for many users of this site and as such should be kept focussed - if it is not, then the site may lose some credibility due to what is in essence silly banter.</dd>

<p>Guys, it's okay to have fun on the reference desk, as it's okay (and recommended!) to have fun elsewhere on Wikipedia, but please keep the conversations close to the topic at hand. A lot of users turn to the reference desk for answers to legitimate questions; it undermines the role of the desk somewhat if they end up with an irrelevant commentary in an attempt to be funny. I wholeheartedly support the intent of SCZenz's actions -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 03:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the solution is to bring such issues up at the Ref Desk talk page, discuss them there, then come up with a consensus for a solution. This is the method which was working, with a few bumps here and there. But, since <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> didn't like how we were handling things, they chose to decide, without consensus, both what is appropriate and when an inappropriate comment rises to the level of requiring removal.

<dd>I think this whole consensus discussion is a red herring. I'm not in favour of removing content from the RD, but IMO it's come to this because people have been so stubborn about defending indefensible contributions. <b>IT'S A WIKI</b>. Every single page belongs to the WikiMedia Foundation, and we release every single character we type to the GFDL. This means articles, talk pages, userpages, and the RD. Users generally have dominion over our userpages out of courtesy, not because we own them. But anyone can edit them. The editing or removal of on-topic talk page contributions is frowned upon because it <i>defeats the purpose of the article talk page, which is to achieve consensus on the content of the article</i>. The RD is not a talk page. Our every contribution is not sacrosanct. We are working towards solutions to individual problems posed as questions by individual posters, and as such, off-topic contributions are subject to removal. They haven't been up to now, but now they are. It doesn't need a change in policy, and it doesn't need consensus. It's as simple as that. <b>IT'S A WIKI</b>. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 09:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unless other admins have concerns about my approach, I'm perfectly <s>happy</s> <i>willing</i> to continue removing inappropriate comments and (if necessary, and after due warning) blocking those who restore them.

<p>SCzenz 's actions were not unilateral as so far they have been supported by every admin who has commented on the page. Obviously then, there are people who agree with him and he isn't acting in a vacuum. I don't think arbcom is needed here either. Nor does it have to be an admin who removes inappropriate comments. "You're taking the fun out of Wikipedia" is an immature argument for leaving irrelevant penis jokes on some of our most public pages. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:21, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's unilateral in that it was decided <b>before</b> asking for the opinions of others. And, frankly, I bet Admins would support one another against the user community except for extremely blatant and obvious abuses. This isn't exactly surprising, as the question boils down to giving Admins more power and Users less power. As for anybody being able to remove a comment, that would allow the original user to restore the comment if they disagreed. However, when an admin removes your comment and you put it back, you get blocked, this is the issue. Your comment that <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a>'s actions are "supported by every admin who has commented on the page" also contains the hidden assumption that only the opinions of Admins matter, and all comments from the general user community (including regular Ref Desk contributors) can be ignored. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 05:53, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And, in any case, each individual deletion is still unilateral, unless that specific deletion has been agreed to based on a consensus. For example, we might well all agree that death threats should be removed, but an Admin removing a statement that "bin Laden may be killed soon" would still be unilateral, because we have not agreed that this was a violation of the "no death threats" policy. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 09:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All opinions are important, but I think we especially value those from people who contribute to the Ref Desk regularly. After all, you guys are the ones actually doing the work of answering the questions. But don't you think some of the less-than-relevant commentary could be toned down a bit, StuRat? It's one of the things that personally turns me off the reference desk also. I see a lot of medical questions that I could answer, but they often devolve into joke-cracking threads that I feel somewhat silly adding to. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 07:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My I add a comment, as a non-admin but long standing Wikipedian and regular RD contributor&#160;? SCZenz is acting on his honest belief that the RDs need to be regulated and cleaned up. He has put some thought into this and has written up the standards to which he thinks RD questions and answers should conform. He has started to enforce these standards by deleting responses, and sometimes whole threads. Unfortunately, he does not have time to patrol the RDs regularly, so his deletions have a sporadic and ad-hoc quality. His actions are also encouraging victimisation of certain RD contributors by others - see recent discussions on the RD talk page. If there is concensus that SCZenz is doing the right thing, then there should be no need for him to patrol the RDs on his own. <i>Please</i> help him set up a process to regulate the RDs properly by applying an agreed set of rules regularly, consistently and fairly. The current <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigilante.html" title="Vigilante">vigilante</a> situation is very unsatisfactory. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 10:20, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Samir, note that if the deletion of inappropriate stuff becomes policy any medical questions would be removed, so any answer you gave would also be removed. Be carefull when judging something you haven't felt the full brunt of. For this reason who should decide ref desk policy should be determined by how active they are at the ref desk, not by whether they are an admin. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 10:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I'm concerned, the block is a minor issue (actually, I now notice the block has already ended). What's at stake here is the nature of the ref desk, and any discussions about that should take place at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia_talk%7EReference_desk_Miscellaneous_ce11.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reference desk/Miscellaneous">the talk page there</a>. About SCZenz's behaviour, may an admin use his powers (in casu blocking me) in a discussion he is one of the original parties in? I thought that was not allowed. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User_talk%7EDirkvdM_68fa.html#Common_sense" title="User talk:DirkvdM">On my talk page</a> I've split the issue in four subtopics: what should be allowed on the ref desk, whether that applies to me and LightCurrent, how should any misbehaviour (when that is defined) be dealt with and if SCZenz is allowed to decide that on his own (ignoring the fact that there is still a hefty discussion going on about this at the talk page).</dd>
<dd>Oh, and since that term was again used here, it was not a penis joke. It was an amusing misunderstanding followed by clarifying info. A joke is something you come up with and I didn't come up with it, it was something amusing that happened to me. But like I explained on my talk page, I wonder if SCZenz has a hidden agenda. He says he wants to remove off topic remarks. But he doesn't do that (consistently). In stead he seems to just remove stuff that doesnt' please him personally, in casu a subject that has to do with a reproductive organ. This is <b>selective zero tolerance</b>. Very dangerous. Rules should be applied systematically, not at someone's whim. And for that there should be rules in the first place. Let's first establish rules for the nature of the ref desk and how to deal with them. I'm rather tempted to start removing <i>all</i> off-topic remarks at the ref desk, to show how disruptive non-selective zero tolerance would be. But I won't be so childish (yet).&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Btw, SCZenz, do you report all your deletions to all the people in the sub-thread? (And is that at all do-able?) If so, I'm surprised this is the first time you've deleted anything by me, considering I make loads of side-remarks and you claim to have been doing this for a long time already. (So you must have been doing it very selectively then.) <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 10:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding complaints that I'm selective... I'm one person doing my best. We're all volunteers here; articles with no references get improved when someone have time, hoax pages get deleted when people notice them, admins are promoted when bureaucrats get around to it. Doing the right thing is still the right thing, even if it can't be done consistently. I have been removing primarily the most egregious examples of off-topic remarks, not indeed in the hope of getting them all, but rather in the hope of illustrating by example what kinds of discussion is definitely outside the purpose of the reference desk. In the long term, I have no intention of being the official reference desk "censor." I'm trying to draw a line in the sand, in order to help bring things back under control. The reference desk is off course, and helping it come back is a matter of applying existing policies, not arguing about new ones. And the reason other people aren't joining me in doing this is, frankly, that I can handle it myself and they have other things to do.</dd>
<dd>Regarding my "hidden agenda"... Yes, the fact that it was a juvenile penis joke is an aggrivating factor in my view. Talk about all the sex organs you like if it answers a question, but if new users think they're going to randomly have crude jokes thrown at them when they ask something not related to sex, it will intimidate them and keep them from using the reference desk. That's not okay, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia not being censored</a> doesn't mean I have to pretend it is. We don't censor <i>content</i>... but we're not talking about content here, now are we? We're talking about a pointless joke.</dd>

<dd>Ok, that's it for me commenting in this section, unless something else goes wrong.

<p>As an admin who frequently posts on the Reference Desk, I think the deletions and the block were completely out of line. SCZenz does not <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the RD, and it is not his/her responsbility to police it. The Reference Desk is, indeed, a fun place, where there are a lot of jokes, but it is also a serious place where lots of questions get answered. Dirk's comment was hardly over the line, and, in fact, was probably perfectly reasonable. I strongly oppose SCZenz's actions, and would suggest taking it to the RD's Talk pages before repeating them. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:40, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SCZenz, that you would be selective was a bit too specific, but the point I was making is that unless this is done consistently there is the risk of unfair selectiveness. To avoid this, it would have to be done by a larger group of people. And to avoid people getting too upset about it, it would have to be done by consensus and we're a long way from that. So far you haven't done too much deleting (you're nowhere near deleting all the of-topic remarks), and you've already got LightCurrent, StuRat and me, three of the most active people on the ref desk, on your neck. Step it up and the ref desk will become one big edit war zone. Don't step it up and you're being selective. The deletion at hand here was one that was much less off-topic than a whole lot of other stuff, so why did you delete this specific one? If you keep this up I will be tempted to start a revolt by applying your rules (<i>your</i> rules!) consistently.</dd>
<dd>You talk about getting the ref desk back on course, but we've both started working on it just over a year ago, and it was the same then as it is now, which is part of the reason I liked it so much.</dd>
<dd>And for the last time, it wasn't a juvenile penis joke. It wasn't a joke. And the other half was informative. But you <i>have</i> now confessed that that was the (extra) reason for deleting it. And that is what I mean by 'selective'.</dd>
<dd>As for the opinion of admins, like I said, it's the opinion of people active at the ref desk that counts, irrespective of whether they're admins.

<dd>You obviously haven't been paying attention. We all agree that certain Ref Desk content may be inappropriate. What we disagree with is that an individual Admin has the right to decide unilaterally which content that is, remove it, and block any user who happens to disagree. And yes, we do feel that people who actually contribute to a project should have more say on the rules for how that project is managed than those who never, or only rarely, contribute. This is because it's very easy to come up with strict rules for others, so long as those rules never apply to you. And, if you never contribute to the Ref Desk, then those rules don't apply to you. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 21:21, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I take strong exception to the suggestion that only those with substantial RD experience can comment on its purpose and direction. But to assuage that criticism, I'll weigh in. I have previously been a substantial contributor at the Science RD, not so much anymore. Besides all the in-jokes about bay-gulls and such, I have found myself turned off by the rather chauvinist tone, whose most extreme form was seen in the thread (previously discussed here) about how a man could force his girlfriend into a sex act she was not comfortable with. I would estimate that at least a third of the "medical" questions there concern male genitals. Let me be clear that I don't propose censoring the RD. I do propose that all RD contributors consider that people from a wide variety of backgrounds see it, and that they address topics with appropriate maturity. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo</a><a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green">100</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 23:07, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, let's say this applied to you. We will say a new position is created, called Admin_Judge. They don't do anything but criticize the actions of Admins, delete and undo what Admins do, and threaten and/or block Admins. They make up their own rules for how Admins must behave, the Admins themselves no longer have any say. If they "discuss" things with Admins, it's only telling the Admins how it's going to be, they don't actually listen to anything an Admin says, no matter how thoroughly the actions of the Admin_Judges are shown to be bad for Wikipedia and a violation of policy.

<dd>As for chauvinistic questions, we now have two feminists as Ref Desk regulars, one sexually liberal and one conservative, so that should provide balance there. I would suspect that most Ref Desk readers are young males, however, as surfing the web in general is mostly a young male thing. So, we would expect to get lots of questions relevant to young males, who would be uncomfortable asking them in an environment that wasn't anonymous. I think it's a good thing to be able to answer questions like "Is it unhealthy if a male doesn't ejaculate regularly". Note that this question might have been asked by a girl, who is being pressured by her b/f into sex using this argument. I have suggested a separate Sexuality Ref Desk, however, to shield the squeamish from such questions and answers. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 06:30, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree this question is appropriate for the RD, which is why I stated "Let me be clear that I don't propose censoring the RD." Rather, I asked that this type of question be approached in a mature fashion. And very often, they are handled appropriately already. Unfortunately, there are also occasions in which this does not seem to be the case. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo</a><a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green">100</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 14:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem of which would be that one doesn't know what might get deleted unless it's done consistently according to a clear set of rules about which some sort of consensus has been reached. One central problem is that it is difficult to keep track of what is being deleted. The histories of the ref desks are way too long to dig through. If some people start to delete stuff it might seem to others that that is normal behaviour. Including others who don't know or understand the rules (if any). And that will (not 'may' but 'will') result in people deleting stuff they don't like. Coming up with a way to keep tabs on deletions is something that should be done first. We need that at the ref desk anyway, because people probably do it already, considering how much vandalism there is on Wikipedia. Encouraging them by giving the wrong example is a very bad idea. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 11:20, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I wonder how one could technically track deletions, though. Perhaps any edit where the result is, say more than 100 bytes shorter than the starting length&#160;? That wouldn't be perfect, but better than no check, I suppose. A "D" could appear in front of such edits in the history, where the "N" for new or "m" for minor edit goes now. We could also allow editors to self identify deletions as they do for minor edits. I wouldn't expect them to do so consistently, though, so the size change check would also be needed. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 12:52, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I missed the bulk of this discussion but as a regular on the subject board I want to make my feelings known.</p>
<p>Most importantly: While I appreciate SCZenz' desire to improve wikipedia and his efforts to do so, I <b>strongly oppose</b> arbitrary censorship. I, personally, am more than willing to put up with a *possibly irrelevant* penis joke (though it actually did have some relevance) in order to protect my own right to make comments as I see fit (fit as being relevant to the discussion at hand although perhaps not popular with some wikipedians).</p>
<p>Other than that, I think that many, if not most, of the contributors are experienced wikipedians and are perfectly capable of policing the desk and dealing with disruptive influences. But it important to remember that one reason many of us like to hang out there is the jokes and banter. Only a part of the reason to be sure but part nonetheless. The intellectual stimulation and, often the tangents, have value to us. If they don't then we can ignore them.</p>
<p>Also, I think that article talk page rules are not analoguous and do not apply. The purpose of article talk pages is to develop an article that complies with wikipedia policy; it is important that they honor those policies. The purpose of the reference desk is to either answer a question or steer the questioner toward the answer. The postings there, especially on the misc. desk, will often consist of original research and may not cite their sources. That is entirely appropriate. The Reference Desks are their own beasts and perhaps need additional policy developed. If such policy needs developing it must be developed through the normal review process.</p>

<p>I note that <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">User:DirkvdM</a> is down to ascribing a "hidden agenda" to SCZenz, and <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">User:StuRat</a> to assuring us that the views of admins are of no account, since admins "would support one another against the user community" anyway. (I don't think he can read ANI much.) Nevertheless I want to register my opinion that this is a matter suitable for handling at this board, and not the kind of thing Thatcher or SCZenz have any need to involve ArbCom in. And I support SCZenz's actions. It goes without saying that the "user community" involved must feel free to request arbitration if they see handling via ANI as inherently unjust. If everything has been said—and having just read the entire thread, I don't see how it could possibly have not been—is it perhaps time for somebody to put one of those snazzy colored frames and stop-talking headings on the thread? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:34, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>On the strange wrestling over talk vs. article pages, the reference desk is a project page. Project pages are like AN, AN/I, AfD, RFA, etc., so that explains the mystery of how they can require signatures, allow some wobbling toward chat, and yet be subject to the rules of staying on topic. Ultimately, we're back to the problem of Internet discussion in general: it takes two people to go off topic. If no one answers, applauds, or condemns the silly jokes and chat, if no one tries to answer the troll questions, then it all stops. When, however, two or three people have the same interest in chat and/or play, then their habits can <i>overwhelm the original purpose,</i> and that's when it becomes appropriate for the other folks to show up and 1) urge, 2) cajole, 3) enforce topicality.</p>
<p>The RD pages have always been prone to "christians are stupid i think dont you" questions and "fags is going to hell" questions, as well as "I am taking a trivia test in a bar and I need to know who invented World War II." These questions invite smart aleck responses or adolescent banter. For the most part, the participants have an internal sense of when they're going off the beam, and therefore trolling questions tend to get no answers. However, because everyone is always new at Wikipedia, eventually those questions will find their own level, attract offended and amused and bored folks.</p>
<p>I agree with the rest of the site showing up to ask RD to stay on topic, but I think it's bad that we've gotten to the point where it becomes adversarial. Generally, RD has stopped chasing the bouncing balls without adversity when a gentle reminder comes in. Like chatter, belligerance takes two sides and bad timing. I think the <i>intentions</i> of David and SC are both pure. The way forward is for more folks to go to RD and keep an eye on when we start frolicking in the meadow and <i>gently</i> reminding each other that we need to stay on task. If it's fifty voices instead of a campaign, the chances of offense are lower. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:29, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My view is that there is a need to keep the Reference Desk from going off-topic and discussing irrelevant stuff. There should be a set of agreed guidelines put up for review to attain consensus, and then the opprobrium of those that don't like this won't fall on one user. If this feels too much like instruction creep, make it a general set of guidelines covering any 'desk' or 'noticeboard' (eg, <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, <a href="../../../h/d/_/WP%7EHD_6530.html" title="WP:HD">WP:HD</a>, <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">WP:RD</a>). I also think that any admins and users regularly involved at the RD should talk to each other to get changes in the culture of 'jokes' and such like stuff. But those admin regulars at the RD should not get involved in blocking to 'control' the RD. Instead, they should post a notice elsewhere (<a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>?), asking an uninvolved admin to judge when a block may be required. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:16, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just want to echo the comments of those who've asked for additional experienced editors to help out at the RD. There's a bit of an ongoing clash there, with people arguing that it's more important to <i>not have censorship</i> than it is to <i>keep the reference desk useful</i>. A couple blocks have been given for people making junvenile sex jokes there, and these blocks have drawn considerable criticism from some reference desk regulars. . Let's all remember that the reference desk needs to be <i>extra friendly</i> to new editors and the general public. More help is appreciated. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really can't see that Odin has done anything out of line here. He mentioned that we'd all been blocked before, and that those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Not a particularly helpful comment, but not a "disgusting attack" either. Note that I was one of the editors mentioned by Odin in his so-called "disgusting attack", and I just can't find any way to be offended. This is really a tempest in a teacup. I guess Odin should doublecheck his comments in such a delicate situation to make sure he won't offend the thin-skinned. But really, Irpen's comments above seem at least as provocative as Odin's. I think all involved should take a deep breath, assume good faith, and get over it. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</sup> 18:39, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wasn't asked to comment, but I shall. Oden has been contributing to the RfC noted above by Irpen, however his contributions haven't been especially helpful. While most editors involved in the discussion have been obviously frustrated with each other and the debate has been quite heated at times, Oden's comments haven't really been about the RfC at hand so much as about policy. For example, he posted a lengthy screed on the RfC talk page about how the RfC has turned into a policy debate, however pretty much the only comments he's made that aren't an attempt to "call out" Irpen have been repeated posts about policy. I don't know if it's intentional or not but he isn't really doing much except to stoke the flames. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebbeng_3c61.html" title="User:Sebbeng">TheQuandry</a> 03:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find his comments on RfC to be offensive and incivil, bordering on trolling (comparing block logs, yeah that gives a true measure... &lt;_&lt;).

<p>Update. Within two hours after I posted the above comment, Oden started mechanically tagging all the fairuse images uploaded by me within last two years with Template:RFU. I regard this as harrassing by way of revenge for my comment above. I see that he specifically targets those images that were uploaded by his opponents. While we should continue to eliminate unfree images, the selective and ad hominem approach practiced by Oden is totally unacceptable. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 14:17, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For a recent example of how this group of editors is steamrollering through various sections of Wikipedia, I point to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes_78a5.html#Disambiguation" title="Talk:List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) episodes">Talk:List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) episodes#Disambiguation</a>, where an earlier naming convention has been attacked, with multiple controversial page moves being pushed through without discussion. The "normal" TMNT editors had earlier this year already gone through several iterations of article naming, finally deciding on a consistent system in February 2006<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41026171" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41026171" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. Then, a couple days ago, as overflow from the dispute at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_2a37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)</a>, an editor from the dispute, in a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, jumped in to the TMNT category and started moving articles around, giving only about 24 hours notice that they were going to start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes&amp;diff=91445042&amp;oldid=71249103" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes&amp;diff=91445042&amp;oldid=71249103" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, and then when no objections immediately surfaced, they proceeded. When the situation was noticed and objections <i>were</i> raised, the talk page has turned into a battleground, as other editors from the NC discussion have poured in. And the pages can't be moved back, because they're editing the redirects to "lock" them<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elementary%2C_My_Dear_Turtle_%28TMNT_1987_episode%29&amp;diff=91742108&amp;oldid=91698905" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elementary%2C_My_Dear_Turtle_%28TMNT_1987_episode%29&amp;diff=91742108&amp;oldid=91698905" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. Please, this group of editors is working its way through multiple sections of Wikipedia, making a <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_court.html" title="Kangaroo court">kangaroo court</a> consensus, and moving many hundreds of articles.

<dd>Elonka's sentence, <i>The "normal" TMNT editors had earlier this year already gone through several iterations of article naming, finally deciding on a consistent system in February 2006</i> boils down to one editor who misplaced one note stating his sole preference. No evidence of either "TMNT editor<b>s</b>" or "several iterations" has been given by Elonka. Just one guy with one iteration all by himself 9 months ago.

<dd>Actually, us normal TMNT editors did agree upon a naming convention that would dilineate the different series so that you could tell which series you were dealing with immediately.

<p>Elonka is asking for someone to say "take it to <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>" — however, dispute resolution is underway. An RfM has been filed, but is currently stalled after the RfM page itself was locked because of an edit war largely perpetrated by Elonka. (Incidentally, I believe that the RfM dispute is settled, and if a neutral party would like to unprotect the RfM page it would be greatly appreciated — the admins hoping to participate in the mediation have been asked not to unlock the page ourselves.)</p>
<p>What Elonka calls a "kangaroo court consensus" is the result of extensive discussion at <a href="../../../t/v/-/WT%7ETV-NC_ba10.html" title="WT:TV-NC">WT:TV-NC</a>. Elonka feels that due to some irregularities in an earlier straw poll, no consensus has been reached on the guideline; she is calling for a second poll. However, subsequent to that poll a supermajority of participating editors expressed support for the existing guideline, and the <i>discussion</i> following the poll showed a strong supermajority supporting the principle "disambiguate only when necessary". Most editors on the page consider this a consensus, but Elonka vocally disputes this.</p>
<p>Incidentally, at least five admins have examined and/or participated in the discussion at <a href="../../../t/v/-/WT%7ETV-NC_ba10.html" title="WT:TV-NC">WT:TV-NC</a>, and all five have agreed that a consensus exists for the current guideline.

<dd>The problem here is all users need to calm down, take two steps back and take a deep breath, all this moving helps nothing; Especially if mediation is to be successful, I advise that it stops until consensus can be achieved. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 20:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually "all this moving" is just the result of following a policy, making the naming of wikipedia pages more consistent and in line with <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D">WP:D</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/-/WP%7ETV-NAME_0ad5.html" title="WP:TV-NAME">WP:TV-NAME</a>. On the other hand, I don't know what insisting that consensus doesn't exist when it clearly does, insisting that an active guideline should not be followed, and trying to change a guideline without consensus via revert warring helps. It's just disruptive. And it should be noted, the guideline is no longer marked as "disputed" (it never should have been in the first place as there wasn't consensus for that addition) and it looks like this issue is not going to mediation. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:23, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Elonka have finally found something we can agree on. I also think that both the current RM's should be speedily closed...and all pages moved per the clear consensus on each. As WP:RM says, "Page moves usually take place after five days, or earlier at the discretion of an administrator. The time for discussion may be extended if a consensus has not emerged. Generally speaking, page move requests which have already reached consensus are processed quicker than those which have not." --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 15:06, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am the editor who did the initial page moves at TMNT 1987, which seems to have set off this thread. I went on an unplanned wikibreak after those moves and have just returned to find all this; I apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>I made the moves at TMNT 1987 in the following context:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of unnecessary disambiguation was pointed out by tiZom three months previously, and he made a suggestion at that point that they be moved;</li>
<li>No one voiced any opinions in those three months, indicating to me that there were no strong feelings one way or the other;</li>
<li>A study of the talk page history revealed no reasons had been stated for the pages to be named using a non-standard naming convention;</li>
<li>A further study of the issue revealed no apparent consensus either for or against using a non-standard naming convention for this series; indeed, no consensus-building discussion had ever been started on the issue, let alone completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all this into consideration, and feeling like much of my wikienergy lately had been devoted only to talk pages, I took the opportunity to be bold and help improve Wikipedia in this small way.</p>
<p>I was not acting as a "representative from TV:NC," but as a Wikipedia editor. Had another editor, perhaps tiZom, made those page moves, would the present escalation have occurred? If my participation in the discussions at TV:NC precludes me from freely editing and attempting to improve Wikipedia, then how may I officially remove myself from that discussion?</p>
<p>I would like to point out that if any editors feel that the TMNT 1987 episodes should have their own specialized naming convention, why not present the argument at the TMNT 1987 page? If a consensus-building discussion resolves that a non-standard naming convention should be followed, I will be more than happy to go through and replace the suffixes myself. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyRush_795a.html" title="User:TobyRush">Toby Rush</a> ‹ <big><a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobyRush_3687.html" title="User talk:TobyRush">✆</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TobyRush_fac0.html" title="Special:Contributions/TobyRush">✍</a></big> › 18:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Consulting the Right to Vanish page, "[t]he Wikipedia projects will delete personal contributors at their request, provided it is not needed for administrative purposes." If this person has abandoned his previous account, then he cannot be accused of sockpuppetry, and thus, there is no administrative reason to include his personal information (including the previous account), if Zacheus is a person notable to merit an encyclopedia article, then this situation is also moot. It is up to -jkb- to either make a case for sockpuppetry involving that previous account with his personal name, or that the person merits an encyclopedia article. Until such time as he is making this case, there is no real need to include that username in any talk page, or article. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 17:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please keep cool. @ Localzik: poorly coosen name - this is a joke, I guess. The user was an admin-bureaucrat on the czech wikipedia for two years, so I do not think he is that poor to judge what name he choose. And the accounts are notable, as there are dozens of attacks on meta pages, here and on czech wikipedia. The user announced, he wants to stay here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92247275" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92247275" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>), so I must assume, he will harrase here again as he did after some other annoucements of leaving. And ad Puellanivis: I it is noit up to me. I already showed where this user manipulated the community. The user mus show, that he will not. See e.g. his lies about my - as he says - deleted pages on the Czech wiki (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZacheus&amp;diff=92244239&amp;oldid=92242615" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZacheus&amp;diff=92244239&amp;oldid=92242615" rel="nofollow">here</a> and some 5 next ones).

<dd>Point taken. @-jkb-: your position appears well justified, I will not argue with that. Personal attacks are inappropriate, and expressing that he has done personal attacks before, and continues to do so under a new name is appropriate, even if that previous name is his full name. As an admin-bureaucrat, I certainly think it clear that he should have had sufficient knowledge to judge the quality of his name before he chose it. @Zacheus: Sorry, but it looks like the cat is out of the bag, you should have known what you were doing picking your real name to begin with. Envoking a pseudonym in order to evade people whom you have harassed, and continue to harass after envoking a right to vanish can easily be claimed as sock puppetry. Your Right to Vanish only applies if you lay low, drawing attention to yourself after changing your name and then claiming a violation of privacy due to the mentioning of your previous name is readily apparent as your fault, and I don't see any reason for giving you any remedy at all. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 19:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have the impression one part of the situation isn't properly understood by some people here. The identity between the two accounts as such is not at issue. This user did two things in order to gain anonymity: (1) he gave up his old account and started up a new one, <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacheus_ab7c.html" title="User:Zacheus">Zacheus</a> (<a href="../../../z/a/c/User_talk%7EZacheus_b610.html" title="User talk:Zacheus">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zacheus_571d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zacheus">contribs</a>); (2) in parallel, he had his old real-name account renamed to an anonymous abbreviation <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Z._d997.html" title="User:V. Z.">V. Z.</a> (<a href="../../../v/2E/_/User_talk%7EV._Z._5b26.html" title="User talk:V. Z.">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_V._Z._4534.html" title="Special:Contributions/V. Z.">contribs</a>). All he seems to be asking now is that when people have to refer to this old account, they use its current, anonymous handle rather than the old real-name one. This request seems reasonable, as it doesn't prevent anybody of talking about the old account and its contributions. Also, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> explicitly says that proliferation of real-name information should be avoided also in cases "of editors who have requested a change in username, but whose old signatures can still be found in archives". Since under the current circumstances there's no factual need for anybody to refer to the old account <i>under its old handle,</i> I don't see why we shouldn't follow his request. Unless a refusal to do so were merely in retaliation for whatever disruptive he did earlier, but that really ought not to be the case. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Appropriately stated, and I have to agree that someone should be enabled to leave an account behind and start a new one without being claimed as a sockpuppet. But using a cloak of newly aquired anonymity to evade detection and continue harassment, should not be considered appropriate. But again, how was it determined that the two accounts were related? If Zacheus owned his previous contributions, then unfortunately, he has owned them, and those where his signature remained as his full name. There is a lot of difficulty dealing with this matter, as it's a big grey area where it has to be determined where the allowance of personal information that has already been released is appropriate or not. But if Zacheus owned his previous posts, then he linked himself to his old account, which had contained his full name, whether the account was changed to an anonymous initials or not.</dd>

<dd>This is why the Right to Vanish can be so tricky, because you have to literally vanish completely, or you will end up exposing yourself. I have the same problem in real life after a legal name change, I continue to be confronted with my old name all over my company, because the computer systems are insistant on maintaining a recorad of my previous name, which then shows up everywhere. While I entirely empathize with Zacheus and his inability to shed his previous identity, that contained his real name, I cannot see how blocking someone outright for exposing the previous name is justified. I can only imagine that counselling be sought for the person using the full name, and try and reach an agreement that he would refer afterwards to use only their initials, in order to protect the other person's personal name. After having an admin relate that such a disclosure is not necessary for administrative purposes, then continued pushing of his real name would warrant a block. But without notifying -jkb- that such action is inappropriate, it seems unjustified to block him, since he is dealing with prevously disclosed public information. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 21:40, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem of -jkb-'s behaviour lies in the fact that he uses <b>now</b> and intends to use <b>in the future</b> my real name, although the account with this name no longer exists. I have no problem that he used it <b>in the past</b>, but since he does not wish to stop this harassment I see no other solution than to block him. In my view if he wishes to refer to my now abandoned account he should refer by its present name, which is "V. Z."</p>
<p>I personally notified to -jkb- that his behaviour is inappropriate and bannable. But, if you think he should warned by the community as well, I see no problem with that. I don't ask his blocking if he stops his harassment by revealing my real name. -- <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacheus_ab7c.html" title="User:Zacheus">Zacheus</a> 12:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Future Perfect has this one correct, and I find -jkb-'s actions to be borderline harassment. Since all the contribs by User:Vxxxx Zxxxx have been reattributed to <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Z._d997.html" title="User:V. Z.">User:V. Z.</a>, there is no administrative or technical reason to keep the old name around. Pointing out that <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacheus_ab7c.html" title="User:Zacheus">User:Zacheus</a> formerly operated <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Z._d997.html" title="User:V. Z.">User:V. Z.</a> is appropriate, and if a case can be made that V. Z./Zacheus has edited disruptively, then go ahead and make it. But there is no reason to refer to the individual's real name at this point and it begins to become harassment. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 22:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just went deeply through the various pages of discussion on -jkb- and Zacheus's talk pages. There is a lot going on there, and it would seem that this was an argument on the cs: wikipedia, which has now spilled into en:, both sides claiming that the other is in the wrong, both having disclosed each other's personal information, and both claiming that it's not their job to do the admin's work of tracking down sockpuppets, etc. They both say that the history is well established in the cs: wikispace, and while I don't argue that it is, there is no reason to expect English wikipedians to be able to access that information easily. I see below someone is asking for a translation of Zacheus's user page, and I think that is appropriate. Having a trustworthy cs: sysop looped in for a neutral point of view that can follow issues on the cs: side of things may be a good idea. But over all, it looks like this is one big mess of a feud, and we don't have the capacity to easily enforce any issues here on en: unless it's in English. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 22:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The way I see it, Zacheus released the personal information himself and after changing accounts linked himself to the old account. Because of that, we have no obligation to try and keep his personal information hidden. However, it would be nice to do so simply as an act of kindness, as it doesn't do any harm to use initials when referring to the old account. If -jkb- has a good reason to use the full name, he is entitled to, however it appears he's actually doing so simply to annoy Zacheus (I'm not going to even try and decide if Zacheus deserves it or not, I don't really care), which is not allowed under <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHARASS_2733.html" title="WP:HARASS">WP:HARASS</a>. So, to summarise, there is no privacy violation here, but there might well be some harassment going on (possibly both ways). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 23:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From my perspective at checkuser, where this first came up last week, Zacheus was never trying to hide the fact that the renamed account <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Z._d997.html" title="User:V. Z.">User:V. Z.</a> used to be his real name and belongs to him. For example, he has used the Zacheus account to change his old signatures. Since his actions are obvious to even a cursory check of his contribs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/V._Z.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90769092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/V._Z.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90769092" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vít_Zvánovec&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90760209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vít_Zvánovec&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90760209" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>, I think the main point here is to keep his real name off of google searches and so forth. In that context, I can't see any reason to continue using his real name except to keep the drama going. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While he has never tried to hide the rename, he seems to have a practical misunderstanding of the ability to perform a Right to Vanish. I agree that avoiding his full name would be on good standing to avoid this whole issue, but Zacheus has made repeated edits to archived public information. After a sysop or someone corrects his edit, he then decries them as violating his Right to Vanish (after returning the archived information to the original state.) Zacheus would have us perform a massive system wide %s/User Name/U. N./g on every page, and remove his mistake of using his full real name in the first place. Rather than detract prying eyes from his relation to V. Z., he has made a concerted effort to bring those prying eyes to the issue, and would like to see the entire RtV policy rewritten to be a requirement, rather than a best-effort. The RtV policy page on metapedia says in fact itself that no one can really guarentee the RtV exists at all, it's simply asking for a best-effort from people to follow it. As such, people should avoid using the previous name in new content, and Zacheus should avoid damaging archived pages. Both should stop harassing each other, and just let the issue die. As such Zacheus has very few edits that are anything but a campaign against -jkd- and -jkd- has vew edits that are anything but a compaign against the other. If either insists on continuing this behavior, either should be banned temporarily, whether they are underlyingly justified or not. Neither is working towards a solution. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 00:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As Thatcher131 put it I have no problem <b>now</b> if somebody says Zacheus = V. Z., because Datrio has breached my privacy by revealing this fact and this can be no longer hidden. But I <b>do</b> have the problem if somebody says V. Z. is Vxxx Zxxx, since the account Vxxx Zxxx no longer exists and has <b>no</b> edits. Saying V. Z. is Vxxx Zxxx is thus the plain harassment.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I edited the archived pages because they pointed to nowhere and they used my old handle name. RtV says that people should correct broken links. And I did not harass -jkb-, but only very civilly asked him to stop using my real name. That's all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I admit that the account Zacheus is one-purpose only, because after my experience with -jkb- I expected his behaviour. I use another account for ordinary work and I don't intend to provide it since it would target of another harassment. If you banned the account Zacheus (for what reason?) it would prevent me to use this another account legally. Thank you.</dd>

<dd>I disagree about your interpretation of Right to Vanish. I think if he wants to change archives (merely to change his name Vxxxx Zxxxx to V. Z., that is fine. Of course, it leaves a trail a mile wide to his current name, but it would have the effect of making his name difficult to find on a casual google search. I helped him change the checkuser case archive with his name on it, and I don't particular care if he changes other archives, as long as he is only doing the name change. He should not be changing pages in other user's space, but I would also prefer that jkb not use his full name. He was kicked off the cs Wikipedia under his full name, but he has not done anything here to hide from or avoid so there is no reason to use his full name here.</dd>
<dd>On your other point I agree wholeheartedly. I have obtained a partial translation of his user page and he is replying, in Czech, to other users on cs with whom he can no longer converse since he is banned there. If Zacheus wants his right to vanish to be respected, he should stop importing drama from cs. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate the effort to protect his privacy, but is there any reason we don't simply ban this troll as well? Zacheus clearly has no intention to contribute anything useful to the encyclopedia. Since his banning from cs, he's continued to troll here and on Meta, continuing uncivil language, wasting our time, and <b>done nothing useful</b>. And we already know he's a troll (banned by the cs arbcom).

<dd>I guess I'm wishy-washy on it. On the one hand, if he stopped using his user page to carry on the drama from cs, I'd be willing to leave him alone to see if he will become a good contributor. His prior account <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Z._d997.html" title="User:V. Z.">V. Z.</a> (<a href="../../../v/2E/_/User_talk%7EV._Z._5b26.html" title="User talk:V.

Z.">contribs</a>) has over 700 mainspace edits, which is not a lot, but not chicken feed either. On the other hand, part of his arb case involved rather serious allegations of privacy violations on his part, and he hasn't done anything since he arrived here except carry on the cs drama. I certainly wouldn't stick my neck out to unban him if someone else banned him. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoa there. Clerks shuffle papers, I don't have access to the checkuser function. I made the same determination Sarah did, that Canuckster and Ottawaman are the same person, based on their single-minded focus on smearing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ignatieff_85c9.html" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> and style of edits and edit summaries. (AFAIK, JohnnyCanuck is VaughanWatch, a different banned user obsessed with a different Canadian politician.) Ottawaman was blocked for trolling and incivility, extended to indefinite when he created another sockpuppet account and used it to fraudulently certify an abusive RFC against Sarah. Canuckster is now banned for a week for more trolling. To Canuckster I suggest sitting out the rest of the week without editing from IP addresses to evade the block, which was well deserved. When the block expires, hopefully you can be a productive and cooperative editor. If you insist on continuing to try and smear Michael Ignatieff or harass admins who are just doing their job, you will quickly join the ranks of permanently banned editors. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:00, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She has also approached other editors on the talk page with a distinct lack of good faith (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2005_New_Zealand_election_funding_controversy#Third_party_campaigning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2005_New_Zealand_election_funding_controversy#Third_party_campaigning" rel="nofollow">"Third party campaigning" and below on talk</a>) and has accused <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">User:Gadfium</a> of ...trying to obstruct the truth. There may be legal implications." I don't know if this is now some kind of legal threat, but her edits, and justifications are IMO POV-pushing and abusive. I've suggested, perhaps too soon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gadfium#2005_New_Zealand_election_funding_controversy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gadfium#2005_New_Zealand_election_funding_controversy" rel="nofollow">semi-protection of the page</a> to Gadfium, however to his credit, he suggested compromise. I don't want to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, but I think now there needs to be some intervention from an uninvolved admin to explain to her the need for NPOV and civility, and the 3RR rule. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 11:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A warning or explanation on her Talk might have helped, I have now left one. If this continues she can be blocked briefly and if necessary the article semi-protected, but hopefully some calm discourse, combined with letting her know how Wikipedia works, will have the desired effect. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just blocked Puneetsquare (<a href="../../../p/u/n/User_talk%7EPuneetsquare_75e3.html" title="User talk:Puneetsquare">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Puneetsquare_8499.html" title="Special:Contributions/Puneetsquare">contribs</a>) for 24 hours for persistently adding a non-notable person to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockdale_High_School_53de.html" title="Stockdale High School">Stockdale High School</a> despite warnings not to. For the next 72, I'll be sparse around here, so can I have a few others watch this article? The user was operating through IP addresses for a lot of yesterday (presumably while at school) so the block probably won't really hold in that sense. Also, the user's most recent action before the blocking was to install pop-ups and turn-on the ability to revert easily, so I would guess that the intention is to keep reverting any people who keep the person out of the article.</p>
<p>The person is the very definition of non-notable and probably is the user who keeps adding it. The section that keeps getting added is about a kid (Puneet Singh--note the relation to the user) who wrote a letter to the editor that was published in a local newspaper. If anyone wants to add any protection to the article, that's fine too, I didn't feel it was totally necessary for one user's actions right now. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 11:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have just discovered that she blanked her talkpage before calling me simple-minded - she seemingly does not intend to stop editing.
