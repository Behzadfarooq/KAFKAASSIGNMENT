<dd>Good question. I take it reversion isn't stopping the repeated addition? What about leaving it in place, once, with the comment "this is irrelevant". The comment is certainly out of left field, but it seems more or less harmless. Perhaps this poster would be satisfied by having it on the talk page (and if it is subsequently otherwise ignored, the poster will have their answer... no one takes it seriously). I dunno if that idea helps or not. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your idea helps. Next time I probably will leave it in place with a comment. But it is offensive enough that someone else will delete it. (I'm just the latest who has warned the user on the user's <i>latest</i> talk page. Other users have posted similar warnings on all the other talk pages.) Anyway, it is strange ... but I've seen weirder on WP. Cheers!Wassupwestcoast 01:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure that sending messages to 12 users' talk pages justifies a 48 hour block. This is the first time that he has done this kind of spamming, and may not be aware of the policy.

<li>I'm somewhat sympathetic to Dean's underlying point -- that articles about enterprises can result in some of the same problems as articles about living persons. (Not, IMHO, all of the same problems, though). Unfortunately, Dean's <a href="../../../t/i/g/WP%7ETIGERS_f7f0.html" title="WP:TIGERS">tiger-ish</a> approach to persuading the community isn't doing him any good. His point is interesting and deserves to be presented by the community, but it would benefit by being taken up by a patient, experienced editor. If I had the time, I would offer to take on an advocacy for Dean, but I don't, so I don't really have a solution. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was "paging" people who have already participated in a discussion about a proposed change in Wikipedia policy.

<dd>About this Category:Criticisms of Fundamentalism, I speculate that the intention is to put books critical of religion and books written by religious authors against fundamentalism into the same category; thereby implying, as critics have, that Dawkins et al. misrepresent "true" religion. After some thinking, I removed <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> from this category because it's notability rests on his attack of <i>moderate religion</i>. In any case, I don't think this is a very neutral use of categories and this users talk page makes me worry because he should already be quite aware that categories shouldn't be used like this. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 21:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

There is commentary in the edit summaries, but it's not very enlightening, and the talkpage is completely empty except for tags. Can anyone else figure this out or maybe someone involved in a relevant project can take a look at it. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I hope no one minds, but I hit the page, looked through it, and hit the talk page. perhaps a debate moderator role is needed, and I jumped in. If this is some sort of wiki-nono, then I'll back off, but I think a little conversation's the first step. I've also notified all the editors who seem actively involved and who edited in the last 3 or 4 days. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:48, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(This was posted here before(around 5, Eastern standard time), but due to an edit conflict and some cut n paste oopses of my own, got prematurely archived. I'm reposting now.)

He maintains a version of the article on his own talk page in which much of the criticism is conspicuously absent, <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._Tohu%26Bohu_Huckabee_05d7.html" title="User:A.J.A./Tohu&amp;Bohu/Huckabee">User:A.J.A./Tohu&amp;Bohu/Huckabee</a>, and it appears he has no intentions of ever standing down on this, no matter what sources, style of writing, or what-have-you is done. In the past couple days, this has ramped up severely. He is now on my talk page asserting that by callign his undiscussed repeated removals 'blanking vandalism' i've horribly insulted him. He's now nearly obsessed with seeing me completely apologize for all my comments suggesting he should elaborate on his thinking, all my referrals to his undiscussed actions as hostile, incivil, and then vandalism. When he was talking, it waas one thing, we could try to work it out. But his explanations got fewer and fewer, his reversions and removals more and more frequent, and after a while, it passed from content dispute to edit warring, and now it's really hitting incivility and vandalism. I'd appreciate some other editors looking into this. I'm going to leave the page alone for 24 hours for review.

<p>Multiple users keep reverting to a critical version that links to a bunch of attack blogs and removing the cleanup tags. I don't know who this guy is (just came across it a week or so ago on recent-changes patrol), and frankly don't care if his page is positive or negative, but by <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> we can't have a negative bio that sources its info only from blogs.

<dd>Oh and it was a particulary sticky situation because he made it seem like it hadn't been deleted, the article history dated back to early January and the deletion by Mailer Diablo was in February.

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">This stuff is a good example of where people have been wanting to go. By continually treating WP:NPA as if it said that "personal attacks" result in blocks, we have made over half the threads on AN/I about "I got insulted! I got attacked! I want him or her blocked!" If that weren't enough, we're sitting right in the middle of a pile of "could it conceivably be interpreted as hostile in any way, and, if so, can I possibly block?" So we get brush-offs as attacks, attacks as threats, and then blocks for content disputes and because someone said (past tense) a thing. Oh, happy! Troll heaven! We can bring all editing to a halt by going to AN/I, claiming to be intimidated, and then getting blocks thrown.</td>

<p>I have repeatedly complained about <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">User:Aaliyah Stevens</a>' wikistalking me.

In two or three of the edits she correctly enforces <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a>, but for the most part she just harasses me.</p>
<p>First instance of wikistalking on January 10, 2007:</p>

<p>Thank you. I have a follow-up question. I can see the user is indeed blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AKankura" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AKankura" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, but I can see nothing on the user talk page. Is this normal, as I do sometimes see this? I ask because I have in the past made the mistake of requesting a block for a user who, as it turns out, was already blocked. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 09:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't need account creation enabled to do that. Just use "block anonymous users only". If you do that and block account creation, the vandal can't get in. It may inflict some damage on other unregistered users from that address though, but I think that allowing creation would simply lead to them creating an account. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>What has prompted me to bring this here, though, after so many months, is that even though we've tried to drill it into his head (not using templatised messages), he still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Storm05&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110051325" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Storm05&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110051325" rel="nofollow">continues</a> to say he's right, totally ignoring valid concerns, and at the same time behaving incivilly - answering every warning he's given with "Wrong." or "Incorrect." when it's obvious he's in the wrong, and just looking for some way out. Are we really going to allow users to get through loopholes in unclear situations?</p>
<p>This user generally is not a net positive to the project - he's been <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tropical_cyclones_Archive_10_d229.html#Copyvios_in_articles" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tropical cyclones/Archive 10">caught adding copyright violations</a> to articles and has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Storm05" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Storm05" rel="nofollow">blocked previously</a> for ignoring consensus after <i><b>SIX</b></i> warnings to him, over a period of a few weeks, but he continued disrupting against consensus.</p>
<p>His Wikipedia-space edits to XFD are totally to say "delete per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>" etc, and then with no clear need for it, tags articles <i>already at AFD</i> {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}}. He has also twice in the past been warned for canvassing at AFD (both AFDs were against his own articles, one of which was no consensus and the other a delete).</p>
<p>Is there any reason such a user is still on Wikipedia? Are we going to keep him around until he gets the foundation sued, because he DELIBERATELY mis-licenses his images when he's already been told <b>time and time again</b> that he cannot do so?</p>
<p>I think it's time that he be indef'd, and I think it would be a preventative block. I welcome input, although it is my opinion that such users are a detriment to the project.</p>

<dd>I was just explaining for the user asking, why you don't have a user page. From time to time is a generic term that certainly encompasses "often". I did not comment on whether you should or should not have a user page in answering the question. Sorry if I gave offense, it was not intentional. But now that you mention it, while I agree there is no firm requirement, I do think it's reasonable to expect an admin to have something on their user page, however small, that users can find when they have questions, rather than being redlinked, and the user's remark that one wasn't there seemed reasonable to me. That's just my opinion, I'm not claiming it is a generally held sentiment. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having a redlink userpage instead of a redirect to one's user talk page is pretty much done just to annoy people, much like voting oppose in every RfA and so on, but there's no actual policy against it... so he can continue, if he really likes annoying half of Wikipedia over something so petty. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) It serves no useful purpose to not have one, and it makes you less approachable for many users. I know I often check out userpages before leaving messages, and I rather doubt I'm the only one. While you're not required to have one, I do remember your personal policy statement that we should stick to best practices at all times, even when it's not mandatory, or something to that effect.</p>
<p>That said, oddly, I support Jeff's desire/right/privilege/whatever to have the thing redlinked. I've certainly defended having a transcluded .sig for quite some time (including to the developer that wrote the code to prevent people from doing that), which some people find annoying, and I think the instant matter is a good example of why everything not mandatory is <i>not</i> prohibited.</p>
<p><span class="user-sig user-Adrian"><i>—<b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> <small>2007-02-21 09:51Z</small></i></span></p>
<p>In answer to Jeffrey's question "why?": (1) because it's distracting to have completely unnecessary redlinks (the least important reason, but still true), (2) because it suggests (incorrectly in your case, to be sure) that the user has not yet fully engaged with the community, and (3) because it misleads people not familiar with you into underestimating your role on the project. The latter concern is not a purely theoretical one, I will add, although it is complicated to capture just how without violating the "all contributors are equal" ethos we rightly have here. A couple of months ago, in discussion of one of the controversial Philwelch blocks which occurred at a time when he had a deleted userpage and a redlinked username, it turned out that Phil had tried to explain policy on something to the editor, and the editor had disregarded the explanation because, in substance, he assumed that anyone too inexperienced to have created their userpage yet was unlikely to be a fount of policy experience and advice. The editor indicated that had he realized the person making suggestions was an experienced editor and admin (the former being as important as the latter, really), he would have reacted very differently. So other than being different for the sake of being different, why do it? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 11:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>For me, it basically boils down to the fact that he's doing something that people are saying "Hey, this annoys me" and it wouldn't effect him to change it or let someone change it, but he says "No, you can't make me, I am going to continue annoying you because I can." And yeah, he can. We all could do a lot of things that annoy eachother but aren't technically against any rule. Thankfully, most of us don't. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the point first raised, of it making Jeff any harder to contact: I think that would be a very good point if he had no link at all, to either talk page or redlinked user page (as I raised recently for unrelated reasons at <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a>), and a half-decent one if he <i>only</i> had the redlink. However, as he links directly to his talk page (and actually, to both), I don't really see any substance to that. Personally, I'd have a distinct preference for admins (specifically) having user pages, and I recall this arising as an issue in some RfAs. Beyond that, I'm not sure there's much of a "so what", as clearly Jeff is aware of several people's such preferences, and as been noted, it's not against policy. However, it does seem extremely pointless to have a <i>link</i> to the lack of a user page (unless the point <i>is</i> to annoy people, or to make a "I deleted my user page" 'statement', or something along those lines, to speculate freely). Perhaps he might consider de-linking the user page from his signature, while he chooses not to have one. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I came across <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a> today for the first time when it was proposed as a redirect target for the Brian Peppers article during today's DRV. I took a look at the article, and in addition to a paragraph about Peppers (which I didn't think belonged here but which, to be fair, was more reasonable than any other Peppers write-up I have seen), there was a lengthy section called "People" about a number of mostly private individuals who have become famous, or infamous, typically because of something embarrassing they did that was captured on-camera or online and became an "internet meme." Many of these paragraphs raised concerns in my mind regarding notability, verifiability, and appropriateness for inclusion in light of privacy and related issues. I edited to delete a couple of the paragraphs I found most questionable. The paragraphs were restored shortly thereafter, with the reasonable observation that most of the entries linked to existing Wikipedia <i>articles</i> on these people and events, and therefore it didn't make sense to challenge the individual paragraphs. I mentally filed this as something that would be better addressed after the Peppers DRV was over.</dd>
<dd>Shortly thereafter, Sam Blanning initially closed the Peppers DRV with a result of redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a>. (The redirect was changed to a straight keep-deleted after Peppers was deleted from the List article.) At that point, I described this article as a "WP:LIVING/privacy/notability horror show," which it was. Doc, who has substantial experience with OTRS/BLP issues, seems to have decided to become pro-active on this article and his observation that sources are required is of course correct, although actually, in some instances sources will probably be simply cut-and-pasted from the linked articles themselves. But in addition to the sourcing issue, several of these paragraphs and linked articles will raise the question of whether the embarrassing content of the material and resulting damage that private individuals may suffer from keeping it on Wikipedia warrants our retaining this material in our encyclopedia <i>even if it were to be deemed fully sourced and true</i>—issues similar to those raised in the Peppers debate today.</dd>
<dd>I hope these issues can be addressed without having to block contributors, especially those who feel strongly about matters of principle. Today's deletion debate on Brian Peppers, contrary to expectation, was <i>not</i> grossly overrun with trolls and SPAs. There were some, to be sure, but there were also a lot of good Wikipedians sharing their ideas and points of view; and as much as I endorse the closure coming when it did (and opposed holding the debate in the first place, as regular AN/ANI readers will recall), <i>much</i> of the general tone was reasonable. I hope that the same will be true of discussions resulting from this article. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In fairness I engaged in extensive discussion with Jmaynard, as can be seen. But with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living persons</a> we err on the side of removal of material. I repeatedly explained he could replace what he sourced. However, when he replaced all the unsourced material, calling my removal 'vandalism', my hand was forced. Yes, we need to carefully negotiate issues such as privacy and notability, as here we have nuanced opinion. An here blocking good wikipedians would certainly not be an option. Discussion is the way forward. But BLP is core policy and non-negotiable - it is intolerable to revert it as vandalism. I'm rather expecting to be endorsed on this one.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This sounds backwards. This is the list, cataloging these phenomena, summarizing them and pointing wikilinks to articles on them. The <i>list</i> doesn't need references for anything which is referenced in the WP article pointed to. Jay's right that referencing on the list too is silly. If there are BLP problems with the target articles, fix those; if the list comments inaccurately summarize the target article, fix that, but deleting it off the list due to BLP seems very wrong.

<dd>I agree in the cases where we actually have articles on them, but some of the entries (like the infamous Brian Peppers) are too short for their own articles, so either shouldn't be mentioned at all, or must have references on the List page if they are. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 05:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you were to have read the articles you knocked off the list, many of them did have sources inside the articles themselves. A simple list does not need a source on every single little thing. I understand you're trying to follow WP:BLP, but blocking someone who's adding references in to what you deleted in an attempt to make it satisfactory to WP:BLP is way out of line. B=Plus, you appeared to block him while he was in progress of adding these citations. I'd say more but really, he did nothing blockable. He violated 1RR at best, and tried to improve on what was there.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 06:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry. No. The List didn't just contain a list of articles (if it did then it would be a category) - it made statements about the individuals concerned. BLP states all such must be sourced. The onus is not on me to fish the sources from elsewhere or other articles and to check they say what they are claimed to say. The onus is on the one who wishes to keep the statements to source them and then replace them. BLP is deliberately designed that way to make sure we err on the side of exclusion not inclusion. If it was that easy to source the statement on the list, then those that wished them kept should have done that and replaced them rather then fighting me. We've have our policy this way so that busy people like me that specialise in BLP enforcement can do our job without let or hinderance. Bulk replacing material removed under BLP without sourcing it is quite unacceptable - and the party was well warned.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 09:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For some time, an anonymous user has been re-inserting a joke/insult to Derek Bell into the article listed above. Recently, that same anonymous user registered an account, and has persisted in his reversion, claiming that it should be included because people like it and it was part of old versions of the article. This isn't a pure content dispute, since it cuts across BLP issues, and he isn't listening to me and doesn't seem willing to check policy pages. From his other edits, it also appears that he could use some help with things like signing his posts and fair use image guidelines, but I'm pretty sure that he won't be disposed to hear about them from me. If it's not too much trouble, would one of you mind having a word with him? I don't want to see this escalate any further, since he's made some good contributions in other areas, and I'd rather not see him get blocked for doing something dumb out of ignorance. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a vandal in an IP block which I'd define as 81.145.2*.*. He is continuously vandalizing <i><a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a></i> articles, talk pages, and the user pages of its editors, including multiple death threats to <a href="../../../e/t/e/User%7EEternal_Pink_861b.html" title="User:Eternal Pink">User:Eternal Pink</a>.

It's an irregular range, I think, so the best I can figure is the following three blocks:

That or our little friend has had a change of heart. I'd like to put in a little more thought/discussion before we decide if a mass-sprotect or some rangeblocking is in order, but given the scope and duration of this nonsense, I'd say it's clear that at least one of the two is justified. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 20:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

Anything I say does not seem to be understood, and the user continues to rant about things which don't actually seem to have happened. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhabs_66a6.html" title="User:Khabs">Khabs</a> 01:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Most of the reverts were uncalled for. Who's stalking who? You probably should cease knee-jerk reverting everything the other editor adds to the project if you want anyone to believe your statement is in good faith. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 02:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I marked the article Travis Steedle for deletion. Suddenly 3 people sprung up on the talk page to say what a great guy he was. All the accounts (including the original, Zclark111) were created within hours of each other. I suspect they may be sockpuppets or meatpuppets. The people involved are:</p>

<p>Here is one example:</p>

Note he reposted someone else's complaint after it had already been deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>He blanks his talk page to remove any complaints against him:</p>

(ironic, given the debate on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template_talk%7EWikiProjectBanners_a662.html" title="Template talk:WikiProjectBanners">Template talk:WikiProjectBanners</a>) I <i>really</i> want to have a legitimate discussion about the issue I raised, but no one's going to want to get involved as long as he keeps pushing for a fight. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know that arguing about it is valid reason to delete the comments, even if it may deter others from participating... I don't know that it reaches the level of disruptive yet, he clearly feels strongly about it and is making reasonable if forceful comments, unless I missed something. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I really feel he's just venting his frustrations from the previous dispute I was in with him. <a href="../../../t/a/l/Template_talk%7ETalkheader_Archive_2_12eb.html#Bot" title="Template talk:Talkheader/Archive 2">Template talk:Talkheader/Archive 2#Bot</a>. What's the point of assuming good faith and asking people to be nice if you can't actually do anything about it? If I had <i>deleted</i> his comments I could understand, but I moved them to his talk page and then noted that I had moved them and provided a link. It's inappropriate and it's getting in the way of legitimate discussion. Is it not reasonable to at least allow one to move the comments in light of what I have brought up? -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Usually no; some uninvolved third party may want to get involved and talk to him politely, but I don't think moving the comments is the right thing.

<dd>I just noticed that the link I gave from Template talk:Talkheader doesn't have the actual dispute stuff, so it's not really a good example of what happened. Whatever, though, forget it, it's been shot to shit anyways and I'll have to give up on that discussion (no one will want to get involved). If you ask me, it's pretty shitty that if you make someone mad in the past they can just get away with what Quadzilla99 is doing to that discussion, and that no one will stand up for you because they disagree with you on an XfD relating to that page. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:49, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. As one of my grunt tasks, I watch <a href="../../../p/l/e/PlentyofFish_cca3.html" title="PlentyofFish">PlentyofFish</a> as there seems to be an issue with repeated reinsertions of some guy's non-RS complaints against the admins on that site. Just went through a string of reverts with a single-purpose account, Rebeltiger. I went 4 reverts without thinking about it and, although it is probably not an issue in this case, I recently seemed to have been scratched off a couple of admins Christmas lists and did not want to take a chance so I self-reverted. Usually there is another editor or two there so there is back-up but apparently not tonight. Can someone give me a hand, please?

<p><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">User:NetOracle</a> has recently gone on something of a AfD spree, proposing for deletion or supporting the deletion of many webcomic-related articles on grounds of notability (always without first applying a notability template to allow for cleanup by authors). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Killroy_and_Tina" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Killroy_and_Tina" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/El_Goonish_Shive" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/El_Goonish_Shive" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Blatant_Comics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Blatant_Comics" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Parking_Lot_is_Full&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108018853" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Parking_Lot_is_Full&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108018853" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greeneyes_%28second_nomination%29#Greeneyes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greeneyes_%28second_nomination%29#Greeneyes" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alternative_Brand_Studios#Alternative_Brand_Studios" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alternative_Brand_Studios#Alternative_Brand_Studios" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_noob_%28Second_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_noob_%28Second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> While some of these arguments doubtless have merits, his unflinching desire to delete <i>anything</i> webcomic-related seems very suspicious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NetOracle#Webcomic_articles_and_notability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NetOracle#Webcomic_articles_and_notability" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> (see bolded text by Erk).

<p>NetOracle’s focus on deletion nominations (<a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=NetOracle&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=NetOracle&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">edit count</a>) looks a bit odd and the manner in which those nominations are done falls far short of the best current practice. However, I find it important to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> here. NetOracle’s understanding of the distinction between policies and other project pages seems hazy<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Killroy_and_Tina&amp;oldid=108561341" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Killroy_and_Tina&amp;oldid=108561341" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> and the nominations are annoyingly vague and repetitive.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEl_Goonish_Shive&amp;diff=109333682&amp;oldid=109332819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEl_Goonish_Shive&amp;diff=109333682&amp;oldid=109332819" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> The nominations don’t seem to be preceded by any other effort to improve articles, such as tagging them or posting on talk pages; this is not very polite towards editors working on those articles. Also, the description of AFD contributors as ‘kooks [who] belong on fan wikis and in chatrooms, and not on a place whose goal is intellectual writing of a meaningful nature’<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109408764" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109408764" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> is discordant with AGF and <a href="../../../n/e/w/WP%7ENEWBIES_6840.html" title="WP:NEWBIES">WP:NEWBIES</a> (the latter due to the webcomics-related noise off-wiki having attracted new editors). While it’s not an actionable matter, NetOracle’s actions have furthermore unnecessarily caused some bad feelings off-wiki. I’d like somebody uninvolved to consider talking to NetOracle about these things to ensure better communication and cooperation in the future. Nevertheless, I do not currently see a need for administrative intervention.<br />
Note: I am or have been involved in several related deletion discussions and cannot claim to be unbiased. Also, while I have focused on NetOracle’s behaviour here, some editors opposing him have displayed attitudes and behaviour which I cannot endorse, either. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 18:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Final Note</b> - I'm going to have my peace, and then I'm done here. Administrators - please block my account indef; I don't intend to return.</p>
<p>I've been reading Wikipedia for years. It is, by far, the most informational site on the entire Internet. I never contributed regularly or as a non-anon, because I never had the time. I was reading Wikipedia during a recent vacation, and saw some errors which needed corrected - this is when I registered my account. After performing some editing, I came across <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_HEC_%28html%29_149d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/HEC (html)">an article</a> which I thought didn't belong, so I read up on the deletion process and other meta-functions, and went ahead and proposed it. This was my first experience with the insane deletion process here.</p>
<p>It was after that that I saw the insane deletion process, and a complete mess at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ugly_Hill_e38e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ugly Hill">a certain AfD</a>, that I began to lose faith in Wikipedia. But, because this is a Wiki, I decided to try and create a push to enforce existing policy and keep the site clean of non-notable material, just as others try to keep it <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleaning_up_vandalism_4314.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleaning up vandalism">free of vandalism</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">free of spam</a>, and free of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">harmful hoax edits</a>. As I intended to become a serious editor, I tried to do my part in cleanup so that I didn't feel as if my time was being wasted, and my edits diluted by non-notable cruft, and other materials of little to no academic interest. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't jump head-first into heavy editing, and instead learned of the direction in which Wikipedia is headed as a direct result of the broadening userbase. Several editors have raised the non-issue of my comparatively small number of edits in article space, and no amount of reason seems to convey to them that non-notable material, and other forms of cruft, is a serious detriment to Wikipedia's reputation, and results in the discouragement of many serious and academically-focused editors who really don't want to be part of a cesspool of cruft, tribute pages, and non-notable pop culture.</p>
<p>Apparently, though, no other active editors seem to share my concern of Wikipedia being overrun with fancruft, and the only people who do actually care are shaking their heads in silent dismay. Even though such material may be well-written (and in the case of the articles I nominated for deletion, it was), the issue is that it simply is out of place, and goes into an inappropriate level of detail, after failing to convince an impartial person reading the article for information (not for editing) of the notability of the subject. The very best how-to guide still needs to be deleted from Wikipedia, as Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a how-to or <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_03f9.html" title="DIY">DIY</a> website; a similar approach needs to be taken to articles whose subjects may be known and loved by a small majority, but aren't notable in the grand scheme of things, and don't exert very much influence on media, culture, society, and humanity in general.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing to beat my head against the wall here, and make relatively little progress, I'll just do other things with my time and use other sites for reference. There is no point in trying to be intelligent on what is becoming more and more like a community bulletin/graffiti board every day, with standards approaching <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> as <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limit_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Limit (mathematics)">t approaches infinity</a>. The majority of editors don't seem to care that Wikipedia is becoming a giant repository of random/useless trivia, tribute pages, and fancruft in general. Wikipedia is not my site, and I don't hold delusions that it is going to change to fit my vision and my vision alone. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 00:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a place for melodrama, and touching though your account is, it glosses over the apparent malice with which you pursued these AfD's. I don't think anyone is disputing that several of them were deserving. But when you went on a nominating spree unchecked by out-of-site verification of non-notability ("This may be one of the few notable webcomics") and—in my opinion, more importantly—unchecked by any attempt to use in-article templates to suggest cleanup and sourcing, your editlog just reads like that of an editor with a vendetta.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I encourage you, and all other similarly-minded editors, to participate in and make the most of the Wiki process. Despite your assertion of, "[beating your] head against the wall here, and [making] relatively little progress," you did successfully remove quite a few bits of fancruft encroachment, and I appreciate that they are gone. If you'd like to continue your work to make this project a place you can call your "intellectual home", so to speak, I'd just ask that you use <b>all</b> the tools available to you, not just AfD, to get the appropriate actions taken.</dd>

<dd>NHN, I am a relative newcomer to the policy side of the Project, and I could not spot the proper heading to affix to a RFCU. Indeed, the text, "Other disruption of articles: List on Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents," on that page was what caused me to come here in the first place. So, please don't <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7Ebite_fe9c.html" title="WP:bite">bite</a>.

<dd>Now, if you take issue with whether he's been disruptive, that's fine. But you're embroiled in all of this, as well, for better or worse, so I don't think your view is strictly objective.

<dd>I had already discussed this on IRC with him. Then when the bot started up again, I again attempted to contact him and he didn't respond this time. This was not an out of the blue action. OF course, next time you could do the polite thing and ask me personally what was going on, which I see you didn't. I would be glad to explain, yet you didn't give me the chance. This is extremely rude behaviour, taking it to AN without even asking the blocking admin. Wangi acted just as rudely by reversing my block without asking either. It does say "Remember, there was probably a good reason for the person to be blocked. Please discuss the block with the blocking sysop before unblocking."

<dd>I'm allowed to have a discussion about behaviour privately. You accused me of blocking without warning. However, I'm just saying that isn't the case, I already had discussed it with betacommand.

<dd>I took it to AN because you can't just take it upon yourself to block an admin without any evidence to that he is definately running a bot and not just a script.

<p>Betacommand wasn't blocked for running an unauthorised bot, rather for WP:POINT, and personally, I'd really much rather have a bot reporting suspected 'bad' usernames to WP:RFCN and being looked at rather than them being blocked on site and loosing a potential good user. There's no reason why a clone of the AIV helperbot couldn't keep RFCN clear of blocked users with Werdnabot archiving everything else every day or two.

That is a point violation. btw, if anybody had given me a fucking chance to read betacommand's reply I would have unblocked as he explained it was a mistake. But no, instead, we jump down my throat, wheel war and go straight to AN. I'm disgusted people didn't even try to ask me what was going on. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>(multiple edit conflict) The background here is that Betacommand is one of the two administrators who has been most active in reviewing lists of newly created usernames and blocking on sight those which are patently unacceptable. (The other admin who's been active in this area recently is pschemp herself.) As Betacommand mentioned in a thread a couple of weeks ago, every day hundreds of usernames are created that need to be blocked on sight; he assembled a memorable list of them (of which "Newyorkbradisreallyboring" was my personal favorite). He and pschemp are both to be commended for this activity, as every one of those accounts was vandalism waiting to happen.<br /></p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, though, there have been a number of inquiries raised as to why a given name had been blocked. Good-faith editors who find themselves blocked at inception because of what does not even appear to be a violation of the username policy are apt to be perturbed over the matter, and within the past few days a number of these blocks have been brought to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User_names_6c05.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names</a> and reversed. (Since I'm giving out credit in this paragraph, it should be noted that HighInBC has been most responsible for the operation of that board in the past few weeks, with pschemp pitching in as well.) As the number of questioned username blocks increased, there was an RfC requested on Betacommand, which was defused after it was pointed out that he should be allowed to explain what was going on. It turns out that there are criteria other than the obvious ones that he applies to these blocks, for example, when a new username is close to that of a prior persistent vandal. In the process, new good-faith contributors are sometimes ensnared.<br /></p>
<p>To avoid being criticized further, Betacommand apparently reset his program to report many, if not every one, of these username blocks to RFC/N. This was unnecessary, and cluttered RFC/N, which is generally a pretty obscure backwater, with requests that the community validate the blocking of User:Bitchslapper or User:Ryulongs. This isn't necessary. I'm sure we can work out a mechanism to obtain community input before blocking new User:Guest9999 or Qwerty12345, without requiring the same before blocking User:ImHereToVandalizeWikipedia and User:NewyorkbradsANIPostsAreWayTooLong. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And to be fair, I didn't know about an RFC until NYB's comment above, but that is over the top. Recently WP:RFCN has become a very unpleasant place, where people go through other's block log and pick and whine about every single thing. I don't blame Betacommand for being upset with this. And, he did agree to stop the reporting after a discussion. He says it was mistake it was turned back on, and I believe him. I would have unblocked then and we could have gone our merry ways, but for 8 other people turning this into massive unneccesary drama. Seriously. Pgk has it right when he says that "I thought it was for input into if names were inappropriate prior to blocking if someone declined to change when asked, not for a review of every user blocked for an inappropriate username." That's what is is for.

<p>I'm at a loss in trying to comprehend why there's so much fuss being made of a really good leap forward in dealing with new users in a way that doesn't result in new users being blocked instantly for having a slightly ambigious username. I've said above, run RFCN like AIV, blocked names are removed by a bot, everything is archived after 24 (or whatever) hours if there's no block or further comments, just like this board. We can quite easily rustle up a template and have the bot tag the users talk page saying their username is giving cause for concern, could they comment and again, send them a message when the username discussion is archived saying (after 24 or however many hours) we consider the username to be acceptable at present. <font face="Arial">-- <b><a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font color="blue">Heligo</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font color="red">land</font></a></b></font> 22:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because it is uneeded duplication of work for usernames like user:fuckoffbitch. Its also <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> and a total waste of time for something that is already being dealt with effectively. Bots should not block usernames, they can't AGF, or make decisions that people can. Also, the exact same thing he reported is already being reported to vandalism channel if you want to see it. It also totally contradicts the purpose of WP:RFCN which is to discuss borderline names <b>before</b> making a block, not to go back and do the big brother trick on every single username block. Every single username block does <b>not</b> need to be reviewed. Your proposal is a solution to problem that doesn't exist. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds like a work creation scheme to me. There is no need to scour the new user log looking for names which "might" after some debate be considered inappropriate. Many accounts created never edit or edit once or twice, if their username is borderline then there is no point in wasting peoples time reviewing these. If on the other hand they do start editing, then in the natural course of things someone will notice and ask them to change if need be (and possibly onto RFC if need be).</dd>
<dd>I propose a much simpler system, if the username is clearly inappropriate, block it on sight. If it's borderline leave it, it'll either follow the paths above, will be blocked by someone else as inappropriate or will start vandalising and be blocked anyway. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The issue here is that WP:RFCN is for getting feedback on questionable names before blocking, not for hunting witches in people's block logs and then harrassing admins who do the work over it.

That attitude has been extremely pervasive there lately, and frankly I'm tired of it. This statement Ryan, "it is not right that admins have the right to block usernames if they aren't blatantly against <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>, it is simply <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting</a>, hence where <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> comes into play to discuss these blocks." is totally wrong. If you think an admin is blocking incorrectly, the correct action is to talk to them first, then take it here to ANI if you think the community needs to comment. WP:RFCN is not the place for that. Its purpose is discuss <b>before</b> you block, not after. I used to play a large part in maintaining that page, when it was being used correctly, but I refuse to participate in the lynchings that have been going on lately. Your automatic assumption of admin wrongdoing is condescending and offputting. That witch hunt mentality is the root cause of this entire thread. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally disagree with that, RFCN is there to comment on usernames, the reason why blocked usernames have been brought there is because after all, its a request for comment on usernames, whether they've been blocked or not, it is the place to discuss these issues. Its not right that every time an admin makes a mistake with a username block it should be brought up here. The problem with Betacommand was, initially he wasn't responding to talk page messages and hence they were brought up at RFCN. By blocking a new editor because of a username which doesn't seam to infinge on <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> is going to stop them editing. At RFCN, if a blocked user is brought up, they are quickly unblocked so they are able to comment, thus hopefully keeping a few of these new editors on wikipedia. I agree that it should be discussed with the blocking admin first, however, it is often a lot quicker to resolve the matter by talking on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 23:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You mean despite what it says at the top of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> which is states nothing about reviewing made blocks. One of the problems with that approach is that it is at too low a level and doesn't actually address the issue, if editors are turned away by these blocks, listing afterwards and getting the block "overturned" is irrelevant, you need prompt action not some bureaucratic process for a very small subset of the wikipedia community to salivate over. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy</a>, admins are selected hopefully as trusted and having suitable judgment to make such decisions (this of course doesn't mean they are infallible). If an admin blocks a username and you disagree discuss it with them, if multiple people do this then they should reassess their criteria. If it's an ongoing problem use normal <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> such as a full <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, this should help confirm that the admins judgment is normally sound, that they should be less aggressive in the blocking or that perhaps they should turn their attention elsewhere entirely.</dd>
<dd>I'll work out some statistics later, but last time I checked the number of username blocks compared to new user accounts was a few percent (8000+ usernames per day), and the majority of those made few of no edits. We need to keep a sense of proportion about such things. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 07:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may weigh in, it seems that admins lately are quick on the blocking finger when it comes to username. Most username blocks are obvious, and I do appreciate the work that <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> and other admins do. That having been said, there are cases of ambiguity. For example, a username that contains "troll" may or may not have the connotation that we give to the world- when most people hear "troll", they think of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">mythical creatures</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_doll.html" title="Troll doll">dolls</a>, or <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28film%29.html" title="Troll (film)">B-movies</a>. While some of these cases are legitimate malefactors who will make a few vandalous edits, that doesn't outweigh the bad of us blocking a legitimate contributor for a username that would, to them, be considered perfectly innocuous. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">»</a> 06:57, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd refer you to pgk's comments above. We block people who make good faith usernames all the time, examples being names with "bot" and "admin" in them. However, they get a polite message telling them what is going on and request for a change from {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameblocked_c05c.html" title="Template:Usernameblocked">usernameblocked</a>}} and most are soft blocks making new account creation simple. In fact, my experience is that the people who care about editing will e-mail me anyway to make sure the new name they pick is ok. I've never had any of them say this put them off from editing. I don't see that wikipedia is hurting for new editors either. Sorry, but the speculation that blocking someone with admin in the username is harmful just doesn't play out. In fact, it is far better to block and request a name change when they have no edits, than to have to deal with established editors with clear username violations. They *do* get pissy. I've always found the new people who care or just made a mistake or didn't think about the username to be most accomodating about changing them. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 08:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't get my first choice of username or my second, how many attempts it took I can't recall now. Given the sheer volume of usernames created it wouldn't suprise me if some people go through quite a few before finding one which isn't already in use, blocking a few additional isn't going to make much difference. Our username policy gives a fair indication on what is required (see below). Once they've created that account there is a load more policy which they will likely run afoul of, have articles deleted, edits reverted, warnings posted to their talk pages... In the inappropriate edits/articles stakes no one seems to argue we should just let it ride in case we upset a new user, we're here to write an encyclopedia after all. In both cases it's really about how well we deal with the situation, if we spend some time explaining the problem to people then my experience matches pschemps and they are usually understanding (if not always in total agreement).</dd>
<dd>In contrast to that, in line with most of our policies they require some interpretation and applying some common sense to them. The username is rightly quite detailed (perhaps more so than other policies would be) as it is likely to be the first point of contact of many users. We should however be treating it in the same manner, some usernames may fall foul of the policy by the letter of that policy, but common sense says they are fine - we shouldn't block those. Likewise some will be fine by the letter of the policy but clearly inappropriate, we should block those. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 09:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
