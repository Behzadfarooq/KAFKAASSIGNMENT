<dd>Well "got explicit approval for hiring a professional Wiki editor to get this page out of its slump, and to lead a team that can over time discourage trolls, morons, self-promoters, and bureaucrats intent on concealing the truthful history of ineptness in OSINT" and "Wiki policy will accept vendors creating a single paragraph and URL link to their home page, and abusive vendors like LEXIS-NEXIS will be cut back to that."

<p><a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> says "You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest." Steele has a very clear conflict of interest. Enough so that he himself needs not to edit the articles he is proposing to pay others to edit.

<p>This may or may not be a spectacularly bad idea and maybe it would set a bad precedent. But "AIEEE! MONSTERS UNDER THE BED!

<dd>Ok, the phrase that is most concerning (in addition to his history of problematic edits) is "discourage trolls, morons, self-promoters, and bureaucrats intent on concealing the truthful history of ineptness in OSINT."

<p>He says "I now understand my mistakes earlier, especially <b>the need for a third party to post any link or reference to me, however central I may be to OSINT</b>. Not to worry. I talked about this page, the experience, and the broader future in depth with several Wiki leaders, and I believe we are all on the same page.

The point of third parties is unbiased editing by people who lack a conflict of interest. People being lead and paid by someone with a conflict of intrest <i>also</i> have a conflict of interest. Further he has already edited the page in a way that was widely believed to be very self serving and he shows no indication that his leadership of paid editors would serve any purpose other than self interest. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 09:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jimbo just made a deal with that other editor who was paid to write an article.

<li>I don't find anything particularly bannable about the name.

</ul>
<p>Every online forum I have ever been in disallowed the use of mod or admin in the name. As a newbie it would be a correct assumption to assume that we wouldn't allow usernames that smell likes they have power they don't have. It's standard practice, and I don't see why we should allow someone that name or anything similiar. (comment by <a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">Mboverload</a>)</p>
<p>"Super mod" is an administrative position on many Internet bulletin boards (including many modified <a href="../../../p/h/p/PhpBB_f7c4.html" title="PhpBB">phpBB</a> boards), halfway between "moderator" and "administrator". Supermod doesn't appear to be making any attempts to act the part of a moderator, and no one seems to be getting confused, so I see no problem in letting this username stand. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 05:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So it's rather like adopting a user name of "administrator" or, more accurately, "semiadministrator", which would obviously not be allowed. It's a recognised title and is potentially misleading.

<li>Although for at least some of us the name has no significant connotations, I appreciate the arguments put forward that it has some meaning in some online forums and thus and on the basis the name has connotations for some (ie it suggests a definition or association), I support restrictions on this and similar usernames as per User:St.isaac --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 23:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Bkell. Several people spent a lot of time and effort on that article and while it was no polished jewel i was working on it - and i am rather offended that it would be deleted without my being informed. I see that it was nixxed by one calling him or her self "Stifle" and it is easy to see where that name comes from. I would like to see the article returned to wikipedia, i believe that it begins with a rather long list of Barrett's accomplishments, sculptor, musician, painter, graphic artist, poet, but if that's not enough, please let me know and i'll try and find some more. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 22:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 22:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My userpage makes my stance pretty clear. A revert, of an edit or an admin action, should not be done lightly.

<dd>I really think you should take a deep breath, Zoe. I do not consider my action wheel-warring: I restored the article, <i>once</i>, and documented my action here for everyone to see. Stifler deleted a new article in passing (out of process, I might add, by not alerting its creator). I did not assume Stifler had an emotional involvement with his decision, and neither do I. This is just housekeeping stuff. I wouldn't ring up a janitor telling him he misplaced a broom, I'd just move it to the proper cupboard. "Go ahead" is indeed our first guideline, as long as you do it informedly, in good faith, politely and in the open. If Zoe thinks that this means she has to re-delete the article, I invite her to do that. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 23:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sensing a definite <i>All wikipedians are created equal, but . . .... some are more equal than others</i> thing here. If the article had not been deleted without notifying it's author then the same thing would not needed to have been done to an administrator. Yet the crime here seems to be that an administrator was overturned without due process and not Ms/Mr Average Wikipedian. Interesting. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 00:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anybody can recreate a deleted article if they want to. There's no need to take it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">Deletions for review</a>. That is only necessary after an AfD if it is wished to keep the same content, which could otherwise be speedy deleted as recreated content. (If it is a speedy that is recreated it can't be deleted as recreated content, but can be deleted under the same original criterion, in this case A7.) So if <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> had a record of the content he could have uploaded it and recreated the article. Alternatively he could have asked <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> to userfy the deleted content, and then Carptrash could have recreated the article immediately in that way. Dab short-circuited this by simply restoring the article. When admins were given the right to do unilateral speedy deletes, it was given out of necessity because of the increasing deletion workload, but was still given with some reservation. Admins can't regard their speedy deletions as sacrosanct, and must be prepared for them to be challenged, in which case, if necessary, AfD can be invoked in the normal manner. As it says on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">DRV</a>: "if you are a sysop and an article you deleted is subsequently undeleted, please don't take it as an attack." <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User:Zoe states that she <i>take(s) it as a lack of civility if my action is overturned without discussion</i> but another's work was deleted without discussion, even though <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> states <i>it would also be considerate to notify the original author</i>. I think we all need to reconsider that civility applies both ways. I agree with the comments of <i>Tyrenius</i> and <i>dab</i>, incivility by admins undeleting the article was not intended. The actions of the admin were within scope of guidelines and policy.

DRV is not needed under CSD. While notability originally might not have been apparent, it was not an egregiously not-notable biography - unlike the typical varieties like <i>xyz goes to zz school and is kool.</i> As has been pointed out above, more appropriate action (as well as notifying the editor), might have been to use the {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} tag or something similar allowing a response.

<dd>If we conceive of the whole process as team work, rather than individual actions, then it falls into place more easily, with the aim — which must always be kept in mind — of creating an encyclopedia. A process, starting with the original stub, takes place and is worked out in several stages, regardless of which individual has enacted each particular stage. The different individual actions counterbalance and correct each other. Finally a result is obtained. Let's see the overall process as the important thing, either to excise material which is not suitable, or to include and improve material which is. Nobody is doubting any of the participants' good intentions, and this is the most important thing. Everybody is on the same side, so I recommend <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good will</a> and tolerance all round. I have devised a user box in its beta stage, which I have on my user page and which anyone is welcome to use or suggest improvements to. I think it's important that admin actions are always open to review. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:18, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since when is it "a lack of civility" to revert someone? It's a wiki... that happens all the time and is supposed to. Yes, explanations of <i>why</i> a reversion was made are good things... which is why we have edit summaries, block/unblock summaries, delete/undelete summaries, et cetera. That's usually all the notification required. Since regular users can't see delete summaries, putting an explanation for a delete on their user talk page is a reasonable alternative. Not doing so is effectively the equivalent of not including an edit/delete summary... not very helpful, but also not a heinous crime. If the summary indicates the reverter didn't understand or overlooked something then go ahead and reverse again with a summary explanation of what they missed. Only if it there is clearly strong disagreement about how to handle the situation should we stop taking edit/admin actions and hold a discussion to develop a consensus. This is all fairly standard 'dispute resolution' stuff. If anything, admins should be <i>better</i> than most at calmly dealing with people reverting them. Only making edits/admin actions after strong disagreement has been established is 'uncivil'. It becomes edit/wheel warring when you take an action which there is no established consensus for and which you <i>know</i> one or more other people are going to strongly disagree with and wish to revert, whether that is the <i>eigth</i> action or the <i>first</i>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the copyright clueful: Image:Arclight.gif is tagged as fair use screenshot, used in <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arclight_%28comics%29.html" title="Arclight (comics)">Arclight (comics)</a>. Two issues: first, this is from the film not the comic, so the fair use is probably not valid in that article, yes? Second, it's not a <i>screenshot</i>, it'sa series of screenshots assembled into an animated gif by a YTMNDer, the image source is cited as the YTMND. Which I think makes it not actually a fair use screenshot at all. It's important because there are a number of these looping animated gifs on the project, including at <a href="../../../m/o/r/More_Cowbell_c413.html" title="More Cowbell">More Cowbell</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless of this unnecessary animated gifs, (i.e. those that do not better illustrate something in the article) are a pain anyway - and make it harder to read the article. If it is used to illustrate the comic (being from the film), and it is noted that it is from the film, it could pass as fair use (I think) as long as it is <i>needed</i> to properly show the comic itself (which I fear may not be the case). The fact that it shows such a significant part of the original work (i.e. reasonable quality and multiple shots) which isn't really necessary anyway, I think it would be pushing the fair use boundaries, and could be considered a copyright infringement.

<p>User:NOFX99 has made only one edit, but it's of a most nefarious nature. It was linkspam (on the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_enlargement.html" title="Penis enlargement">Penis enlargement</a> article, which sees a lot of linkspam), with the edit summary "spelling." It's pretty much impossible for me to assume good faith here.

<li>One wouldn't like to assign political allegiences to the anon 82. However, yes, he does have a long Wikipedia history of POV-pushing in articles about the deaths of black people (always accidental) and the deaths of white people (always at the hands of black people). So he certainly has a bee in his bonnet. I've been through his recent contributions and reverted a pile of strange edits, but I'll look closer now. I suspect a fair bit of stubbing of articles down to the known facts will be required - that's what was needed last year when he last appeared. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:09, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This user has been making repeated, unsubstantiated allegations that I am a "POV shill" who works for either WABC Radio or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Levin_504f.html" title="Mark Levin">Mark Levin</a>. He has deleted many of my edits to the evin article, accusing me of "not editing in good faith". I welcome an administrator to review my edit history and how I have tried to constructively contribute to the Levin article (including reverting vandalism, supporting inclusion of negative/anti information, and trying to start a discussion on including a relevance/notability threshhold for what external links are to be included in the article.) and determine if these accusations are warranted. He has also taken a note I left him on his user page, asking him to stay civil with me and work towards consensus, and posted it to the Levin talk page as if I had posted it there. From this point, he has continued to be belligerant, uncivil, and is basically holding the page hostage based on his lone, unwarranted accusations that I am a POV shill for WABC. I am here to contribute in a constructive manner and I think I am owed the courtesy of assuming good faith and ntot having flames and attacks thrown about on a article talk page. Shouldn't this be about the content of the article and not the poster?</p>
<p>You can find most of the discussion here: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMark_Levin_b567.html" title="Talk:Mark Levin">Talk:Mark_Levin</a> and here: <a href="../../../f/l/e/User_talk%7EFLeeLevin_346d.html" title="User talk:FLeeLevin">User_talk:FLeeLevin</a>. This particular poster also seems to have a history of belligerance and incivility towards others who don't agree with this political leanings. See here: <a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EEleemosynary_df06.html" title="User talk:Eleemosynary">User_talk:Eleemosynary</a> and also the types of comments he includes in his edit descriptions, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Eleemosynary" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Eleemosynary" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Eleemosynary</a> .</p>

<dd>Your attempts to help mediate the dispute on the page are most appreciated, however the belligerance and assumptions of bad faith continue.

If history repeats, he will use this as the basis for reverting everything I try to do to improve the article. I am officially requesting some for of administrator action at this point.

<p>I have decided to retire from editing Wikipedia. There are several reasons for this, one of which is that I am still angry with myself for having been involved in a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive121_9df2.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive121">fairly recent sockpuppetry incident</a>. I am particularily ashamed of the fact that some of the accounts that I created had usernames that attacked specific users. I would like to address all of those users now and apologise for what I did. Please do not think that I have anything personal against any of you. Why, if that’s the case, I choose names that deliberately attacked you, I am not even completely sure myself. The best answer that I can give is that I had seen vandals create similar names before and wanted the accounts I created to seem like “authentic” vandal accounts. Please also take into consideration the fact that I suffer from certain mental problems and at times have a difficulty acting with reason, but everything else aside, I was aware that what I was doing was wrong, and chose to do it anyway, and therefore I accept responsibility for my actions. This incident is not the only reason that I have decided to resign, though. Right now I am involved in a lot of academic-related activities and I feel that editing Wikipedia has been eating up too much of my time that I should have spent studying.

<dd>Loath I am to do it, I have blocked the entire 151.44. range for an hour -- which affects not only the editor formerly known as Panairjdde (TEFKAP) but some 65,000-odd other people. However, he has been stalking or edit-warring not only with Codex Sinaiticus, but at leat 2 other editors. I'm gambling on the fact that the users of an Italian ISP aren't interested in editting an English Wikipedia, &amp; as long as no one complains, we can repeat this until TEFKAP gives up. (He has also used the 151.47. range -- but let's wait until we see what kind of trouble I've caused before blocking that one also.) I won't protest if another Admin reverts the block. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He's been blocked for a week (second block), but I think an indefinite block may be required; he's vandalized hundreds of articles relating to religion, often in fairly subtle ways (PoV inserts and content deletions and modifications, removing images, etc.), and I've only managed to revert a quarter of his edits so far. (Going down the list, I managed to revert everything [sometimes with difficulty, due to later edits] down to 03:21, 29 July 2006, although that still leaves scores and scores of edits which someone will need to revert. --<a href="../../../e/m/u/User%7EEmufarmers_b2e0.html" title="User:Emufarmers">Emufarmers</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../e/m/u/User_talk%7EEmufarmers_439c.html" title="User talk:Emufarmers">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Emufarmers_b9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Emufarmers">C</a>)</small></sup> 03:59, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have recently created a bot-based summary to follow up on the <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_RFA_summary_7cd9.html" title="User:Dragons flight/RFA summary">RFA summary</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_ce8b.html" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary">AFD summary</a>. This new function, which I have dubbed the <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_Category_tracker_b0c5.html" title="User:Dragons flight/Category tracker">Category Tracker</a>, monitors a selection of administrative and editing related categories and identifies when they have an unusually high number of items in them compared to their long-term means, and hence are in need of some attention. The full <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_Category_tracker_b0c5.html" title="User:Dragons flight/Category tracker">tracking page</a> covers a couple dozen different categories and gives statistics on their fluctuations. In addition, I also created a <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_Category_tracker_Summary_8abf.html" title="User:Dragons flight/Category tracker/Summary">summary table</a> (transcluded here) to give easy access to the most important or most backlogged categories.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_Category_tracker_Config_9357.html" title="User:Dragons flight/Category tracker/Config">configuration page</a> which can be used to adjust which categories are monitored, where they are displayed, and how often they are updated.</p>

<p>It is a very nice summary, but the number of articles needing wikification is incorrect. There are 6,776 (sorted) articles in the category currently, but they are split up into subcategories by the month they were tagged, so only the ones that have not been sorted (123 at the moment) show up on the summary. Once the bot comes around, the 123 articles will be put in the August category. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People have noted various issues above, but it would also be nice if this could incorporate AIV, RFI, RFAr, RFCU, <i>all</i> of the 'cleanup' categories, et cetera. What would <i>really</i> be nice would be some method of putting the data onto individual transcludable pages... so a person who wanted to keep an eye on just TfD, PER, and RFAr could transclude those three stats onto their user page... a possibly beneficial form of 'userbox' showing the topic, current backlog number, and color (red/yellow/green). Likewise a page could then be set up showing the status of all 'admin only' tasks. And if it could make toast too that'd be really grand.&#160;:]</dd>

<p>I know it's been said before, but AfD really does seem to be a remarkably bad way of dealing with controversial articles. I think it generally works fairly well in most cases but when we get a subject that attracts major controversy it seems to go off the rails. A case in point is the current AfD at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_508f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> (the third on this article!) which seems to be attracting POV-pushers from all over, from both sides. Some of the comments strongly suggest that vote-stacking by e-mail is going on. Many of the votes are plainly being driven by partisan POVs on the article, totally ignoring the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability criteria</a> in favour of their own opinions on the subject matter. I've seen the same happen with other recent controversial AfDs, such as <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Kurdistan_fac6.html" title="Turkish Kurdistan">Turkish Kurdistan</a>.</p>
<p>I really do wonder if we should seek to restrict voting on controversial AfDs to administrators, who should be more likely to act on the basis of Wikipedia policies and criteria rather than voting as a proxy for blatant POV-pushing. If there's an unusually large number of votes on an article, as indicated by <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_Many_votes_96d3.html" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary/Many votes">Dragons flight's useful AFD summary</a> - perhaps a threshold of 40 or so - it's a good indicator that the subject is particularly controversial, particularly likely to attract partisan voters and particularly susceptible to being decided on POV rather than encyclopedic grounds. Perhaps when this threshold is reached it might be a good idea to impose <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloture.html" title="Cloture">cloture</a> and initiate a vote among admins rather than prolong the agony on AfD?

<dd>Giving admins more editorial authority is probably not the way to go; not only would it be immensely unpopular, but it also wouldn't necessarily be helpful -- admins can have idiosyncratic ideas about policy, too. We need to encourage closing admins to discount these "votes" that do not take our policies into account. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 17:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. What the analysis reveals is not a flaw in the AfD process, but a flaw in the application of policies, particularly it would seem <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, though I am sure a closer inspection would reveal <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> to be equally ill attended. More rigorous standards need to be expected and imposed on what is permissable as argument.

See my comments at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Abuse_of_AfD.3F" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#Abuse of AfD?</a>. Getting back to the topic, though, I'm sure you're right that it would be controversial to give admins more editorial authority. Jkelly is certainly right that even admins can have idiosyncratic views on policy (I note that at least one admin has given a blatantly POV reason for voting in the AfD I mentioned). However, wouldn't it be even more controversial for a closing admin to decide - by himself - which votes were valid and which weren't? Perhaps a middle way would be for a group or panel of admins to determine which votes were for valid policy reasons and which weren't. I agree that we need to enforce permissible arguments but we would need to ensure that a single admin's interpretation of policy wouldn't dictate the outcome. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 17:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Extra discussions from the closing admin would tie up our closing admins (there are precious few as it is as closing AfDs gets you hell from both sides) in needless, long, neverending pointless discussions.</p>
<p>What we need to do is accept that our admins need <b>greater</b> discretion. That admins can close AfDs against the apparent consensus without being flayed alive for it. And that would mean close in either direction, and it would mean that we would need a <i>rule</i> about "not biting the closing admin" or the like. And, yes, it would mean that we would have to give a greater degree of latitude to admins like Tony Sidaway (no offence, Tony, you're just a convenient example&#160;:o), happy to close a debate with a caustic comment on how poor the quality of the debate was. Of course, in giving that discretion to our admins, we make it so that such caustic comments aren't required.</p>
<p>But the face-off that currently exists between rampant inclusionists and rampant deletionists means that we would never get consensus on giving admins that latitude. And we would remain fair game for the parade of personal attacks, droning-on comments and public pillorying that even otherwise sensible editors subject a closing admin to for... closing something. Even when we close <i>within</i> consensus. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> already does give discretion to admins - at least, I've not noticed many recent overturnings of what I considered to be correct deletions (or keeps) as a result of considering the arguments and not just the numbers. I think we should be looking to ourselves as admins to show more <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldness</a> in closing discussions. Getting overturned at deletion review is not something to be worried about, as if you do get overturned the article gets undeleted or relisted and no harm is done. The only way to do harm via closing discussions is in not learning from overturns and repeatedly getting overturned for the same reason - and people who can't learn from mistakes often don't pass RfA. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giving <b>no reasons</b> is useless - it's saying "I think this should be deleted but I expect someone else to work it out why for me". People can give multiple reasons, of course - but remember that, if they have to argue for an article to be speedy deleted, then it <i>isn't</i> a speedy delete. And, if they nominate an article for deletion when it clear doesn't fit a criteria, they are asking the deleting admin to take on the risk. The <i>admin</i> has to justify the decision to the angry user. Tagging for PROD or AfD or clean-up and telling the user is harder work, but at least doing that doesn't just pass the responsibility down the line. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I helped set up RFI in its current form, and since then I've been the only admin to do a significant amount of dealing with reports to it for long periods of time (I've been completely away for last two weeks and on semi-wikibreak before that, hence the lack of action on that page for the last month). It would really help if more admins could watchlist RFI and deal with reports there; I'd be happy to assist anyone if they need help with that (ask me on my talk page, or the RFI talk page). On the other hand if admins continue to ignore reports on that page there isn't much point having it (I certainly can't keep up with it on my own all the time). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 10:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>(Just to clarify, <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.145.123.171.html" title="User:69.145.123.171">this</a> is me)</b></p>
<p><s>Okay, this is going to be very long and complicated; not only that, but I am typing this without the internet and will have to copy and paste add links and such later. So please forgive and fragmentation you might see and bear with me: The problem is with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kaiwen1/Vote_to_prohibit_anonymous_edits" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kaiwen1/Vote_to_prohibit_anonymous_edits" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. The page is, simply put, a vote that will show the general thoughts on letting anons edit. I, as an anons advocate, hover around the page and try and keep it fair. I do not own the page, but the person who made it has not been editing often, and I haven’t been able to ask permission of them to keep the peace. My opinion is that Wikipedia would not exist were it not for the anons. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">User:Hildanknight</a>’s opinion is that you should be required to register. He follows the page even more than I, which is saying something. He has gone to the point of commenting on almost every single vote to allow anon editing, sometimes adding ‘no comment’ when he can’t think of anything to say. Needless to say, I was upset. So I tried to handle it nicely. I left a comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=61897641&amp;oldid=61889355" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=61897641&amp;oldid=61889355" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> on his talk page that simply said anons are Wikipedians to. It was at this point he decided to retire, then un-retire. For months I kept going back to that page, checking to see if he’d reply, but he did not. It was only after my internet connection had been cut and restored that I discoverd he had replied, needlessly harsh, I might add<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=66277773&amp;oldid=66254519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=66277773&amp;oldid=66254519" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. I added my reply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69334257&amp;oldid=69323209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69334257&amp;oldid=69323209" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, then waited. I was surprised to find that instead of reply on his talk page, as he normally does, he edited <b>my</b> <b>userpage</b>, stating that it was time to register, and I would soon know why he hated anons<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69335234&amp;oldid=68905719" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69335234&amp;oldid=68905719" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. I then added a new message on his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69335691&amp;oldid=69335600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69335691&amp;oldid=69335600" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, saying that I would stand for anons no matter what the cause. I then came up with an idea, inspired by his comment-I would keep track of the IP’s I had to use on AOL. Growing excited with the thought, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69336149&amp;oldid=69336038" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69336149&amp;oldid=69336038" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> told him of it. Yes, it was mean. I was angry. He reverted it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69337236&amp;oldid=69336979" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hildanknight&amp;diff=69337236&amp;oldid=69336979" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, calling me an 'annonomous vandal'.Now, the reason he doesn’t like IPs is that Singapore, as a whole, has one single IP address. I can see the problem, but that’s no reason to abuse me. After my idea popped up on his talk page, my userpage suddenly was vandalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69336765&amp;oldid=69336617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69336765&amp;oldid=69336617" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> by the Singapore IP. Coincidence? I don’t think so.The edit was reverted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69336853&amp;oldid=69336765" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69336853&amp;oldid=69336765" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> by Mr. Lefty. I thanked him, and moments later discovered that my <i>talk page</i> had been vandalized-again, by the Singapore IP. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69337551&amp;oldid=69336972" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.145.123.171&amp;diff=69337551&amp;oldid=69336972" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>I knew it was him.

<p>That was confusing, was it not? Now, am I in the right in assuming that his page should not be protected and he should recieve a warning for his behavior?

<dd>It's a very problematic set of images. Many images so tagged have been done on the assumption that something published somewhere is automatically free for any use. It is difficult to "mass work on"; the mechanism for deleting sourced ones if there is uncertainty is either <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. A more efficient approach if one wants to do a a few hundred at a time is to simply remove the template from any image that doesn't give such a license at the source, and tag the image with {{<a href="../../../n/l/d/Template%7ENld_3ee8.html" title="Template:Nld">nld</a>}}. If one does that, however, many of the images will wind up with a spurious fair use template on them. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 17:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also encountered a bunch of images with the norightsreserved tag.

<dd>The template, if I understand correctly, was to avoid the possible legal issue that it may be impossible for someone to release something to public domain, even if they wanted to. Thus, its to signify that it is not in the public domain, but close. With that said, copyright tag(<i>any</i> copyright tag) abuse is massive. {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}} are abused like crazy (they don't have to provide a source then if they claim to have made it themselves).

<p>I am currently engaging in a sort of undesirable "edit war" that I don't intend to be any sort of war, except the 3RR rule should have kicked in long ago, and nothing is happening in response to the 3RR report. Another editor systematically deletes all the content I add, with no explanation, or covertly in combination with another edit. The material has been deleted six times so far - the first four deletes in a matter of a few hours.</p>
<p>I left a report at the 3RR noticeboard two days ago, and it has been unacknowledged. I guess the 3RR rule is either arbitrary, or doesn't matter, or no one cares. I don't believe I have a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to make, other than that the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> rule doesn't mean squat if it's impossible to get it enforced. In the meantime I'm going to keep on reverting (though I expect I'll do so slowly, as all the reverting is such a waste a time) and I will probably deserve a 3RR block as well. Someone, please let me know when the 3RR rule will continue to be enforced, so I will know when to stop breaking it.

<dd>It is indeed a rant. It's probably a silly one at that, and definitely a hasty one, because I normally take the time to provide good links. The contributor I'm complaining about is seemly also doing good article edits elsewhere, and a block is now belated and possibly counterproductive. I needed to get some frustration out, and this was a non-destructive way to do it.

<p>I was hoping to get more comments about what to do about articles with the template {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, since the category that it put articles into, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_lacking_sources_5f50.html" title="Category:Articles lacking sources">Category:Articles lacking sources</a>, has been deleted. This makes it very difficult to work on fixing unreferenced articles, since the only way to see which articles have the template is to click on "what links here". People tend to work on topics that they are interested or have knowledge in. Using what links here makes that difficult, especially since there are now <b>16,650 articles</b> (1.28% of all articles) with the template. I suggest that the template put articles in a category again and that a project be started to work on articles without references. Failing that, I suggest that the template be removed from any article it is on by a robot, since without a category and an organized project, there is unlikely to be any significant work done on fixing unreferenced articles, let alone keeping the number of articles it is on from getting higher. Please give your opinion <b><a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28proposals%29_6eab.html#Unreferenced_articles" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)">here</a></b>.

<dd>I found UCRGrad's statement to be remarkably offensive as it does nothing but disparage my alma mater. However, in the interest of civility, I have deleted those remarks. I said those out of complete anger and emotion. I was completely out of control and I apologize for using such profane statements. However, I also ask UCRGrad to apologize for insulting Rutgers. I worked hard to get a good education there and he has no right to denigrate a school that helped me to achieve my goals in life. Thank you. Teknosoul02 03:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's been discussion on the AFD talk page about reducing the size of closed discussions on the daily log page by removing the discussion section and just leaving a summary of the result. The suggestion met with a fairly negative reaction due to the fact that it was seen as more work for the admins in an already tedious process. I've had a play around with the template and think I've got a solution that would <i>mostly</i> involve less work while achieving the desired effect. I wondered if any regular AFD closers would take a look and give their opinion on these possible replacements to the AFD top and bottom templates.

<p>Is it possible to block account creation from an AOL range, but still allow IP edits?

<li>The lagging is due to the hundreds of thousands of people acessing the site right now.

<li>Well according to the stats I have it is barely in the top 50 of page hits on the toolserver for August and has transferred around 25mb of data, that's pretty trivial. I can't imagine that the page is that popular as if only has an appeal to a narrow audience when compared to something like the edit counter.

<p>Redirects for Deletion has recently been renamed Redirects for Discussion, apparently in keeping with the same change being made to CfD. Unfortunately, that doesn't make sense. Since category moves and renames are nominated on CfD the broader "Discussion" is appropriate. This is not the case with RfD. Anything aside from a deletion can and should be discussed on the redirect's talk page and/or enacted by a suitably bold editor. RfD only concerns whether or not a redirect should be deleted, regardless of what happens to the redirect afterwards. This new name could potentially gum up RfD with fuzzy redirect "discussions" that belong on talk pages. I have brought this up on the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia_talk%7ERedirects_for_discussion_9cdd.html#New_name_for_the_process" title="Wikipedia talk:Redirects for discussion">RfD talk page</a>, the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html#New_RfD_name" title="WP:VPP">Village Pump</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html#Redirects_for_Discussion_vs._Redirects_for_Deletion" title="User talk:Cyde">talk page of the admin</a> who made the change, and have heard no reason it should stay.

<dd>You have a point. Mind you, part of the motivation for these name-changes seems to be a continued attempt to get away from the idea that XfD is a deletion vote – as happened when VfD became AfD – because of the whole "voting is evil" thing. However, the truth (at least for now) is that all of these pages continue to be, essentially, votes of some kind; usually for deletion, though as you correctly pointed out, CfD caters for a broader range of things. Anyway, my point is that I don't think the name change will actually affect the way the page is used, at least not significantly. People will most likely continue to use it as they did under the old name – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 11:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A quick look at his talk page, I think, makes it clear the cause of my worry. Despite several editors attempting to talk to him about his image use, he seems to have made only minor corrections to his <i>modus operandi</i> and OrphanBot continues to notify him about images he's uploaded. He also has not written one word to another editor that I can tell, be it on his talk page, our talk pages, or article/image talk pages. Not even a single edit summary, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>It's not that I want to see him blocked or anything. It'd just be nice if he acknowledged the presence of other editors beyond token attempts to modify his behavior, and started actually following procedure for fair-use images (that is, providing a fair use rationale so OrphanBot stops bugging him).</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Since I seem to engage in personal attacks, I would like to add a couple of comments, along with a few questions. First of all, I have not called this user a 14-year old. I pointed out that discussing things with him is a bit like arguing with a 14-year old, since he refuses to accept that we build Wikipedia on a foundation of facts, and not personal views, opinions or assumptions. (Arguments presented by me and other editors, along with undisputable facts was obviously not good enough, as they conflicted with this users view on things.) I also asked this user to refrain from editing certain pages if he couldn't bring himself to understand or accept why we don't put opinions before facts. (That is what all this is about, essentially.) Now, I have a couple of questions. What fake accusations are we talking about here? What fake charges or accusations have I brought up? /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 22:48, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems to be a really silly argument. If your that mad Magore, you can take it to arbitration but really it seems as though Magore has a point. No, he doesn't have a very immature way to talk on and I agree with Magore; if you haven't settled a dispute you need to stop editing the pages. Both of you, I should say.

<p>There's been discussion on the AFD talk page about reducing the size of closed discussions on the daily log page by removing the discussion section and just leaving a summary of the result. The suggestion met with a fairly negative reaction due to the fact that it was seen as more work for the admins in an already tedious process. I've had a play around with the template and think I've got a solution that would <i>mostly</i> involve less work while achieving the desired effect. I wondered if any regular AFD closers would take a look and give their opinion on these possible replacements to the AFD top and bottom templates.

<li>On a similar, yet 100% unrelated note, is the autoblock feature, now used in dozens of templates, such as {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserblocked_233c.html" title="Template:Userblocked">Userblocked</a>}}, capable of handling this many frequent hits without using up server resources? I notice that it's been lagging a lot lately, probably from severe over use--172.129.113.165 23:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The lagging is due to the hundreds of thousands of people acessing the site right now. No particular page should be hit worse than that others to my knowledge with the current implementation. <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch</a></b> <a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a> 03:03, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well according to the stats I have it is barely in the top 50 of page hits on the toolserver for August and has transferred around 25mb of data, that's pretty trivial. I can't imagine that the page is that popular as if only has an appeal to a narrow audience when compared to something like the edit counter. Regarding lag, it isn't (and by the looks currently never will be) totally up to date, it should generally be within 5 minutes. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 06:53, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Redirects for Deletion has recently been renamed Redirects for Discussion, apparently in keeping with the same change being made to CfD. Unfortunately, that doesn't make sense. Since category moves and renames are nominated on CfD the broader "Discussion" is appropriate. This is not the case with RfD. Anything aside from a deletion can and should be discussed on the redirect's talk page and/or enacted by a suitably bold editor. RfD only concerns whether or not a redirect should be deleted, regardless of what happens to the redirect afterwards. This new name could potentially gum up RfD with fuzzy redirect "discussions" that belong on talk pages. I have brought this up on the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia_talk%7ERedirects_for_discussion_9cdd.html#New_name_for_the_process" title="Wikipedia talk:Redirects for discussion">RfD talk page</a>, the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html#New_RfD_name" title="WP:VPP">Village Pump</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html#Redirects_for_Discussion_vs._Redirects_for_Deletion" title="User talk:Cyde">talk page of the admin</a> who made the change, and have heard no reason it should stay.

<dd>You have a point. Mind you, part of the motivation for these name-changes seems to be a continued attempt to get away from the idea that XfD is a deletion vote – as happened when VfD became AfD – because of the whole "voting is evil" thing. However, the truth (at least for now) is that all of these pages continue to be, essentially, votes of some kind; usually for deletion, though as you correctly pointed out, CfD caters for a broader range of things. Anyway, my point is that I don't think the name change will actually affect the way the page is used, at least not significantly. People will most likely continue to use it as they did under the old name – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 11:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A quick look at his talk page, I think, makes it clear the cause of my worry. Despite several editors attempting to talk to him about his image use, he seems to have made only minor corrections to his <i>modus operandi</i> and OrphanBot continues to notify him about images he's uploaded. He also has not written one word to another editor that I can tell, be it on his talk page, our talk pages, or article/image talk pages. Not even a single edit summary, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>It's not that I want to see him blocked or anything. It'd just be nice if he acknowledged the presence of other editors beyond token attempts to modify his behavior, and started actually following procedure for fair-use images (that is, providing a fair use rationale so OrphanBot stops bugging him).</p>

<p>This (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">User:Magore</a>) seems to have a very immature way to discuss on. The user has also fake accused me, on my talk page. --Comanche cph 22:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Since I seem to engage in personal attacks, I would like to add a couple of comments, along with a few questions. First of all, I have not called this user a 14-year old. I pointed out that discussing things with him is a bit like arguing with a 14-year old, since he refuses to accept that we build Wikipedia on a foundation of facts, and not personal views, opinions or assumptions. (Arguments presented by me and other editors, along with undisputable facts was obviously not good enough, as they conflicted with this users view on things.) I also asked this user to refrain from editing certain pages if he couldn't bring himself to understand or accept why we don't put opinions before facts. (That is what all this is about, essentially.) Now, I have a couple of questions. What fake accusations are we talking about here? What fake charges or accusations have I brought up? /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 22:48, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems to be a really silly argument. If your that mad Magore, you can take it to arbitration but really it seems as though Magore has a point. No, he doesn't have a very immature way to talk on and I agree with Magore; if you haven't settled a dispute you need to stop editing the pages. Both of you, I should say. Let other editors take care of it.

<p>A series of editors have been targetting the alma mater section of the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_University_ce58.html" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a> article (now protected), violating the three revert rule, altering information that is cited with information that is uncited and unverifiable, and interrupting wikipedia to make a point (albeit a feminist/political correctness agenda). The edit history at Rutgers University shows that the page has altered the official, cited lyrics of the alma mater, to those inserting words that are not official, as shown by citation, and practically every other site on the web discussing the lyrics of the alma mater... and while not vulgar, these parenthetical insertions are annoying and disingenuously perpetuating an inaccuracy.</p>
<p>The following individual users have been warned repeatedly of their conduct and have continued over the past few days in this conduct with blatant disregard for warnings or referring them to Wikipedia policies governing their conduct.

<dd>There isn't a whole lot to it actually. Create an account (unless you already have one) at the Wiki where you are going to be sending the article. At the new Wiki, create an article called "Transwiki:Constructionism and reductionism (wiki)" without the quotes. Paste the Wikipedia article into the new article on the new Wiki. Then, go back to Wikipedia and copy the history of the article. Then go back to the new wiki, go to the talk page and then paste the history of the article in.

<p>I didn't know how to do that either, but actually I'm rather shocked that that's how it is done, since that is not GFDL compliant. The cut and paste history shows who has worked on the article, but it does not show who is responsible for which bit of text - any of the editors mentions could be the substantial writer (and thus copyright holder) of the text. I'd like some reassurance here that I'm missing something. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 08:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do we mean by credited. This method can't distinguish between the substantive creator, the guy who tags it, the pedant who fixes a comma, and the vandal who blanks it with some obsenity. No way does that comply with the GFDL's accreditation.

<dd>I agree with Doc on this one. An ideal solution would be if the software allowed a page to be exported together with it's history from one wiki and imported to another.

I rewrote the disambiguation page using the name of the city the school is in for disambiguation, since that is what Calgary uses (the Hong Kong school link is actually a redirect to King George V School, also the article might need moving if an article is written on the Sutton school, since it has the exact same name, although it is probably much smaller than the Hong Kong school (the town of Sutton has about a thousand people and the HK school has 1,700 students, so a link to the other school might be better). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been 8 hours now since the last DYK update, and given the updating patterns prevalent in the last days, the next update won't come in the next 6 hours. There is a significant backlog in submitted DYKes, so I believe the DYKes should be refreshed as often as possible, which means every 6 hours. Currently, only one admin at a time takes care of that, and the admins that are interested in doing these tasks live in Canada and Australia, which means that they cannot possibly update DYK every 6 hours if they want to maintain a reasonable sleeping schedule&#160;:D</p>
<p>So the result is that only two DYK updates per day take place, and the one that would fall in the middle of the day European time is missing. Thus, European Wikipedians end up seeing the same DYKes all day and the queue is building up! I was wondering whether other admins might be interested in updating DYKes, especially those from the European/African time zone. Moreover, perhaps the DYK queue size and the "time since last update" (with a notice that it is time to update the template) could appear in this fabulous backlog box as seen in this page?</p>
<p>One last thing - what's with <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_2250.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions">Wikipedia:Recent additions</a>? The link on the main page in the DYK section (or more specifically, the link in the DYK template) leads there, but of recent DYKes are being archived in <a href="../../../d/y/k/T%7EDYKT_2730.html" title="T:DYKT">T:DYKT</a> - so somebody who clicks the link to the abovementioned page sees neither recent additions nor a DYK archive.</p>

<p>An important warning about a vandal getting his IP unblocked to continue creating abusive accounts. Accounts User:Scareslamfist and User:Sakura Avalon both have no actual contributions, and both were repeatedly able to get an IP unblocked that created dozens of vandalizing and bad-username accounts. Sometimes these accounts would even vandalize or attack the "nice" accounts, perhaps in an attempt to make it look legit. The vandal accounts would be blocked, then either of these two accounts would post an {{unblock}} request saying they were the victim of collateral damage from an IP autoblock. An admin would come along and unblock them, and the cycle would continue; the IP would invariably be autoblocked again for creating vandal accounts and a couple hours later, sometimes even minutes, they would post another unblock request; again they would be unblocked, etc. These are just the couple accounts that I know about.</p>
<p>This happened several times for each; unblocking administrators seriously need to look more carefully at such unblock requests. These user's "contributions" were just User talk edits, mostly to their own pages, and one even had some screed about being a reformed vandal. There is no reason to remove an autoblock when the user that purports to be adversely affected is not going to do anything related to the encyclopedia anyway. This should not be happening. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 04:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The behavior of the two accounts named shows that they are the accounts of banned users who have continued to disrupt Wikipedia. At best, these particular accounts would continue to be annoying and disruptive; at worst, they are just two of many sleeper accounts from that IP that would flare up into blatant vandalism. The IP <i>has</i> been highly disruptive, and there have been no complaints about the block from legitimate users, but it is blocked for 18 days because it may not be static. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 15:42, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think since this last post you have seen some of the strange behavior. He would be, at best, a previously blocked/banned user trying to play a joke, but there is no reason to believe that he is not the very same person who created the vandal/sock accounts, and there isn't an exception to the blocking policy for having a pseudo-legit, but totally non-contributing, account in the foreground, while vandalizing in the background.

<p>Has anyone seen his post on wikipedia review <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=5795986fd699531f223c9e2d17b88954&amp;showtopic=3050&amp;hl=" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=5795986fd699531f223c9e2d17b88954&amp;showtopic=3050&amp;hl=" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>&#160;? I used the search function on wikipedia and couln't find past reports about it so I am reporting it now. Karmafist basically tells how he is sneakily adding tons of intentional misinformation as some planned attempt to destroy wikipedia. He states:</p>
<p><i>"Best case scenario -- several new Siegenthaler Crises are made, thus destroying the credibility of Wikipedia, and its funding, forcing it to either become a corporate shill or charging users for an account(thus removing any pretense of being a "free and unbiased encyclopedia") or forcing them to reform."</i></p>
<p>Then he says: <i>"Worst case scenario -- the majority of articles on Wikipedia are either protected or abandoned(again, removing the "free" pretense), and all new users are seen as potential suspects, creating an atmosphere where they are unlikely to become wiki-addicts and possibly spread the word of the poor behavior of the Cabalists."</i></p>
<p>I am quoting him in case the forum deletes it. Basically, this type of vandalism is obviously far worse than Willy on Wheels. Willy did stuff easy to discover as vandalism.</p>
<p>The thing is, I see no long term abuse for this. We need a page to help track Karmafist's vandalism so it can be spotted and not left to linger. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 08:19, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is a really sad and disturbing post by Karmafist and a sad thread (I was unaware that Karmafist had started to vandalize Wikipedia, for one thing (assuming that it is really him on the website)). What is especially disturbing is that they take pleasure and find purpose in attempting to destroy the hard work of other people. Hard work that they do not get paid anything for and that they do for the betterment of the world. Another sad thing is that Karmafist has been negatively affected as a person due to his involvement with Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course no one on Wikipedia Review realizes that if Wikipedia fails, they and people like them will be at least partly at fault, and depending on the reason it fails, perhaps mostly or even entirely at fault. They complain about the quality of Wikipedia, yet they try to make it worse through systematic vandalism. If they want Wikipedia to be better than it is now, they should stop vandalizing it so that we can concentrate on making it better instead of trying to detect vandalism, reverting vandalism and dealing with vandalizers (talking, blocking, dispute resolution and arbitration). If all forms of vandalism stopped or were significantly reduced, we could make large increases in quality, breadth, neutrality and accuracy.</dd>

<dd>I have trouble seeing how Wikipedia Review members who vandalize Wikipedia think it is okay. It might be because they think that it is just a website and because it is easier to think that it is a victimless crime, especially since they do not see the victims. I have some hypothetical situations in which they would do what they do to Wikipedia to other entities and whether they think it would be justified. For example, would they burn down the Library of Congress because they disagree with the policy that members of the public cannot check out books (or would they vandalize the books or make books with fake information to insert in the collection)? Would they spray graffiti on a school's buildings because they think one of the textbooks it uses is biased? Would they vandalize pay phones, which are needed for the indigent and for emergencies because they do not like the phone company's policies? Would they kick over a child's sand castle because of its poor quality? Would they hack into the computer of a columnist whose opinion they disagree with and delete all of the articles he or she is working on? Would they steal newspapers from stands because they think some of the stories are biased? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:36, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That commentary sort of misses the mark. They've already identified the purported source of Wikipedia's quality problems, to wit, the present power structure of Wikipedia. Since they know tey won't achieve the consensus necessary to make their desired changes to it, it follows that Wikipedia must be destroyed in order to build a new encyclopedia along the correct lines.

<dd>Wikipedia Review looks like a complaint board, but there's shady things under the surface there, especially by those who run it (seen most easily if you try to register and don't give them all the personal information they demand). There's lots of criticism of wikipedia that criticizes it to improve it, but this site may not be one of them. I found karmafist's post some time after he made it, though as I very rarely read the forum, and I had assumed it was still current. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 14:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I fail to see why unless Office explicitly involves itself. I don't think Jimbo's "deal" over MyWikiBiz's writing of articles prohibits us from taking action over other disruptive actions, such as advertising in AfDs. You shouldn't reverse an Office or Jimbo action, but not doing something because you think Jimbo <i>might</i> object to it is another thing entirely. Of course, he's removed the comment suggesting the writer of the spam article should have contacted him following the message on his talk page, so that might be dealt with. Whether his nomination of company articles constitutes a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation will depend on how many of them actually merit deletion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 21:54, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not just one comment though, it's a whole string of the same type of nonsense. I'm inclined to block indefinitely. I see a huge conflict of interest here. He spouts the names of various Wikipedia policies to try and justify his comments but what he's really operating from is a desire to save articles he's been paid to write and delete articles of businesses he hasn't been paid to write. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 14:15, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi <b>Administrators' noticeboard</b> , after a very long time keeping my userpage, user Moe Epsilon has undertaken removing my gallery from my userpage claiming it is a violation of wikipedia policy concernng serpages. I am willing to review the images, removing any of which are demed unfree and thus must be removed. I find the userpage neccesary as a basis for my work and ethics in wikipedia. Moreover, it acts as a synthesis of work which i am a keen contributor to, adding these images to relevant articles, editing images and generally as a workstation for wikipedia. This is not an isolated incodent with userpages such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkaci_Nudity_d4e3.html" title="User:Markaci/Nudity">User:Markaci</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_Weird_pictures_1285.html" title="User:Cyde/Weird pictures">User:Cyde</a>, User:Ac1983fan, <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_WikiPorn_d352.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom/WikiPorn">User:Ewlyahoocom</a> and a seperate project Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Wikipedians against censorship/Gallery, where my user-page also features. For these myriad arguments it is important to keep this userpage as it is or if neccesary edit the gallery removing unfree images, otherwise I believe a unjustice will have been served. i take this problem pwith the <b>Administrators' noticeboard</b> with the confidence that it will be resolve fairly in the interest of all.</p>

<dd>As I understand it, the key issue is that Kinstonjr needs these images for his work on wikipedia. As a user page is intended to provide information about the user, these images don't seem to be appropriate, so the obvious solution is to create a sub-page, where they can be stored (the free images only of course). <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:05, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Both editors were banned from Wikipedia for one month, banned from editing this and related articles for one year, and put on personal attack parole.</p>
<p>Problems continue, however.</p>
<p>A new editor <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/g/User_talk%7EHagiographer_d5ee.html" title="User talk:Hagiographer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hagiographer_af5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hagiographer">contribs</a>) started editing on 25 June and on 5 July made edits to <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero%27s_early_years_%281960-2000%29.html" title="Zapatero's early years (1960-2000)">Zapatero's early years (1960-2000)</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero%27s_years_as_an_opposition_leader.html" title="Zapatero's years as an opposition leader">Zapatero's years as an opposition leader</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero_and_the_Local_and_Regional_Elections_of_2003_2fd3.html" title="Zapatero and the Local and Regional Elections of 2003">Zapatero and the Local and Regional Elections of 2003</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero_and_the_2004_General_Election_9f8d.html" title="Zapatero and the 2004 General Election">Zapatero and the 2004 General Election</a>, all of which had been originally created by Zapatancas and then made into redirects by SqueakBox in May, to recover the article versions. He also edited <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a> to refer to those articles.</p>
<p>A strong suspicion exists that this is a sock or meat puppet of Zapatancas, but <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Zapatancas_17c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Zapatancas">Checkuser evidence</a> is not conclusive.</p>
<p>More recently a new user <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPura_Paja_73bb.html" title="User:Pura Paja">Pura Paja</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/r/User_talk%7EPura_Paja_e46f.html" title="User talk:Pura Paja">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pura_Paja_c70a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pura Paja">contribs</a>) has edit warred with this editor. Despite strong suspicions, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_SqueakBox_04a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/SqueakBox">checkuser evidence</a> suggests that this isn't the same as SqueakBox.</p>
<p>But SqueakBox and Hagiographer meanwhile are engaged in mutual campaigns of harassment. There has been little or no significant editing of the subsidiary articles except by SqueakBox, Zapatancas, Hagiographer and Pura Paja and these are the only editors who have ever edit warred on those articles.</p>
<p>A longstanding principle of identification on Wikipedia is that editors who are engaged in similar behavior may sometimes be treated as a single editor with sock puppets. This is expressed as follows in the recently completed arbitration case <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Moby_Dick_3ead.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Moby Dick">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Moby_Dick</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For the purpose of dispute resolution when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar behavior, they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So as a matter of enforcement, I seek consensus that editors acting in ways similar to SqueakBox and Zapatancas in this particular context (to wit, Hagiographer and Pura Paja, and anyone else who engages in warring, tendentious edits, personal attacks and harassment related to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a> and related articles) should be treated as subject to the same remedies as SqueakBox and Zapatancas, and that this should be noted on the talk pages of those articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The principle makes sense but it seems to leave the possibility that it could be broadened too far if used indiscriminately, so whenever this remedy is proposed in the face of inconclusive CU evidence I'd like to see the case made rather strongly that they (the editors in question) are giving a strong appearance of acting in concert. But that should not be taken as opposition to the principle. <b>Support</b> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tony's request is consistent with previous arbitrations, and also with our community standards. Checkuser has never been the only way to identify puppetry, and it kind of doesn't matter who they are. The problem is what they are doing. The editors are acting in the same way, on the same pages. I think applying the same remedy is appropriate. I would be concerned if this were happening on different pages, or if we were trying to broader a particular arbitration into binding policy. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 15:12, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anybody who reads RFCU and WP:ANI for a few weeks can get a pretty good idea of how to make sockpuppets look unrelated. I agree with Tony's proposal to treat Hagiographer and Pura Paja as sockpuppets, per the "if it quacks like a duck" aspect of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock policy</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 16:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Thank you for agreeing to participate in our research survey.
 Our goal is to understand how conflict arises and is resolved
 in Wikipedia articles. To achieve this we need the help of expert
 Wikipedians like you in identifying the types of conflict that
 arise and the degree of severity of those conflicts.

On the following pages you will be provided links to current
 Wikipedia entries and will be asked to rate the degree of conflict
 that the page is in, as well as the amount of vandalism and the quality of the page.

You will be asked to rate 15 Wikipedia pages in total. Thank you
 again for helping us collect this vital information.

----------------------

DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study
 that evaluates the effect of conflicts and controversies on
 Wikipedia. We’re interested in the degree of conflicts and how
 they are resolved on Wikipedia. The experiment involves surveying
 and asking you questions about various conflicts that exists on
 Wikipedia and your opinions of them.

RISK: There are no known risks associated with participating with
 this study.

TIME INVOLVEMENT: The total time for this experiment will be less
 than 1 hour. The survey will first ask some simple non-identifying
 demographic questions about your computer and internet use
 (just a few minutes). The primary portion of the survey will ask
 you to look at various topics in Wikipedia and estimate the degree
 and type of conflict that existed on these pages. We estimate that
 this will take about 40 minutes, depending on how much material you
 examine to arrive at your answers. You are free to take a break any time you like.

PAYMENT: You will receive no payment for your participation in the experiment.

SUBJECT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to
 participate in this experiment, please understand your participation
 is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or
 discontinue participation at any time without penalty. You have
 the right to refuse to answer particular questions. Your individual
 privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting
 from the study. You may report any objections or concerns about the
 conduct of the study to Peter Pirolli, Chair of the Human Subjects
 Committee, PARC, (650) 812-4483.

If delivered on paper, the extra copy of this consent form is for you
 to keep.

If delivered digitally over the Internet, you should keep an extra
 copy of this consent form for your own records. Clicking on the

On the following page you will see 15 links to Wikipedia articles.
 Clicking on a link will open the relevant article in a new browser window.

For each entry, please examine the page history, discussion history,
 and anything else you deem relevant for deciding about the degree
 of conflict, vandalism, and quality of the page. Then rate it
 according to the scales provided.

To get an idea of what constitutes high vs. low conflict, please
 examine the following two pages. Pet skunk has been rated by other
 Wikipedians in the past as a very low conflict article, while
 Intelligent design has been rated as an extremely high conflict
 article. These pages will open in new browser windows; when you
 are finished examining them please continue to the next page.

<p>Personally, it looks real fishy to me, like someone is out for <b>material for another exposé on wikipedia</b>. I think the user <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParc_wiki_researcher_8085.html" title="User:Parc wiki researcher">Parc wiki researcher</a> should be <b>permabanned</b>, but I haven't a clue what actual policies are being broken besides <a href="../../../j/e/r/WP%7EJERK_1eda.html" title="WP:JERK">WP:JERK</a>, and even that might not be considered true by someone else. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">User:Pedant</a> 21:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lots of users display links to vandalism received on their user pages. I think that in most cases, a user should be able to create his/her user page the way he/she sees fit. Perhaps a nice compromise would be to use a numbered link like this, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, to display examples of user page vandalism? <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 03:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not just simple vandalism, nor merely an insult, and should not be treated as such. A threat to kill someone is an illegal act. The only likely effect of its continued display as humour is to encourage more such threats, by providing the idea to copy and suggesting that action will not be taken against the perpetrator. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hoped that my compromise would solve the concerns of both parties. The blue link hides the actual vandalism from being prominently featured and the user is allowed to keep track of vandalism to his user page (again, this is a very popular feature on many user pages). The vandalism itself should be dealt with in the appropriate manner, of course, but the user vandalised should not be sanctioned or chastised. I believe Tyrenius is reading a bit too much into the situation, as the user page will not encourage rampant Wikipedia-wide death threats (for one, most individuals possess consciences that prevent them from making such threats). <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 10:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now it seems you are <i>literally</i> getting his schoolmarms involved.

Take a step back and try to appreciate the absurdity of his threat, and then, perhaps, of your reaction to it.

<dd>I did not criticise your sense of humor. I suggested to you that you are misperceiving the situation. You are <i>still</i> misperceiving the situation.

It may even have been a better response in terms of producing positive effects. Then again, maybe it wasn't. But it was his user page so it is reasonable for him to make that choice. You misperceive his behavior as only having bad consequenses and mispercieve your competing method of dealing with the idiocy (that wasn't funny and didn't refer to a dog - regardless of how you misunderstand my earlier post) as only having good consequenses. Human reactions are not so simple. I expend no energy to defend idiocy. I expend energy to promote a wider diversity of tools in response to idiots than are currently acceptable to you. I am sorry my efforts to help you have been in vain. But Fat Man might have appeciated my appreciation of his way of doing things. And maybe others have been reminded that humor is a tool too. Ridicule goes a long way in many societies to create conformance.

<dd>Idea: try it, see if you like it. Bear in mind that it's a work in progress, and that changes can be made. I can certainly understand why you're concerned, and I sincerely appreciate that you're looking out for the best interests of Wikipedia... but to be perfectly honest, having used it some, I don't see any potential for abuse that wasn't already inherent to the entire AfD system. Users with fewer than 250 edits can't use the program (requirements can be changed/developed, if necessary). Sockpuppetry will still be just as easy to catch. Obviously uninformed or misinformed votes will still be ignored, just as they always have. A team of WikiVoter moderators will be available to respond to any complaints of misuse, and will be able to ban users from using the program if necessary. If this doesn't address your concerns, please let me know of any concrete problems or potentials for abuse, so that they might be resolved or improved. Please try WikiVoter and see what it does, before you decide, that's all I ask. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 03:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've used this software a bit and find it useful for doing all the things Zoe describes. It's current version allows the user to access the article, the AfD nomination and outside search engines by clicking on different tabs. It makes informing oneself on the relevant issues easier and (in my opinion) encourages editors to do due diligence. I guess I could see how it could be abused, as the voting feature would make it easy to just go through and vote to keep (or delete) every article, but I haven't seen any evidence that that is happening. Of course, I could be missing something. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 04:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It certainly makes it easy to do the things it does. But the real issue is whether doing only these things can lead to a good contribution to a debate. Too many people rely only on "the Google test" when "voting" (they should be discussing) on the article at hand; I would suggest that having these built into a program would diminish the amount of actual research or investigation that people do into a topic before contributing to the debate. So it certainly makes certain tasks easier, but we should be asking whether they are actually behaviours we want to facilitate. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reliance on the "Google test" (which is of <i>very</i> limited usefulness/applicability outside of internet subjects in my opinion) is becoming a real problem. No argument there. To take one of many examples, there were quite a few comments on a recent AfD for a 19th century member of the Italian parliament (who obviously meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) that followed the "D, no ghits" line of reasoning. However, Google can be a useful resource if you can use it to find resources online to establish notability for a subject where the article lacks sources. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:41, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried using it a bit and it makes it incredibly easy to get a crapload of "quality RFA" edits without even thinking. Just scan down the list of RFAs for each day, look at the ones that have a high percentage one way or the other, and just pile on. Along with VandalProof, AWB, and other such programs we're reaching the point where anyone can get the "required number" of edits to meet most people's minimums at RFA. Also, this has really steadied me in my resolve to ignore numbers on either side and just look at the reasonings. The inconvience of "voting" in AFD has become so low nowadays that you just see a bunch of people saying "Keep" or "Delete" without any reasoning whatsoever. I think we do need some sort of change to the process, like a policy that allows us to just strikethrough "votes" with no reasoning. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 04:51, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

You'll have to let me know which point was being made to make it an early close, since it isn't immediately obvious to me. Regardless of the worth or otherwise of the software/page (noting we can't stop the software existing and being used by removing the page), I can't see why an MFD couldn't have been let run longer than 1.5 hours. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 06:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>It has a few article which are very pro-Israel, but that is to be expected from a Jewish site. In fact every Jewish site out there has pro-Israel articles, are we going to start removing links to all of them? The links that are in the articles are to specific sections of the site that deal with the content of that article. For example in the Psalms article it links to the transalation and commentary of Psalms, not to any Israel related content. The Israel content is a tiny fraction of a percent of the site. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC) In addition its Pro-Israel articles focus less on politics and more on prayer, charity, and good deeds. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you deny that it carries heavily politicised pro-Israeli editorial content, then? And the translation <i>with commentary</i> is indeed problematic, as is the fact that the copyright status of the commentary is somewhat unclear, and the fact that it is surrounded by adverts selling off the page (see the shopping cart icon?).

<p>About the Pro-Israel content see above. Why is a third party commentary <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a> problamatic? There is no problem with copyright. You can write to Judaica Press to ask them. and a small advert on the side offering someone to buy a hard copy is quite reasonable when you are making the entire copy available online for free. I don't know, but perhaps Judaica Press asked them to place a link there as part of the agreement. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chabad-Lubavitch is a popular and well-known Jewish movement, and chabad.org is a popular Jewish website - for example, it gets an Alexa ranking of 10,786, significantly higher than other popular sites about Judaism like askmoses.com (15,200), aish.com (15,930), ou.org (66,439), and jewfaq.org (68,141). I daresay it is <i>the</i> most popular site about Judaism on the internet. The fact that it carries a small amount of material about Israel is almost inevitable (just about every Jewish site does), though it's not clear what makes this content "heavily politicised". In any event, most of the links appear to be not to content that has anything to do with Israel at all, but rather to relevant pages on Jewish thought on various topics. In particular it's hard to imagine what is objectionable about the links to Jewish translations of various books of the Bible, along with <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a>'s commentary. The <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaica_Press_c0b0.html" title="Judaica Press">Judaica Press</a> translation is generally recognized as one of the most scholarly Jewish translations (it's not a translation done by Chabad, btw), and Rashi is the pre-eminent Jewish commentator - observant Jews almost never read the Bible without using his commentary. All in all, these links are a rather valuable service provided to the Wikipedia reader. Oh, and regarding "copyright" issues, Rashi wrote the commentary in Hebrew in the 11th century, so I suspect his copyright has expired at this point. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm with Jay on this one. That said, the chabad.org site does not in every single instance represent the mainstream Orthodox Jewish viewpoint. In those cases, alternatives may need to be sought.

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean by "past actions" here. All actions that we know of are past actions. If an editor has continually edit warred on an article, then it's reasonable to conjecture (in the absence of the power to see his future actions) that there is not likely to be a change. I also emphasize that the decision to place this editor on probation was made before the edits, and that the decision was made on the basis of what was known about his behavior at that time. The decision of the committee was obviously correct. Even so, knowing that he was to be placed on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">probation</a>, Karl Meier contined to disrupt that article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:01, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a little confused here too. The page says the decision to place Karl on probation was "Passed 9 to 0 at 03:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)". The last edit was made August 15.

In any case that's just nitpicking. Administrators have always been entitled to draw reasonable conjectures on Karl Meier's disruptive behavior, and plan to ameliorate it using their whatever powers are at their disposal.

<dd>"Nitpicking"? Not at all. When is the effective date of an ArbCom decision? It's a crucial question. For example, a common ArbCom decision is "Jpgordon is banned from editing XYZ for six months...if he violates this ban, he's subject to being blocked". So now can someone reach back and block me because I edited it a week before the decision? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> 23:32, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict)This "made/passed" dichotomy seems needlessly unclear. The RfArb page clearly states when the motion was passed, and hence when Karl was placed on probation. Also, this is the same day Karl was notified he was under probation. It appears pretty straightforward that this is the day he was placed on probation, and not before, To ban him from a page based on previous actions is the definition of an <a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_post_facto.html" title="Ex post facto">ex post facto</a> law, and I don't think pointing that out is "nitpicking". If Karl continues his behavior, by all means block him, but don't use his new probation status to punish his pre-probation behavior. Isn't the whole point of placing someone on probation to see if they continue the disputed actions? --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">Nscheffey</a> 23:36, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a>'s request, I am posting to the Administrators' noticeboard regarding <a href="../../../q/m/w/User%7EQmwnebrvtcyxuz_3d2a.html" title="User:Qmwnebrvtcyxuz">Qmwnebrvtcyxuz</a>. A rising third-grader whose intellectual capacity is far greater than his years, Qmwnebrvtcyxuz (the name being a QWERTY keyboard pattern) is my son.</p>
<p>Despite Wikipedia not being a site intended for social networking, he managed to meet several other children here. Unfortunately at least two of those other minors are accused (perhaps with cause and perhaps not -- I am unacquainted with their controversy or history) of discussing possible vandalism to one or more project articles. My son was not implicated in such discussions, and neither was he accused of same, but he was initially banned from Wikipedia by The Anome along with a list of other children who were socially acquainted while their interaction history was disentangled.</p>
<p>Some intercalary background for Administrators: I introduced my son to Wikipedia, and he became enamored with the site immediately. He is a very unusual child, evidencing palpable cognitive ability, and such difference is perhaps best illustrated by the fact of his having memorized 230 digits of Pi (so far), entirely on his own and much to his mother's and my shock. Congruent with this curious achievement, he has edited articles regarding the number Pi (examples: <a href="../../../p/i/h/PiHex_598d.html" title="PiHex">PiHex</a> which he largely authored in its entirety [note the article's unsigned edit history under IP address 71.199.39.144] and the related smaller <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellard%27s_Formula_b732.html" title="Bellard's Formula">Bellard's Formula</a> article which he created), among other minor contributions.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic at hand, I quizzed Qmwnebrvtcyxuz at length, and following some fairly difficult moments here at home which alternated between empathic counseling, interrogation, and internet investigation, I finally drew the conclusion that my son had simply become swept up in an online version of what we sometimes see occur in schools daily: The boy got into trouble, not because of anything he had particularly done, but because of who his friends were. Now, speaking as a psychologist as well as a father, I would like to quickly add that I am very grateful that this lesson is being learned with a computer and an internet site NOW rather than with drugs and dangerous real-life encounters a few years hence. The overused heuristic is nonetheless so true: If you hang out with dogs, you're more likely to catch fleas.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of interacting with The Anome subsequent to his investigation, and he ultimately removed the ban from my son and from our household's IP address. Throughout our contact, he was very concerned but polite, careful but eminently respectful, and entirely lacking in rigidity as he worked his way (and probably continues to work his way) through these complicated events involving so many junior project participants. For my part, I have pledged to supervise and/or closely review my son's participation here, and my son understands that I expect to review his URL history (which is cached in my password-protected router for such purposes) daily for the foreseeable future. In any case, this event has also been helpful to me as a father: The internet is not universally safe, and I have unfortunately allowed my son too much unsupervised freedom despite his very young age.</p>
<p>Speaking professionally again, I would like to offer an uninvited and unneeded defense of The Anome. Clearly his actions were courageous and very likely to elicit uncomfortable questions like: 1) Were the children banned simply because of their ages? 2) Were they banned for discussing, rather than actually effectuating, possible vandalism? 3) Was the net cast too widely, ensnaring other children who weren't actual parties to the questionable activities? (Etc.) I would offer this in return: If a group of children look as if they are planning to engage in misbehavior, responsible adults SHOULD intervene, mindful of the fact that minors do not enjoy the same due process rights accorded adults in civilized societies everywhere (and I would enjoy hearing about the inevitable exceptions). At the same time, such adults need to be willing to shoulder some additional responsibility, as The Anome has done, through their willingness to work with the parents and other Wikipedians in order to see any investigation through to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Finally, I will close with a request, which I have redundantly posted on my and Qmwnebrvtcyxuz's user pages: If anyone observes Qmwnebrvtcyxuz engaging in behavior which is harmful to Wikipedia, an eventuality which I believe is very unlikely although anything is possible given his age, I would very much appreciate being alerted -- <code>padawer AT THE DOMAIN gmail DOT com</code>.</p>
<p>I apologize for the article length, and thank you.</p>

<p>This arbitration case is close and the decision has been published at the above link.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of challenge, non-controversial material obtained from the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hunger_Project_783c.html" title="The Hunger Project">The Hunger Project</a> website, <a href="http://www.thp.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.thp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thp.org/</a> may be included in the article. Such material may be added by Jcoonrod or any other user associated with The Hunger Project. If such material is contested, in good faith, by any other user the material shall be removed unless a reliable published source is available for the information. In this context, a good faith challenge requires some reason to doubt the validity of the information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Critical information may be included in the article only if it is supported by verifiable information which has been published by a reputable source. Material lacking an adequate reference may be removed by anyone without discussion. Such removal is an exception to the three revert rule. Critical information shall be attributed to its source and be placed in context, in other words, practices which are alleged to have occurred during the organizational or formative stages of the Project shall be identified as such.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is presumed that, using the suggested guidelines we have made, Jcoonrod, Smeelgova, and other involved editors can edit responsibly without sanctions which restrict their editing of this or related articles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Arbitration Committee retains jurisdiction of this dispute and may, on its own motion, or on the motion of a concerned user, reopen it for further consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello, this template is protected and i cant had a new interwiki (<a href="../../../../fr/r/e/s/Mod%C3%A8le%7ERestreint_%C3%A0_Wikip%C3%A9dia_5150.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Modèle:Restreint_à_Wikipédia">fr:Modèle:Restreint à Wikipédia</a>), is it possible to add him ? Another think the begin on this template is "This image is copyrighted, and used with permission" and his name (Template:Copyrighted) is not realy representative of this content. but i dont know.
