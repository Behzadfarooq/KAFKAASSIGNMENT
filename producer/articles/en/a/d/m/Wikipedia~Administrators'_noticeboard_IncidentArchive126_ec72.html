<li>Appleby violated 3RR several times. Previously he's been blocked up to 72 hours.</li>
<li>And now, multiple sockpuppetry was confirmed

<li>Appleby <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Circumventing_policy" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">circumvented 3RR</a> with sock puppets.

<p>The unfortunate thing in all of this is that, despite multiple blatant rules violations, he's made some good contributions as well.

Appleby inherited some good traits by dumping some of his bad traits on to his other sockpuppets. But look at the number of Dollarfifty's reverts on June 13 (there's over <b>50 reverts</b> on that day alone, perhaps?). This proves that Appleby is a full-time revert-warrior. If you're not going to indefinitely ban Appleby, you have to think of a method to monitor and restrict his reverts.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 20:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't go jumping all over me, Endroit, especially when it appears you've misinterpreted my comments. I wasn't disagreeing with anyone that Appleby shouldn't be blocked for longer. I've already said I agree that he should be blocked for a much longer time in order to cool his heels for a while and think about how to play nicely in the future. I was just expressing some regret that it came this far since he obviously knows how to edit in an acceptable fashion, and yet chooses not to. You don't need to convince me of Appleby's indiscretions. I've been around most of them, so I have first-hand knowledge of what a pain he can be. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 00:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't condone what Appleby did. In fact, he messaged me once with his sock Dollarfifty, presumably to make the sock look more legitimate and I don't particularly appreciate being used (there's probably a better word) like that at all or wasting my time writing a response to someone who didn't need to read what I wrote. But I agree with with Nihonjoe that Appleby has made some good contributions, especially in an area of Wikipedia that is often neglected. I think a long Wiki-break for Appleby is probably a good idea but I don't think an indefinite ban is the solution. I can't speak for Appleby myself but my suggestion is if he/she promises to be good (taken in good faith), a last chance should be given in my opinion (After a long break.) <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 20:50, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, at least Appleby's writings were reasonable and it means he/she knows how to behave him(her)self. Now that all other accounts were blocked, and the main account's warned, I think he/she can do good job from now on as it was done under Appleby. It doesn't harm to give it another shot and see. Therefore, I object to indefinite ban. 2 weeks will do. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinnre_6885.html" title="User:Ginnre">Ginnre</a> 20:40, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A block for about a month certainly does teach him a lesson, but not an indefinite one. It is certainly far too harsh. Furthermore, see his contributions to wikipedia. The vast majorty are constructive, not destructive. I have never seen him violated any other laws other than this. People do make mistakes, you know. Perhaps he is not even aware of this law and he happened to find out that a computer terminal can create multiple accounts, without being aware of the law. Ypacarai himself, on the other hand, is quite a controversial and stubborn figure in the first place. Currently, even I had problems to pull him in just to enquire him for reasons <b>only</b> on why he removed the <b>Korean naming conventions</b> on goodwill basis.

<dd>Hmm....you do have a point. But I'm sure that besides this violation, he is not a mere vandal and has made many constructive edits as shown on his contributions page and his user page. I certainly do support a one to three month ban just like an armed robbery being prosecuted to ten-to-twenty years jail under Singapore's laws, but an indefinite ban on him directly just like an exceution of a murderer in the gallows is certainly way too harsh for such a valued contributor. I am sure that every other moderate user holds a similar view of my standard, and that few months is certainly more than enough to let him reflect on his violations. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 13:58, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Three words, "I'm always right". That's his attitude on everything. He could give a rats ass that any of us exist. His MO hasn't changed since I first met him. He edit wars people until the either give up or in many cases he drives users off the project(see Jimbo's talk page for the list of his victims). And the admin staff at this site seems content to keep giving him gentle warnings and leave it at that and he treats those warnings like what they are, a joke. Even though he's now got 2 fucking Arbcom probations one specifically for edit warring on highway articles he's yet to have one block initiated on him that's stuck more then 2 hours before his buddy buddy admins unblock his ass. This is absurd! I don't care if he single handedly is writing half this encyclopedia.

<dd>(edit conflict) OK, I peaked, and I know I'll get jumped for this anyway but I first noticed two things:
<ul>
<li>He has reverted 4 times, but the 4th occured more than 24 hours after the 3rd.</li>
<li><b>He did not initiate the name change</b>, which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Highways#Controversial_moves" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Highways#Controversial_moves" rel="nofollow">Remedy 6</a> from the Highways arb case.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I also note from the talk page for that one, he's also the first to initiate discussion on this. Mind you, it looks to have been posted <i>after</i> his third revert. I think he should have reverted only once, posted to the talk page, and brought it here, <i>all at once.</i> But if we're throwing the Highways case around here, I don't think he's broken it so much as strained it quite a bit. It's far too easy to push his buttons.

<p>Im writing regarding a very controversial subject that is being afd'd: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Problem-reaction-solution_a2fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Problem-reaction-solution">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Problem-reaction-solution</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, people are lining up to vote "delete -&gt; RS", claiming there are no reliable sources. At the same time, there are no actual claims of factuality made in the article itself, it just reports opinions of people, and what the people cited view the term stands for and what were it is manifested.</p>
<p>As i understand it, Reliable Sources are needed if one is to claim something as factual. For example, if i say "Iraq has wmd's", i need to have a very reputable source claiming it, for example multiple mainstream publications.</p>
<p>But that is not the case for a <i>opinion</i>. If someone is quoted as having a opinion, then his own admission is enough as being a reliable source for that opinion.</p>
<p>Now, people are arguing to delete that article with arguments like: "The examples provided are not factual, and there is no RS for claiming that they are. The people cited are not RS"</p>
<p>This is problematic in many ways, in my view. First, the article is not claiming them to be factual, it only states that people hold those views. Further, they <i>admit</i> that the people cited hold that view, agreeing that there is no dispute regarding the people holding those views, but they proceed to argue that those peoples view is not a reliable source for the factuality of the claims. <b>But the article does not claim the events to be factual to start with!'</b></p>
<p>This is nothing more than twisting words. They make a false claim, and then argue that the article needs to go based on that false claim, while at the same time <i>agreeing</i> to what the article actually stats: That it is a term used by conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>The claims of the term being a neology is refuted, and so is the claim of it being a non-notable, so people are just throwing false arguments in order to get it deleted.</p>
<p>But what is more: The article <b>itself</b> is about a <b>term</b>. Even if the entire "Example" section was to be deleted as non-RS, it would <i>still</i> not merit to delete the article, since it is representing a real-life phenomena: the use of the term, and what it means: the very basic function of a encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:36, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>A few things here. First, Striver, I think it is courteous to post new comments to the <i>bottom</i> of the page (I'm not moving this, however, because I don't want to cause problems). Next, an encyclopaedia does not need to report on opinions. It needs to report on facts, so if the article makes no factual claims, then it shouldn't be here. Last, an encyclopaedia does not give "the meaning and use of terms", as you suggest above. A dictionary does that, and Wikipedia is not a dictionary. In short, I don't see why this merits a posting on the Admin noticeboard, really. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 11:48, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, sorry, i did'nt know that. As for "Next, an encyclopaedia does not need to report on opinions.", then what is <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_reactions_to_the_2006_Qana_airstrike_45cf.html" title="International reactions to the 2006 Qana airstrike">International reactions to the 2006 Qana airstrike</a>? Or <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a>? They are nothing else than "factual opinions". What i mean is that the non-opinion facts, such as "x was Problem-Reaction-Solution" is not stated as fact, rather as "y views x as Problem-Reaction-Solution", and then quotes y's personal admision as a sources. Since nobody disputes that Y belives that, there is no valid reason to claim there is a lack of RS. With that said, "It needs to report on facts" is fullfilled. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>:</li>

<dd><i>Wikipedia is devoted to stating facts in the sense as described above. Where we might want to state an opinion, we convert that opinion into a fact by attributing the opinion to someone. So, rather than asserting, "The Beatles were the greatest band," we can say, "Most Americans believe that the Beatles were the greatest band," which is a fact verifiable by survey results</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And that is exactly what the article does. As for "the meaning and use of terms", see <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascist.html" title="Islamofascist">Islamofascist</a>, it has a "Application" section and also a "Origins and usage" and a "Examples of use in public discourse" section. When the exact same thing is done in the Problem-reaction-solution article, then all hell is breaking loose. Im bringin this issue here in hope of geting some actual argumentations, since the people on the afd and talk page give arguements that display an unaccaptable level of ignorance for wikipedia policies, and i was hoping to find a higher level of argumentation here.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am hoping to either be shown were i am misstaken, or to agree with me that there is a problem of a majority imposing its will with bogus arguements, and that being a problem for the integrity of wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Basically this is 3RR fodder, but I mention it here rather than there as a) I've already blocked both parties (more briefly than might be wise, given the excessive reversion on one side, and the counter-productive edit summaries and "entitlement to revert" logic on the other), and will re-block if this continues and b) there already seems to be significant sock/meat-puppetry at work, so if someone else keeps an eye out, that would be handy. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Recently created account that seems to exist only to act to revert in line with <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELUCPOL_6fdd.html" title="User:LUCPOL">User:LUCPOL</a>, has a "forged" talk page (copied over from <a href="../../../d/c/f/User_talk%7EDcflyer_9d67.html" title="User talk:Dcflyer">User_talk:Dcflyer</a>) to give the impression of having been around longer than the day-and-a-bit he's actually been editing for, and to top it all off, does content-disputes reverts "in the style of" admin rollback. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:41, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The forged talk page is impersonation, so I'd say that <i>is</i> an indef. block situation.

<li>Indef blocked, given that every edit but one was pure mischief. Now would you do me a favour, and not cite "per IAR" as a rationale for actions (especially, admin actions), given that it a) explains nothing, and b) "justifies" (or at least in some vague sense of "covers") absolutely everything? Thanks. Just a pet peeve of my inner logical positivist. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no rule that I'm aware of, that justifies speedy-deleting something for "obvious trolling." And for good reason—"obvious trolling" is in the eye of the beholder! But this was <i>very</i> obvious trolling, so I deleted it (despite the lack of explicit policy justification) for the good of the encyclopedia. What do I call it other than "per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>"..? My specific reasoning was clearer on other pages, but most of all it was obvious from what I did. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point is, to be clear, that I don't like to apply IAR much at all. Since I did, I wanted to emphasize it and have it reviewed. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IAR may be the applicable "rule", but it's not much of an explanation. I agree with your actions, btw, I just think that for clarity, one should say "invoking IAR, I did X for reason Y", rather than citing IAR <i>as if it were</i> a reason. e.g. "exists only for baiting and annoyance purposes" might not be a CSD, but it's certainly a <i>reason</i>, whereas IAR is not. (For my money, CSD G1 pretty much covers it in this case, anyway.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You raise a valid point. I was in a bit of a hurry, and had a vague inclination (since the user was complaining emphatically and superficially reasonably, in the way of trolls) that I would pass off the facts without prejudicing the discussion by explaining my reasons properly. It worked, but I admit it was a bit silly; obviously IAR isn't the reason one does anything. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 04:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

He was engaged in a dispute already in the German Wikipedia about the subject, and brought the edit war over here, to what was a previously quiet article. Next he claimed that his actions were a grand experiment to test the right wing extremist bias on English Wikipedia, a kind of behaviour that is disruptive in the extreme and should be completely disallowed. It has been claimed I was in a content dispute with him, but I did not block until the issue was resolved with a complete rewrite of the article in question, at which point I was no longer disputing anything, nor was he.

In addition, KarlV's edits seem to be absolutely correct in this case, and Pschemp's wrong - the sources did, in fact, not describe Bad Nenndorf as a "concentration camp", and Pschemp used <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> to insist that it be described that way anyway.

<dd>The content dispute was over as the wording had been changed to neither concentration camp nor internment camp. I blocked long after this was settled. Since when is its said that if you ever edit an article you can't block someone? I didn't "insist", I tried to stop an edit war while we worked on it. I'm not allowed to think? Don't characterize me as insisting either, If I had "insisted" I wouldn't have changed it from both of the original words to a third solution, nor accepted the final ChrisO version. I didn't use any word not already printed by The Guardian, and debating which term should be used doesn't mean I'm a neo-nazi, it just means I'm at least trying to figure out what is the best term. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:25, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

First, it appears that <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">User:pschemp</a> was part of the conflict dispute and therefore shouldn't have blocked. That aside, if KarlV was here to find out whether far-right German contributors had become admins, that wouldn't necessarily imply that he was editing disruptively, so I see no grounds for a block. On the contrary, if there's any truth to what he's saying, it would be important to find that out. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:59, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If any of you think I'm a neo-nazi because I stumbled into an edit war and tried to figure out what was really going on here, then you are sadly mistaken. I looked at all the possible words, and over the course of this dispute educated myself on what should be used. The fact that this article is on its fourth term for the camp and that I tried to come up with a compromise (cited from the Guardian, not original research) shows this. Ultimately, interrogation camp was used, which NOBODY disputed. And my block happend AFTER the wording question was settled. Questioning wording is not a crime, nor is trying to stop an edit war while things are sorted out. And correct edit or not, KarlV started an edit war, broke 3RR and generally disrupted this article. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't see where Jayjg said or implied that you're a neo-Nazi.

Would you please consider undoing your block?

<dd>I'm not getting back into the content issue, it was already settled. I was actually referring to the title "torture camp" there, and as for concentration, the word was used in the article, I didn't pull it from thin air. It was decided that the word wasn't used in a way that made it appropriate to cite it, and I didn't argue with that ultimately!

<dd>I wish you weren't happy about it, InShanee, and I hope you'll reconsider. He said he had a concern that there were far-right editors from the German WP operating here. He made some edits that had been at the center of a dispute on the German Wikipedia (as I understand it) to see whether the alleged far-right editors here would respond. That is not disruption, and it's not baiting in any serious sense. It's trying to determine whether there's a problem. The response was that he was blocked for 3RR by an admin involved in the dispute, and then blocked indefinitely by another admin involved in the dispute. And there are two separable issues here: (a) the indefinite block is inappropriate; in fact I don't see he should have been blocked at all, though he should be cautioned not to play games, if that's his intention; and (b) regardless of any other issue, those two admins should not have blocked; otherwise we may as well ditch <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> entirely.

<dd>Pschemp, how much plainer does it need to be made to you? You and Samsara were involved in a dispute with KarlV over whether to call something a concentration camp.

A few days later, KarlV said that his concentration-camp edits were made to find out whether some editors alleged to be involved with the German far right (or words to that effect) <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Bad_Nenndorf#Stellungnahme_von_KarlV_.2F_Statement_of_KarlV" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Bad_Nenndorf#Stellungnahme_von_KarlV_.2F_Statement_of_KarlV" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> would respond.

<p>I am previously uninvolved in this case, but admit that I've been supportive of actions of pschemp and other editors in the past. I've reviewed this case and I think the content dispute is a total red herring. If we are going to argue that pschemp should not have made the block, ok sure. But the block itself is a good one. I think it's <a href="../../../w/o/n/WP%7EWONK_b33f.html" title="WP:WONK">wonkism</a> to insist that some other editor make the block, but, since I'm previously uninvolved, (have never touched the article or interacted with KarlV) I would be happy to unblock and reblock if that would satisfy the process issue. More importantly, though, it's clear to me that this editor turned up here to disrupt things. Whether for "noble reasons" or not, that's just Not On. There are far better ways to work for change or raise issues than by being disruptive. I tend to take people at their word when they say they ar here to disrupt, and hand out a block. That's the case here in my view. Support the block as is, reluctantly would be ok with a reduction to a definite (but long) term, and will reblock (once) if lifted completely. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:58, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've unblocked and reblocked so the block is in my name, a previously uninvolved admin, based on my review of the facts of this case. I'm not keen on a reduction to any particular definite term... but I think a month might be a good amount if we were trying to give this user a small amount of benefit of the doubt. That said I don't agree with your characterisation of why the block was handed out, it was not at all related to a content dispute, it was related to a <b>stated claim</b> of intent to disrupt. That's a blockable offense, and indefinite as far as I am concerned. The content dispute is a red herring, dismissable by a reminder that at the time of the 3RR violation, pschemp or samsarra should have asked for help, and nothing more... the recent block is completely unrelated except inasmuch as it gives a possible appearance of impropriety. Appearance only, there is no real impropriety here in my view. Let's not wonk out and avoid doing The Right Thing if we can....

It's just that, in this case, I honestly don't get it (i.e. don't see that it was disruption), but perhaps there's something about it that I'm missing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dunno, it just strikes me that this editor was doing a breaching experiment, and disrupting things. I see no need for that here, and think indef is the right thing to do. pschemp is one of the admins I tend to see taking a hard line but who I trust because her actions, while sometimes pushing the envelope, are for the good of the 'pedia and she's willing to make herself unpopular in that cause... maybe her page hasn't been vandalised as much as yours but she's out there making the hard choices all the time. Should she have come here first? Sure. Sometimes expediency should win out and sometimes it shouldn't. But that's a side issue. The main issue is this is a disruptive editor, and as pointed out, a month may not really even inconvenience them in the scheme of things, or (more importantly) act as a preventative 4 months from now if they come up with another brilliant experiment... So I think indef is the way to go here. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:15, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>pschemp: "<i>The block happened AFTER THE CONTENT DISPUTE WAS SETTLED</i>". Blocking post facto could well be interpreted as unwarranted revenge ...if unjustified - that's what counts. I'm having a more than unpleasent exchange on <a href="../../../b/a/d/Talk%7EBad_Nenndorf_interrogation_centre_a418.html#Rewritten_and_expanded_article" title="Talk:Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre">Talk:Bad_Nenndorf_interrogation_centre</a> with pschemp, for several reasons stated there I feel his actions in the course of these events are unbecoming of an admin - IMO he's not to judge about KarlIV given the circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, I concur with SV that KarlV edited proper: he tried to delete POV and "inadequate reading of sources" to put it mildly, pls cf. my unsatisfying exchange with pschemp on that very subject. KarlV's <a href="../../../../de/b/a/d/Diskussion%7EBad_Nenndorf_0e1a.html" class="extiw" title="de:Diskussion:Bad_Nenndorf">statement</a> (it's in English) may show an unwise choice of words, however, he never announced anything that could be constructed as intent of obstructing WP: he saw severe shortcomings both here and on German WP and wanted them addressed - doing so via legit editing, he expected trouble from specified users. This happened, and that's what he wanted to find out: will they hinder me to do what's needed wicipedically. To call that a "social experiment" is unwise, arguably pompous - but undoubtedly just a metaphor. Like it or not, no reason for action. His outspoken wish to go for Neo-Nazi machinations is arguably not the ideal mindset wikipedically, but who has that mindset anyway? Eventually, he's to judged by his edits alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His indefinite block is unwarranted, as he violated WP:POINT only following semantical interpretation of words unwisely chosen. Both his edits and intentions don't allow for the assumption at all. As for his suspicion of here being editors trying to take advantage of others not being able to read sources, be it German ones here or English ones on Geman WP my experience so far corroborates this. <a href="../../../i/_/l/User%7EI_like_Burke%27s_Peerage_fd09.html" title="User:I like Burke's Peerage">User:I like Burke's Peerage</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=67398409&amp;oldid=67296657" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=67398409&amp;oldid=67296657" rel="nofollow">revert</a> to a version containg a forgery is a prime example. pschemp is involved, I quarrel with him about it, and I don't like the way he handles the issue at all.

<dd>The Historian Heiner Wember, author of the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Zeit_0f37.html" title="Die Zeit">Die Zeit</a> article states exactly the contrary: Neo-Nazis he cites made the claim, which he rebuffs as "utter nonsens".</dd>

If requested, I'll have to sort that out on a timescale. And yes, I find it troubling that Neo-Nazi claims are smuggled into WP. German WP is constantly attacked like so, but over there all know to read German sources, so mostly it's to no avail. Karl is afraid that some folk switched to English WP as consequence. Good thinking. Some even start to reintroduce such edits to German WP citing their English articles as references. Absurd, but sometimes it works - sloppy sourcing is everywhere and attrition does wonders.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for Karl's contribs here: he's a busy and respected editor on German WP, sometimes impetuous, and yes, his statement could be seen as loudmouthing; but he's reliable and, say, doesn' t forge - I assume several admins to speak up for him if that should help. He's only an occasional contributor here, that should not be an issue. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 02:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should surely look at exactly <i>what</i> KarlV changed. He repeatedly changed the term "concentration camp" to "internment camp" (see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66859971&amp;oldid=66859559" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66859971&amp;oldid=66859559" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). He was right to change the terminology (though wrong to breach the 3RR, of course): the term is highly POV and isn't supported by the contemporary sources. If I hadn't been busy rewriting the article, I probably would have made similar changes. Does changing POV terminology really constitute a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>?

<dd>When a blocked user makes a sockpuppet and makes an edit, you're supposed to revert the edit, because regardless of how wonderfully brilliant the edit is, the problem is that it's being made by a user who isn't supposed to be editing at all, right? So, we already have a precedent that states that intent does matter. This user had the intent to disrupt English Wikipedia, and rather than it being a mitigating circumstance, ther fact that the user is an admin on a different Wikipedia actually should make the charge even more grave. They know better than to pull this sort of thing. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 07:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Slim, if it was <i>merely a 3RR</i> I'd agree it was harsh, but it wasn't. It was a breeching experiment, admitted to as such by the user. We don't need that here, the user should find something else to do. This is a good block, because, regardless of what the inital violation was, the block is actually for breeching. I believe this has been explained quite eloquently by Phil above... and I'm surprised that you seem to be resisting the notion that when someone admits they are here to cause disruption and expect to be blocked for it that we don't oblige them.

<p>I was travelling yesterday and today and saw now the discussions that break up on en:WP. I am very sorry about the missunderstandings that occured now, perhaps because I expressed myself not in a right manner (excuse my English). So I never had the intention to disrupt. The main motivation for all my edits in the past (and will be also in the future) is to create a wounderful encyclopedia based on realiable sources. I never intended a "social experiment", but I described in my statement more detailed my motivation for my 4 edits on en:WP (I called it test, because of the warning of the user Rufezeichen not to come to en:WP). So the main sentence of my 4 edits on <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Nenndorf_5717.html" title="Bad Nenndorf">Bad Nenndorf</a> was not to test, no - it was a concret edit against the POV-label "concentration-camp", which was defended by several users on de:WP and en:WP. And as anybody can see now, I was right. No reliable source is talking about a "concentration camp" there. So, whatever you decided, at least WP has won, the article has won, and that was the most important for me concerning this issue. Thank you. Karl</p>

<p>This situation looks like this to me: Someone tells Karl that there are biased admins here on en.wiki. So he comes here expecting to find a biased admin, and whichever admin was to stumble into trying to get a handle on the budding edit war was destined to be presumed to be biased by Karl. This is a fundamental lack of good faith on Karl's part. Instead of coming here to improve the articles by working with people to get the facts right and sourced, he was instead ready to assume the worst of any admin who gets involved. We need more AGF here.<br />
The last sentence of his email also reads like something a dedicated edit warrior would write (sort of like <i>I don't care if I get blocked for edit warring, as long as my version of the article stays</i>). This is disappointing coming from an experienced user from another project. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 12:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds to me like he doesn't care if he's unblocked, so why bother unblocking? After all, he got his "win". Too bad he didn't realize no one said he was wrong here. Evidently even discussing such things makes us biased now. Also, he doesn't say anything about not doing it again, and the pompous tone indicates he'll gladly do it again because his cause is just. The issue here however, was never his cause, nor was it "winning". The issue is his behaviour, his violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and the consequences of that.

<p>I think SlimVirgin has about the right take on this. I don't agree with pschemp's summary of the issue. I believe that it was improper for pschemp to block someone he was edit warring with. I also think pschemp was on the wrong side of the content dispute--he was definitely pressing for POV terminology. I don't think KarlV did a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaching_experiment.html" title="Breaching experiment">breaching experiment</a>. A breaching experiment per that description would be putting in a bad edit on purpose, trying to defend it, and seeing what happened. Pschemp may characterize KarlV's actions that way, but KarlV's edit was in my opinion a good one, maybe with some characteristics of a <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeypot_%28computing%29.html" title="Honeypot (computing)">honeypot</a> since he wanted to see if anyone would revert it back to the bad version (which Pschemp did). I like ChrisO's new article very much and ChrisO's terminology is similar to KarlV's. KarlV did use the word experiment on the German page several times, but I think that aspect is being overblown in this discussion. The English article used a loaded POV term that needed to be fixed on way or another. I defer to the better German speakers whether <i>Konzentrationslager</i> is less loaded in German than "concentration camp" is in English, but there was edit warring over it there too (interestingly, it was introduced to the German article by someone with the handle "ProIsrael"). KarlV seems to understand the headache this all caused, so I think he should be unblocked.

<dd>Phr: Your beef about the block is now with me, <b>not</b> pschemp, ok? It's my block now, not hers. I unblocked and reblocked so as to have the block come from an uninvolved admin. If you read over what you say, it's pretty clear that you yourself are enumerating the <i>very reasons</i> that she and I both saw for imposing this block... honey pots, experimenting, edit warring, and so forth. He might now understand the headache caused, but that's true of just about every troll and vandal, isn't it? What is lacking is any statement that what he did was wrong, any statement that he understands that the rules apply, any undertaking not to do it again, or any remorse at the wasted effort and time he's cost the project. Given that, this is a good block. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:46, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin: other than KarlV, I don't know. There were two or three registered accounts and a couple of IP's on de: trying to use "konzentrationslager", "folterlager" (torture camp), etc., but those account names weren't in the en: war. There were some similarities of purpose which is why I said I hoped pschemp wasn't one of the people (under a different account name; note that I wouldn't consider using different names on en and de to be sockpuppeting until we get SUL). Lar: that was a pretty lame excuse for an edit war (4 total edits) and should get a normal 24 hour 3RR block. As for "experimenting", hmm, suppose someone is reverting me in several politics-related articles and I think he's stalking me, so I go edit some mathematics articles and sure enough he reverts me there too, confirming my suspicion. Does that "honeypot" call for an indef block, if all the edits were good in their own right? I don't think you should list "honeypot" and "experiment" separately in that string of amplifications since they both refer to the same thing. Leaving aside any issues with pschemp's block, I have concerns about pschemp's conduct in the edit war (not just warring <i>per se</i>, but specifically warring in favor of POV-pushing propaganda terms) and pschemp's initial report which I see as having presented a somewhat warped view of what had happened. Maybe we need an RFC. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:41, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Phr. Perhaps pschemp or Samsara could say whether they were involved in the editing on the German Wikipedia. I agree with your analysis of what he did: honeypot seems more accurate than breaching experiment. Or if we stop using jargon entirely, he got annoyed about the POV pushing on the German WP and came here to correct the same error, wondering whether his correction would be allowed to stand. I'm having difficulty seeing that as disruptive. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Had KarlV done the exact same thing, but instead gone to an article and replaced internment camp with concentration camp (tests the same hypothesis in the same manner) and announced it as an experiment on de.wiki, <b>no one</b> would be out here defending him. The truth is that people are blinded by the emotionally charged content and thus unable to see the true issue here.

<dd>Hang on. You were defending original research and POV editing. The sources did not say the camp was a "concentration camp," yet that was the wording you initially defended. KarlV wanted to change it to what the sources say. In so doing, he was improving Wikipedia, regardless of any other factor.

What he expected were <i>some</i> admins trying to protect POV per edit war, as he had been warned in threatening tones on German wikipedia not even to try it, lest he wished to run into serious trouble. What was he to do? Announcing, "hi folks, edits xyz are wrong, but I'm one kraut and ought not to interfere - bye"? For what can be said <a href="../../../b/a/d/Talk%7EBad_Nenndorf_interrogation_centre_a418.html#Rewritten_and_expanded_article" title="Talk:Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre">at the moment</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/l/User%7EI_like_Burke%27s_Peerage_fd09.html" title="User:I like Burke's Peerage">I_like_Burke%27s_Peerage</a> forged a source into the contrary of what it said and admin Samsara edited it in a way that makes it likely that he understood what the source said. pschemp reverted to that version fo no valid concern. When I asked for the forger to come up, pschemp answered with uncivil blurb. He refrained from getting to the source however - until SV asked for it, eventually. As I see it, there's no reason to allege that admins haplessly "stumbled into trying" something, that's one possible outcome. Certainly there is quite a number of users eager <i>not</i> to wait for results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seeing Burke's accusing Karl of "<i>provok[ing] a[n] interwikiwar</i>" is rich. He forged, Karl corrected (possibly unwittingly, merely looking for POV), others tried to hinder Karl - where's the interwiki war? Is it me, as I support his edits? I contribute in a dozen or so wikis and I got 1348 edits on en:main since 2005/01. Call me lazy, but I'm no warring Sockpuppet, am I? Some people on German wiki support him too - do they come over to fight? Kylu'd rather less of my contributions on this page - I don't cherish his at all, see above. Is that an interwiki war?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Burke's, of all users, alleges German wiki celebrates "<i>Karl as a kind of interwiki-heroe in social investigation</i>", asking to "<i>please inform the German Wikipedia about Karl's infinite block</i>". Lar swiftly complied. Judging by his English language posts there he wasn't in a position to evaluate Burke's allegation's factuality. Burke's is wrong, all I can find is this comment by de:user Braveheart:
<dl>
<dd>"Was mich aber nachdenklich stimmt ist die zeitliche Überschneidung mit einer Demo in Bad Nenndorf. Ich würde die Stellungnahme vielleicht auch noch an prominenterer Stelle anbringen, um ein Bewusstsein für solche Fälle zu schaffen"</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>One might not cherish that user's activism, however, where's "German wiki's celebration", where's the interwikiwar? Burke's edit forgery is as unbecoming as his incitement of what I'd call a turf war. If he doesn't substantiate his claim of krauts celebrating I'll call it a lie. I'd rather not see him "<i>[h]erewith confirm[ing] by oath</i>" Karl's behaviour "<i>on the German Wikipedia</i>" - or anything.</dd>

The block was made in violation of <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, because Samsara was one of the editors reverting against him. He should also arguably have been warned before being blocked, as it's not clear from his contributions that he had been advised before about 3RR.</dd>

Per <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, controversial blocks should be brought to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">this forum</a>, not executed singlehandedly. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> explicitely advises against blocking when involved in the article.</li>
<li><del>The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> block was also arithmetically dubious. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlV_6a40.html" title="User:KarlV">User:KarlV</a> made four edits in total to the article and the user’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66857154&amp;oldid=65354909" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Nenndorf&amp;diff=66857154&amp;oldid=65354909" rel="nofollow">first edit</a> is not an obvious revert, so, together with the aforementioned issue,</del> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">User:Samsara</a> should have consulted <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> instead of blocking.</li>

<dd>Tell you what... we block people indefinitely all the time, for lots of different reasons, including "exhausted the community's patience", so this is a good block. Don't stand on precise wording, remember that doing the right thing is more important than being slavishly adherent to policy. That said I'd be willing (very relucatantly and only if there was a clear consensus) to go to a month with the following proviso. Before the block ends, I expect to see a statement from KarlV (with no quibbling, excuses, "but I had my reasons", "you're wrong but I'm saying this anyway to comply" sort of wording in it) that said; he was wrong, he understands he was wrong, he understands that he did a breaching experiment, he understands it was inappropriate, he undertakes never ever to do it or any other disruptive thing again, he is sorry that he did it, he is sorry that he wasted everyone's time, and that if he ever does it or any other disruptive thing again he will be blocked indefinitely. The current statement falls far short of that, it basically says he was justified in his actions which I strongly dispute. That mindset of his has to go. If he said all those above things and I was convinced he was sincere and had internalised the issues, I'd go along, but would swiftly reblock on sign of any breech of the agreement. Anything short of that is unsatisfactory to me.

The IP has never contributed any edits not related to this issue, but I felt an indefinite block was not in order due to it being an IP. I think what we have here is a Scientology/LaRouche/US Congress-style attempt at censoring out information unfavorable to the organization being written about. I saw multiple cited claims removed from the article, and from what I've gathered, this organization is something of a cult, which lends certain Scientology/LaRouche-esque overtones to these removals. The content should be investigated by established and trusted members of the community. It should also be noted that the blocked user (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanleygoodspeed777_6ce3.html" title="User:Stanleygoodspeed777">User:Stanleygoodspeed777</a>) left veiled legal threats in his edit summaries ("Wikipedia and each libelist is being referred to The Way International for review").

<li>No way. We aren't losing anything by keeping this guy blocked, and if we unblock him we're only going to incur more risk.

<p>I've unblocked him. If he ever makes legal threats, accuses anyone of libel or defamation, or revert wars again, he is to be immediately given an indefinite block per the terms of his unblocking and probation. In my view, this supercedes the rule about not blocking in an editing dispute—that means that if you're an admin and you edit the article, and he responds by calling you a libelist or revert warring you, you have every right to block him.

<p>If <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorinir_5095.html" title="User:Torinir">User:Torinir</a> had gone around misrepresenting his status as being a Wikipedia sysadmin, I can understand why someone might be justified in thinking that the userbox was inappropriate, but you haven't posted any sign that they did that. The userbox is just a professional description - there are <i>millions</i> of sysadmins out here. Threatening to wheel war over a reversion of a poorly explained, apparently policy violating block and edit war on someone's homepage is bizarre. Threatening to wheel war before you explained your side of the situation in detail, why it was bad and the block or removals were justified? That's just uncalled for.

<dd>Looks like a poorly understood one to me. Perhaps instead of edit-warring over its inclusion or deleting it, we should make it clear that the user performs System Admin functions <i>somewhere</i>, just not here? Say... "This user is a professional System Admin" or "This user works as a Computer Administrator somewhere"? Then: 1. it'd be harder to pass off as a fake "I'm a Wikipedia Admin!" userbox, and 2. those who aren't trying to say they are a Wikipedia Admin don't get penalized for doing so? Zoe works very hard to try to help us out, and Friday's just trying to fix what he sees as a mistaken block. I'm of the opinion that Torinir wasn't trying to misrepresent his status, just trying to show that he is, in fact, a system admin <i>somewhere</i>, which technically is true of almost every person that visits this board. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 04:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is crazy! "System administrator" is a profession, or at least a trade. If someone puts a notice on their user page that says they're a plumber, that doesn't mean they're <i>Wikipedia's plumber</i>. If they say they're a manager, it doesn't mean they're the manager of Wikipedia. As it happens, I'm a system administrator too; I've worked as one for eight years. And while it's stereotypically a thankless job, I've never heard of anyone being harassed like this for calling themselves one ... other than by their own users.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 04:26, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>I don't care if the template is kept or not, but</s> I changed the background color so that it doesn't look like the standard admin template.

<li>I've got to agree that it's a bad box, but that's not even the issue. Zoe is reacting to being reverted <i>without prior discussion.</i> That's pretty much the key. It's ok to change what another admin has done, but <b>talk about it</b> at least at the same time, if not beforehand.

<dd>Side issue: I agree that IRC is not preferrable. In fact, it is <i>not Wikipedia.</i> POlicy cannot be formulated there. Consensus cannot be found there. Since we cannot log it and should not, since we cannot review it and should not, since we cannot form whole paragraphs there nor should try, IRC is merely a neat doodad for folks to chat with, but it's not Wikipedia. I'll use it for a short time every so often, but it's an auxillary <i>at best.</i> I think it also does a great deal of...weirdness to Wikipedia, as it has a lensing effect. The vocal and friendly there can have undue influence on project. If it were a choice between making it mandatory or outlawing it, I'd outlaw it, but that's not the choice we have to make, fortunately. Just so long as we recognize that it's a doodad and not a policy forum, we should be ok. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:00, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I only see two possible ways to go: Either the burden should be on the admin taking the action to justify it to the satisfaction of anyone who objects, or the burden should be on the admin who would undo another's action to justify why it has to be undone right now, without prior discussion with the blocking admin. Obviously everyone's actions are subject to review and discussion, and we all act as a check on each other. If Friday and Zoe had talked and agreed, we would not be here. It's not about undoing a block, it's about not talking and listening first. And too, I agree with Geogre above and Geni elsewhere. If someone undoes my block without asking first, I assume they had a good reason to, and I would not re-impose it without talking first. We all need to give the other guy the presumption of competence, acknowledge our own fallibility, and take it slow. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:01, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many good points. I agree some discussion is needed, one or the other should have initiated it at some point before things got icky. I am not sure I agree that all admins should HAVE to use IRC though... that may not be a fair requirement. but some lines of communication should be open, somehow... and not just talk pages, sometimes offwiki is the way to go. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a></p>
<p>Given Zoe's continued defense of this block after someone else told her it was wrong, I fail to see how talking to her could have possibly helped. If I'd talked to Zoe, not convinced her, and <i>still</i> undone her block, she'd have been <i>even more</i> upset by it, right? Anyway, I agree that as a general rule we should not undo each other lightly, and talking it over is good. In this case, I saw that a mistaken block was made, attempts get Zoe to change it had failed, and meanwhile an editor is blocked for no valid reason- so I did what I thought was least harmful to the project- I undid the block. If protecting the fragile egos of other admins is more important than correcting our mistakes, then I'm using an entirely wrong approach here. As is always the case with any use of my admin functions, if someone else disagrees strongly enough to want to undo what I've done, please go ahead and do so. I make no assumption about Zoe's general competence- only only observe she was wrong in this particular case. Anyway, I see discussion of this is already split between AN and AN/I- if anyone thinks this issue needs more input, please open an RFC on my actions here- I waive the traditional "prior effort to resolve" requirement of such things. It might well be useful to the community to try to clarify the central of whether or not it's always automatically wrong to reverse another admin- I strongly feel that it's not automatically wrong, and that it's in fact very helpful for admins to act as a check on each other. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see this type of thing in terms of American civil Law. A judge might not agree with a Jury's decision, but the only way he is allowed to overturn the decision is if he comes to the conclusion that no reasonable person could have come to the verdict that the Jury did. So the verdict might have been unjust, ridiculous, idiotic, but if a reasonable person could have possibly have come to the same conclusion by looking at the same evidence then their verdict must stand. In my opinion, it is possible that a reasonable person could have come to the conclusion that Zoe did. So even though Friday might have have not agreed with his actions, I really do not think he should have undone his them expecially without even talking it over with him first. Friday's reasoning for not doing this also seems somewhat inappropriate. Basically what he implied was that he only would talk to him if he was sure that Zoe would change his mind.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 18:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>3. The entire thing is predicated on Zoe's misunderstanding of the user template. I've seen that template elsewhere, and I don't know anyone other than Zoe who misreads it to be 'Wikipedia admin'. I don't know Torinir or Friday from Adam, but this entire situation is ridiculous. Zoe made a mistake (misreading a dumb userbox), Friday made a mistake (not telling Zoe BEFORE he unblocked), and Torinir made a mistake (when he simply restored the template in the face of block threats without seeking external assistance). Of the three parties, Friday and Zoe are the two that are held to the higher standard, and I expect better of both. While I agree with Friday's assertion that right is more important than policy when an injustice has been done, I also feel that Zoe put an honestly good faith effort into using policy to make the project better. The fact that everyone collided and royally fucked everything up is less an indication of bad faith than it is a failure on the part of all parties to effectively work together to figure this thing out. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 18:59, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This goes to show why simply reverting a clearly erroneous block should not be considered "wheel warring", just as simply reverting an erroneous edit is not considered "edit warring". The block was clearly predicated on a misreading of a user's claim to work in a particular profession as being a claim to a particular status on Wikipedia. This was a simple factual error, as much as if someone went to the article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and posted that he was born in 1932 (rather than 1732).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The appropriate response to a flatly erroneous edit is to revert it. Reverting doesn't mean you accuse the editor of being a vandal or a rogue or a nutcase. It just means you recognize that an error occurred and you remove it from the article, because an error makes the article worse. Likewise, the appropriate response to a flatly erroneous block is also to revert it. Doing so doesn't mean that you accuse the blocking admin of being a vandal or a rogue or a nutcase. It doesn't mean they're evil -- it just means they were <i>wrong</i>. Everyone can be wrong, and the Wiki Way is that when we see someone committing errors, we correct them. Editors don't ask permission to change 1932 back to 1732 on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, and admins shouldn't ask permission before reverting an erroneous block. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 21:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I strongly agree that 'never revert another admin without prior discussion' is as harmful as 'do as thou wilt' I think there need to be two important caveats; First, if you reverse another admin without talking to them first you absolutely <i>have</i> to explain your reasons for doing so to them. It's like using edit summaries when you change someone else's work, but vastly more important given the greater potential disruption. Second, such action should only be taken if you believe that your action would have a clear consensus of support (because the original action violated policy or some such)... in cases where there is widespread disagreement on how to handle something <i>nobody</i> should take an admin action until some sort of consensus is worked out. I get sick of seeing people place blocks or taking other admin actions <i>after</i> other admins have objected to such a course and then saying, 'you cannot revert me... that would be wheel-warring!'. Taking the action in the first place is just as bad as reverting it if you know in advance that there isn't a consensus supporting it. Alot of times proposed 'wheel-warring rules' are formulaic and simplistic... it isn't about sequence of actions, but rather any time when people knowingly act without consensus. It is perfectly possible for two admins to take opposite actions on a situation while both believing they are following consensus (as apparently happened here), but after that it usually becomes obvious that there is a disagreement and needs to be more discussion... especially if they have been communicating properly. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you. For what it's worth, in this case, I did leave Zoe a note shortly after (but, not before) the unblock. Someone else had already told her it was a mistake and asked her to undo it, and she declined. Unless we wish to be tied down in bureaucratic paralysis, continuing to insist on prior consultation in such cases doesn't seem helpful at all. I don't think anyone but Zoe has said the original block was justified, and a few people have said it was not. I do take wheel warring and disruption very seriously tho, so if there's a reason for me to not act as I did here, let me know. I do see that a few people have said I shouldn't have done it without prior consultation of Zoe, but I'm not sure whether they meant as a general rule, or in this situation specifically. Zoe had <i>already said no</i> to undoing the block. Is anyone really suggesting we let a wrongful block stand in such circumstances? Shouldn't all admins be willing to let others modify their actions when they feel it's best? I realize there's a cultural prejudice against this, but isn't it time for that part of the culture to change? I'd much rather have one of my actions be undone than let it persist in error out of misguided courtesy- the harm to the project is less that way. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:12, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion (mainly negative feedback) regarding a Wikipedia bot created by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html" title="User talk:Carnildo">user Carnildo</a> named OrphanBot. OrphanBot seeks images that it feels are not licensed, or licensed as "fair use," and pegs them up for deletion. Another bot created by Carnildo, <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairuseBot_674e.html" title="User:FairuseBot">User:FairuseBot</a> operates in a similar manner.</p>
<p>The issue seems to be that the bot is not programmed to be "smart" enough to recognize enough parameters to make wise judgments in pegging an image for deletion. It does not parse the text comments made in justifying fair use, but instead looks at an image in a binary fashion of "acceptable" or "not acceptable". Some users consider it vandalism when OrphanBot removes an image.</p>

<dd>Mis-identifying the original uploader is a bug, but it may be an unsolvable one, as there is no infallible method to distinguish between a minor correction of an image and a complete replacement. As for giving time to correct the error: images can be deleted 7 days after tagging. It is in the best interest of the encyclopedia to notify *everyone* that the image is going to be deleted, as often the original uploader is no longer here. Removing an image from an article is a very effective way of doing that. If this was left until the 5th or 6th day, there wouldn't be much time left for other people to research the source or license of the image. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 11:16, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Some users consider it vandalism when OrphanBot removes an image", as do some when we remove personal attacks. Removal of images which don't meet our requirements is fine, same as if a human did it to if a bot does it. Your first example where someone considers it vandalim show when looked at the image clearly was tagged by a human as having an unknown source (several days earlier) and indeed was deleted by another human a couple of days later for that very reason. Your second example doesn't include anyone claiming it to be vandalism, but it does seem to be a simple case of disputed fair use claim, again same if human or bot doing this. Can't track the example of a warning which seemed to have been misdirected since they don't say which image it was. "This appears to happen with any image that is not in the public domain, such as fair-use company logos" - not sure what your point is here, we need correct information regarding any image.</dd>

<dd>Indeed: By the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">image use policy</a>, this bot is merely making sure that people follow the standard procedures for uploading images. Given the scrutiny that bots go through, I suspect this one has been vetted to be perfectly "proper." I don't see the bot as "warning" people in the way a user would warn another for vandalism; it's informing the person that his or her upload is not up to the proper standards, and that he or she should address the matter.

<p>I should disclose that I haven't had any personal contact with the bot, but would it not be useful for the bot to contact the uploader first and give the uploader time to add copyright information, and then put up the image for deletion if the issue is not fixed? Say, a 14-day span instead of automatically adding it for deletion -- The image is not up for deletion for 7 days after the bot finds it and notifies the user, and then is up for deletion for 7 days, meaning the user has 14 days to fix it.</p>
<p>Right now, it seems the bot first puts it up for deletion and notifies the person who uploaded it as an afterthought.</p>
<p>As well, the bot appears to be contacting the last person to edit the image page, who may or may not be the first person who uploaded it. -- <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 11:45, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To address this outside of OrphanBot's actions, is it possible to code Wikipedia to force users to include all copyright information before an upload is accepted by the server? -- <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 11:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure your understanding of who it warns is correct, I believe it warns the last person to upload rather than merely comment, which by nature for renaming images may not be the original uploader. I cannot see how you can code Wikipedia to force users to include all the information, how would it know it is correct? We'd just get people filling in any old rubbish to keep the software happy. I would suggest that would actually be worse. The onl y solution to this problem is a human one, people should include accurate information when they upload files, people should only use fair use claims when absolutely necessary, people should attempt to find alternate images to make the use of fair use redundant, people shouldn't get annoyed with a bot which does a vital task in wikipedia attempting to keep it clean of images used without proper permission or justification. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 13:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"how you can code Wikipedia to force users to include all the information, how would it know it is correct?" &lt;-- I think the point is that currently Wikipedia does not force people to provide <b>any</b> information when a file is uploaded. If it is required that users provide information on licensing then why is it even possible to upload with the default "None selected"? The answer from <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a> seems to be that Wikipedia does this so that it is easy to trap bad-faith contributors into uploading images that can then easily be deleted by a bot. The danger in making wiki interface design decisions so as to deal with users who cause problems is that we end up having an interface that does not best serve the needs of honest contributors. We end up with a file upload system that HAS MUCH SHOUTING rather than a gentle system of guiding contributors through an easy point and click process. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>OrphanBot recently removed from articles about 500 images with fair use claims. If 90% of these were correct removals, that leaves 50 false removals to be fixed. Who is doing the fixing? Furthermore, from interactions I have had with the bot I suspect it does not search the image description page for other relevant tags or fair use texts for specific articles. The shotgun "remove first and ask later" creates more work: after removing yet another deletion tag an image, the article text must be edited too. The coder could have implemented a better net. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 18:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where does the 90% figure come from. In the instance where it makes mistake has the bots owner been shown the mistake such that they can evaluate if a generiic reliable method can be employed to prevent the problem in the future. Is it a mistake a human looking at the same image page would make? I've no doubt the bot makes mistakes but they need to be evaluated in their proper light rather than the abstract. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:48, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

With <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewimages_bd2e.html" title="Special:Newimages">thousands of images uploaded every day</a>, brainstorming about other technical solutions, or more refined automation is useful, but we can't pretend that we can do this by hand. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 20:39, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To answer the various points raised here:</p>
<ol>
<li>OrphanBot is very conservative about what it tags. For example, it will only tag an image as "no source" if the image has a blank image description page, or an image description page with a copyright tag that requires a source and no other text. In every other case that's been reported to me, it was some other user that tagged the image, and OrphanBot was being blamed simply because it notified the uploader.</li>
<li>OrphanBot does its best to figure out who to notify about an image, but it cannot, for example, tell the difference between someone uploading a crop of an image, and someone uploading a new, smaller image. It will ignore reverting of vandalism uploads, and it can detect some types of minor adjustments to images, but when in doubt, it notifies the most recent uploader because that person has had some contribution to the selection of the currently-displayed image, while there's no certaintly that anyone else in the upload list has.</li>
<li>As another point to your statistics, during that same time period, approximately 63,000 images were deleted as lacking source or license information.</li>
<li>Yes, OrphanBot will tag an image for lack of source, lack of license tag, or lack of rationale before it notifies the user. Typically, it will notify the user about fifteen seconds later, but if Wikipedia is running slow, this could stretch up to several minutes.</li>
<li>I've been adjusting the delay between when an image is tagged and when it is removed from articles back and forth depending on the complaints I get. Right now, it removes the image after it's been tagged for three days, which seems to result in the fewest complaints.</li>
<li>I see no benefit to increasing the time limit beyond one week. Of the 24,000 users that OrphanBot notified between December 1, 2005 and June 1, 2006, in only three cases did the uploader offer to provide proper source and license information more than a week after the image was tagged.</li>
<li>If that "500 images with fair use claims" you're referring to is <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Stamps_wrongly_claimed_as_Fair_use:_serious_copyright_problem" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Stamps wrongly claimed as Fair use: serious copyright problem</a>, that was a special request by an administrator to remove every image in the category so that the few good images could be put back. OrphanBot was used here only because it's faster and less boring for a bot to do the job.</li>

<dd>My $0.02: if the people who are complaining want to take on the burden of reviewing the tens of thousands of images which have dubious copyright status, opr to write a better bot, they can volunteer any time they like. Right now, OrphanBot is the best we have, and most of the time - nearly <i>all</i> the time - the tags and deletions are right on the money. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:16, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As usual, there are multiple issues here. First, I could most certainly improve the coding, however I have so far had zero success getting an admin/dev to even acknowledge the existence of code I have already developed for wiki, so I have no idea how to go about it. Nevertheless, whether I could do the programming or not is irrelevent to whether Orphanbot could be better. Some things are obvious and do not take complicated logic. Blank description = no source. Other things could use a little bit more logic. Should an image with {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_license_827d.html" title="Template:No license">no license</a>}} be removed from articles? What if it also has PD and FU tags of various flavors? Does the bot look for that? Should it?</dd>
<dd>On the stamp issue (which is after all what I'm talking about), it seems like it wouldn't have been hard to look for a fair use rationale on the description page. In my experience, only a tiny percent of fair use images have any rationale given. If I had written the program I would have looked for things like that and left them in the category for later human review. If my program could not do that, I would have said so. JKelly has apparently fixed 14 stamp images and found another "dozen" that other editors had fixed already. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 22:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have tried twice to add the following paragraph the Wikipedia article entitiled "Hezbollah" but it has disappeared twice. I have placed the paragraph as a last addition in the section labeled "Rebuttals to terrorist designation" without deleting already present text. Clearly, the article is unusually long and I don't know if my addition gets automatically deleted or someone is vandalizing my relevant and well-documented addition.</p>
<p>MY LAST DISAPPEARING ADDITON:</p>
<p>'Any discussion using the word “terrorist” would be remiss if it were not acknowledged that any dictionary definition of the word could also be applied to actions of the United States, Israel, and other Western powers that routinely dismiss the label. A decades long debate over the definition of “terrorism” continues to rage at the United Nations. Speaking on the July 28, 2006 broadcast of Democracy Now! former Deputy Director of the Reagan White House Task Force on Terrorism, Richard Beck, revealed, “[T]hey asked us to come up with a definition of terrorism that could be used throughout the government. We produced about six, and each and every case, they were rejected, because careful reading would indicate that our own country had been involved in some of those activities.” Referring to Nicaragua’s case against the United States that resulted in America’s withdrawal from the International Court of Justice, Noam Chomsky has often pointed out that the only country in history to be found guilty of terrorism by a world court is the United States.'</p>

<dd>Sentence in question: "My specific interest on Wikipedia is (when I have the time) keeping tabs on homosexual activists who seem to have targetted what is ostensibly a beneficial, encyclopaedic resource as a vehicle to disseminate propaganda, usually in direct contradiction of the facts." This is, in my opinion, an okay thing to have on a userpage (though I don't agree with it). <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:18, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>a) I'm not an admin. b) I disagree with Ros Power's politics and a lot of her edits. c) I don't think her userpage is inappropriate. Lots of users state that one of their reasons (or their only reason) for being on WP is to keep an eye on people whom they think are edit warriors or POV pushers. Ros Power may be wrong in her opinions of certain editors, but IMO she hasn't said anything actionable. If anything happens to her because of this I'll be disappointed, because I've seen many userpages (including those of admins) promising to keep an eye on the Christofascists (my word) or the far-right Zionists.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 22:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed with the above. It's entirely proper for users to explain their activies and approach to editing on their user pages. If it were an generic rant against gays rather than a statement about how this user edits, I'd certainly ask the editor to remove it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just noticed an editor with the suspicious name of <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFR_77d6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFR">user:EnthusiastFR</a> edit one of the pages on my watchlist. When I am reminded of the incident with <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">user:EnthusiastFRANCE</a> I had a few months ago, I realised this was an obvious sockpuppet. I checked his edit history and he has been editing sense late july: this would logicly be before his 2 month block expired. While this block either just expired or is about to expire, this doesn't stop the fact he was making hundreds (thousands?) of edits when he should have been blocked. In fact, the last attack edit I remember of his was several days later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:195.167.240.5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:195.167.240.5" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, so his block should have been re-uped on that day (if I understand policy correctly)... logicly, if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEnthusiastFRANCE&amp;diff=58783222&amp;oldid=57794499" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEnthusiastFRANCE&amp;diff=58783222&amp;oldid=57794499" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> was his as well, he should have been blocked for even longer still. --<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 18:52, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your info is inaccurate and false. You are not seeing things clearly and should NOT be editing 9/11 pages. Your use of the term "9/11 conspiracy cruft" is proof that you have some very serious problem. For you to use such a term shows you to be a silly little fool. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia and should therefore have the all the NEWEST up to date information about the person.

<p>This user has two sockpuppets confirmed by CheckUser. After the kerfuffle over her Raven Symone sock, I'm presently debating putting the sockpuppeteer template on her userpage. However, I suspect she'd probably just delete it and cause Wikidrama.

<dd>My basic feelings about the user are still represented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61098726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61098726" rel="nofollow">my ANI listing</a> back in June. This is a kid and a newbie. She thinks wiki is Myspace and makes up imaginary friends when she has trouble getting enough action... shrug... OK, we can't have that, wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but I wish somebody would just take her in hand and explain stuff, rather than the blocks and the templates. That wish isn't directed at you, I know it's a lot to ask, and I'm not willing to do it myself either. (Children have enough nightmares about Bishzilla as it is.) It looks to me like there are two options: either put on the puppeteer template and adminprotect the page, or post an appeal for a volunteer nanny on ANI. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>It's worrisome I'll agree. At first I was inclined to say she knew too much HTML to really be eleven years old, but when I saw her add the warning tag to her userpage today and break about every div tag on the page, I realized she's just probably copy/pasting what she likes from other userpages. So while I grit my teeth at her claim that she created the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_Mason_04f5.html" title="Perry Mason">Perry Mason</a> article (which she's never even edited on) I do wonder if there's anything we can (or even should) do. Certainly she doesn't seem to understand warnings and other input from admins, and will often just delete them. In other users this certainly wouldn't be tolerated, but I can understand your concern about taking a harsh approach with her.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On the subject of the naive, I agree with Rosicrucian, but I also note that Bishonen is more asking for a patient parent-figure to help the child than that the child's misdeeds be ignored. I like to be a New Critic about this stuff and say that, if a person is doing harm and no good, then it's just a case where "You must be this tall to ride the Wikipedia" -- that we still have to correct and prevent damage, <i>even at the same time</i> that we shower the user with the grace of Wikilove (it's Sunday, and I'm missing church, so expect religious metaphors all day). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:38, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I do understand what Bish is getting at, it'd be with some trepidation that I'd ask someone, indeed <i>anyone</i> to open this can of worms, which is largely why I haven't slapped a puppeteer template on the kid. I remain doubtful the user would take any outside criticism or advice the right way, as she seems to just get confused when people try to nudge her in the right direction. Certainly given the tone some editors and admins have taken with her, she probably doesn't know who to listen to and who to ignore.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, that wasn't my main bone of contention, but it does make more sense now that I see that. Though she is counting one of her socks in the "Creations" list. I think what it boils down to though is the kid really doesn't know Wikipedia, and reacts fairly badly if you point out her mistakes. What Bish suggested in the form of a mentor <i>might</i> work, assuming she was willing to work with the mentor. It'd certainly ease potentially nasty wakeup calls from admins when she does stuff like the sock puppetry.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 00:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Even though I find Bishonen's attitude to be admirable, I still have to state that an indefinite block would be more appropriate as well as prudent. She might be a fine editor one day, but it more or less seems like she has little to positively contribute to wikipedia at this time. I also do not think that we want to send the message that wikipedia is the new myspace, especially since the old myspace isn't even old yet.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 02:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. The user who created the pages refers to them as "development pages", and development pages belong in the userspace. I don't see any reason to have them perform any formal detours on the way there. And I did review them: it was either speedy or userspace. I assumed good faith (with some effort, in view of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=68104790#WP:POINT_by_User:Striver" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=68104790#WP:POINT_by_User:Striver" rel="nofollow">other Striver entry above</a>, but I did it) and concluded that he simply didn't know how to properly name the pages he'd created. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Anchoress: while this would normally be the place for inter-editor issues that require admin intervention (!), when the person is reverting edits of another it can be considered vandalism, and <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> (if you deal with it as a vandalism issue) will have a much faster response time than if you post here and deal with it as a wikistalking issue. AIV's kept on many admin watchlists and updated quite frequently, whereas posts here tend to get discussed a bit before things happen, in general. So, if it <i>can</i> be considered vandalism, then it's just faster to use AIV since people act upon posts there faster. Hope that helps! <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 17:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh my goodness...!!! — The verb "establish" occurs in connection with Muhammad. — What in God's name can we do against this utterly grotesque distortion of history, against this grossly perverted verbal frenzy ...?!--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorius_d6c7.html" title="User:Editorius">Editorius</a> 17:38, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't know if I like the dichotomy of "Non-Muslims believe" and "Muslims believe" but it beats the alternative. Muhammad established Islam and the Muslim community... well, I don't think that makes sense according to modern historians... They obviously don't believe that he was a prophet to whom God revealed the Qur'an but... they also don't believe that he established Islam and the community. There is talk of evolution of Islam... not just an establishment by a single man. I don't think it's clear at all that he established Islam and not only from the Muslim perspective but from the iconoclast perspective. It is indisputable that he is the central figure of Islam... I don't particularly care for either of them... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Esposito_c4cf.html" title="John Esposito">John Esposito</a> in his book "What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam" p. 4-5 writes: <i>As Christians view their revelation as both fulfilling and completing the revelation of the Old Testament, Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad received his revelation from God through the angle Gabriel to correct human error that had made its way into the scripture and belief systems of Judaism and Christianity.</i> <b>Therefore Muslims believe that Islam is not a new religion with a new scripture. Far from being the youngest of the major monotheistic world religions, from a Muslim point of view Islam is the oldest</b> <i>because it represents the original as well as the final revelation of the God to Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad.

The background is complex: Portugal is a republic. It ditched its monarchy in 1910. A mysterious woman claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of one of Portugal's last kings and had her own merry band of supporters pushing this 'claim'. De Sousa is one of those. He has spent over a year rewriting articles to delete or downgrade mentions of the real <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretender.html" title="Pretender">pretender</a> and substitute this woman, one <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilda_Toledano_0d6f.html" title="Hilda Toledano">Hilda Toledano</a>, and the man she named as her "heir". Curiously this "heir" is based in northern Italy. De Sousa's edits place him in northern Italy also. It is quite possible that de Sousa is one of the so-called "heir"'s court and is trying to use Wikipedia to push his boss's dodgy claim to be Portuguese king.</p>
<p>De Sousa has been vandalising articles to write in propaganda <i>selling</i> Toledano for over a year. Having been banned from the site, he now jumps between IPs. Users have sought to semi-protect his usual targets but invariably some well mean admin takes down the protection after sometimes a day or two, leading to a new outbreak of vandalism by Sousa practically the moment the s-protection is taken down.</p>
<p>De Sousa, having found some of his articles blocked through semi-protection, is now resorting to creating new articles to push the agenda which I have deleted. Given that this vandalism by Sousa shows no sign of stopping, and is probably linked to an attempt to push use Wikipedia to push a political agenda by supporters of a 'candidate', does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do next? The current situation, where the same group of users have had to spent months constantly reverting the edits of de Sousa's sockpuppets, protecting or semi-protecting pages, issuing warnings and blocks that go unheeded, can't go on.

<p>Hi, I am 'YourCousin'. This mess stems from a small group of Anti American editors that monitor the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> page. I noticed on the 3rd of August that this Jeremy Clarkson quote had been added: "when you buy an American car, you must afterwards have sex with your cousin, because that's what [Americans] do.". I looked on GOOGLE and The BBC and could not find any such quote so I deleted it as the editor had NO SOURCE. I believe that if you are going to quote someone as saying that <b>an entire nation is INCESTUOS</b>, that you should <b>CITE THE SOURCE</b> and back it up.</p>
<p>User Ryulong did not agree. Ryulong began to revert my edits and said that Jeremy 'probably did say it" and that "It sounds like something he'd say". Jeremy had his admin buddies block my username and he reverted the article back to the status where it said that ALL AMERICANS ARE INCESTUOS. The actual quote is "if you buy an American car you're gonna have to commit acts of love with your cousin". The actual quote as you can see is VERY different than the SPICED UP version that Ryulong tried to edit into a factual document. He insisited and went to great lengths spending over 3 hours trying to get it to stick. The page now has the correct quote AND the source. I'd say that my contribution to the page far outweighs RYULONG's politically and ego motivated contributions.</p>
<p>You wanna block me and count up my thousands of IPs and block them then be my guest. I am only writing this because I think it's wrong that such a WIKIBULLY could possibly be considered for ADMIN. It's a joke. INCEST IS NEVER FUNNY and falsely claiming that an entire nation is incestuous and going to great lengths to keep it that way, is nothing but XENOPHOBIC.</p>
<p>I have a proper USER ID with nearly 2,000 edits. I will never use it to edit pages with politi-wiki-bullies monitoring them. I prefer it this way.</p>
<p>You don't have to doubt my story OR wonder about it. Go to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> and look at the history and also the DISCUSSION history. You will see no holes in my story. Make ADMIN out of that guy? TOO CROOKED!</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Like I have explained, there is no reputation. I noticed that when you edit the Anti American rhetoric out of the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> page that the Anti-American editors chase you down undoing your work, marking you articles for deletion and haveing you blocked for fictional violations. I would never affiliate my real username with nearly 2,000 edits with this mess. I went to battle with some people that were using the page for their own political purposes and I have succeeded. The fictional INCEST quote has been fixed. I have no beef anymore. I'm just watching all you busybodies having some good fun pretending to block me. You guys are soooo cool to hang out with. Thanks for the smug little comment WhisperTome... I'll think about the 'YourCousin' reputation tonight when I'm laughing myself to sleep.</p>

<dd>There is no <b>fictional</b> incest quote. Jeremy Clarkson said everything about Americans and incest on his show. No one is being Anti-American (other than Clarkson, himself). I am, in fact, American. I don't use "coloured" pencils, I use "colored" pencils. I don't go to the "cinema" I go to the "movie theater". I drive on the right (not left) side of the road. I was born in New York, and I have never left the North American continent. If you continue to harass me, as well as do vandalous edits at pages I watch, you will continue to be blocked for your actions. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 20:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

Ok FOLKS! Ryulong is determined to confuse this issue with word trickery. Here it is in plain English. When I looked at the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> page the quote said&#160;: "when you buy an American car, you must afterwards have sex with your cousin, because that's what [Americans] do." -</p>
<p>JEREMY NEVER SAID THIS - But what it does say is that "THAT's WHAT AMERICANS DO", in English, this means <i>THAT's WHAT AMERICANS DO</i>... anyone confused? It says that all Americans have incest VERY CLEARLY.</p>
<p>The <b>ACTUAL</b> quote is (the one on the page now thanks to ME): "if you buy an American car you're gonna have to commit acts of love with your cousin". see? anyone confused? The ACTUAL quote does not say anything about what Americans do... See the difference?</p>
<p>So, Ryulong, wrong again. The misquote that you tried so hard to uphold, the one that I was suspended for reverting, is exactly what I said it is, UNTRUE. You fought hard and long stating that "HE PROBABLY SIAD IT" and that "IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING HE WOULD'VE SAID"... these are not the decisive words of Wikipedia Admin.</p>
<p>Your rebuttal above shows that you are craft, devious, dishonest and that you intend to use Wikipedia for your own POLITICAL agenda and to bully people with opinons different to yours... in my case, my opinion was fact...yours was politically and egotistically motivated. You are a WIKI-THUG... and definietly not ADMIN material.</p>

<dd>YourCousin: you need to learn about citing quotes. When something is between brackets (like these: []) then that means the information within the brackets is being clarified.

<p>It's not a threat. I've found the NOTICEBOARD to be inneffective and emailing "The BOARD" results in computer generated emails when dealing with crooked people, so I devised my own method for punishing bullies. It's VERY effective. I have already had 3 bullies abandon their accounts, one with more than 7,000 edits. I have never vandalised a page once, but I have upset certain politically motivated wiki-bullies with fact backed up by sources. I advise anyone else to do the same. Get tons of ISP accounts!!! They're free and they nullify WIki-Bully blocks. It's a good bit of fun. Now stop bullying me and look at the history taht I so eloquently described above so that you can see what has been going on on the histroy pages. <b>THE TRUTH KICKS ASS!</b></p>
<p>P.S. to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Chan_556e.html" title="Charlie Chan">Charlie Chan</a> who discovered that NTL (BRITAINS LARGEST COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY) is the ISP provider to DIXONS, TSCO, PC WORLD, CURRYS, COMET, BOOTS and MANY MORE!! GOOD WORK BOY WONDER!! GOOD LUCK!</p>

Ryulong, I tried to communicate with you last night. That didn't work so I tried to open a TOPIC on the discussion page at <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> and you just deleted it SEVEN TIMES so that nobody could talk about it then had me blocked!!...</p>
<p>Now that we have an audience you're a lovely gentleman.. this is much better!</p>
<p>Well I'm sorry .. it's too little, too late. You proved that you're crooked time and time again. It's even in the histories. I don't care what kind of quotes are used for what... one paragrpah above that you were claiming that there was no FICTIONAL QUOTE... now that I've pasted it you are saying.. 'yeh there was one but the brakcets blah blah blah..." ... you are making it worse for yourself. It's two paragrpahs up.,.. now you are arguing with yourself?</p>
<p>No fictional quote? Now you say "Yeah but"?... I'm sorry... you are clearly not WIKI ADMIN material. You are dishonest, weaselly and devious.</p>
<p>It's not only above in YOUR own words, but also in the histories of the pages that I have referred to above. Don't try so hard. It doesn't pay to be a crooked bully. Dishonesty always gets found out. How long did you think you could keep the page like that? you must know that Americans would be looking at it.</p>
<p>You may have turned the tables and had me suspended etc.,.. but you are the liar. You have contradicted yourself HEAVILY on this very page.</p>

<dd>Why do you constantly say I'm not American? And <b>I</b> did not delete it seven times. And even in each time it was a rant against me. I have watched the clip about the Dodge Charger, and the video does not continue to where Clarkson would have said anything. The part where it mentions "sexual acts with your cousin" is gone. <b>However</b>, he did mention incest when he was talking about the Ford F150, and that quote <b>will</b> stay. Your actions are not proving you to be a serious editor with evading your block by constantly changing your IP, and with your constant harassments of myself, WhisperToMe, and any user who did anything at my RFA, you will find your ISP pulled. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 21:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryulong LIES AGAIN when he says he didn't delete my TOPIC seven times. It's right on the DISCUSSION HISTORY of the Jeremy Clarkson page. I even started to note the amount of times he deleted it within the EDIT SUMMARY and at the top of the TOPIC each time.</p>
<p>Also, RYULONG opens the above statement with "Why do you constantly say I'm not American?"... I have NEVER said this and you won't find him pointing you to any HISTORY page to say I did because this is the exact calibre of MIS-INFORMATION that this ADMIN NOMINEE thrives on!</p>
<p>This guy is lying now. You only have to look at the HISTORY OF THE PAGE to see who is telling the truth. Please people.... you just have to look! Ryulong tried desperately to make the page say that ALL AMERICANS PRACTICE incest. It's CLEAR for all to see in the history.</p>
<p>For the new people, I was suspended for reverting this quote that Ryulong FOUGHT HEAVILY to preserve: "when you buy an American car, you must afterwards have sex with your cousin, because that's what [Americans] do."</p>
<p>I told him many, many times that the quote was wrong and tried to get him to find the real quote and cite the source (ITS ALL IN THE HISTORY)... he refused, deleted it and had his admin buddies block me and even made SMUG remarks about me, JASON SMITH in the edit history. Yes, He put <b>MY NAME</b> in the edit history! ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS LOOK!! This person is WAAAY too devious to be ADMIN... lies on the page here.. and all the lies I've claimed he's said, are SUBSTANTIATED IN THE HISTORY... you only have to look.</p>
<p>Thanks TheM62Manchester! You are the first person to contact me that didn't want to bully, threaten or make a smug comment. It's nice to see a productive and polite Wikipedian. I will take your advice and I look forward to a long future editing. I have contributed to 41 articles today under my real account. Thanks again mate... You calmed things a bit...</p>
<p>RYULONG... You have lied 3 times on this page.. challenge me to point them out? I can cite sources if you like?</p>
<p>Wiki-bullies are weak.</p>
<p>This guym TheM62Manchester should be nominated for ADMIN, he is cool calm and collected... seems like an honest chap too!</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">I watched the clip that ChicosBailBonds cited as to have the comment about "when you buy an American car..." and the quote was not in the video clip.

<p>I watch Jeremy Clarkson and you and your friends made up a QUOTE and cited it is AUTHENTIC when you knew that the source DIDN't CONTAIN the quote. The quote involved INCEST... yeh very funny! So you are VANDALISING the Jeremy Clarkson page AND you are a nominee for ADMIN? I think that people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.</p>
<p>You have lied countless times on this page alone... if people bother to check the history of the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> and it's discussion page, we can see what fun you are when your comments are not appearing on the ADMIN NOTICEBOARD. You made up two different quotes and then cited a source that didn't substantiate your PHONEY quote... YOU ARE THE VANDAL! Only difference is...l you think you are admin material... which after people look at the history I speak of, will be a laughing matter.</p>
<p>So why not LEAVE ME ALONE Ryulong and stop sending stupid threats that you can't uphold to me... it's innane... You lost. The quote that you insisted was true has now been corrected by yourself solely because of MY comments on this page and your fear of it affecting your ADMIN nomination.</p>
<p>Go away little boy... go away!</p>

<p>I have been blocked INDEFINIETLY simply for requesting to have my two week block undone. I have proved with GREAT abundance on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:YourCousin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:YourCousin" rel="nofollow">USER PAGE</a> that Chairboy has tried to rig the vote.</p>
<p>He challenged me to prove that he is a liar and I did with considerable ease.</p>
<p>I have been blocked indefinitely for requesting a to be unblocked. It's unbelievable that you want this to GO ON AND ON AND ON... why?</p>
<p>The original edit war ended. I won. I was correct. Ryulong treid to uphold a phoney quote with a phoney source... I prved him wrong.. he didn't like it and here we all are.</p>
<p>Since I have done NO sockpuppeting (since my block was put in place) and was VERY, VERY careful not to personally attack anyone (SEE MY TALK PAGE).. I find it odd that suddenly my block is INDEFINETLY extended because supposedly I "cannot remain civil and coherent, and continues to make inflammatory attacking comments with incivil edit summaries".</p>
<p>Chairboy the #2 supporter for the RFA of Ryulong said that "I have had one interaction with Ryulong, and only one." ... I then went on to prpve that it was 9 to which he said WHOOPS.</p>
<p><br />
This is why his friends have some along to suspend me. On the pag you can see that in his incivility, he constantly tried to upset me with , false claims and sarcasm. I believe that when you punish an reaction to a personal attack, that you must first punish the instigator or you yourself are untoward.</p>
<p>I am having my vote silenced AND my talk page has now been 'protected' so that I cannot defend muyself anywhere. This is not an Iranian court.</p>

Thanks Chairboy. Unfortunately in your whimisical involvement in this issue, you have over looked that 'YourCousin' specifically refers to the bogus quote that Ryulong tried to uphold that concerned incest and COUSINS...</p>
<p>I was trying to get the account unblocked early so that I could vote under that name, YourCousin... that would have been class!!</p>
<p>As it is, I have done 56 edits today under my real account. I'm into classic rock and 80s action movies... stuff like that.</p>
<p>I must say, it was good fun taking up your 'PROVE I'm A LIAR' challenge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:YourCousin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:YourCousin" rel="nofollow">here</a> last night! Ha... what a roasting!!</p>
<p>Even if you and I were the only ones that ever saw it... (which we weren't)..</p>
<p>As Ryulong would say I was actually, "LAUGHING OUT LOUD".</p>
<p>When I see that Jaranda has indefinitely blocked my 'DISPOSABLE' account, 'YourCousin' and then Lar endoreses the block... I find myself, "LAUGHING OUT LOUD" again.</p>
<p>You guys and your BLOCKS(wishful gestures) are adorable. I love them! It's the best summer ever!!</p>
<p>I'm gonna hit 2,000 edits within the next few days.. I've been on for seven months... I wonder if I should nominate myself for ADMIN soon... hmm.. I might wait 1 more month. I can't wait to get a hold of those tools! FUN FUN FUN!</p>

<p>On July 23 User:Homey claimed to have left Wikipedia and asked to have his account blocked, in order to avoid an arbitration case that was being brought against him for various abuses, including sockpuppeting. As it turns out, even while the case was being considered, and before he claimed to have left, he was creating even more sockpuppets, and since then this has continued. In all he has created at least a dozen sockpuppets, some of which he has used to harass former "enemies", and some of which ended up being blocked for various kinds of disruptive behavior. Yesterday, while following up on one of the accounts that had been blocked as a sockpuppet of WordBomb, I discovered the extent of Homey's behavior. I consulted with the Arbitration Committee list, and in agreement with them I have now tagged and blocked all of his sockpuppets (well, all the sockuppets that weren't already blocked by others). The entire list of sockpuppets can be found here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Homey_29c8.html" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Homey">Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Homey</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 15:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

a) User:Homey is a defunct account, I do not have access to it since I don't have the password. The account was never banned but was blocked and desysopped on my request as I no longer had access to it and as I suspected someone else had gained access to it at some point meaning it was not secure.</p>
<p>b) Jay is incorrect to say that I left wikipedia to avoid an RFA, I explicitly said that the RFA should not be discontinued because I was leaving and that if it continued I'd be happy to stay and fight it. However, since I no longer had access to the account and since there were several imposters, one of whom I believe was <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">User:Dervish Tsaddik</a> (who posted as "daughterofzion" and signed several anon IP posts as "sonofzion" and may have also been the original <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonofzion_3228.html" title="User:Sonofzion">User:Sonofzion</a>) there was no way to be certain on which of the IPs posting to the RFA were actually "Homey".</p>
<p>c) the Homey account was not banned and was not going to be banned (the RFA was on desysopping) hence it is absurd to accuse that account of having sockpuppets, particularly when the account is defunct.</p>
<p>d) Jayjg is completely mischaracterising the behaviour of the alleged sockpuppets. If one actually looks at their edits they are not controversial. Jay wrongly implies that numerous of the accounts were blocked because they were being "disruptive". In fact, only one of these alleged sockpuppets was blocked and that was because it was, incorrectly, accused of belonging to Wordbomb since it asked whether the checkuser for Mantanmoreland was going to be posted (it's beyond me why such a query is considered "disruptive" as a checkuser was run on Mantanmoreland and came out positive).</p>
<p>e) the alleged sockpuppets were not editing the same articles and were not doing anything in violation of WP:SOCK</p>
<p>f) the accounts were not being operated by a single person though they were using a shared semi-public IP in the computer room of a co-op. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_the_Cotton_Fish_23d9.html" title="User:Fluffy the Cotton Fish">User:Fluffy the Cotton Fish</a> and <a href="../../../4/t/h/User%7E4thright.html" title="User:4thright">User:4thright</a>, for instance, were not the same person who used User:Homey. I did use a few of the alleged sockpuppets after I junked Homey but did so on a temporary basis (ie one day each) without bothering to retain the password as I do not wish to return to wikipedia permanently. 69.158.191.248 22:41, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Homey, an apology is not enough. Your actions have been disruptive. Myself and other admins spent hours of our time trying sort out your sockpuppet accounts. Your actions confused the situation, making it more difficult to accurately enforce a ban against WordBomb, an indef banned user. Sorry but I agree with a community ban. You can ask the Arbcomm and Jimbo to review it. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 05:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose that we declare a community ban of User:Homey, in all past, present and future incarnations, whether sockpuppet or single purpose account, for exhausting our patience. That should remove any further need for wikilawyering about Jayjg's blocking your accounts, whether they are technically socks by the letter of the policy, etc. <i>ad nauseum</i>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 03:31, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I think it's you who is doing the wikilawyering and retroactively trying to justify an unjustified ban. See <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc.html" title="Post hoc ergo propter hoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>. If you want to ban me then go to the ArbComm rather than trying to sneak it in by the back door (I've opened an RFA on Jay and Pinchas' behaviour). The so-called sock puppets were non-abusive - if you want me to only edit with one account fine, I'll do that (though my edits have been tapering off, actually, and will continue to do so) but retroactively declaring Homey banned is an abuse of process as is trying to distort policy to justify an action - it's pretty easy to throw out the concept of due process and rule of law by arguing that these things are "lawyerly" traits but it's a dangerous route for wikipedia to go down Thatcher131. 72.60.227.118 03:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Home is clearing attempting to still edit while avoid going through his ArbCom. The chutzpah to accuses the admins trying to deal with the situation of wikilawyering is outstanding. He has already attempted to bring his own RfAr (which of course is on his terms). I support a community ban and an end to this nonsense. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:09, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are misrepresenting things Joshua. The RFA against me had to do *only* with being an admin - as PinchasC wrote in the confirmation section "Not applicable. This is a request for review of admin status." I am no longer an admin by my own request so that RFA is moot. If you don't want an RFA to be avoided then let's go to the ArbComm by all means rather than acting arbitrarily against <i>non-abusive</i> edits. Anyway, as you should well know, an RFA is really never on anyone's terms but the ArbComm so your commont "of course is on his terms" is nonsense. If you think I'm trying to edit while "avoid going through his ArbCom" then fine, lets go to the ArbComm. Given User:Homey's long history and the relatively good status that account enjoyed until just a few months ago acting in an arbitrary manner without going to an RFA is unjustified, particularly given the fact that we are not dealing with personal attacks but with edits which even SV conceded were "legitimate" and "good" in the case of the PETA article. Again, if you want to ban me then go to ArbComm rather than banning through the back door. 72.60.227.118 04:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sockpuppetry was seriously abusive. There were RfArs being filed, then withdrawn; requests for desysopping that no one knew whether to trust; interference in trying to keep track of WordBomb, an abusive user who was engaged in on- and off-wiki harassment; one of the sockpuppets accused me of admin abuse because I blocked a WordBomb account after he had tried to "out" an editor; the attempt to interfere with PinchasC's nomination.

<li>I just wonder what is <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> role in all this: She came in as "neutral" honset mediator but clearly tried tio tilt the mediation to one side, eventually, after causing much disruption to the mediation process (deadedned) she ended the dragged on mediation and joined one side, filled nomerous "evidence" trying to cause great hardship to admins and editors who tried to resolve the situation. In the process she tried again to absolve some sock puppets by using some non public "tools" that no one but her can see the results. All this time the Wikipedia article on "israeli partheid" gained in number of google popularity something (that if I remeber correctly and if i am mistaken I appologize on the spot) Kim at some point argued that it is favorable result. This whole set of articles by Homey (with the support he got from Kim) has resulted in great great disruption to everyone involved. maybe Kim should just censor her self fro a month or two and let the disruption clear itself out&#160;? <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 08:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me point out that in the past, he had said he was leaving, but obviously has not done so. He has posted from IPs and then claimed they were impersonating him. He says he has used single purpose accounts to make constructive edits, but at least one of them (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbamama_ba38.html" title="User:Barbamama">User:Barbamama</a>) was highly disruptive, and others have targeted his previous foes' edits. In fact, if it were not for Barbamama, the rest of his accounts probably never would have been found out, so he only has himself to blame. However, since there are admins who still defend him, Arbitration is probably the best route. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 11:58, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Kim, I find it odd that you have first tried to defend Homey's fringe political views (during after the mediation in which you were supposed to the honest broker) and continued to defend his behaviour.

<p>This is a copy of my statement put on ArbCase that EX-Homey filed.</p>
<p>IMO that User:Homey is currently under a community ban. All of User:Homey's user accounts are indef blocked on sight by myself and other admins. No other admins have undone these blocks. This type of behavior by the community is by definition a community ban. If they so desire, the Arbitration Committee and Jimbo can review our ban. If the Arb com wants to open a case and modify the community ban they can. Until an admin reverses one of User:Homey's blocked account, hopefully with full community consensus, I consider him under a community ban and will continue to block his sockpuppet user accounts. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 14:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not exactly. First, the user was in an RfAr over abuse of their admin tools. Then the user quit Wiki and asked to be desysopped and their standard account indefinitely blocked. About simultaneously it was discovered that the Home had been using abusive sockpuppets. Home then proceeded to edit using various other accounts. Due to the previous sockpuppets and disruption, many admins have been blocking his new puppets on site. But his original indef block was at his own request. Someone please correct me if I am missing any major details. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After quite a bit of thought, I have to support the community ban. At this point Homey is deliberately subverting any attempt at process and order on Wikipedia. I'd allow him the opportunity to explain himself, but until then he - in all his manifestations - should be banned. And good riddance. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to add my support for a community ban, as his army of sockpuppets have demonstrated that he does not care much about Wikipedia and he will do what he could to disrupt it. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 02:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Leifern. I haven't had much interaction with Homey (some on AfD, a few comments on talk pages), but from what I've seen of his behavior so far, this person should be banned. He has had numerous chances to reform, and he has avoided attempts at reconciliation, choosing to puppetmaster, harrass other users, and even delete his own user page. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 02:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Obviously I support this. He still continues to sockpuppet, having created several sockpuppets since then, including ones not yet identified as sockpuppets. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 04:35, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well intentioned, I'm sure, but perhaps a bit hasty? I'm thinking in particular about Israelbeach. You wrote virtually nothing on the long term abuse page that you created for him, and I wonder if you are at all familiar with his case? Though I believe he has engaged in vandalism, he is not the classic vandal who vandalises Wikipedia for vandalism's sake, so much as a tendentious and contentious editor who targets specific users whom he has decided are his enemies (such as myself). Labelling such a user a "vandal" in this way is a bit strong, and likely to drive him to further extremes. I'm of a split mind about this, as you can see I've moved content to the page you created (from what was once <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Israelbeach_66cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Israelbeach">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Israelbeach</a>, but I'm not at all sure it was necessary to make this move. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 08:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Though it may be edging towards spam, I think the members of a project, no matter how POV it is have a right to know that it is being deleted. Besides, it is not votes that count in an AfD but is based on consensus. I'm sure the person closing the debate and reaching the verdict would do enough research to find out which people are part of the organisation and which are not. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 09:20, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wouldn't you assume that <i>members</i> would have the project page on their watchlist anyway? So while D-Boy's posts may have been slightly redundant, I see no reason to drag him here as a spammer. Rather, since "voting is evil" anyway, I encourage all "fundy watchers" to constructively attempt to recognize the problems with their project, and to transform what is useful into a more acceptable framework. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This bothers me a lot. AfD is theoretically not a vote, but in practice it is one, except for blatant cases of single-purpose accounts suddenly appearing from off-wiki and that sort of thing. If an organized group of shared-POV editors participates in an AfD, then at minimum, there should certainly be a notice about it inserted into the AfD to help the closing admin determine the general community consensus. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

An anonymous user has posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ferick&amp;diff=68199360&amp;oldid=68173260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ferick&amp;diff=68199360&amp;oldid=68173260" rel="nofollow">this</a> to the RfC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=68199754&amp;oldid=68169889" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=68199754&amp;oldid=68169889" rel="nofollow">this</a> to my talk page and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ferick&amp;curid=3016288&amp;diff=68229837&amp;oldid=68096111" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ferick&amp;curid=3016288&amp;diff=68229837&amp;oldid=68096111" rel="nofollow">this</a> to Ferick's talk page. The net effect of the anonymous user's comments is to portray me (falsely, of course) as anti-Muslim. However, the same user made a series of edits to the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> article last week, reverting it to an Albanian-nationalist version preferred by Ferick (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=208.3.69.196" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=208.3.69.196" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>). I believe this is the same person who made identical edits around the same time from 172.214.0.245, 81.132.186.22 and 87.86.8.3 - all apparently compromised hosts. From the edit history and edit summaries, I strongly suspect that the anon is Ferick himself, trying to smear me as anti-Muslim and pro-Serb and to portray the RfC as being part of a supposed effort to promote "Christian culture" in Kosovo.</p>
<p>I don't believe that the anon's comments should remain in the RfC. At the very least, this seems to be a case of gaming the system. However, as an involved party I obviously can't remove them myself. This is a most unusual situation; I don't think I've ever come an editor behaving in this way before. Any advice? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obvious solution is for someone to insert a comment into the RfC about the attempted manipulation. I'll do it if you want.

Due to the request being aborted (the user had formatting problems with their attempt), they are not considering the unblock-answer authoritative.

<p>I believe that over (at least) the last few weeks, a series of anonymous IPs have been inserting hoax information in articles about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Adelaide_ca80.html" title="University of Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>, specifically relating to the Wood-Bright Professor of Women's Studies. I've been flagging possibly affected articles with {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}}, but the quantity of IPs and extent of the hoax is expanding to consume more time than I currently have available. In other words, over the last few weeks, some anon IPs have been adding false information, some have been attempting to remove it, and others have been re-adding it, and there's a lot of page history to go through, so I am requesting assistance. I have placed more info at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniversity_of_Adelaide_1c84.html#Possible_hoax" title="Talk:University of Adelaide">Talk:University of Adelaide#Possible hoax</a>, which is probably the closest thing to a central repository of information on the situation.

<dd>And you have also been tagging genuine articles as hoaxes which a quick Google search would clarify as genuine for some reason, though Wood-Bright Professor of Women's Studies does seem to be a hoax. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 19:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been tagging articles as hoaxes, if I had a reasonable concern that <i>some</i> of the information in the article may have been part of the hoax. That's the tricky thing about this one, is that the information is getting inserted in bits and pieces, by multiple accounts. If it were simple and straightforward, I wouldn't have asked for help.
