<p>I am having a problem with admin Tom Harrison. He is currently engaged in an edit war, reverting the inclusion of a link, however refusing to participate on the talk page. I have asked people to discuss the issue on the talk page using guidelines and policies, instead of personal opinions on the source. Tom has refused to even respond to me after being asked twice to participate.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tom_harrison#CR.2FCNN" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tom_harrison#CR.2FCNN" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] I just went to ask them again after their latest revert and found their user page protected from all editing. I am asking someone politely ask Tom to either stop reverting, or at least feign interest in the discussion for which he is a minority. Himself and one other user has argued the link should not be included, calling it a blog, which was refuted, then a wiki which was refuted and finally an anonymous site, which the registrars information was then provided. I am growing tired of this user simply ignoring people and reverting blindly.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=94063265&amp;oldid=94060942" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=94063265&amp;oldid=94060942" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Note, tom has not posted anything regarding any of those points, the other user brought them up and were disagreed with by myself and others.</p>
<p>Tom has also displayed a misunderstanding of WP:EL, stating we do not use an external link if we have a Wiki article on the topic,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=93289282&amp;oldid=93257519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=93289282&amp;oldid=93257519" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> however the EL in question is actually more detailed then possible to achieve on the article and provides a greater period of time that can be covered by a single Wiki article. WP:EL also states that the external link should contain more information that then article its being placed in would have once it reaches Featured Article status. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 15:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

About Tom ignoring the request to participate 2x? That is what this AN/I is about, an admin refusing to use the talk page yet reverting anyway, refusing to even state their point, and not following WP:EL.

<li>As usual the onus is on the editor seeking to include content to provide a justification and persuade those who disagree. You haven't. They rightly note that the timeline you want to link is contentious.

<dd>That timeline is not as detailed and further WP:EL states that external links can be used if they present more information then that of which can be included in the article in question if it was to reach Featured Article status, this surely fulfills that. We have articles on the Geneva Convention, are you stating we should never link directly to the Geneva Convention on outside websites, hows about the Declaration of Independance and other historical records? WP:EL is quite clear on this and I have yet to see anyone disagree. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 18:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have according to WP guidelines stated my case, the arguement against its inclusion has not been based on any policy or guideline but just that the people do not like it, which is not adequate. What if you were in a situation where someone on the article for China did not want it included that China was in Asia, what do you do if two people disagree with 7 on this? Do you leave it out? Even if they do not present a reason that fits a policy or guideline, they just dont like it. I would be happy to discuss it, but as I have pointed out to you, Tom has no participated on the talk page regarding this, which is what this AN/I is about, not the link itself. If Tom is just reverting to maintain "concensus" then that means RX is actually alone in not wanting the link, and the concensus is actually completely against him. Further reason Tom should not be reverting and refusing to use the talk page. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 18:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always wondered: what harmful effect will further edits to the actual page have? Continuing the discussion on the tfd talk page, the template talk page, or participant's user talk pages would be unneededly breaking up discussions. As long as further discussion on the tfd page itself isn't disrupting anything, I think leaving it is okay, especially since you closed it as speedy kept after only 27 hours. Although I think the speedy closure was the right decision (there was a definite consensus to keep, and I'm going to assume the tfd notice looked terrible when transcluded in articles), there is still plenty that could have been left unsaid in 9/8 days, and continuation elsewhere could leave later readers confused. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Þicaroon</a> 22:29, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I can think of precious few reasons why you'd ever want to shut off discussion. This doesn't meet any of them. Let the discussion continue on the talk page or something if it's really so imperative that the main TFD remain further unedited. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that using transclusion in signatures is a seriously bad idea. It means that discussions (which should be a historical record) can change arbitrarily without records in the history, for one thing, and there are massively more instances of a given signature on a busy talk page than of any template in project space (plus we work to remove a lot of them, like {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}). I have yet to see a compelling reason <i>for</i> using transclusion in sigs. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:02, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK you may be right that the bot does the right thing. Maybe I have been just overly scared. But it isn't meeting half way, if you request of someone who feels he is in an emergency to start doing research first. I feel administrators have an obligation to respect polite requests to stop a process if there is no reason why it couldn't be stopped for a moment.

<dd>Sebastian, it's quite clear that you don't have a specific complaint against Metsbot.

<p>The preferences page specifically says not to use templates in your signature. I doubt the fact that it's in the User namespace not the template namespace makes any difference.

<p>I hope an admin can help with this.</p>
<p>Apparently a Wikipedia user has caused problems with other Wikipedia users. There is an incident in the archive with this users Wiki name and IP address.</p>
<p>The IP address is not his, but rather my companies.</p>
<p>We have discovered this user may have caused problems elsewhere on the Internet, and our searching shows he seems to have done the same here.</p>
<p>We would very much like to disassociate ourselves from this behavior. While I can't speak about specifics publicly in detail, though I wish I could, you may read 'disassociate' in very liberal terms and it will be clear what I mean. This will not happen again from this user/IP address.</p>
<p>While we do not care if his Wiki user name remains, as it should, we wish greatly to have the Incident archive post edited to no longer reflect, via the IP address, any negative association with our company.</p>
<p>We would appreciate it very much if a Wikipedia admin could contact me for further information and directions on how we can resolve our problem.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>On the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosses_messer.html" title="Grosses messer">Grosses messer</a> page, WP contributor <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> persists in adding an external link (<a href="http://www.pokingstick.com/item/gross_messer_sword" class="external text" title="http://www.pokingstick.com/item/gross_messer_sword" rel="nofollow">Example of a traditional grosses messer</a>) that feeds into an online catalogue page, complete with ordering instructions and prices, maintained by a maker and vendor of reproduction swords. His reason? Because, he says, "...in a search for a picture of the weapon. I was unsure about the legal status of the photo so I added the whole link." When warned (on my <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJack_Bethune_04c7.html#Grosses_messer" title="User talk:Jack Bethune">talk page</a>) that adding blatant commmercial links to a WP article appears to violate <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="Wikipedia:External links">WP:EL policy</a> #4, he replied, "it was the only picture of the weapon available and thus gives an adaquate reason not to follow it." He further insists he has no commercial or other interest in such a link but is justified in inserting it, "since a picture of the weapon would be helpful to the article." To prevent further acts of what might be considered vandalism, i.e., willful violations of WP:EL policies, and after encountering three reinsertions of the commercial link by Al-Silverburg on December 13th, it seems the matter should be referred to cooler heads at the WP Administrator level. Could a decision be made whether persistent insertions of purely commercial links are considered vandalism, or whether such links are justified because a contributor believes they would "be helpful to the article" and he says "it was the only picture of the weapon available"?

<dd>As I have already told Jack I had never even heard of the site until I googled "Grosses Messer" looking for a picture, since I was unsure of the legal status of it I decided just to add the entire link. I will also mention that I did not appreciate how Jack began our interaction by immediately accusing me of link spamming which was not only a violation of good faith but was also completly unwarranted. I also attempted to explain my position by stating that guidelines may at times be ignored if their is good reason which in this case there was. I will admit that my reaction has not been appropriate at every turn but I feel it was almost justified considering such incivility on such a mundane detail.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 05:57, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling it a "typical devout Catholic opinion" is a bit of an over-generalization... My experience with Dwain/Pitchka has been that he has virtually no understanding or regard for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, but if we start indef blocking for that, there are an awful lot of editors and admins who wouldn't be editing here anymore. I do think one of his accounts should be blocked though because he edits from both of them and it is damn confusing if you aren't watching very closely to discern those accounts are the same person. To be clear, I've never seen him do any abusive sockpuppeting, but unless he has a very good reason for running two accounts he should be given the option of keeping one active and having the other locked. He can link to the contribs for the other account from the userpage of whichever account he choses to stick with. From what I see there is no good reason he has two accounts.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 22:57, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't want to see any user blocked for his religious beliefs or lack thereof.

<p>Get some perspective. It looks like all the complaints really are about "just userpage content". There have been admins and would-be admins who have posted their disdain for Christians on their user pages and elsewhere. I do not share this guy's views, but they are his business and well within the range of statements to be found on userpages. I, for one, consider the tolerance here for the posterior orifice who professed his admiration for Osama bin Laden infinitely more offensive than this (yes, the <i>tolerance</i> expressed here for it, not just the box itself). Lots of people have alternate accounts: as long as they are not used in the same conversations they are not sockpuppets and not against policy. Not everyone in the world is "politically correct" and you need to deal with it when it creates a problem in articles, not just its existence on userpages. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 14:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as I know, his name is Dwain. He chose the username Pitchka, and then discovered that it meant something offensive in some other language. He didn't want to abandon the account, so he created the account Dwain. (If that's not exactly how it was, it's still fairly close, I think.) Yes, he has things on his user page that are confrontational. I don't endorse them, but I don't find them any more offensive than some of the things that other users have posted on Wikipedia about Christians. As for blocking him, that's absurd. He's a good-faith editor, who sometimes gets annoyed when people are trolling and harassing him. A few months ago, he removed a message or some messages from his talk page — something which is <i>not</i> forbidden by policy, and which many administrators do — and within hours, users were descending on him, reverting, sending him template warnings about vandalism, and making him even more annoyed. I've seen numerous insults aimed at Christians here on Wikipedia, and I have never even <i>considered</i> blocking the users. I think we need to move from an "I'm-not-going-to-let-him-get-away-with-it" mentality to one of "it's-not-urgent-to-get-rid-of-it-and-I-don't-want-to-make-matters-worse." I would suggest that someone who hasn't already been hassling him might suggest <i>nicely</i> that it would be better not to have those quotations since they might offend some people. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 15:52, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I completely agree. During the userbox wars, it was flat out verboten to have polemical attack user boxes, be they anti Christian or anti anything else. Listing a number of people for whom you have distaste (based on their associations) and then accusing them of trying to prevent verifiable information from being added to wikipedia is assuming bad faith. Repeatedly referring to those who have attempted to discuss the polemics as being devil worshipping vandals is BEYOND overbaord, and shows that the editor is more concerned with disruption and insults that what is or isn't encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 20:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really see how that'd be possible. Adding an image really is just adding something to the source. I suppose you could hash out a list of images in the article, and disallow new edits to the wiki source if it changes the list of images at all ... but really, that'd be very ugly, and probably not worth dev time. Also, you'd still have to somehow deal with template vandalism.

<p>This is a question for any recent change patrollers who browse <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">special:recentchanges</a>: do you watch article-only changes, or do you include all namespaces? Vandalism to articles is regularly reverted within seconds, but I've seen vandalism to talk pages and wikipedia talk pages that sits for several minutes, as if there is a significantly smaller amount of people watching those spaces. By extension, it means a significantly smaller amount of people then the normal amount of rc patrollers see edits to templates at all. This might be the explanation as to how template vandalism can sit for a while. (Or my theory could be completely off base.

<dd>I'd take issue with the statement "Vandalism to articles is regularly reverted within seconds". I'm reverting vandalism that is hours or days old in several articles every day, and ocassionally deal with vandalism that has been sitting around for weeks or months. I often see vandalism being reverted that misses the two or three other vandal edits that preceeded it. The bots can't help it, but live editors need to be more careful about looking at the recent history. I'm apparantly the only editor that reverts vandalism on many of the articles on my watch list, and I shudder to think of all those articles that are not on anyone's watch list. In other words, it is my opinion that we are not doing well in the fight against vandalism, be it in article space or elsewhere. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 14:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Speaking as someone who was on the other end of this ... hell no, questions shouldn't be removed. The very thought that the elections can be impacted by removing questions by someone acting in defense of said candidate is ludicrous. We <i>definitely</i> need impartial election officials for all such elections in the future to deal with issues such as these. Since it is too late for these elections, I say we take a very conservative approach and only remove questions that are clearly beyond the pale. This question doesn't even approach the pale. And remember, the candidate always has the option of ignoring the question.</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize how important it is to have fair elections. The electoral process is sacred, and we shouldn't do anything that even gives the impression of something below-the-board going on. That is why it is so wrong that another administrator actually wheel warred over whether my question about a candidate's statement could be asked. It disgusts me that someone would even think of doing such a thing. And I hope, for all of our sakes, that it never happens again. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is interesting how Serbs promoted invented word "Serbophobia" on the internet. First they introduced the word to wikipedia, and then thousands of other scrapper sites copied content from wikipedia, and now Google yields thousands of matches for this invented word. Of course, while Bosniaks wanted to do the same, and create an article Bosniakophobia, Serbs quickly jumped and voted "NO!". And of course, attempts to create Bosniakophobia article failed thanks to Serbian activism on wikipedia! They don't use wikipedia for educational, but for their nationalistic/politic purposes. It is sickening to see Serbian propaganda and lies poisoning Wikipedia</p>

<p>Some of the users he is sending the message to are completely random and have never interacted with him, or Bosnia related articles before.

<dd>On a more general note, our current tools for dealing with ongoing edit wars (where each editor is well-meaning, but the sum of their efforts negative) are rather too granular (blocks, protection, or nothing). A one-article "daisycutter ban", where <i>every</i> editor who had edited a contended article in the last n months would be prohibited from editing it for the next n months, might be a way to break the logjam and let some fresh brains tackle the problem. But I'm not aware of community consensus for anything like either what you describe or my more general version, and really <a href="../../../v/p/2F/WP%7EVP_P_9a0b.html" title="WP:VP/P">WP:VP/P</a> is a more plural venue for obtaining said. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 21:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm all for creativity and flexibility in applying admin measures like that, below the arbcom level. If we as admin-community have the power to wield the strongest of all sanctions, the indef ban, then <i>a fortiori</i> we should have the power to hand out lighter but better focussed sanctions such as partial/temporary bans, revert restrictions, probations and the like. For a similar idea, see my proposal for an individual 1RR restriction for certain articles to be imposed in a different case, above under <a href="#User:Tajik_and_User:E104421" title="">#User:Tajik and User:E104421</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The trouble is that there is no policy basis for banning individual editors from certain articles unless these editors are on probation.

<dd>I'm looking at the talk and blocks page, and it's fairly obvious to me that near every edit that's happened from that IP is from Daffy Duck.

<dd>I took the tag on the page at face value. If it is not a shared IP, there is still the guideline on the block page that says that anon IPs should not be bloced indefinitely. So what is supposed to happen when a indefinitely blocked user moves to anonymous edits? -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 08:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I took a long look at the history, and it was clear to me that every edit was from Daffy Duck. Perhaps we just put a long hard block on it, like 2 months, and if he feels sorry, he can appeal the block (though he's been a problem user for months now, and it's unlikely). That would be my take. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 14:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you check his contributions? Particular gems include making a masturbation joke in response to a RD question. He's been quite unresponsive to complaints on his talk page. Well, unresponsive is not the right word- he responds, as a chattering child might respond. But thus far he's failed to modify his behavior. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:12, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not off the top of my head. Here's another recent off-topic sexual remark that someone complained about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AReference_desk%2FHumanities&amp;diff=92130494&amp;oldid=92129765" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AReference_desk%2FHumanities&amp;diff=92130494&amp;oldid=92129765" rel="nofollow">here</a>. See also the numerous complaints on his talk page about his RD activities. He seems to honestly believe in his right to use the RD as a chat board. I'm not opposed to a certain amount of that, but here's a user who's been getting and ignoring complaints for some time. He's exhausted my patience, but I don't know if he's exhausted the entire community's patience yet. Note that mostly his remarks aren't that bad in isolation- you have to look at the overall pattern of disruptive behavior to see the problem here. He seems to enjoy being a pest- if there are little or no useful contributions to offset this, the answer looks obvious to me. But, I'll admit I'm personally irritated at him too, so if action needs to be taken I'd prefer someone else do it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you can't remember what you meant by the "masturbation joke". Is it possible you are conflating the activities of several RD users, and attributing them all to Light current&#160;? As for the "photography" example, Light current's remark was challenged on the RD talk page, and Light current says he would have amended it, but we will never know if he would have, because you didn't give him a chance - you deleted his response <i>7 minutes</i> after it was raised on the talk page. That does begin to look like stalking behaviour to me. You say that Light current irritates you - my opinion is that this irritation has led to you no longer being objective about his behaviour. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 19:56, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Why are you objecting to me <i>quickly</i> deleting irrelevant (and possibly, slightly offensive) content? Doing it slower doesn't mean it gets done better. Yes, I've been reviewing his contributions- so have others. This is so we can remove the more juvenile and off-topic remarks he makes, since he's demonstrated no judgment of his own. I guess one man's "stalking" is another's "damage control". However I intent to continue to remove rude, irrelevant, and/or unhelpful comments from pages as I see fit.

<p>I have posted to Light current's talk page before, mostly over the same sort of problems. See archived threads <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_archive8_39e1.html#Why_did_you_move_that_debate_to_Talk:Saddam_Hussein.3F" title="User talk:Light current/archive8">here</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_archive7_8e21.html#comment_at_RD.2Fscience" title="User talk:Light current/archive7">here</a> for examples. One comment in particular was very illuminating: <i>"When you have as many edits as I have, esp on Rd, then you can tell me what to do. Until then, I advise you to keep your counsel. 8-)"</i> (28 October 2006) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=84171658&amp;oldid=84171025" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=84171658&amp;oldid=84171025" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> - despite the smiley, this either displays the wrong attitude, or a worrying lack of judgement over the right time and place to make jokes. This lack of judgment is evident at the Reference Desk as well. There also seems to be a pattern of behaviour along the lines of pushing the boundaries and defying authority up to a certain point, and then claiming innocence, and saying that he has "responded to all queries". Overall, the attitude and behaviour is often (but not always) juvenile and immature. Ultimately, I would say stern warnings (when needed) from <i>uninvolved</i> parties may be the only way to get the message through, along with some mentoring. Of course, the behaviour may improve over time as the user gains experience in life and Wikipedia. And it would be unfair to single out Light current. There are others that exhibit the same sort of behaviour. Possibly showing these sort of users <i>other</i> areas of Wikipedia they could contribute to would work well, as then they really <i>will</i> encounter people who will tell them exactly what they think of silly behaviour. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree that there are other problem editors with the same sort of behavior. LC seems to be buddies with some of them. But, we have to start somewhere. Agree that warnings are reasonable but they have thus far been ineffective. Whether the "innocent child" routine is genuine or not I don't particularly care- the disruption is the same either way. He also made some reference to his edit count to me, as though he believes this justifies his behavior. Anyway, he's characterized my telling him his behavior needs to change as "stalking", which I guess translates into "leave me alone and let me do what I want." A block might help him understand that his behavior really is a problem, but it's hard to point to a single edit that clearly warrants such action. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears harsh at first glance, but I understand the logic. When a user clearly alludes to masturbation and then tries to convince people that it's all in their own heads, that's trolling. LC often seems bent on arguing that nobody can <i>prove</i> what he's talking about, and that the judgement and common sense of others may be faulty, so there's nothing anybody can do; I've talked to him before about the fallacies of this approach, but I guess the lesson didn't sink in. Unfortunately, I'm not sure a long block will make him behave better—but I also have no idea what else to do. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 02:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but a week seems a little harsh to me. Light current has shown that he can talk the talk (ie. he says he understands what is wrong and will try better in the future), but I would say judge his actions during a probationary period. Unblock or reduce the block length, and make clear that disruptive behaviour during the probationary period of a week will result in the block being reimposed. ie. Make clearer to him what sort of behaviour he needs to avoid, and then watch for a week to see that he does avoid that sort of behaviour. Again, mentoring is really what is needed ere, with someone to politely tap the shoulder and say "ahem, do you <i>really</i> think that is suitable?" <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To clarify, both nonsexual jokes and the serious discussion of sexual topics, such as masturbation, are allowed on the Ref Desk, but there do appear to be significant objections to sexual jokes. That's fine, but the editor should then be asked to remove the post and given a reasonable opportunity to do so. Instead, <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> removed it himself, depriving <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">User:light current</a> of the opportunity to do so, then used this post later as a justification for blocking this editor for a week. Note that <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">User:light current</a> did not restore the comment, and shows every sign of being reasonable in this matter. Furthermore, <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a>'s actions regarding the Ref Desk have been needlessly rude, as he himself admits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:StuRat&amp;diff=92028447&amp;oldid=92027607" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:StuRat&amp;diff=92028447&amp;oldid=92027607" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and disruptive recently, including his suggestion that the Ref Desk be deleted entirely. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 03:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have seen no evidence that he has broken WP guidelines or policy. He has not been disruptive. Friday has over-reacted, and has allowed his feelings of irritation to override his judgement. He has abused his admin powers to pursue a personal disagreement with Light current. He has escalated from his initial AN/I post to a week long block in <i>less than 24 hours</i>. If Friday thought a block was necessary, he should have proposed this course of action, given Light current a chance to defend himself, obtained concensus on the term of the block and asked an uninvolved admin to enact it. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 09:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm sorry, posting nonsense like that, then pretending you did nothing wrong, after repeatedly being asked to stop is totally unacceptable. I'm sorry, he should know better than that.

<ul>
<li>The ref desk is going to die this way. A one week block?! I sometimes wonder what LC is talking about, but I don't find him disruptive at all. I still don't get what he is being blocked for. It's all about one single remark that he himself agreed to remove (had he been given a chance) and when Friday is asked for another example he restates the same one. Other examples given are from his own talk page. His own talk page! Is that a reason for a block? A <i>one week</i> block? Much more disruptive is factually wrong information, because that looks like a useful answer. That is not the case here. This is about a silly remark. If this sort of deletionist behaviour continues at the ref desk and those who protest it are blocked (in stead of the other way around) the ref desk will become dull, many useful editors will leave (there are too few already as it is) and the ref desk will die. I have already noticed this happening, as I predicted it would. And it's going to get worse. This censorship has to stop. No need to block me. I've done that myself. After thousands of edits over the last year I have decided to stop contributing to the ref desk. And this is probably my last contribution to this page too. It's all too childish for me to waste time on. If people get blocked for a week for something like this, I'm out of here. To those who say 'good riddance' (there will be those): I didn't get <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html#Reference_Desk" title="User:DirkvdM">two of my three barnstars</a> for my work at the ref desk for nothing. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 13:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is not censorship. The reference desk needs to be kept on topic and focused. The more 'playful' and 'stream of consciousness' it becomes, the less useful it is. As I've said above, there are plenty of other places to joke around at, but <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">WP:RD</a> is not one of them. FWIW, I too think the 1-week ban is too harsh, and I also think Friday needs to provide a clearer reason, and Friday should have left it to an uninvolved admin to impose a block, if needed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have myself found some of LC's post to the forum frivilous and I personally have decided to ignore any questions posted by him. That is based on what I saw as "crying wolf", i.e. asking questions that he really had no desire to have answered, just for fun. I hinted at such in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91066341#Repairing_Shoes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91066341#Repairing_Shoes" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. I considered that LC was disrespectful to the fact that I had gone to the effort of giving him a legitimate answer to what I thought was a legitimate question. As I myself just consider LC overly playful I did not see fit to warn him otherwise. That Friday sees his behaviour as more serious is a matter for those two to sort out but to the degree that LC ignored the warning then he can have the block but one week is WAY excessive; 12 or 24 hours is better. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am not judging anyone there, I am simply making a comment. I further hope that LightCurrent (and others) can come to understand that the banter and off-topic junk on the Desks is an enjoyable <b>aside</b> to the real work of answering questions and is never to be started or encouraged as an end-in-itself.

<li><b>Oppose</b> block. Even if one accepted that Light current needed blocking, a one-week block is inappropriately harsh.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just a few remarks and I'll probably bow out of this. As for warnings, there were <i>months</i> of warnings prior to this from different people. Light current has been blocked for trolling before. This was blatantly obvious trolling yet he kept up his "innocent and clueless" routine. He's just looking for a reaction out of people- check out his attempts to engage in conversation after the block, acting like he doesn't know what he did wrong. I did start the discussion here well before blocking, and so far there seems to be admin consensus for the block. So, I'm not personally inclined to change it, however my standard offer still stands: if any admin disagrees with this and wants to change it, I invite them to do so. I don't "own" my blocks any more than we own our edits. I realize a week seems harsh here, but he was very obviously trolling and this has been an ongoing problem, apparently for quite a long while. I acknowledge this is a tricky situation- hardly any of Light current's edits, taking in isolation, seem remotely blockable. This is why I sought input from others before and after the block. Also, please- <b>let's not let this turn into a perceived "admins versus reference desk" fight</b>- I blocked one particular editor- discussion of other editors who are also problems are not relevant to this situation. If anyone cares to notice, after some initial disgust at the sorry state of the reference desk and me questioning whether it adds any value to the project, I've decided it IS valuable, so I've jumped in and started trying to help answer questions. I thank all the people who do useful work at the reference desk, or in any other part of the project. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Attention! I'm going rogue and starting a wheel war!</b></dd>
<dd>Er, by which I mean that I'm lifting the block on Light current. Per THB, I'm paroling him. I don't think that the block was undeserved, but I do think that LC has acknowledged (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92314011" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Light_current&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92314011" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>) that some of his comments were inappropriate for the forum in which he made them and that his judgement has not been up to snuff on occasion.</dd>
<dd>I think that leaving the block in place will shed more heat than light, as the mounting evidence here would suggest. LC is often a useful and productive contributor to the Ref Desk, and – providing he can restrain his occasional impulse towards off-colour humour and borderline newbie-biting – it would be a shame to lose that. I fear that we may have rushed into a block just when LC was starting to 'get' that the weight of opinion did <i>not</i> support his behaviour. I think it appropriate to give him a shot at reform. Note that I do not use the word 'parole' lightly, and I <i>do</i> expect that LC will make every reasonable effort to temper his remarks. His block <i>will</i> be restored (by me or by someone else) if he doesn't avail himself of this opportunity.</dd>
<dd>Note also that I expect other parties (both to this specific incident and those involved in the broader Ref Desk discussions) to refrain from sniping, kicking LC or others while down, taunting, gloating, oh-so-'clever' remarks, or anything else that might be taken as a lapse in civility. I'll be all over any sort of 'I-told-you-so', namecalling, 'You-don't-have-a-right-to-talk-about-Ref-Desk-because-you're-not-there-as-much-as-I-am-so-sod-off', or other petty ugliness like stink on cheese.

When I buy a copy of Brittanica, I've bought an encyclopedia. I don't expect that this includes a guy who will come to my house, hold my hand, and read it to me. Is it reasonable to expect a reference desk? Not in my opinion. We're an encyclopedia, not a forum, and not a place to get other people to do your research for you.

<li>Please note that my request to be utterly civil and courteous and to try to put this behind us wasn't actually solely for the pleasure of hearing myself type. It would be appreciated if you stopped quoting that remark on talk pages and noticeboards in an attempt to push Friday out of this discussion. If you look upward about six comments, you'll see that Friday has reconsidered his opinion on the Ref Desk, and is actually endeavouring to be a helpful participant there. In the same comment, he also explains that the block was not for a single incident, but for a pattern of behaviour — which we all hope and expect has now been remediated – from an editor who has received many warnings about his conduct. I will also note that Friday has expressed support for my approach to handling this block, and that he seems to be a pretty reasonable guy. I expect that he would have done exactly what I did had I sent him a polite message—I was just impatient at the bickering here. It is not appropriate to kick Light current while he's down, <i>nor is it appropriate to try to lynch Friday while he's being reasonable and accomodating</i>. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:48, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hey, can I assert my opinion into this one? I don't know if it's valuable here, but it looks like there's a long history of Light Current managing to find a way to get blocked, then unblocked. And the one time he wasn't unblocked was by Pschemp, and he's still bitter about that. In other words, perhaps we need to make it clear that infinite patience doesn't exist, and constantly walking the oline between appropriate and inappropriate, then acting like "poor persecuted me" when he called on it, won't be tolerated forever. That being said, he is a long-time contributer.

<p>Why are we so soft on a user who continues in a pattern of pushing the line? LC's actions appear childish and are frustrating when they happen again and again. i see this block as a cumulative effect of LC's own actions. Friday was right to block in such a situation, although, possibly a week was too long, but I do not know enough of this users background to judge. Regardless of the length of block, if these actions continue then the blocks should become progressively more severe. LC's claims of innocense, given the masturbation link posted by Friday above, are laughable.

Also, I'd like to say that I appreciate that friday is starting to understand the point of the RD.

<p>I'm coming in late to this, but I have to say that I oppose the block. I do think Light current is too flippant on the RD, and it would not hurt for him to be mentored, but I'm trying awfully hard to wonder why so many admins are suddenly hopping into the RD and tsktsking when they aren't regular participants. The RD has been running fine for months now, there is nothing wrong with the way those of us who do frequent do things there. We need to quit warring over this, guys.

<dd>StuRat &amp; PatStuart, I appreciate your feedback. I've decided to institute the protection, and I'd like to respond to your concerns (Stu). First, the block isn't meant to be therapeutic, blocks are to prevent disruption. They aren't punitive, they're to stop a problem. The intent with temporary blocks is to break the chain of disruption long enough that the user can reset and be productive on their return. Pat's quick summary above is very accurate, and reflects my concerns here too. Not only is this user failing to acknowledge any culpability (note that on his user page, he talks about how "responding" to criticism should somehow equal changing behavior, yet makes no attempt to) but there's also the matter of his/her editing of his or her talk page. A blocked user is allowed to edit their own stuff when blocked primarily so they can have an opportunity to discuss the circumstances of the block and appeal appropriately. Instead, Light Current has used this to create grudge lists, working to categorize bad faith edits, announcing alternate interpretations of policy, and nest building in general. I think LC has the capability of being a valuable editor, but his or her shennanigans in user space are going to draw a legit lightning bolt. Also, a couple of posts from other users may be lending to LCs opinion that he or she is a victim of some great conspiracy, and that's hardly conducive to becoming a good editor. I'll protect it now, and ask that any admins who disagree contact me before unprotecting so we can discuss it. I'll make a point of checking for messages frequently. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 22:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This ban is <i>way</i> too long, and regardless of the reason blocking his user page is unacceptable. You said that blocks aren't theraputic, they're to prevent further disruption... well isn't blocking his user page "to keep him from stuffing his foot further into his mouth" more theraputic than to prevent disruption?

<dd>Hi Froth! I appreciate your comments, but I'll respectfully disagree. We don't get to say "whatever we want" on our user pages. This isn't a blog, it's an encyclopedia. I've been corresponding with Light Current in email, and I've expressed my hope that he can use this opportunity to turn things around. I'm not sure I understand your other point above, as I mentioned before the block is <i>not</i> intended to be therapeutic. I've protected his page to help him, not punish. I told him in email that I'd rather he be a succesful wikipedia editor who hates my guts 6 months from now than an indefinitely banned editor who likes me. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 01:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: If the block is intended to prevent further disruption and not to be therapeutic then I do not get the point of blocking him from editing his own talk page. I can understand feeling that he needs a break and suggesting that he take one. Enforcing that he do so even to the extent of blocking his access to his own talk page when he obviously does not care to take that advice amounts to punishment. You cannot even say he is using his talk page improperly, IMO, as he is using it to discuss wikipedia issues and if someone does not want to see his remarks then they simply need avoid his talk page. For the record, I also suggest that he take a break but if he chooses not to then that is his choice and if it contributes to further disciplinary action in the future then that is on his head also. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:04, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback, guys! I've talked this over with Light Current, and he's on track to coming back as a productive editor in a couple days when the block expires. The almost 50 edits he made to his talk page during his block before the protection was pretty darn crazy and he might have spun a bearing without intervention. The page protection is the inanimate carbon rod that governs his fission reaction, and it'll drop shortly along with the block.

<p>I have been looking through Wikipedia trying to find a policy that covers this. This userpage User:ViraltheShow appears to be nothing more than an advertisement for their service and company and links to promote it. Ordinarily, if this was an article, I would put a speedy delete on it and move along, but how to handle if it is the user account. This user has no edits to anything other than their userpage and it is pretty obvious what they are doing here, but never having dealt with this before, I didnt want to make a mistake. Any direction? Can U put a speedy delete on a userpage, or should this be addressed in a different way? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 07:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry 'bout that.

I then began discussing with him my next series of edits so as not to make another error. I handled the error in stride, and will be more conservative with the tool in the future. May I have my AWB access restored please?

<p>A relatively new user, Wikinger, decided unilaterally that the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwar_kameez.html" title="Salwar kameez">Salwar kameez</a> article should be moved to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwar_kamiz.html" title="Salwar kamiz">Salwar kamiz</a> and did it by setting up redirects. Without any discussion. I removed the redirects and left a message on his talk page saying that salwar kameez gets 580,000 google hits, salwar kamiz gets 15,000, and we use the most common English transliteration. His reply is that ee should always be replaced by i; he's in the process of restoring his redirects. HELP! I don't think he's a native English speaker and he has no idea of how disruptive this is.

Regardless of whether the user is right or wrong about wanting certain information in the article (I'm not in a position to tell), his/her behaviour on the talk page is uncalled for.

<dd>His behavior has only gotten worse. He's taken to blanking the discussion again to supress the links that show he's been vote stacking.

<p>Hi. There was already a backlog of 2+ weeks at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_on_open_proxies_36d8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject on open proxies">WikiProject on open proxies</a> when I dropped 100+ suspects on the list. So now there's an even worse backlog.</p>
<p>69 of these are obvious open proxies because they were the same vandal/spammer (maybe a spambot) hitting the same article talk page, (<a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_f0fd.html" title="Talk:John Lott">Talk:John Lott</a>) using IPs from all over the world.

<p>As far as I can tell, these are, at a minimum, a case of long-term abusive editing even if they're not open proxies.</p>
<p>I did a detailed analysis of the vandals hitting that page and noted which were blocked and which ones weren't; I left this on the article talk page in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_f0fd.html#Only_25_out_of_94_open_proxies_hitting_NPOV_section_were_ever_blocked_indefinitely" title="Talk:John Lott">"Only 25 out of 94 open proxies hitting NPOV section were ever blocked indefinitely"</a> section.</p>
<p>There are just 23 <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_on_open_proxies_verified_users_997a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject on open proxies/verified users">"verified users"</a> qualified and authorized to process open proxy reports. There are over 1000 admins who can block abusive editors.</p>
<p>Suggestion: perhaps admins could block these 69 accounts with sufficiently long blocks until the verified users catch up with the other reports. Alternately, if you feel so moved, you could block them indefinitely for abuse. If you do either, you may want to annotate my reports or else leave some sort of a message at <a href="../../../o/p/_/WT%7EOP_a15b.html" title="WT:OP">WT:OP</a> so the verified users know they can skip these for now.</p>
<p>I'm not an admin, so I will leave it to your judgment as to whether and how you want to act on these. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>As one of those canvassed by StuRat, I was surprised to be notified by him of the MfD. I had been peripherally engaged in the most recent discussions at the Ref Desk talk pages, and StuRat had canvassed me for my opinion on several previous ocassions over the last day or so. In the MfD, StuRat does seem to misunderstand several points about how WP works, so it is possible this is a genuine misunderstanding here, rather than deliberate vote-stacking. For the record, I voted <b>merge</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:29, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zoe, that is correct. People have been "sent in" to "fix" the reference desk, one of whom is a sockpuppet. Although admittedly the sockpuppet has not been disruptive, the others have been, and it's disturbing. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 01:01, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've attempted to count every vote during stroll polls to determine whether a supermajority exists. I now understand that, while a supermajority is often used as an indicator of consensus in many area, like determining who should be an Admin, who should be on the ArbComm, and AFD, and RFC, several people object to using a supermajority to determine a consensus on the Ref Desk. I will, therefore, only refer to the results as a supermajority from this point on, and not a consensus, in an attempt to ease any conflict. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The way to ease conflict is to listen to the people who don't agree with your little group rather than blowing them off and attacking them, not to have more polls and count votes more process wonkily. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 19:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, it's not a "little group", it's the majority of the people on the Ref Desk Talk Page. Second, I do listen to the opinions of everyone, and respond, and have found that the supermajority wanted something different than what I wanted in a number of cases, and I've respected those results. However, there are some who just refuse to participate in the process. It's difficult to accomplish anything if you need to build a consensus, and you have several people who refuse to participate in building that consensus. For example, they've deleted the straw poll results, launched sockpuppet attacks, deleted the contents of the page where we recorded those results, and now are trying to delete the page itself. This makes it quite difficult to proceed. Instead of continuing the revert war they started by deleting the supermajority content, I thought it wiser to move to another page, so they can do whatever they wish with the old page, and tempers can cool down a bit. Then, once we complete our proposed rules for the Ref Desk, and they complete theirs, we can once again work to merge them together. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 22:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that XFD/AFD is not - most categorically not - a vote. Closing admins do not just number crunch: they look at the arguments as well. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 19:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I believe I've also looked at the arguments for each side of an issue. For example, I've often had a poll where a yes or no answer was expected, but, based on responses, formulated a more nuanced "yes, but..." or "no, except..." answer to the question under consideration. Once I take a read on the consensus, I'm also quite willing to reconsider if people tell me I've read it incorrectly. There was a rule interpretation I took to be a supermajority, but was then asked to look at it again after more input came in, and I saw that there was no longer a supermajority either way, so removed that rule interpretation from the list. And, at this point, we are only building a list of proposed rule interpretations for the Ref Desk. These are not carved in stone. After the list is completed I will ask for more input on additional rule interpretations people might want us to consider, changes that should be made to the current rule interpretations, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 22:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that StuRat's behavior is disruptive in some ways- the vote stacking mentioned above is part of that. However I'm not the most unbiased person, having been the target of what I considered a bit of harassment by StuRat.

<dd>I'm not an admin and I'm not completely unbiased, either, but I'd like to point out that this discussion should probably not be focusing entirely on <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">User:StuRat</a>. I could be wrong, but it appears (based on perusal of the history of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_guideline_8e7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/guideline">Wikipedia:Reference desk/guideline</a>) that he and some other Reference Desk regulars were attempting a reasonably orderly, consensus-based construction of some useful Reference Desk policies and guidelines, when their process was somewhat rudely barged in on by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">User:Radiant!</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">User:Hipocrite</a> summarily making some fairly sweeping changes in directions different from that of the fledgling consensus. (Examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/guideline&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93796341" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/guideline&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93796341" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/guideline&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=93801834" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/guideline&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=93801834" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>.) Naturally StuRat was upset by this, and while I can't condone vote-stacking, I can certainly sympathize with his frustration. But AN/I probably isn't the place to discuss all this further; there are already ample discussions going on at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_rules_b86a.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Reference desk/rules">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Reference desk/rules</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_StuRat_88d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/StuRat">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/StuRat</a>, Wikipedia:Requests for comment/THB, and of course <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia_talk%7EReference_desk_guideline_c608.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reference desk/guideline">Wikipedia talk:Reference desk/guideline</a>. —<a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 05:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet again, an energetic RD editor is being victimised. In my view, both Rick's MfD and Hipocrite's AfC are intended to provoke StuRat.

For those who weren't there, Steve Summit has provided edit history links above.

The former was a set of sentences, each individually voted on, that was not allowed to be modified by anyone without further vote. The latter is a descriptive guideline that gives a consensual view of refdesk operation. I invite you to look through <a href="../../../g/_/_/CAT%7EG_2fde.html" title="CAT:G">our other guidelines</a> and see which of the two methods is commonly used.

<dd>The bullying of StuRat is Rick's MfD, Hipocrite's AfC, your accusations here of vote-stacking, and now, in addition, Hipocrite's completely outrageous accusations at RD Talk. This follows a repeated pattern of singling out an energetic RD editor and either hounding them until they leave or provoking them into a blockable misdemeanour.

<li>The bullying is the deletion, by the minority, of supermajority votes, deletion of those rules agreed to by supermajority, blocking of users in the supermajority, filing RFC's against members of the supermajority, filing an AFD against the page containing the supermajority rules, etc. The minority appears to be determined to get their way "by any means necessary". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 15:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know this goes against the spirit of Wikipedia, but can we fully protect all the templates used on TOFAs in the next couple days in the hopes the penis vandal(s) will get bored and disappear? Most of the templates don't need editing anyway. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 04:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought that was already being done? Here's something I thought about ... what about having a bot auto-move-protect any template that is in use in more than some arbitrary number of places (like 2).

Also I suspect their relations to other vandals on that page, which have maliciously vandalized users' pages. 68.39.174.238 07:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I replied</p>

<dd>Hello. It is not your edits that are the problem so much, but that you ignore people talking to you on your talk page?</dd>

<dd>It is full of people asking you to explain stuff you did, or to not keep doing things. It is expected that you make some attempt to reply to other people, even if you disagree with them.</dd>

<p>No reply as yet. He doesn't seem to have understood what the problem is, still. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 11:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In this case we have to wait and see until the block expires. He's not formally asking to be unblocked anyway. At least he recognizes vandalism. So let him learn. You did the right action by the way.
