<p>It all began when I severely warned <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_125.164.161.204_bf44.html" title="Special:Contributions/125.164.161.204">125.164.161.204</a> earlier today for blanking text of Wikipedia articles and creating categories that do not exist usually over a category that does, which also constituted to removing a link or section of an article without any apparent reason. It took me quite a while to revert all of the unconstructive edits of 125.164.161.204 using popups. About half an hour ago, I noticed that <a href="../../../1/2/5/User%7E125.164.161.33.html" title="User:125.164.161.33">125.164.161.33</a> began doing almost the exact same mistakes as the former which lead me to believe that it was the same anon. IP user. Again, I had to take up about half an hour (maybe less) to revert almost the exact same edits as the first IP did. I wasn't exactly sure what to do afterwards, so the tagged the second IP as a possible sock of 125.164.161.204. Perhaps using <a href="../../../c/h/e/WP%7ECHECK_3f44.html" title="WP:CHECK">CheckUser</a> would be best here, but I'm so exhausted (and its 3 am in the morning in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> now) I suggest an immediate one week block for each IP until I could get a CheckUser going first thing when I log on Wikipedia in the morning. I apologize for not showing any links of proof because if I were to do that now, I wouldn't finish in a long while. But, if you were to look at each one's contributions and compare them, you'll find that they're about exactly the same, here's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/125.164.161.204" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/125.164.161.204" rel="nofollow">125.164.161.204</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/125.164.161.33" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/125.164.161.33" rel="nofollow">125.164.161.33</a>. I hope this was enough evidence to get these anonymous IPs blocked for about a week or two, maybe two seems better here. Really, its not fun doing this reverting for half an hour. IP addresses shouldn't even edit the encyclopedia anymore (unless they create an account) since they're the ones that <b>usually</b> disrupt Wikipedia... <a href="../../../p/o/w/User_talk%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_d945.html" title="User talk:Power level (Dragon Ball)">Power level (Dragon Ball)</a> 07:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Checkuser isn't required here, as all the relevant info is in IP addresses.

<dd>I don't agree that sockmaster notices should be forced onto a user's user page if they object - in the same way that if a warning is placed on their talk page, they are allowed to remove them. It's a form of scarlet-letter harassment. That being said, Chozo was being a jerk to Itaqallah (one of the more mild-mannered editors on Wikipedia) after coming back from numerous blocks for similar stuff, so I support an indef. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 21:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I noticed this discussion while looking at <a href="../../../r/f/u/CAT%7ERFU_768d.html" title="CAT:RFU">CAT:RFU</a>. I have no qualms with an indefinite block (and I would have declined the unblock request had you not beaten me to it) as long as indefinite does not mean <i>de facto</i> permanent. In other words, if, at some point, this user expresses a commitment to civil behavior, I think that at that future time, an unblock should be be considered. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not care for the block one way or another. I just find it odd that part of their out burst was brought on by the "scarlet letter" that was being forced onto their page. They were not behaving perfectly, but above border, until that point. If the scarlet letter set them off, then they were prodded and it should be noted. Is there a set policy regarding sockpuppet notices or notices on pages of those who have been allowed to once again edit? Feel free to point out if I am missing anything as I mainly been reading happenings here. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've locked the userpage, the talkpage, you yourself (Steel) were one of the complained-about admins. This looks like YOU taking out some frustration on someone and deliberately trying to drive them into a reaction.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fact that you (Steel) now went back and removed the unblock request, too? Shame on you.</p>
<p>BigDT, how is the user supposed to "come back" later and express a commitment to "civil behavior" when all he's received from the Wikipedia community is incivil behavior and scarlet letter harassment, and when the talk page any everything else are locked? Merzbow complains he was "being a jerk to Itaqallah" and claims Itaqallah is "one of the more mild-mannered" editors, which isn't the case; the two are obviously antagonistic toward each other and Itaqallah's been involved in any number of edit wars. RunedChozo at least kept it out of article space, leaving it to a not-unreasonable demand that Itaqallah promise not to edit war on the page. I'll make a note that rather than simply saying "sure, I promise not to edit war", Itaqallah took it on himself to say some mean things about RunedChozo.</p>
<p>Nuclear, it's obvious this was a campaign to attack RunedChozo - for speaking up here against The Epopt (arbcom/cabal member), for speaking up on the slashdotted <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_failing_1d6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing">Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_failing</a>'s talk page.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> A little worried here. Not only did we not investigate <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">User:RunedChozo</a>'s complaint fully, we incriminated him before this happened. Isn't it a legitimate complaint if someone complains about me telling them to stop spamming them on their talk page? If I didn't spam, I have nothing to worry about; and if I did, then why raise it here and risk incriminating myself?</dd>
<dd>The indef block is a different matter - but I was kind of hoping that when a user raises a complaint, he doesn't get blocked for it. &#160;:-/</dd>

<p>Just a heads-up - I just found a spam link (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jenny&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107067679" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jenny&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107067679" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jenny&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107067679</a>) added to the disambig page at <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny.html" title="Jenny">Jenny</a>, with a misleading edit summary. The target includes a few porn links, but I got the impression from the text it was child porn. That IP only made that one edit, but it's possible that the link was added elsewhere under other IPs. |<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 22:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, the blacklist is for spammed links only - it doesn't censor things that are illegal (in fact, I think the Foundation may be able to get into trouble if they put, say, a child pornography link into the blacklist because, ironically, it makes it available to the public).

<dd>Just a thought - say "8teen" out loud. 8teen. eight-teen. eighteen. 18. while this is clearly linkspam, the suspicion that it's child porn seems unfounded. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a>(<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">c</a>) 14:53, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because porn links are always logical? I saw "teen" and figured it wasn't worth the chance. Even viewing those images may be illegal in the U.S., and I was on a work computer when I saw the link. No reason to take that risk, and I think that from Wikipedia's perspective, it doesn't matter if it's child porn or adult porn - we're not going to link to it. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My question here is whether any other user has edited from an address in the 4.245.120-121.* range, to make sure we're not trapping innocent users. Also, I wouldn't start with a six-month block - I think that's a very long time to block an IP range, even if it's only 512 addresses. Maybe we can start with a month or so (if that's acceptable for a range-block) and see what happens. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 00:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to differ: Starwars1955 has caused so many problems, especially for you, King Bee, and Aviper2k7. Not only that, but he has created more sockpuppets than any other user I've encountered. He has used multiple personal attacks, and blanked his talk page several times. He has evaded his ban, and continued to vandalize and attack. A six-month block would ensure this doesn't happen for that length of time. After the block, we'll see what happens then. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 00:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Throwing in my 2cents here, being a nuetral editor and looking at all the evidence, i think a 6month block is needed.

<dd>Yeah, I was just going to suggest that. It is a Level3 IP range and possibly there are non-Favre obsessed fans out there who may possibly be editing, but if not I would say a 3-6 month range block isn't out of the question based on this guy's behavior and the fact that I've noticed him employing some more "advanced" trolling techniques lately.

<dd>The 'harassment' sign that RunedChozo is complaining about is a notice that he has operated sockpuppets.

You can look at my contributions since my return, I'm staying in the rules and have every intention of doing so. But if you want to call me names, fine. Go ahead. I really can't stop you.

<dd>I was mad at being harassed and insulted. I sent emails. I don't know what "spams" these two are talking about, because the only emails I ever sent were to the wikipedia mailing list. As for the "block log", that's a joke of how the wikipedia system is messed up, a bunch of Muslim POV writers have admin rights and decided to harass me, and Asterion near as I can tell was a friend of someone else who wanted to get me. I'm not going near any of them, and I've already served warning to some of the writers on a page that's nothing but propaganda that I'll be suggesting corrections but I want their promise first that they won't make an edit war again like they did last time. If they won't make that promise, I won't bother with anything other than keeping the disputed and unencyclopedic tags on that page, because that is what it is, completely disputed and unencyclopedic. I have NO desire, repeat NO DESIRE WHATSOEVER, to get into a major conflict with anyone, because I've already seen how the administrators here will just use that as a tool to beat someone up for their own sick amusement. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 17:18, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you are demanding other editors to make "promises" to <i>you</i> that <i>they</i> won't violate policy, else you won't co-operate with them. that is tragically ironic, and as such i see little value in making any 'promises' to you. you have already broken your 'promise' to abide by wikipedia policy, several times already, yet demand that other editors play along in this charade. if you cannot edit without issuing ultimatums to other editors, you may wish to reconsider your role here. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I have already promised to follow the rules. If you are not willing to do the same, since you started edit wars in the past, then I am unwilling to work with you, because all you are showing is your intent to cause an edit war, something I am unwilling to be involved in. I am stating this as fact, because I am not going to give you any chance to start some big problem, much though I know you want to do so. You want to lie and claim I broke the rules?

<p>I would note that this editor has been registered since last May, and has a consistent and predominant range of edits which are of the same style as those above.</p>
<p>I admit freely that I, and a number of other editors are in content dispute with him on the discussion page for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>. That is not the issue here. If that particular issue can be solved by talking, it will be, and if it can't, more appropriate action (e.g. mediation) will be taken. I certainly don't want to prevent de Fanel from contributing there (although he wants to prevent others from editing, having threatened to prolong the edit-lock for the next five months <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHarry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=108106417&amp;oldid=108101197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHarry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=108106417&amp;oldid=108101197" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>). But his attitude makes him impossible to work with, and is profoundly unhelpful to wikipedia. I want an admin to take notice, and to persuade him - either with words or actions - to <i>behave appropriately</i>. No more than that. I don't care if he sticks around. But his attitude and behaviour are intolerable. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 12:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if that would be appropriate - he's been making accusations against a number of editors, and the main issue is his behaviour and attitude, rather than the content dispute.

<p>As I have said earlier to Michaelsanders himself, I have nothing against him, I don't want him to be warned or anything, and I'm not upset because content disputes on a HP article. However I will not let him spread lies about me. So I'm going to rectify every insidious lies he has written here, and for the last time, ask him to <b>leave me alone</b>. Because, my dear Michaelsanders, your current behavior will never make me leave Wikipedia, or force me to adopt your point of view about the content dispute (no, you do not <i>force</i> others to agree to your opinion. Either you convince them, or you fail, and if you fail, just stop, otherwise you're going to create a lot of problems of which you'll be the only one responsible).</p>
<p><i>First lie: bad faith accusations</i></p>
<p>If you look to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">talk page history</a> in its globality (and not only the little bits Michaelsander has shown), you will all be able to notice that I merely removed from <i>my own talk page</i>, comments that I found inappropriate or undue.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, as per <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types_of_vandalism</a> , "<i>on a user's own talk page this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the user's discretion</i>".</p>
<p>That's merely what I did, I "removed comments at my own discretion".</p>
<p>However, Michaelsanders has shown a certain <i>insistence</i> in <b>reinstating</b> comments from him and from other users on my talk page, threatening me of being banned from Wikipedia if I removed them, in an extremely authoritative tone, certainly not appropriate for a mere user without any administration right (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=108049164&amp;oldid=108048202" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=108049164&amp;oldid=108048202" rel="nofollow">"Revert - read the rules. That is not vandalism, and your talk page is wikipedia space, which you hold only by submission to the rules. Obey them, or leave"</a>)</p>
<p>He has reverted my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=107885236&amp;oldid=107321969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=107885236&amp;oldid=107321969" rel="nofollow">1</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=107926309&amp;oldid=107925364" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=107926309&amp;oldid=107925364" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=108049164&amp;oldid=108048202" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Folken_de_Fanel&amp;diff=108049164&amp;oldid=108048202" rel="nofollow">3</a>, ignoring me when I told him about the "at the user's own discretion" principle.</p>
<p>That there was bad faith from his part makes no doubt. When I finally warned him for what I concidered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Talk page vandalism</a>, he just started going mad with his "bad faith assumption" thing, will I was merely warning him for his violation of the rules (and of my rights to manage my talk page as I want).</p>
<p>I have not assumed any "bad faith", his behavior was just obvious, and I just tried to make my opinion <i>clear</i> to him (because after 3 reverts he still wouldn't let me remove comments from my talk page at my own discretion).</p>
<p><i>Second lie: Incivility and lack of calm</i></p>
<p>Well, no need to explain anything here. his claims are perfectly ridiculous, and he is nitpicking over everything I said just to try to harm me.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no incivility in my speech, or lack or calm.</p>
<p><i>Third lie: history of incivility, POV and attitude problems</i></p>
<p>I have had no history of incivility, POV and attitude problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps Michaelsanders would like to be reminded of his own attitude problems, when he was involved in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=107129911&amp;oldid=107127851" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=107129911&amp;oldid=107127851" rel="nofollow">edit-war and POV dispute</a>&#160;? Or that he was accused of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=107144600&amp;oldid=107143710" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=107144600&amp;oldid=107143710" rel="nofollow">not being willing to let other users alone - a form of harassment&#160;?</a>? Which leads us to something interesting, as Michealsanders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Michaelsanders" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Michaelsanders" rel="nofollow">has been blocked twice for violation of 3RR and edit warring</a>. I can also mention several examples of incivility of which I was the victim (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107183273" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107183273" rel="nofollow">"self-righteous and conceited"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107856560" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107856560" rel="nofollow">"pathetically juvenile" and "behaving like an ape dancing in a judges robes"</a>)</p>
<p><i>Fourth lie: me, wanting to prevent others from editing, having threatened to prolong the edit-lock for the next five months</i></p>
<p>One can only wonder where he could have seen that.</p>
<p>Obviously Michaelsanders doesn't know what the word "threat" means. As I have noticed earlier, he is merely screaming on everything I would say, and distorting the meaning of my words in order to be harmful towards me.</p>
<p>What I have originally written is pretty clear: "There is no possible consensus. I <i>think</i> it's <i>best</i> for the article to stay blocked for the remaining 5 months. In this way we won't have any edit wars, we won't argue for weeks about which speculations should be added, etc. We will wait for the book to be published, and finally we will reach the perfect consensus since we'll have all the answers we're waiting for, there'll be no need for speculations and no disputes about it. <i>Currently we have nothing more to add to the article, and actually, we won't have much until the book is published</i> (except perhaps an extract from the book, later on, or the covers). So <i>it's better</i> to wait the book, which will end any debate about those speculations. <i>It can be avoided if we can find a consensus, but as I see it, it's not possible. We're only repeating the same things all over again</i>. Folken de Fanel 16:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC) "</p>
<p>Again, where does he sees threats or anything&#160;?</p>
<p><i>Fifth lie: "But my attitude makes me impossible to work with"</i></p>
<p>Well, that he hates me because I don't have the same opinion as me is one thing. That he utterly failed to convince me and 7 other editors of the relevance of his point of view in yet another thing.</p>
<p>But saying "it's impossible to work with me" is an all-together different thing. Wouldn't it me more realistic that it's impossible to work with Michaelsanders&#160;?</p>
<p>The thing is, Michaelsanders seems to regard any divergence of opinion as a crime and a sin. He failed to convince me and others, and seeing this, to avenge himself, he has resorted to a personal crusade against me, first attempting to vandalise my talk page, and then tracking me down everywhere on Wikipedia, using every occasions to spread lies about me and to say to the world that i am the devil ( and he has already shown an obsessive behavior when involved in a POV dispute, as proven by his 2 blockings for 3RR)...</p>
<p>He wants "an admin to take notice, and to persuade him - either with words or actions - to behave appropriately". However, as I have undisputably proven, the one how has behavior problems is really Michaelsanders and <i>not me</i>, and the <i>only</i> problem that Michaelsanders has with me, is in fact that <i>I don't agree with him in an opinion debate about the content of a Harry Potter article</i>.</p>
<p>Which means that he "wants an admin to <i>persuade</i> me, either with words or <i>actions</i>, to <i>agree to his opinion</i>".</p>
<p>Really, where does he think he is going with this...</p>
<p>However, I'm really wondering if Michaelsander could be persuaded to leave me alone...because actually, he is the only one stirring things up, making false accusations on this notice board and all...He is really drawing unnecessary attention on him, and his attitude can only prolong any dispute that exist between him and me.</p>
<p>I have asked him several times to let me alone, and just not to talk to me anymore, however he has proven to be really <i>insistent</i> in <b>NOT</b> letting things calm down by themselves, and in challenging me perpetually...<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 01:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that a person I was in conflict with some time ago - a person with an academic career, by the way - is now going to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks, hiding some very intemperate remarks that he made. I will refrain from mentioning his name, but I question the ethics of these "concealing" edits. As one of the parties involved in the (past) dispute, I am mentioning the matter here, and suggesting that someone may want either to revert, or to make some indication on these talk pages that considerable matter has been cut. Please note that I am avoiding linking the material that is liable to reveal his identity: that is, I am not linking to where a username was related to his actual name.</p>

<p>Reviving this discussion, which was archived.</p>
<p>If you examine the edits linked above, he's not even just removing his own remarks (nor is he marking the pages to show that anything is removed). He is also removing mine and others'.</p>
<p>I am reviving this discussion because I now see that he also, as Usrdltd (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Usrdltd_88a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Usrdltd">contribs</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jmabel/Archive_10&amp;diff=103134291&amp;oldid=97150445" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jmabel/Archive_10&amp;diff=103134291&amp;oldid=97150445" rel="nofollow">removed someone else's comments about him</a> - and, again, he had earlier changed his name here, so that was already long since covered - on one of my archive pages. Unlike the other cases, I have reverted this, since he clearly has no right to remove a third party's remarks from my archives. That same account was used to remove other discussion (see, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison/Archive02&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103134735" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison/Archive02&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103134735" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, which was discussion of, among other things, his own sockpuppetry).</p>
<p>What do I want done? I'd like to see these edits reverted, but I don't think I'm the appropriate person to do so, since I was involved in the dispute. Failing that, I'd like to see at least a clear notation as to <i>where</i> material has been deleted from talk pages, even if that material has not been restored. And possibly someone may want to check IPs to verify (what seems to me to be obvious): that all of these one-edit throwaway accounts come from a single place (sock puppetry supreme) and see if someone who is still an active editor appears to be doing this. Because the "right to disappear" does not include the right to hide your past and keep participating. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, not everybody is going to know what "the late" means in that context.

<dd>Booshakla, I'm very concerned by your statement <i>No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.</i> You cited <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> in your comments on that talk page; you should read that policy more carefully yourself, because the comment I just quoted is a very strong example of page ownership. You've expressed your opinion on the matter, but you're getting significant pushback from other editors. In the short term, cease making these edits and discuss the matter with the objecting editors. If the consensus goes against your edits - and you can add me to the list of folks who don't see your logic - then you need to accept it and stop deleting "the late" until and unless consensus changes in the other direction. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 13:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, to be perfectly fair, I can understand his frustration; you <i>have</i> been particularly aggressive in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ultima_Thule_Ambient_Music_9147.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ultima Thule Ambient Music">Ultima Thule Ambient Music AfD</a> (including posting to my talk page with an <i>obvious</i> "this should be deleted" attitude when I started to open an AfD, but then decided against it), and even added a speedy deletion tag on the article while the AfD was going on (which was a poor choice on your part, though I believe you understand that now).</dd>
<dd>It doesn't <i>excuse</i> his behavior, but it does provide at least <i>some</i> explanation. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 16:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, actually, I haven't had enough time to explain my point: I believe that that article had (has) to be deleted becouse of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, such episodes are slowly seriously damaging Wikipedia. <b>After</b> deletion, the article could/should be recreated by a different, indipendent editor.

<dd>I really don't see why the article, of a notable subject, should be deleted and then recreated; what's the point?

<p>I have recently been blocked by InShaneee for no real reason. On 13th February as I logged to Wikipedia I first noted I have a message on my talk page. Going there I saw a <a href="../../../d/a/i/User_talk%7EDaizus_1345.html#Albert_Wass" title="User talk:Daizus">3RR block message signed by InShaneee</a>. I knew I had some reverts on that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Wass_e14b.html" title="Albert Wass">page</a> regarding a controversy related to <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> but I remembered I had avoided falling under the incidence of 3RR rule, hence my first reaction was to protest with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107779550&amp;oldid=107748220" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107779550&amp;oldid=107748220" rel="nofollow">reply in my talk page</a>. But then immediately I checked the page history for the article on Albert Wass and I noticed I had 4 reverting edits in a 24 hour interval (11 February 20:48 - 12 February 16:45; I'm using server time as reference) and then, in good faith, I thought I rushed in denying the accusation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107779781&amp;oldid=107779550" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107779781&amp;oldid=107779550" rel="nofollow">withdrew my reply</a>. Amazed by the difference between what I knew I had done and what I saw in that first glance, I proceeded to analyze the situation.

<p>As such, I was not under the incidence of 3RR rule and I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107783766&amp;oldid=107779781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107783766&amp;oldid=107779781" rel="nofollow">requested</a> an unblock. However, my request was denied by <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArjun01_13e5.html" title="User:Arjun01">Arjun</a> because apparently, my block was registered for another article: <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burzenland.html" title="Burzenland">Burzenland</a>. This can be seen in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Daizus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Daizus" rel="nofollow">block log</a> and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107746990&amp;oldid=106647120" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107746990&amp;oldid=106647120" rel="nofollow">first edit</a> InShaneee performed in my talk page, a edit which he later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107748220&amp;oldid=107746990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107748220&amp;oldid=107746990" rel="nofollow">corrected</a>. And here I want to mention I couldn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR" rel="nofollow">find</a> a 3RR report issued on me (and thus the evidence for the accusation and the block). True, I have performed a lot of edits in the article on Burzenland, but there were not even 2 edits reverting the same content. Furthermore I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107803634&amp;oldid=107799008" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADaizus&amp;diff=107803634&amp;oldid=107799008" rel="nofollow">protested</a> in my talk page and I requested evidence for the 3RR accusation. I have not received responses or apologies, though both administrators were active since then, as easily anyone can see in their contributions history.</p>
<p>I have added this complain also in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/InShaneee" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/InShaneee" rel="nofollow">RfC</a> opened on his behavior. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 13:53, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I might not have been very clear about my motives. Of course I am unblocked. But it was an abusive action with apparently no justification, an action which frustrated me. Isn't power abuse a worrying thing here? Can an administrator block someone for no reason and then simply all things continue as nothing ever happened? Didn't I deserve at least an informal apology? Doesn't that administrator deserve at least an informal warning? <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 05:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless something has changed in MediaWiki (which is entirely possible, I haven't kept up), he can't, because a redirect will exist at the correct location that has to be deleted first.

<p>Hi. Some may remember I reported a set of incidents about 11 days ago about anons giving me some really bad harassment (threats which considering my Northern Irish background are incredibly serious), see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive192#Being_harassed_by_anons" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive192#Being_harassed_by_anons" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. Well this evening I checked my mail to discover I'd received this email through Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YOU FUCKING NORTHERN IRISH BIGOT PROTESTANT BASTARD...WE HAVE OUR EYE ON = YOU...YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A CUNT..A BIGOT DISCRIMINATING GAY BASTARD...GO = FUCK YOURSELF...')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mail was seemingly sent through the account of <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerdy80_6a45.html" title="User:Perdy80">User:Perdy80</a> from the headers (email and addresses etc available on request). Now this is too similar to the Brazilian based IP abuse I was getting in the above mentioned incident and I have no choice but to take this seriously given my Northern Irish background and the kinds of people that could be involved in that sort of matter. Any thoughts, suggestions, advice? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 18:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the circumstances I would say an indef block is more appropriate. It doesn't solve the problem though. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 18:57, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I received this email today, and since he hasn't edited anything to do with Northern Ireland I'm inclined to believe him and leave it at the appropriate block.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just want to take the time to say how sorry i am about that. I copied and pasted something that someone else had said to you before that i thought would anoy you because i was annoyed at being blocked, i should have known that you would find the cut and pasted comment to be insensitive. I just find it's so easy to go a bit overboard on this site when someone blocks you for what wasn't that bad. I think it best if i leave this website to people who really have a passion for it, i feel that there are to many cat fights and arguments. Once again i apologise for cutting and pasting what i did to you, it was in very poor taste. I came to this website with good intentions but have found there is to much bias involved in articles and to many arguments and subsequent personal attacks on people which are really not called for {mine included}. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me and i wish you luck with this site, i think i get a bit too worked up to contribute again. ps: i'm actually from English/Protestant heritage myself and can see why it upset you. regards</p>

<p>Today <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Argonaut_f594.html" title="User:The Argonaut">User:The Argonaut</a> went around and tagged at least 7 articles that he had previously made extensive edits to as copyvios (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halloween_festival&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108337349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halloween_festival&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108337349" rel="nofollow">random diff</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACopyright_problems%2F2007_February_15%2FArticles&amp;diff=108337913&amp;oldid=108329414" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACopyright_problems%2F2007_February_15%2FArticles&amp;diff=108337913&amp;oldid=108329414" rel="nofollow">diff from copyvio log</a>). Checking out the history of a couple of these articles it seems he is responsible for almost all of the content (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ghost_tour&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ghost_tour&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of one of them</a>). The alleged copyright violations all come from the same website; Questmagazine.com, and all have the same author - one Hal Siemer. All the Questmagazine articles have this copyright notice on the bottom,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Reprints</b> This article may be reproduced online in whole or part if credit is given to both the author and Quest Magazine and a link is included to the web address from which the article was taken. Copyright © 2006 Quest TM Magazine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately prior to Argonaut tagging as copyvios an IP, User:86.129.166.136 had removed all the references to Quest Magazine (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Christmas_traditions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108313676" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Christmas_traditions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108313676" rel="nofollow">random diff</a>) with an edit summary of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removed Vanity Reference - To: The Argonaut / Hal Siemer, Wikipedia is not a place to promote your magazine. Stop with these countless uneccessary references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about it on both editor's talk pages and got the following responses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThe_Argonaut&amp;diff=108341598&amp;oldid=108339525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThe_Argonaut&amp;diff=108341598&amp;oldid=108339525" rel="nofollow">from The Argonaut</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I copied these from Quest since they give permission on their site as long as the author, magazine, and a link are included. ... I thought it would be OK since the cites and link were included, but these have been removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason why I removed the reference as I feel user:The Argonaut (very likely to be Hal Siemer) has been using Wikipedia to promote himself and his magazine. ... I see the use of these articles to as yet another attempt at self promotion. As it now appears the articles are identical to another website. If the text in these articles is made GFPL, then the situation does change, but as far as I can see the author of this text has not made this GFPL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that about a year ago someone wrote articles on Quest Magazine and Hal Siemer which were deleted (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Quest_Magazine_5596.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quest Magazine">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quest Magazine</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hal_Siemer_19ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hal Siemer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hal Siemer</a>), and the IP thinks that The Argonaut is the same person and is spamming.</p>
<p>Reading what Quest Magazine has to say about copyrights, it looks to me like the material is licensed in such a way that it is compatable with Wikipedia's GFDL license, especially since we're supposed to be citing out sources anyhow. It's not a copyvio if it's cited.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, the IP believes all these citations are spam. Hence it seems to boil down to <i>Cited = spam, uncited=copyvio</i>. Which do we like less, copyvios or spam?</p>
<p>Frankly I'm inclined to go through and revert to the version prior to the IP's removal of the citations. What do other people think?

<dd>If the material isn't released under the GFDL, then would it be legal for editors to make changes to it? I wouldn't think we could copy the material and credit the magazine, while at the same time allow editors to change the credited material. If the pages are completely copied, It's my opinion that they be deleted. I'm sure there are many people with a better idea on how copyrights work, and I'd gladly change my opinion if someone explained to me why this would be alright. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 17:13, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article has to be deleted; that licence doesn't specifically allow for 'creation of derivative works', so it's a nonderivative licence (all rights are reserved by default unless they're specifically released). Wikipedia deletes images with nonderivative licences (unless they're fair use), and is stricter on article copyright than image copyright, due to the need to edit. So unless a small quote is taken that could be fair use, the article's a copyvio and has to be deleted. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:16, 15 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<p>The first two diff shows edits that were unsourced and potentially in violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Although the edit made is, in itself, not libellous, the edit is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">trying to make a link</a> between Francis Escudero and former president <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Marcos_0f3a.html" title="Ferdinand Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> (through Escudero's father), and in the Philippines, that could be taken to mean that since Escudero's father and Marcos know each other, it may be assumed that the Escudero family may have profitted from what is regarded as the fruits of massive corruption on the part of Marcos and his cronies. I am not in a position to judge whether that is true or not, but as it stands, the Marcoses are facing several lawsuits which remain unresolved with finality (because of the endless appeals and counter-appeals).</p>
<p>The last diff, now with sources, might be deemed as either NPOV pushing or as a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. The source mentioned was, in fact, an <i>editorial</i>, not a news report or a magazine feature report. Near the top of this source's page, it clearly says "Opinion", which, in the context of <i>where</i> the edit was made (i.e. in the Biography) section, was out of place.</p>
<p>Since tomorrow is a Saturday (Manila time), I'm expecting that there could be more similar edits made to the article. I'm also on the look-out for other articles about Philippine politicians. If similar edits were made to these articles, I'll file separate reports here. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 13:14, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, I did read the sockpuppet log on runedchozo and basically what it says is that RunedChozo edits with an IP that comes from the University of Houston, so saying that other users using that IP are him is pretty hard. There doesn't seem to be away to confirm that RunedChozo is a sockpuppet through IP.</p>
<p>And Itaqallah, the note pointing out that someone had responded to the discussion on blocking RunedChozo with a similar IP. RunedChozo was severely less calm and level headed about this then the user who made that comment. So either RunedChozo really calmed down and completely changed how he was writing, or it's someone else. Either way, the comments are valid. I fail to see how this user can come back with a locked userpage and talk page, and the investigation that the user submitted seems to have come to a halt--the speedy deletion request has been reverted and the sockpuppet notice is back up. The page obviously can't be deleted while the user is indef banned, but this seems to be a problem with user and I understand why. This user may not be the best behaved, but this user also has legitimate complaints and attempted to go about handling them properly, and wasn't treated neutrally. This user doesn't respond to conflict well, but the user was also provoked, in what the user probably sees as an ongoing thing.</p>
<p>I'm very disappointed in the administrators who continued to put the sockpuppet notice back when this issue had been raised here. A user came here asking for assistance, and this somehow got turned into an investigation of the user and the user's behavoir, becuase the user got upset when instead of responding to the query here or providing help, the "offending" warning was placed back on the user page and a user was kept from editing his own page. The discussion here then lapsed into a he said/she said about the users's previous and current behavoir which was really a completely separate issue. The past behavoir is kinda irrelevant, and if people are having a seperate problem with the user, they should post something seperate here or warn the user on his talk page. Not take over the user's complain and keep him from being helped.</p>
<p>Keeping the sockpuppet notice up on the user's page now is just rubbing salt in. The user wasn't banned for sockpuppetry this time, and user's aren't supposed to be forced to keep these notices on their user pages, so this notice should be deleted. Also, the user needs to be given some place to edit--the talk page if the user page is too volatile an issue, so that the user can express interest in coming back to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am more than disappointed in the way this has been handled. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> 12:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I posted above and will repost here since it seems this discussion should not have been closed. If someone is complaining about the scarlet letter, I would think the proper response would have been to just cite the policy, or at least that would have been a better way then what was undertaken. I think this leaves me with some questions:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Are users allowed to remove sockpuppet notices if they are being allowed to edit again? This is not a question of opinion, I am asking if there is policy on this.</li>
<li>If the user is being allowed to edit after X behavior, at what point is there past behavior left in the past?</li>
<li>Is it standard practice to negate a complaint, with another complaint? Am I allowed to be harrassed by Joe, if I vandalized a page last week?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I was under the impression that most warnings and notices on user space could be removed, especially since for admins there is a log of the block, so admins can see relevant information and so can anyone else who looks at the block log. What is the purpose of keeping a notice on the users page? I think the whole situation could have been handled better and I think poking and prodding users who are upset is not the route. Wikipedia is not paper seems like a good example, had the user written 10 times asking for help, who does that hurt? The page goes up 3 kilobytes? I would think that instead of telling the user to calm down, which didnt work after the 2nd time, those responding would have recognized the user felt help was needed quickly. Not that they had to jump, but telling him to relax a third and fourth time, then posting WP:COOL, was not going to result in a cool headed user. This seems to be more of a failure or relating and apathy, then anything else. I hope someone can actually answer the questions above, if there is no policy regarding the sockpuppet notice, then I think we should pull a rollback and forgive the outbursts them stemmed from a mistake and let the user edit again and everyone just walk away and forget. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're being much too nice to this user. Speaking as an outside observer that's not been involved in any of his arguments or fights (but someone who HAS been noting his behavior), your suggestion, especially the part about "letting the user edit again and everyone just walking away and forgetting", doesn't seem in the best interests of the project at all. Besides that, I think he IS editing again under the PSPMario sockpuppet, given that all that user's edits have identically picked up just where RunedChozo left off. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 13:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it disruptive editing? I think if its not, it just goes to show further that they are a useful member of this project and can edit civily. I really do not see why people rather chase down sockpuppets, until they turn into vandals, then chase down vandals. Would some then be satisfied since they can say "I was right all along", knew he was a vandal ... Driving people to the point where they have an outburst and then bannig them for it, makes little sense. We have had admins curse eachother out here on this very page, we do not drop the ban hammer because its understood sometimes we as human need a release and a moment to cool. Again, I never said the editor was perfect, but as mentioned above, coming here because they feel they are being harrassed, and then being investigated, is not normal. I will point out though that I am partially not surprised, as taken from my comment above that disagreeing with a current/former Arbcom member will only end badly. Which no surprised, it did. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You seem to have a grudge against PSPMario, though I cannot fathom the reasoning. You characterize RunedChozo as driving off an "fantastic editor" ZakuSage in the other discussion below, yet ZakuSage left right after being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZakuSage&amp;diff=103252253&amp;oldid=103088642" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZakuSage&amp;diff=103252253&amp;oldid=103088642" rel="nofollow">caught wikistalking</a>, which doesn't speak very well for your friends, but does speak to the fact that RunedChozo had a legitimate complaint about being systematically harassed by people. You and Trebor in the discussion below utterly dismiss a good-faith question brought by PSPMario, and instead are trying to have him brought up on charges of being a sockpuppet. This seems to be very typical on WP:ANI, one party brings a question or concern and instantly are attacked for bringing it to someone's attention.</p>
<p>The only places PSPMario has edited appear to be the PS3 and PSP pages, and no controversy exists about those edits. The number of people here who are willing to make ad hominem attacks and very incivilly try to game the rules against other editors rather than civilly discussing matters is breathtaking. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountPointercount_401c.html" title="User:CountPointercount">CountPointercount</a> 14:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you read my first comment carefully, review the blocklog of RunedChozo carefully (blocked a dozen of times by several admins since a relatively short period- since November 9, 2006) and the conflits they've been into w/ a dozen of contributors than you'd agree that it is a waste of time especially that the main discussion was closed above this section.

<p>Multiple users agree that closing the debate was improper, first of all.</p>
<p>Second of all, that the incidents involving RunedChozo involve deliberate provocation from other involved users. I prefer to think that most people on Wikipedia can be rehabilitated, especially if they have made good edits, and RunedChozo has obviously made good edits, edits that have been replaced and supported by multiple other users as well. If you cannot see this, then I must wonder if you may have some ulterior motive for trying to close off this debate.</p>
<p>I must also question your logic of "a dozen" blocks, as reading the log, there are multiple times where administrators appear to be playing games, lengthening/de-lengthening blocks, and you are trying to read each alteration as a "new" block. Plus, we have the additional problem of administrators who are deliberately using lengthened blocks as a method of provocation.</p>
<p>If you say that you think the indef is justified that's one thing, but as I noted about another user below who was mischaracterizing things, you appear to be deliberately trying to paint this user as an evil and vile person, and that is simply not supported by the record.</p>
<p>Additionally, the continued trying to tar and feather anyone who disagrees, such as Ex-Nintendo and Trebor are doing, is most distressing. It is hardly a fair proceeding when they are using these tactics and trying to kill the messenger. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountPointercount_401c.html" title="User:CountPointercount">CountPointercount</a> 16:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a>, it all makes sense now. Both PSPMario and <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountPointercount_401c.html" title="User:CountPointercount">CountPointercount</a> were determined that yes, they are sockpuppets of <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a>. Accusations of "killing the messenger" aside, what I see (and what I have commented on) is this: a user with an extremely long history of very, very bad behavior and a large blocklist (VALID blocks, I might add, not "playing games"), and two brand-new users who pop out of nowhere to support this user who have extensive knowledge of Wikipedia's workings. I'm disinclined to believe that <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountPointercount_401c.html" title="User:CountPointercount">CountPointercount</a> is simply some previous IP-user who just coincidentally happened to pop out of nowhere to suddenly begin to give his unerring support to <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> at the exact same time that <a href="../../../p/s/p/User%7EPSPMario_9a95.html" title="User:PSPMario">PSPMario</a> did. The fact that a checkuser came back with a positive confirms my suspicions. Bear in mind that I've not gotten myself involved in any of the edit conflicts that <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> has participated in- I'm only stating what the record shows. Even the quickest check of <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a>'s history shows that each and every block of his is valid, starting all the way back with his actions in November of 2006. I'm not being mean about this, I'm just stating what clearly is fact- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> has a very, very long history, starting from the very beginning of his Wikipedia editing, of ignoring the most basic rules that are in place here. He even got into a fight with <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a>, who is in my opinion a very level-headed and rational person. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 17:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I should examine the characterizations you're making, since you go to all that trouble.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's see, a "fight" with Aecis? It looks like a disagreement, but no more, according to the talk page record <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RunedChozo#Blocked_for_24_hours" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RunedChozo#Blocked_for_24_hours" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>I didn't question the validity of most of the blocks, but the number of them which FAyssalF quotes is both wrong and misleading. Blocks which are the result of an administrator tweaking the timing should not be "counted" twice.</li>
<li>There is an ongoing problem in Wikipedia in which administrators take a user who is in a conflict, block them, and then use harshly worded unblock requests as an excuse to be punitive and block longer. This is not good because it directly contradicts Wikipedia's policies that blocks are not supposed to be punitive, because it is itself incivil conduct on the part of the administrators, and because it is equivalent to throwing gasoline on a fire: it does absolutely nothing to calm the situation down.</li>
<li>My support is not "unerring", but I make no bones about the fact that I believe administrator conduct in this case has been woefully inadequate, if not unprofessional, incivil, and detrimental to the encyclopedia.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>As to edits, you can look at my edit history and judge for yourself. I have no relation to those articles; indeed, I usually just wander around with the Random Article button trying to do cleanup to articles that need some small edits or grammatical fixes. What I have a problem with is administrator misbehavior and the tactic by which you and others are trying to tar and feather anyone who disagrees with you. Someone earlier mentions "Scarlet Letter" harassment, and I think this is a very good description of what you are trying to do. It is incivil behavior on your part and serves no purpose to improve the encyclopedia, because if the edits were bad they would be reverted, and if the edits are good then who cares where they came from? I am sure that PSPMario, if a checkuser on the other two came back negative, would be more than happy to apologize to the two, but you're not giving them the chance, you're calling for their head on a platter which isn't exactly fair given that they appear not to be logged in to defend themselves at the moment. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountPointercount_401c.html" title="User:CountPointercount">CountPointercount</a> 17:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

RunedChozo and all his various and sundry socks are free to attack me, to call me "incivil" for stating my observations as such. To call him some sort of derogatory name would certainly be incivil, but that I have not done. Stating the facts as I see them- that I have done. In the end, we have what we have- a user with an extensive history of rule-violation that stems back from the very days he created his accounts, a plethora of proven sockpuppet accounts and a headache for any and all administrators that have to clean up this mess.

<p>I'm a "blatant" nothing, please stop trying to kill the messenger. You can see my edit history for yourself.

<p>STOP! You dont really have to, but I would like it if the persons points were addressed instead of crying puppet. There was points I made and the editor above me did as well that seem to be ignored because an editor may or may not be a sockpuppet. I never understood the idea that someone who wants to contribute so badly that they would go get another IP, is a bad thing. They are asking for the ability to edit this encyclopedia. Many people go through Arbcom hearings and are put on probation, why not just enact a probation of sorts and give him an admin that will make sure he doesnt cross the line, but also that he is not baited or harrassed. Also again, banned editors can comment on Arbcom hearings so I do not see why they cannot defend themselves here. And please the back and forth AGF'ing and the like is making everyone look less then mature. Can we stop the back and forth and have a discussion? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing about sockpuppets is that they'd never be discovered if they didn't <i>immediately revert to the behavior that got them blocked in the first place</i>.

<p>Again I think the points went completely ignored. He wants to edit the encyclopedia, keep blocking him and he will keep cycling his IP and making new accounts and eventually just become a vandal as opposed to someone who had a complaint. It seems some people are perfectly happy with perpetuating the cycle of vandals. If he wants to edit, let him, put him on probation. The truth is if he wanted to just vandalize and curse people out, he would not be here fighting for his ability to edit, he would be out vandalizing since he can obviously get around blocks easily.

<dd>As said above...If he only wanted to edit, he could have and very likely would have gotten away with it. If CountPointercount was truly RC, then he chose to come back to this page and start up the argument again. I think that is also painfully obvious. I don't agree with hunting after sockpuppets that are only making positive contributions to Wikipedia, but then again...that doesn't seem to happen very often...at least not that we know of, and that's kind of the whole point. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 18:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've come here from Bosniak's Talk page where I found out this was going on. I'm not going to speak for or against him though some of the people whose names I've seen here know very well on which side of the fence I stand. I was told to "watch my conduct" when I gave up the struggle to remain "civil" in the wake of yet another onslaught at the article by people whose good faith I doubt - and even if I'm banned for saying that it's what I believe. Editing and administration have moved the article towards a position where people who have worked very hard in the past to assert the truth of what happened at Srebrenica in the face of overt mistruth and more subtle manipulation have become increasingly upset and less happy about pseudo-objective discussions and actions that those familiar with the situation at the article recognise as wilfully provocative. The specific reason why I'm intervening here is that I'm angry to see a reference to "POV edit warring and revert warring (against the established community consensus) on <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>". This so-called "established consensus" is just the new status quo that has emerged in the wake of this stepping up of the campaign of revision. What is referred to now as "POV edit warring and revert warring" has often consisted of attempts to restore parts of the article to a former "consensus" (if that word is ever appropriate to the article given the concerns and motives of the participants), that existed before the onset of the recent campaign spearheaded by a complicated and controversial character who I still believe whatever else is said has not been subject to the same restraints as other people. Bosniak, myself and Emir Arven have attempted to stem this tide of change at the article. I maintain we were justified not just in terms of ensuring a reasonably true account of what actually happened but also in terms ultimately of defending the credibility of the article. Personally I've found this a pretty disillusioning experience and I can't say that I'm bothered any more by the threat of sanctions here. I'm still very angry so I'd better not say any more, not because I'm concerned by what the administrators here might now threaten me with but because I'm unhappy enough already at having let myself get provoked into losing my calm. People here have deleted me in the past and may well do so now, but at least I've had my say and unencyclopaedic as it may be to say so at least I don't feel that Bosniak, Emir Arven or I have betrayed our duty to the truth. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 00:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi friends. I was invited to come and state my side. Psychonaut was blocked in the past for disruptive behavior. He has been reverting Srebrenica Massacre constantly. There is no established principle with regards to disputed terms @ Srebrenica Massacre article. Disputed terms include: "alternative views", "controversial views", "revisionist views", and more recently "dissenting views". We are attempting to improve the article, but disruptive users are constantly reverting article to their Point of Views which is (I believe) wrong. User Psychonaut does not assume faith. This is probably 10th or 11th time that he is complaining against me. He seems to side with revisionist views @ Srebrenica Massacre, and he wants to get rid off me and other progressive editors who want to improve the article as opposed to constantly disrupt it. User Psychonaut is using old tactics by pointing out to my old edits, etc. Administrators should take notice that he is not assuming good faith and that he is constantly complaining. He treats wikipedia as his own personal page and he is complaining against people who he does not agree with. As you can see from my contributions, I have slowed down my editing at Srebrenica Massacre article and even compromised with disruptive editors (Osli73) that we should not focus on Gen. MacKenzie, as he is not a central player in the massacre (you can read this at Srebrenica Massacre discussion page). I call upon administrators to stop Psychonaut from his fully biased approach, constant complaints, and him not assuming good faith when it comes to users he does not agree with. As I said -- Srebrenica Massacre article is slowly, but steadily becoming improved. We are using compromise and good faith as the best approach to improve the article. Things are getting better and by working together, we can achieve much better results. Thank you for your time, and I wish you peaceful day friends. All the best, and assume good faith at all times.</dd>

<dd><b>Update:</b> User Psychonaut does have a grudge against me and I don't appreciate his constant complaints, constant reverts (he is starting edit wars and reverting "revisionist" to 'whatever term he sees appropriate', even though there is no concensus which term to use). His goal is to achieve "moral equivalency" with respect to the Srebrenica Genocide article (which is wrong and biased). I would like to thank user (admin) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ckatz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ckatz" rel="nofollow">Ckatz</a>, user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Duja" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Duja" rel="nofollow">Duja</a> and user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Opbeith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Opbeith" rel="nofollow">Opbeith</a> for their opinions. Psychonaut should learn to assume faith and stop using old tricks and old edits as an evil tool to block me. He is starting revert wars, he reverts my good faith contributions, and then he comes here and complains against me. Unfortunately, user Psychonaut is not constructive. Don't fall for his tricks.

<dd><b>Update 2:</b> It is not legitimate to describe anything as an "alternative" view when it's been contradicted by legal findings (that was the relevance of the MacKenzie discussions), and that's exactly what user Psychonaut does with his constant disruptive behavior, edit wars, and reverts. He is trying to maintain and enforce his point of view in the face of interventions that the administrators have been very reluctant to respond to and he is making me appear the guilty / aggressive party because of the way the ground has been moved by other people's changes. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 05:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To give some background on my involvement with the articles under discussion, I wish to point out that I have no interest in anything remotely related to the Balkans. Contrary to what Bosniak has stated in the past, I am not a Serb, and do not have a pro-Serb or genocide-denial agenda. I became involved in the articles rather accidentally, probably through an AfD or from tracking down vandalism in a related article. My only involvement in the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> article has been minor formatting changes and attempting to defuse POV issues. I have no horse in this race, and in fact didn't even know about the Srebrenica massacre until I stumbled upon it on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>It is correct to say that I do not assume good faith for Bosniak, at least for certain incidents. For example, he states above that I have been blocked for disruptive behaviour, which he knows to be a lie as it was repeatedly explained to him that the blocks on my account were mistaken (and at any rate had nothing to do with the sort of behaviour he ascribes to me). He also has chosen not to read the diffs I posted, because they are not "old edits" as he falsely claims, but rather those made only after the expiry of his latest block.</dd>
<dd>With respect to breaching consensus, since the expiry of his block Bosniak has been the only editor on <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> to change the term "alternative views" to "revisionist views" or "genocide denial". To my knowledge no other editor has made such changes, but other editors (besides me) have reverted them. These events are at odds with Bosniak's characterization of this problem as my POV-pushing against the rest of the editors. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 13:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think it's fair to say that Bosniak's edits to <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> are "against the established community consensus". The issue on whether to call it "alternative views" or something else was discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#.22Critical_views.22_or_.22Denial_of_the_massacre.2C_revisionism_and_scepticism.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#.22Critical_views.22_or_.22Denial_of_the_massacre.2C_revisionism_and_scepticism.22" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but in my opinion no consensus was reached.

<dd>I was under the impression that there was indeed a consensus regarding the section now titled "alternative views" since Bosniak was last blocked. The section was originally titled "Critical views", and the first paragraph referred to the views as "alternative views". It had remained as such for a long time. Bosniak then began editing the article, and repeatedly changed the title "Critical views" to "Genocide denial" or "Revisionist views". This was disputed and discussed on the talk page, as you indicated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#.22Critical_views.22_or_.22Denial_of_the_massacre.2C_revisionism_and_scepticism.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#.22Critical_views.22_or_.22Denial_of_the_massacre.2C_revisionism_and_scepticism.22" rel="nofollow">[103]</a> Bosniak was blocked on 21 January, and on 23 January I proposed that we title the section "Alternative views", since that was how the views were referred to in the section, and since no one (including Bosniak) had taken any issue with that description throughout the edit warring.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#Alternative_views" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre/Archive_11#Alternative_views" rel="nofollow">[104]</a> Throughout Bosniak's block, this proposal was followed, and no one changed the title of the section or disputed it on the talk page. I therefore considered the editors involved to have reached a consensus. However, immediately upon the expiry of Bosniak's block, he began changing the title of the section to "Revisionist views" or "Genocide denial" again. I am quite sure that he was the only editor to do so. Other editors, including me, reverted these changes. Again, I took this as evidence of a consensus. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 12:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

"With respect to breaching consensus, since the expiry of his block Bosniak has been the only editor on Srebrenica massacre to change the term "alternative views" to "revisionist views" or "genocide denial"". This statement gives a false impression of the existence of a consensus. After a simple exposition of the temporal relationship between MacKenzie's cited statement in July 2005 and the International Criminal Tribunal's (Krstic) finding in 2001 establishing the fact of genocide at Srebrenica and its confirmation by the Appeals Chamber in April 2004, I was obliged to continue arguing - with people who among other things maintained that the man in the street's understanding of genocide and hence MacKenzie's had equal validity with the wording of the Genocide Convention and the findings of the ICTY - that the "alternative" view being advanced here was in fact a denial of genocide. I did not go silent because there was consensus. I shut up after I was driven to exasperation by the constant refusal of other editors and administrators to accept this situation and their deletion of my comments and contributions. When I expressed my exasperation I was warned to mind my conduct and so I chose to keep silent. This was not the achievement of consensus, this was the outcome of a war of attrition. I don't think it is purely self-obsession that leads me to the view that there is a one-side enforcement of "discipline" at the Srebrenica Massacre article. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 15:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>"didn't even know about the Srebrenica massacre until I stumbled upon it on Wikipedia." Extraordinary. If so, this is an example of one of the inherent problems with Wikipedia. If administrators have no idea of important issues in the real world it must be very difficult for them to understand what is legitimate debate and what is illegitmate revisionism. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 16:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been having a very difficult time this evening dealing with a new user who keeps copying material from an external website and putting it into a Wikipedia article. The article in question is <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bismarck_State_College_d397.html" title="Bismarck State College">Bismarck State College</a>. Bjork53 keeps taking material from <a href="http://www.bismarckstate.edu/college/" class="external text" title="http://www.bismarckstate.edu/college/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> at the College's website and pasting it into the Wikipedia article. I have reverted the inclusion of this material and have tried to explain to Bjork53 that we can't take material from external websites and paste it into articles on Wikipedia. Take a look at <a href="../../../b/j/o/User_talk%7EBjork53_bd67.html" title="User talk:Bjork53">his talk page</a> to see the comments I've left for him and then look at <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">my talk page</a> to see the comments he has left for me. I would not be trying to get an administrator to help me, but my warnings to Bjork53 don't seem to be doing the trick. I continue to preach to him that he can't take material directly from the schools website and he continues to do it anyways. Right now, the Bismarck State College article reads like an ad and is almost entirely ripped from the school's website. I will say that, while before it was a verbatim copy and paste, now he is changing a word here and there to make it be "in his own words". I think an administrator needs to at least look at the article and the website that it is copied from and perhaps leave a message on his talk page to let him now how important copyrights are on Wikipedia and that "in your own words" doesn't mean just changing a word here and there. The College's article clearly needs expansion, but Bjork53's method (copying from an external website, changing a few words, and then pasting into the article) isn't the way to do it and he needs to understand this. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matthew<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 07:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears that some clever, helpful person has changed whatever bit of the MediaWiki stuff creates the icons at the top of the "Editing" page so that instead of the usual redirect icon we have a Nazi-era German flag. I don't know where this is stored. The redirect icon seems to be regularly tampered with, so an idiot-level explanation of how to undo this would be nice.

<dd>Try logging out, viewing the article, and <a href="../../../b/y/p/Wikipedia%7EBypass_your_cache_1dae.html" title="Wikipedia:Bypass your cache">bypassing your cache</a>. The article must have been vandalised and reverted, and your browser cache is still holding the vandalised version; bypassing your cache (Ctrl-F5 on IE and FireFox) will sort it out. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:33, 16 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>Another good way of getting around your cache (at least as far as seeing if it <i>is</i> your cache) is to go through the history, comparing diffs (find when the vandalism took place, and you can find if it was removed). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This site has been added to numerous pages within the last 45 days. Its caught fairly quickly, however this current user has a substantial number of spammings. First batch conducted in december 2006 and user was warned. Now user has 12 edits today alone. I will be initiating a RFCU to see if these are puppets as well. If an admin can look into this, it would be great! <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob110178_fec2.html" title="User:Rob110178">Rob110178</a> 17:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
