<p>The section of modern politics is entirely removed.<br />
He warned me to block my id if I revert the article that has modern politics. I dont think that it is fair.

Only under certain circumstances can admins be sanctioned for "abuse of Admin powers", and I see none of it there. Please provide specific <a href="../../../d/i/f/Help%7EDiff_d48e.html" title="Help:Diff">diffs</a> which demonstrate <b>a clear breach of administrative protocol, with proper reference to what is stated in the Wikipedia admins policies</b>, and then maybe something can be done.

<dd>What I mean is not difference between version. The version edited by me was identical with the version that Nlu had edited.

<dd>And how does that make your complaint qualify as <b>"administrator abuse"</b>, as opposed to <b>"normal abuse"</b>? Normal "abuse" goes down the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> path, which is exactly where this should be headed. It is not admin "abuse", because they didn't use their admin powers to act in an "abusive" manner.

Why should we believe an obscure book you pointed out, when you describe yourself on your user page as "a Finn nationalist" and engage in tendentious editing?

<p>Could everyone please stay civil here, and can this discussion please take place on the articles <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussophobia_b9bb.html" title="Talk:Russophobia">talk page</a> for now? It does appear that Jaakko has provided evidence of the photo being a fake and I tend to agree that it should be removed or labeled as such, but it would be best if editors involved with the article worked it out on the article talk page. This was not vandalism as he clearly stated in edit comments why he was removing it. Still, after a removal and a revert of the removal it would have been best to start a conversation rather than removing it again. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> 13:23, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wise words. Move to the article talk page, and post nothing more here until you actually need administrator intervention, and then only as an absolute last resort. So can we all move away from clogging up WP:DR with complaints, and negotiate a solution on the article's talk page?

<dd>The book in question is a popular high school history book, not an "obscure one", and there is no reason to doubt it unless you give other reference. Thus, it is reliable. You have not given any evidence to support it's authenticity. In addition, the Soviets did a lot of propaganda on exactly these kind of things, are you denying that...? That photo's purpose is to show Finnish prison camps as somekind of Nazi-style concentration camps which they were not: they are comparable to the Amrican internation camps for the Japanese.

<dd>I have already left the 3RR template on his page. I know he is new, but he has been asked to respond or explain on discussion many times and has refused, just simply repeated the same edit, every hour or so for the past two days. (First as an IP, then with the account). Since I can't get him to discuss, I don't know what else to do, so now I am coming here. I have not seen any source other than him to suppose that Ethiopia has changed its anthem from <a href="../../../w/o/d/Wodefit_Gesgeshi%2C_Widd_Innat_Ityopp%27ya_7b09.html" title="Wodefit Gesgeshi, Widd Innat Ityopp'ya">Wodefit Gesgeshi, Widd Innat Ityopp'ya</a>. On occasion he has changed other bits of info in the Ethiopia infobox beside the anthem. He could at least explain why he is doing this non productive edit so insistently.

His block had expired which was obvious by the fact that he could *edit*. Please do not remove other people's comments again. The rest of argument is silly and needs to end. Nixer hasn't used sockpuppets for awhile, so its fine for the tag to be removed. Its in the edit history anyway and we don't need to keep branding people if they've refomed. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
More accurately is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was asked to participate in a controversial discussion, (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_urban_legends" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_urban_legends</a>) I made a comment, the gist of which was that whether it was true or not, it should *not* be included in the article. I did not comment in the article itself for obvious reasons. The only reason I commented on the talk page was because I watch the BPL page, and was *asked* to give my opinion, not for any other reason.</li>
<li>User <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS</a> at some later time (five or six hours) removed a portion of my comments fom the talk page. He did not comment in the talk pages as to why, nor did he comment on my own talk page.</li>
<li>I left polite, but firm feedback for <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS</a> on his talk page. In a nutshell, I said "You edited (removed a portion of) my comments on the Jamie Lee Curtis page. This is not acceptable. I'm happy to discuss any differences of opinion I may have with other editors, but I won't accept other people editing my comments because they disagree."(See <a href="../../../w/a/s/User_talk%7EWAS_4.250_abb7.html#Jamie_Lee_Curtis" title="User talk:WAS 4.250">User_talk:WAS_4.250#Jamie_Lee_Curtis</a>). I also reverted the edit to my opinion on the talk page.</li>
<li>User <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS</a> replied relatively quickly, explaining his rationale on my talk page. (see <a href="../../../a/t/o/User_talk%7EAtomaton_9031.html#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_and_Nikki_Craft" title="User talk:Atomaton">User_talk:Atomaton#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_and_Nikki_Craft</a>) He said "So you want to pick a fight with me over my correct use of WP:BLP while you use it to delete sources instead of claims and your edit subjects are troll bait (but I have not reviewed your edits on those sex pages). Altogether a troubling pattern"</li>
<li>I responded, explained that I was not offensive, only establishing limits. I acknowledged that I understood his rationale and respected it. (and a great many other things).</li>
<li>I also responded on the Jamie Lee Curtis talkpage that I was offended to be *asked* to offer an opinion, and then told my opinion was politically incorrect when I did. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jamie_Lee_Curtis&amp;oldid=82862786" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jamie_Lee_Curtis&amp;oldid=82862786" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]</li>
<li>This was reverted, by user WAS and part of my previous comments re-edited again. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jamie_Lee_Curtis&amp;oldid=82865755" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jamie_Lee_Curtis&amp;oldid=82865755" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]</li>
<li>On my talk page, I told user <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS</a> "Anyway, I respect your opinion on the matter and won't comment on the Jamie Lee Curtis issue again. I only wanted to point out that it was rude to ask for my opinion, and then say that my opinion was politically incorrect."</li>
<li>I removed all of my comments entirely from the Jamie Lee Curtis talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it is my opinion that <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS</a> was extremely rude. He implied I was trying to pick a fight with him, implied that my area of specialty was somehow not appropriate for editing, and just generally seemed to be pushy for no good reason when he could have just been polite, and assumed good faith on my part. I respect that his intentions, to protect the biography of a living person, as well as the image and integrity of Wikipedia was pure. As a member of that project I understand the sensitivity. I had no idea that I would be treated so roughly by responding to the request to offer my opinion at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_urban_legends_Biography_of_living_persons_noticeboard." title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Jamie_Lee_Curtis_urban_legends Biography of living persons noticeboard.</a>) Apparently the only comments desired were ones that carefully avoided discussing the subject. Someone might want to post that on the talk page to avoid other people from being burned without warning. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 20:56, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two things here. First Atom, policy cleary states unsourced claims can be removed from anyplace on wikipedia. You yourself admitted you have no source. Therefore, WAS's action was correct. If you don't agree with the policy, start a discussion on the policy talk page, but in the meantime, you must abide by it. Second, WAS, your statement on Atom's talk page was clearly made to put Atom on the defensive ("I also notice almost all your recent edits are sex related. So you want to pick a fight with me over my correct use of WP:BLP while you use it to delete sources instead of claims and your edit subjects are troll bait (but I have not reviewed your edits on those sex pages). Altogether a troubling pattern.") and you should have made a more polite comment rather than accusing Atom of various and sundry crimes. In short, neither or you handled this well but the removal was correct. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:15, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't argue the removal. What I stated was fact. Disclosing the source would by contrary to my goals of saying that there was some reason it was important. It isn't. I don't think it should be in the article whether it is true or not. I agreed that I did not offer a source, and hence agreed to abide by policy. That is why I retracted my comments. I would have retracted all of them but user WAS had already edited some of them out before I finished replying to his comment. I don't suggest that the policy was applied incorrectly, or that it should be changed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I objected to was being slapped around as though I was some vandal, merely because I offered my opinion when asked. My original comment/response was really not intended to be malicious. In responding the the BLP request, I was merely pointing out that I knew it to be true, not trying to pass on any gossip or rumors. In restrospect saying that wasn't really relevant, and didn't need to be said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I felt that I was polite, and assumed good faith even though he could have been more diplomatic. The only reason we are her on this page is because user WAS felt obliged to comment on it, even after I ceded his point on my talk page and removed my comments. (disregarding what he implied in his comments). <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 21:35, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Jayjg! First off, I think it's great judgement of you to list this incident here, given your involvement in the incident. In briefly looking at the diffs you provided and the user's contribs, I would suggest a longish block (two to four months) for the user to chill out and reevaluate if he wants to postively contribute to this project or to continue to antagonise other users and attempt to interject his POV. If he returns and changes his ways, then great! We'll have another dedicated volunteer; if he comes back from his block and continues to negatively affect Wikipedia, then I'd have no problem with an immediate permanent block. I hope this helps!

<p>I have been making some edits to <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamilnet.html" title="Tamilnet">Tamilnet</a> which have been repeatedly reverted with POV and propaganda from the ministry of Defence, Sri Lanka without any qualifications of the text by user <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4">User:Snowolfd4</a>. I have added a list of justifications for my changes. But this user has never bothered to answer them and gone ahead given very terse statements for his reverts. This is pretty much vandalism. I have in turn added citations from a reputable source, namely a journal article on Tamilnet.com by Whitaker, Mark P. "Tamilnet.com: Some Reflections on Popular Anthropology, Nationalism, and the Internet" Anthropological Quarterly - Volume 77, Number 3, Summer 2004, pp. 469-498 George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research. He has reverted my citations claiming in effect that this peer-reviewed scholarly journal article is the following:</p>
<p><i>According to Official WP policy</i> <i>Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources. That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book. The reason personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial — is that they are usually created by unknown individuals who have no one checking their work. They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or even insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. Only with independent verification by other sources not holding the same POV is it possible to determine the difference.</i></p>
<p>He has claimed pretty much all the sources, including the journal article not to be a reliable source, with very very dubious edit summaries. I desperately need administrator intervention on this. This is getting to be very frustrating when a user claims that a peer-reviewed scholarly journal article is an unreliable source and then goes ahead and blanks legitimate cited contents. He has already been blocked for edit warring and has a history of POV pushing and blanking. <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElalan_06ee.html" title="User:Elalan">Elalan</a> 04:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Do not modify it. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:59, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<p>This concerns a discussion Mongo and I had been having on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MONGO#ED_purging" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MONGO#ED_purging" rel="nofollow">his talk page</a>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had written <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbrace_weasel_words_4279.html" title="Wikipedia:Embrace weasel words">an essay</a> which, passing, included in a link to Encyclopedia Dramatica. As far as I know, the link is uncontroversial and doesn't in any way involve harassment. I'm not an ED editor or anything-- I only recently became aware of what a big drama ED actually is-- I myself just copied the link from <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a> because my essay was on a similar subject.</p>
<p>Today, Mongo deleted the link from the essay, citing a recent arbcom decision. Since that time, I have been engaged in a dispute with Mongo to either help ME understand why Wikipedia is better with that link deleted, or to help him understand why it isn't helpful to delete _all_ ED links, regardless of the linked to content. I want to stress, and I mean this sincerely, that I was genuinely trying to have an actual dialogue, truly open, and indeed eager, to understand how the deletion improves Wikipedia. At no time have I attempted to re-insert the link in question, nor do I have any intention to do so.</p>
<p>I post here not because of the deletion itself, but rather because of the extereme rudness Mongo has shown me in my sincere good-faith attempt to have this dialogue. If you look at the discussion, I haven't insulted him, I haven't been rude to him, I haven't slandered him-- I have sincerely been trying to understand his POV or convince him of mine. I sincerely expressed my frustration with the deletion, and honestly asked him to help me understand it. Mongo has responded with extreme rudeness, generaly dismissed my concerns, aggressively told me to "find a better use of my time... NOW.", and snidely remarked "I hope this isn't too frustrating for you". In his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=82995358&amp;oldid=82994029" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=82995358&amp;oldid=82994029" rel="nofollow">last response</a>, he promised to block me if I continued the dialogue, and terminated the discussion by saying "<big>NOW GET THE HELL OFF MY PAGE ABOUT THAT GODDAMN WEBSITE</big>."</p>
<p>Despite this behavior, I actually have alot to say in Mongo's defense. I'm only marginally familar with his on-going dispute with the ED webmasters, but it seems like he's had a very hard time of things and they've been very, very rude to him, even posting person information about him, and saying things that are so slanderous I won't even repeat them. I can only guess that his behavior towards me is based on the assumption that I am a sockpupppet of that person, and that my questions to him are actually bad-faith attempts at annoyance and harrassment. However, I assure you, I am not the webmaster of ED, I have no ties to him, I have a relatively-long editing history here at Wikipedia, amd I was trying to have a good-faith dialogue with a Wikipedia Admin who was enforcing his interpreation of policy on an essay I had written. Mongo's behavior to me is completely and utterly uncalled-for, and honestly, very upsetting.</p>
<p>It seems like Mongo has a long and outstanding edit history here, and has been a valuable member of the community-- and his attacks towards me are probably nothing but shell-shock-- the jitteriness of someone who has been attacked by others for too long, and has gotten very tired of it. That said, his behavior towards me _is_ inappropriate, and I would ask the Wikpedia community to help him understand that, and to understand that I, and more importantly, other users he might encounter in the future, are not necessarily trying to harass him when we ask questions of him, even if we are slow to understand his thinking, and even if we are persistent in our sincere inquiries.</p>
<p>I would explicitly ask that he not be blocked for his-- I don't know if that's even something that would be considered, but i'm quite convinced he's just suffering from "diminished capacity" caused by being under attack by persistent trolls,and that blocking would only aggravate the situation. I also am not informing him of this posting, per his request that I not post on his talk page anymore-- someone else can contact him regarding this discussion if such contact is appropriate.</p>

<dd>I want to offer my support for MONGO, who has been targeted for months and continues to be 'pecked at' by vicious ED trolls. I know few people who would show as much restraint as MONGO if they were similarly targeted. While his comment was uncivil, his capacity is not 'diminished'.

<dd>I think you should bare in mind that the arbcom ruling on this matter says 'may be removed' not 'must be removed' or similar, so this users questions about whether the wholesale deletion of the links is necessary are indeed legitimate. You conistently refuse to actually discuss the matter simply referring the editor to the ruling and telling him to 'do something better with his time'. I would simply say that regardless of any history with other users, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> still applies and was ignored here with a new user with a legitimate question.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, Alecmconroy did persist a little too much over the issue as it was obvious an answer, which didn't simply point to the arbcom ruling, was not going to appear. This gives the impression of trolling.</dd>
<dd>So, I would say that both editors are in the wrong here, Mongo for not assuming good faith and incivility and Alecmconry for not just letting it drop.

<li>All MONGO needed to do was state "The matter is closed, take any further questions to ArbCom". The statement made was <i>way</i> out of line. I commented on his talk page as follows:</li>

<p><i>MONGO, certainly you're aware of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Examples_of_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, specifically "Profanity directed against another contributor". Whether his actions constitute <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHARASS_2733.html" title="WP:HARASS">harrassment</a> doesn't excuse a like reply. You might want to reconsider the tone of your above statement.</i></p>
<p>Which he proceded to remove without comment, a fairly <a href="../../../u/n/c/WP%7EUNCIVIL_ed2c.html" title="WP:UNCIVIL">WP:UNCIVIL</a> edit per <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html#Etiquette" title="Help:Talk page">Help:Talk_page#Etiquette</a>. While Alecmconroy might have been overly persistent, such a comment to him, and a removal of what amounts to a Npa2 warning, only strengthens the idea that MONGO is acting in an uncivil manner.</p>
<p>Just as I submitted this for preview, MONGO again removed my warning and posted on my talk page the following: <i>The discussion does not involve you and you are trying to antagonize me...so here is your warning from me, an administrator.</i> I'm not quite certain how putting a npa2 warning on a user page is any sort of violation, so I don't appreciate his threat. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 14:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>MONGO is absolutely in the right. If he believes it is productive to find and delete all references to ED he may do so according to the arbcom ruling. He should not be badgered indefinitely by persons who disagree with an Arbcom ruling. In fact, anyone who reverts those deletions is subject to immediate block/ban (after being informed about the Arbcom ruling). To argue that they "may" be removed does not grant authority for MONGO to delete them all is specious. There are no rules about what priority an editor <i>may</i> place on any particular edit. If MONGO believes that removing ED is his highest priority, then he <i>may</i> do so. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 14:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Of course MONGO is absolutely in the right regarding the deletion actions. I even agreed with him on his talk page.

<p>Enough of this. Repeated trolling needs blocked - wikilawyering be damned. I don't think MONGO should have to deal with this, or block these lusers himself.

Arbcom says that link can and (more important) <b>should</b> be removed at discretion.

Good for Arbcom (they've endorsed his prior actions completely, which says "Good for MONGO"). Someone has to stand watch at this gate, and MONGO has demonstrated vastly more patience than I might, and certainly more patience than Alexmconroy (though Alex's original message here has all the appropriate caveats, to his credit). Alex should understand that linking to ED will always be controversial, and stop doing it. MONGO has an obligation to himself and others to make his intention to delete such links clear on the ED talk page, and IMHO he should stop blanking valid comments from his talk page (they call that vandalism, even for testy admins).

<dd>I disagree that profanity is 'out of line' (although I rarely employ it myself). Calling someone a profane name, for example, is out of line because it's name calling, not profanity.

I'll repeat what numerous users have told you (but which you seem to ignore) - that your persistence here is not speaking well of your ability to concentrate on content rather than contributors.

<dd>In response to the complaints that I "harassed", "badgered" or "wikilawyered", let me just explain my point of view. An admin comes to a page I'm on, deletes a link, and tells me no to add it back. I, or any user, am going to want to know why that has to happen, and ideally, I'd like to actually understand how wikpedia is better because of that rule. And "because arbcom said so" doesn't cut it. That explaination is certainly sufficent to persuade me not to break the rule-- I haven't disobeyed it, no will I. But that doesn't quench my desire to understand why that link was bad, just because of an unrelated dispute between Mongo and the domains's owner. I'm sorry i was persistent in my inquiries, but I legitimately don't understand why anyone wanted that particular link gone, and I don't guess I'm going to understand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's fine. Take the link--- it was a dumb little humor link anyway. Don't explain to me why you want the link gone-- just point to the law that allows you to remove it. okay. But please-- don't get mad at ME for even asking the question! Don't call me a harasser or a badgerer (or god forbid a lawyer). ya know?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I'm dropping this, as I've been strongly encouraged to do. I question the wisdom of deleting all links based not on the linked-to-content, but based just on the domain name. I question the wisdom of being so mean to people who question you. But that will be up to someone else to convince people of those things-- I'm politely exiting the whole mess, grumbling as I do so that I sorta got a raw deal in the whole matter.</dd>

<dd>Samir, I promise you, it was in good faith. I've only added the link once, way back in july, when I copied it from the policy page <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a> along with other text that was on the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words&amp;oldid=64296670" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words&amp;oldid=64296670" rel="nofollow">at that time</a>. I had no way of knowing what a huge bru-ha-ha ED was (if indeed it even was such a big deal back then). I haven't added a single ED link since that time, and I'm not gonna. It completely was good-faith, as has all my behavior since then. Really.</dd>
<dd>I mean, the link itself isn't that big of a deal. I mean-- here's an easy way out-- I notice that linked-to-page (which I won't post here) has since added a very offensive and disgusting pornographic image which wasn't there when I first visited that page. So, right there is a reason we shouldn't link to that page--it's a really gross image. I completely understand that kind of reasoning.</dd>
<dd>I just don't get why Mongo, or others, want to delete links to stuff just based on who's hosting it. To make light of what I can see is a tense situation-- I really hate AOL (all those stupid AOL cds cloggin up my mailbox)-- but I wouldn't delete links to un-objectionable pages just cause hosted on AOL servers. Anyway-- I don't mean to redebate the issue-- Wikipedia seems to have spoken on this issue through their elected representatives, so that's a done deal.</dd>
<dd>I'm just saying-- if you see bad faith in my actions, you're wrong. Dead wrong. I never even heard of Mongo two days ago, I wasn't trying to harass him, I wasn't trying to be rude, I was sincerely just trying to have a discussion. In doing so, I seem to inadvertantly stumbled into a landmine, and since then have been insulted, cussed at, threatened with blocks, likened to a cry-baby, and in general, seen as whole side of Wikipedia that I didn't know existed. And I'm telling you-- I don't deserve it, I wasn't trying to be difficult or annoying or anything like that. If you see bad faith, hear me looking you square in the eye and promising you-- I wasn't trying to harass, annoy, or otherwise. Seriously. Word of honor.</dd>
<dd>So, <i>next time</i>-- everyone just be a little more willing to accept that someone might be acting in good faith, and a little slower to hit incivility. For my part, I apologize that I didn't pick up earlier on Mongo's wikistress in the discussion on his talk page-- if I had known earlier what a hot-button topic this ED thing is, I would have taken extra care to distance myself from that group of people, to reiterate to Mongo my regret at what they've done to him, and to be extra clear that my concerns and questions about the deletions does not in any way imply that I condone the rude way he's been treated by those people.</dd>

<dd>Can we maybe stop the incessant "wikilawyering" comments? There's legitimate criticism of how Arbcom handled the linking issue, and the fact that some people are indeed going overboard in enforcement isn't much better. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a finding of excessive zeal in the arbcom case, and it appears that Mongo took the "No action is taken..." response as a license to go back to behaving rudely, when it really should have been taken as a clear warning that there is a line in the sand. This seems to be to be a serious mistake, from MONGO removing the ED links himself, to escalating to highly rude responses when people ask why. Another sad day. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia usernames are not intended as vehicles for linkspam. However, every edit that <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">User:SafeLibraries.org</a> makes inserts another link to <a href="http://www.SafeLibraries.org" class="external free" title="http://www.SafeLibraries.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SafeLibraries.org</a> into Wikipedia. As this user now has 1099 edits, he has now inserted at least 1099 spam links into the edit history of various pages. This continued linkspamming is disruptive. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username#Inappropriate_usernames</a> recognizes this problem, and states that</p>

<dd>From what I understand the "link spamming" is that every time the account edits it leaves the URL in the page history. However, these pages aren't even counted as links by search engines (only pages with /wiki/ in the URL are cached by search engines). Of course, a username change would change the history pages anyway, so... I was in the middle of discussion with this user, and he said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SafeLibraries.org&amp;diff=82933897&amp;oldid=82928290" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SafeLibraries.org&amp;diff=82933897&amp;oldid=82928290" rel="nofollow">he would change his username</a>, and I would <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume that is in good faith</a>. Also, I left a note to John explaining what I did, but he decided not to leave me a message, as I requested he do if he had a problem, but instead made a report here. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 15:44, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since users can edit their talk pages even while blocked, <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">User:SafeLibraries.org</a> can specify a new username on his talk page.

<p>As John said. Also, BusterD, the name is inappropriate regardless of "spamming".

<dd>Thanks for the explanation. Site seems like self-promotion, and behavior appears unreliable. But if the user name change is agreed, problem looks solved. Curious: how did this get to 1100 edits before blockage? Was no time frame agreed upon in first contact? This seems open and shut to an outsider.

X's vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> X's vote authorized the President to establish permissible interrogation techniques and to "interpret the meaning and application" of international <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_def6.html" title="Geneva Convention">Geneva Convention</a> standards, so long as the coercion fell short of "serious" bodily or psychological injury.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The bill became law on October 17, 2006.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some individuals, he's actually created whole sections to discuss this.

Aside from the fact that the wording is prejudicial and not supported by the sources, it seems to me that this kind of boilerplate insertion is spamming for political purposes, and a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Will he insert this paragraph into the bios of <i>every single senator</i> who voted for this? Is this particular vote of each senator notable in some way? Have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> actually commented on these specific votes of these specific individuals?</p>
<p>Not only is Sandover adding the material to articles, but he is also reverting anyone who removes it. I suggest that this behavior is disruptive, and that Sandover should stop doing this. If he wants to list every senator who voted for the bill, he should do so in the article on the bill. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He continues to add it to articles, for example <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia_Snowe_9bde.html" title="Olympia Snowe">Olympia Snowe</a>.

To add to this, the user is quoting incidents from the newspapers that he has read someday. sometime ago!! Here Iwazaki has framed up two entire sections of his own, literally without any citation at all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Velupillai_Prabhakaran&amp;diff=82998537&amp;oldid=82954817" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Velupillai_Prabhakaran&amp;diff=82998537&amp;oldid=82954817" rel="nofollow">refer here</a>. The citations he has pointed to refer to a newspaper article which he has read sometime ago and is not a piece of evidence which can be verified by everybody who would be reading that article. It is something like 'I-saw-that-in-news-once' kind of a link. It is a blank newspaper name link which isn't a hyperlink or anything at all.

<li>Again (didn't notice this earlier) - there is a world of difference between "jointly compiled byCrimsone" and "includes a list compiled by Crimsone used to show the user which edits he had recieved a final warning for and why". Please be more accurate in your language when describing such things, as your statement implies my taking of sides in this latest report, which is most certainly not the case. I do not wish to be drawn into a content dispute that I know little about, nor an ongoing incivility dispute between two editors I have no real connection with. All I have done is given a list of comments to the user that made them in explanation of a final warning given by an admin in response to a <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> report.

<p>An indef block does not mean permament.

<p>If he doesn't abide by the arbcom ruling and knowing adds links to the website in question, he can and will be blocked, as can any editor who knowingly violates the arbcom ruling. It's that simple. That the block is permanent is another matter, but wheel warring over a block applied that is backed by an arbcom decision would be a bad idea.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The exact arbcom wording is:</p>
<p><b>Enforcement by block</b> 1) Users who insert links to Encyclopædia Dramatica or who copy material from it here may be blocked for an appropriate period of time. Care should be taken to warn naive users before blocking. Strong penalties may be applied to those linking to or importing material which harasses other users.

<dd><i>Pass 5-0 at 02:08, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>An indefinite block is clearly a strong penalty. A link to the ED homepage is not a link to material that harrasses others. Indefinite is not "appropriate" for a mere link to the ED homepage, though it's clearly compliant with the decision to do a more limited block.</p>
<p>I strongly support not linking to ED and the arbcom decision, and an appropriate block on those who violate it, but Arbcom sent two messages over this: one, don't abuse WP admins, and two, don't be abusive in return. If Arbcom had meant inserting <i>any</i> link to be indef-blockable they would have said so. And the block here has not been listed as the arbcom decision requires.</p>

<dl>
<dd>1) No listing at the Log.</dd>
<dd>2) An indefinite block is a strong penalty, which may only be applied to those linking to or importing material which harrasses other users. A link to the ED homepage, which currently (without following any links) only has one Wikipedia reference on it, and nothing related to any WP editors as far as I see, is not harrassing other WP users.</dd>
<dd>2a) Jgp is not a naive user, knew what he/she was doing, and the second sentence does not apply.</dd>
<dd>2b) Jgp did insert a link and per Arbcom <i>may be blocked for an appropriate period of time</i>.</dd>
<dd>2c) In no prior arbcom decision has a single act of defiant disagreement with an Arbcom decision by a non-party been justification for an indefinite block. Arbcom decisions have been treated like any other normal policy, and violations thereof as for any other policy.</dd>
<dd>2d) One time ordinary wilful violation of WP policy is normally appropriately and consistently handled by 24-48 hr blocks and appropriate warnings.</dd>
<dd>2e) WP blocks are, by policy, preventive rather than punitive. Given a single wilful violation, other than a catastrophic attack on someone or on WP, an indef block is punitive.</dd>
<dd>As I said: Jgp shouldn't have done this and "a" block is within policy. An indef block is not, and should be overturned by Zoe, or should rightfully be overturned by another admin after 24 hrs or so if she won't. This would not be wheel-warring - it's enforcing the Arbcom decision as written.</dd>
<dd>Acting too harshly and arbitrarily lends credence to WP critics. Arbcom carefully phrased its decision. This was not a carefully phrased or carefully thought out response. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:46, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Baloney...comments in the edit summary he made clearly indicated he knew what the ruling was and he clearly called another editors attempts to enforce the arbcom ruling as vandalism. His comments on his own talk page initially indicated he was both hostile and unremorseful for readding the link. The appropriate period of time as far as Zoe was concerned is indefinite...and that is not the same thing as permanent per se. You have virtually zero experience dealing with trolls, no experience administering blocks and no experience explaining why you deleted an article, so your commentary is based on a lack of experience. Zoe has been around for a long time, and I can find zero fault in what she did, especially with the remedy that was unanimously selected by the arbtrators that voted on the arbcom case.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:06, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>First of all, Hello to you all. Straight to business. I've had a minor tiff with <span id="StalinsLoveChild" class="plainlinks">StalinsLoveChild&#160;(<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStalinsLoveChild_3e5b.html" title="User talk:StalinsLoveChild">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_StalinsLoveChild_9c84.html" title="Special:Contributions/StalinsLoveChild">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=StalinsLoveChild&amp;site=localhost" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=StalinsLoveChild&amp;site=localhost" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">count</span></a></span>), and although I admit that I am at fault (and will accept any comments on my conduct), I've a bit worried through his comments on <a href="../../../h/a/w/User_talk%7EHawkerTyphoon_e6d7.html" title="User talk:HawkerTyphoon">my talk page</a> and on his own user and talk pages. It looks like he could be evading a previous indefblock, although i'm not entrely sure how to go about finding this out or if it's even a problem. Most worrying is his final message on my talk page - "I have had numerous past accounts on Wikipedia, which usually get shut down due to the ignorance of people like you not knowing what's best" - combined with his User page, stating that "If my userpage gets deleted AGAIN I will be extremely angry - and this time, you SHALL FEEL MY WRATH. ". Is this a problem? I don't profess to know much about indefblock polciies, and if they can create another account afterwards to evade the block? it doesn't look like he's learned his lesson, regardless. Here's to a quick reply, <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 23:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well its a big issue, you can file for Checkuser but there is always the issue that while they had previousa ccounts they did not actually get indef blocked and simply left the account to avoid stigma, arguements, harrassment etc. You can file a check user <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, however you need to present evidence that they did something wrong, not simly that they had past accounts. You also, I believe need to provide a name to check against, so if you do not know who you want to accuse of being his past account there is not much that can be done. The real issue is finding out if they actually got banned before or simpyl left the accounts. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have never been indefinitely blocked, and that's fact. This HawkerTyphoon dude has a vendetta against me for some reason - read his comments on my talkpage yourself, he has breached numerous rules, only I'm not so petty as to report them.

<dd>This user has now asked to be unblocked, and I've been asked to explain my reasons for blocking. SLC is clearly a trolling account. Most of the mainspace edits are minor grammatical tweaks which change nothing, null edits (adding or removing a space), or vandalism/trolling (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gott_erhalte_Franz_den_Kaiser&amp;diff=82140506&amp;oldid=68017999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gott_erhalte_Franz_den_Kaiser&amp;diff=82140506&amp;oldid=68017999" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, or especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cruelty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83086466" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cruelty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83086466" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> -- make sure you read all the way to the bottom). After establishing a mainspace presence, he proceeds to troll, and every single user talk edit is a nasty one indeed. After Hawker's apology -- he hadn't <i>really</i> done anything so bad -- SLC began the harassment campaign, targeting Hawker's own picture. Look at his last edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:UserHawkerTyphoon.JPG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83326093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:UserHawkerTyphoon.JPG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83326093" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> -- this is harassment, and has no value towards our goal, which is building an encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>When we face users like this, we need to ask two questions: 1) is this person here to help us build an encyclopedia? 2) if not, is this person actively interfering with those of us who are?

<dd>Just to throw in another sixpence, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Image_talk%7EUserHawkerTyphoon.JPG_9247.html" title="Image talk:UserHawkerTyphoon.JPG">this picture of me</a> is rather, well, petty. An interesting distraction from my daily routine though it was, I didn' really agree with it. I will admit that I did insult him in my edit summary after he mistakenly added a link I had removed. He then left a message (visible on my talk page), which I didn't take kindly to. I responded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Navy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=83064886" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Navy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=83064886" rel="nofollow">thusly</a>, which I admit was overly snappy. I then left the following message on his TP: "I removed the Geocities site, I didn't add it, and I don't need to be talked to like a piece of shit. Read WP:CIVIL, and double check your edits before you start acting yourself up as someone who knows what they're doing". I was not impressed, as you can see. But afterwards there was a period of reverting my edits, and of course placing a wronglicense tag on a picture of me, on the assertion that because I was in the picutre, I couldn't have taken it. In short, I am naughty, but he is contributing very little. It's not my place to, but I agree with the block. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 18:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that BhaiSaab was blocked for “a week” mainly due to <a href="../../../h/k/e/User_talk%7EHkelkar_0e67.html#Ahmadinejad" title="User talk:Hkelkar">User talk:Hkelkar#Ahmadinejad</a>. BhaiSaab has requested for unblock.</p>
<p>Here is the description of the reason for block:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been blocked for 1 week, mainly due to User talk:Hkelkar#Ahmadinejad. Since Hkelkar is a declared Jew, and Ahmadinejad is a well-known holocaust denier and virulently anti-Semitic, I can only presume that you are trying to provoke something from him. Add to that, a lot of edit-warring and general fighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BhaiSaab’s request for unblock is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahmadinejad is not anti-Semitic, so what's your problem? Does denying the holocaust automatically make one anti-Semitic and would <a href="http://nkusa.org/activities/demonstrations/2006092106/1-IMG_0902.jpg" class="external text" title="http://nkusa.org/activities/demonstrations/2006092106/1-IMG_0902.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> ever take place if he was anti-Semitic? Considering that Hkelkar goes sprouting opinions about Ahmadinejad <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-10-18_Indian_caste_system_36f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-10-18 Indian caste system">all over the place</a>, then you don't allow me do the same I would consider this a double standard. Another admin reviewed the same edits and I received <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=82389513&amp;oldid=82383414" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=82389513&amp;oldid=82383414" rel="nofollow">no block</a>, then you come in and look at the section on Hkelkars page without seeing what he did elsewhere, and decide to block me. Very irresponsible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, I should mention that I, for one, do not support Ahmadinejad in anyway. He can be very well, and in many cases rightly, criticized but fair is fair. I don’t agree that he is anti-semitic. Some may think he is but that’s a POV. As Bernard lewis writes anti-semtism has some marks:</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a well-worn platitude that we have all heard many times before: it is perfectly legitimate to criticize the actions and policies of the state of Israel or the doctrines of Zionism without necessarily being motivated by anti-Semitism. The fact that this has been repeated ad nauseam does not detract from its truth. Not only do I accept it, but I would even take it a step further with another formulation that may perhaps evoke surprise if not shock: it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Semitism is something quite different. It is marked by two special features. One of them is that Jews are judged by a standard different from that applied to others. We see plenty of examples of this at the present time. But there too one has to be careful. There can be different standards of judgment on other issues too, sometimes even involving Jews, without anti-Semitism or without necessarily being motivated by anti-Semitism… The other special feature of anti-Semitism, which is much more important than differing standards of judgment, is the accusation against Jews of cosmic evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we should distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. I haven’t seen Lewis mentioning new anti-Semitism in Iran but rather among Arabs. Ahmadi nejad is definitely anti-Zionist but not anti-Semitic. Ahmadinejad’s denial of holocaust, while definitely unjustified, only meant that why Arab’s should pay the price of west’s anti-Semitism. I think</p>
<p>Aside from these comments anti-Semitism shouldn’t become a catch phrase to condemn someone. There are academic scholars who share BhaiSaab’s view (like the distinguished academic scholars of Islamic studies, Montgomery Watt). These are his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do, however, think that the US is following a very dangerous policy in relation to the Middle East. The root of this trouble is that the US gives too much support to Israel. They allow them to have nuclear weapons and to do all sorts of things, some of which are contrary even to Jewish law. <i>Jewish families occupy Arab houses without payment</i>. That is stealing. I think that the US should be much firmer with Israel and put a lot of pressure on them, though this is difficult because of the strong Jewish lobby. Unless something is done there’ll be dangerous conflict in the Middle East. Such danger would be less likely to arise if all three Abrahamic faiths - Jews, Christians and Muslims - paid greater respect to what God teaches us about living together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would be thankful if the bhaisaab’s block could be removed. BTW, It seems that it was the other user who first brought up this issue and not BhaiSaab.</p>

<dd>I think we need to analyze this issue in its context. Hklekar was the initiative and that's important. BhaiSaab's comments were short and in response to his comments. And again, <i>I know that it might not be appropriate to write so in wikipedia,</i> but BhaiSaab has a POV which is not far from that of some renowned academics. But I agree that he shouldn't have wrote them on Hkelkar's talk page, but again, the initiative was Hkelkar. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:08, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed that context is important. However, this is not a POV block issue, it is a block for inappropriate comments, which BhaiSaab made, regardless of the context thereof; the bottom line is that his comments were inflammatory <i>even if he was provoked</i>. As such, I think the block was appropriate. I have to leave but, I agree that the comments of Hkelkar should probably be reviewed as well -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 06:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't justify BhaiSaab's statements, but I think the fair thing would be to block both.

<dd>To be frankly honest, in this sphere of editing it is basically close to worthless to police for mild personal attacks as it is more or less standard amongst this lot. I have already blocked HKelkar for the ad hominem Jihad references. So that leaves religious and racial inflammation, which BhaiSaab appears to have done. Hkelkar's personal jibe is more or less the norm in this area. Things which are meant to raise the ire of others by insulting religious figures or ethnicities is what matters more. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 06:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, anti-Semitism means a discrimination against the jews simply because they are jews.

<dd>Errr, this isn't about BhaiSaab's political opinions. It's about him making in this case an ethnically inflammatory jibe – irrespective of what anybody thinks of Ahmadinejad, he is inextricably associated (regardless of anybody's opinion of him) as being anti-Semitic, Holocaust denying and Hitler apologist and the use of the jibe could only be seen as an attempt at ethnic/religious bloodboiling. Such incidents as the Muhammad=pedophile comment by Subhash bose and the Allah=Pig comment by FairNBalanced have also been met with a one week block.</dd>

<dd>In the case of Hkelkar, the type of behaviour he engages in more or less the norm in this sphere of editing we are talking about. Both sides more or less assume bad faith, accuse the others of being out to get them, siege mentality, sarcasm, calling each other bigots, extremists, fundamentalists, arbitrary sock allegations etc. - see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EAMbroodEY_Fundy_Watch_984d.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy Watch">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch</a> and<a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Category%7EPatriotic_Indian_Wikipedian%27s_Guild_8d90.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Category:Patriotic Indian Wikipedian's Guild">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Category:Patriotic Indian Wikipedian's Guild</a> – as such this kind of behaviour is more or less ignored or else we would have no coverage of India-Pakistan religious politics articles. I have found it useless to police people for this type of behaviour (See my talk archives – if anybody wants to start trying to police this area properly, then they are welcome to try), so the line is basically when somebody makes racial insults or religious lampoonery akin to the Muhammad cartoons etc in an attempt at bloodboiling. In the case of Kelkar (a declared Jew) here, he has claimed that the other users are doing an “Ahmadinejad” on him – this is the standard in this area of editing - to claim that users with opposing POV have an agenda.

<dd>Well, I blocked Bose was new and I blocked immediately for that one, because that kind of inflammatory hate-speech isn't allowed. As for FairNBalanced, I had never heard of him and when Crzrussian reported it, I blocked immediately and asked people who appeared very familiar to adjust as necessary as I didn't have knowledge of what his past was. I am not comparing the records of BhaiSaab and FairNBalanced, I am referring to their singular acts. I asked people to modify FairNBalanced's block based on their knowledge of his past and nobody did anything. I don't feel that your comparison to N Korea is valid. People on WP repeatedly show their political opinions on political leaders all the time and nothing happens. I myself have been aware that BhaiSaab feels that Israel is illegitimate since August and declined a block request from his sparring partners. What happens here is that the uncontrollable norm of incivility, AGF violations, personal jibes, bogus accusations of misbehaviour and mudslinging etc in this area has crossed into the RED ZONE of making ethnic or religious jibes, which is where the magnitude of the block comes in.

<dd>Humus sapiens, thanks for sharing your thoughts. As far as I know anti-Semitism didn't happen in Muslim lands. Muslims were not treating Christians and Jews differently in any way, and traditionally Jews and Muslims were closer to each other than each of them was to Christians. It was only after the establishment of Israel that we observe this unfriendly conversations between Jews and Muslims. Otherwise, they were very close to each other, (and I would like to think they are). That's all I know about the history of anti-semitism. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Incorrect.My own matrilineal ancestors came to India from Iraq to flee the persecution of Jews there. This was in the 18th century. Read about the history of the Baghdadi Jews in India, particularly David Sassoon.Plus, the Jews in Pakistan were ethnically cleansed together with the Hindus during partition in 47. Read about the now nonexistent Peshawar jewsih community. Khushwant Singh's "Train to Pakistan" also talks about the ethnic cleansing of the Pakistani Jews.

<dd>All right. Let me add my own two cents. It is my goal to make scholarly and well-referenced edits to wikipedia.However, I am a human being with human flaws, including the tendency to get provoked. Bear in mind that it was BhaiSaab who started the talk page conversation regarding the holocaust denier who's currently running Iran.I reacted aggressively, and for that I am regretful.However, let me add some more facts.Prior to the talk page incitement, I was on #wikipedia-en chatting about an unrelated matter when Bhaisaab showed up and PM'ed me. He made some of the most frightening comments I had heard in my life, up to and including polemical attacks against Jews (not Israel, but Jews as a people). A lot of these statements are considered as anti-semitic. I did not react well to those statements and was in a very agitated state.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, since these statements were made off wikipedia, I ask that it be entered into evidence only as context. The context establishes that he intended to provoke me with inflammatory comments following the outcome of an edit war in another article (which, when thankfully stopped by administrator intervention, did not leave the situation in his favor). His support of the holocaust denier's call to eradicate Israel is a follow-up to that off-wikipedia conversation. When I first referred to the holocaust denier who's presently running things in Iran, I was addressing neither the user BhaiSaab nor the holocaust denier in the first person. Ergo, the comment, not directed at any specific person, does not count as an incitement. The only way it could have incited BhaiSaab was if he already had the view that any reference to the holocaust denier in a negative vein had to be responded to aggressively and with malice against the one who made the statement, and I cannot be held responsible for such an attitude.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Plus, regarding the apparently overwhelming support for BhaiSaab, I ask reviewers to dig a little deeper into the users who make such statements.Specifically, the block logs, and the temporal correlations with their reactions to the blocks and those of BhaiSaab in prior incidents.Also, glean from all this the apparent "Quid-pro-quo" system where BhaiSaab has similarly raised a stink when some of these users got blocked.Plus, cross-reference the users who speak "on his behalf" and the members listed in the Muslim Guild page, as well as the edits of these users in earlier debates, some of which are quite prejudiced against specific ethnic and religious groups and point to a level of hate that I had not expected to see on wikipedia. Correlate those ethnic groups to the ones involved in this issue, either directly or peripherally, and you will see that there is far more to this matter than meets the eye.</dd>

<dd>Actually, my statements were very carefully worded. I did not say that there was a connection between the Muslim Guild editors here and prejudiced comments. There are several users speaking on BhaiSaab's behalf. If A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C then that does not mean that A=B.

<dd>The logical fallacy in this claim is obvious if you can draw some Venn Diagrams.Your argument is problematic. The contrapositive of a logical statement WOULD be true if you have firmly established that EVERY INSTANCE OF set A leads to EVERY INSTANCE of set B, and you haven't established that at all.None of these so called "scholars" (with no background in mathematics or logic it would seem) have.(Netaji 11:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>The admins should take into account that <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> is systematically taking an extremely provocative attitude with people he disagrees, by constant edit-warring and playing with the 3RR rule (he provokes, waits for reaction, then provokes again, and let the counterpart edit a 3rd time, then he requests for blocking under 3RR violation). User <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> has triggered unumerables threats of blocking, personnal attack action etc. Just check his account and see. <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> never takes the time to elaborate his viewpoint on talk pages, he just can't argue normally and has no precise perspective.

<dd>This may have some relevance to Dollys (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dollys_47cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dollys">contribs</a>) who was on a campaign to recreate Brian Quintana (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brian_quintana_486f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brian quintana">Afd'ed here in February</a>), repeatedly recreating it, ignoring all messages about G4 and Deletion Review, until the article was salted. Apparently, there's some ongoing feud between Winick and Quintana about Zamora. Dollys' Talk page messages (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFan-1967&amp;diff=82573064&amp;oldid=82571766" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFan-1967&amp;diff=82573064&amp;oldid=82571766" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) assumed that editors involved were somehow involved with our "Jewish friend Judd Winick". <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know what good that level of protection will do, since it appears that the unregistered Dollys simply reversed the edit that implemented it, and Quintana is now a registered user who himself has begun re-inserting his vandalized edits. He has been given a warning on his Talk Page (without the red octagonal stop sign, mind you), and if this continues, something more decisive may have to be done. In addition, someone is also vandalzing the Judd Winick page, which is not similarly "protected" (though I cannot be certain it's the same editor(s). <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 01:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an aside, and on afterthought, I think I may finally understand what you're driving at with your characterization of categorizing an image as "not useful"...and I have to say, I fundamentally disagree with the assertion I think you're making. Categories are not designed to be useful to the <i>editors</i> of wikipedia, especially not to <b>experienced</b> editors...as useless as they are to the complete novice, categories are designed to be useful to readers untainted by the jaded stains of trollabused wikieditors. I think you'll be hard-pressed to find any "feature" of wikipedia that's designed to alleviate the strain on editors--everything is done to relieve strain on the <i>readers</i>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The commons category that contains the image in question (among others), is linked from the equivalent wikipedia category. Creating a page that only contains a category for an image that's already in the same category in commons is redundant (in my opinion). - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 08:11, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am under the impression that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> applies to all articles. When I come across a series of articles that have been on Wikipedia a long time and have no sources cited, I put the unsourced tag at the top under the belief that, in the long term, identifying and sourcing these articles is for the betterment of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Today I was adding the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame Induction list for 1980 on the blues artists inducted. I noticed that all of them were unsourced so I added the unsourced tag and clearly noted the reason in the edit summary. Now someone has systematically removed the unsourced tag from each article under the edit summary of "cleanup" or something similar, but without adding any sources.</p>
<p>How do I handle situations like this? I contacted the editor in question and she says I have no business adding such tags. She considers my tagging driveby tagging and made assumptions about my knowledge of blues and intentions. She noted that I was not part of the Blues Project and have no right.</p>
<p>My question: Is this ethical behavior on her part? She not only removed the tags without asking me my intentions (i.e. was I contributing to articles about the blues -- which I have as well as writing them -- and also her removing the tags under misleading edit summaries.</p>
<p>Should I just ignore this and leave blues subjects alone (back away from such situations is the more frequent advice I get) or is it in Wikipedia's best interest that unsourced articles be tagged as such to inspire those interested to improve the articles?

<li>Removing an unsourced tag without supplying a source is vandalism. Might I suggest a politely worded comment on the editor's Talk page, and ask why they did the edit they did?

<p>Part of the problem appears to be that you are conflating citing sources with a <i>specific style</i> of citation. You are tagging articles because they don't use &lt;ref&gt;, rather than because they don't cite sources. (Several of the articles that you tagged <i>did</i> cite sources.) {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsourced_589d.html" title="Template:Unsourced">unsourced</a>}} is for where there are no actual (usable) citations, of <i>any</i> style. The tag that you are looking for is {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_style_ebdd.html" title="Template:Citation style">citation style</a>}}. Before going overboard with <i>that</i> tag, note that citation style should match the breadth of applicability of the source to the article. This often leads to a mixed citation style. See <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Foster_7429.html#References" title="Vince Foster">Vince Foster#References</a>, for example. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article in question cited 7 sources, all listed in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_cfbb.html#References" title="Robert Johnson">Robert Johnson#References</a>. The problem here is not that sources were not cited. They were. A citation, giving the author, publisher, title, and date of a book, is a full citation. It provides the conventional information necessary for a reader to locate the source, which is what citations are for.
<p>The problem that you are addressing is not lack of citations, but, rather, which part of the content is supported by which cited source. In the absence of &lt;ref&gt; or Harvard-style notations in the body of the text, there are no explicit links between content and citation. That doesn't mean that the article is unsourced, however. It merely means that the exact source to consult for any specific part of the article isn't being spoon-fed to the reader. In many cases, the article can be improved, by linking sources to specific article sections, or to specific paragraphs, using &lt;ref&gt; or Harvard-style notations. But, conversely, note that there are cases where sources can encompass wide swathes of, or even the whole, article, and the link between citation and content really is best left at the level of the article as a whole.</p>
<p>Our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy merely requires that sources <i>be</i> cited, somehow. The (minimum) author+publisher+title+date information for (say) a book source, enabling readers to locate the book, must be present, in some fashion. The exact cross-linking of content and citations is a matter of style, some differences of opinion, and (anyway) what the cross-connections are in each specific case.

<p>(Having received an e-mail from Mustafa). While agreeing with all said above, I'd propose to the community that the block is lifted. I think that 48 hours for the first offense is way too much, and blocks are supposed to be preventative, not punitive; the crime he commited is serious and took a while to repair, but I don't think he was really aware how much it was against the rules. The thread above shows that Mustafa was civil and kind in response, as is my experience in contacts with him so far. I do agree what he did was way out of line, but I have a kind of understanding (if not sympathy) for what he perceives as team-tagging in Turkey and Greece related articles. He has simply chosen a <b>very</b> bad way to combat it, and (I hope) he learned his lesson. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 12:26, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry but I disagree. I may not be fully neutral on the issue, as I supported his nomination, but I feel that no tolerance must be shown to blatant attempts to disrupt a Rfa; IMO, it must be clear that all such attempts to carefully select the editors on a national base so to sink a rfa must earn a block.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 12:35, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly agree with Aldux. I also received an email from Mustafa Akalp which clearly shows he does not understand that what he did was wrong. He claims: "my messages is not include any comment to receivers for 'opposite vote'" despite the fact that his messages all included his strongly worded oppose in them. He openly admits he was trying to taint the RfA pool "I sent my messages to some users that possibly had problems previously with Khoikhoi" and sees nothing wrong with this action. He genuinely believes he has proved his case against the candidate despite not providing <b>any</b> evidence. This is an organized witch hunt against Khoikhoi where allegations alone are expected to be accepted as evidence of serious wrongdoing. We must take a firm stand against this. I strongly oppose lifting this user's block, and personally consider a 48 hour block to be too short. There is plenty of reason to believe Mustafa Akalp will continue to disrupt Wikipedia's processes and articles as he doesn't understand what he did was wrong and has open and clear biases. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 12:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would support shortening the block (I've already asked jossi to consider it), merely because I'd like to give him the opportunity to withdraw his comments from <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Khoikhoi_2_24dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Khoikhoi 2">Khoikhoi's RFA</a> before it closes.

<dd>I've just received another email from Mustafa Akalp in which he claims his spamming was intended to "reach consensus" and in which he makes the claim that "from a neutral POV, No body had accused with like an allege before, in the history of wiki. More than 10 different users have this allege. This allege will have a stamp on this Rfa for ever." (by "allege" he is referring to his allegation that Khoikhoi was orchestrating edit wars by email off-Wiki). It is clear to me that Mustafa Akalp sees nothing wrong with his actions, is intentionally attempting to blacken the name of an editor in good standing and is an inveterate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> pusher who will do anything to oppose those who are trying to maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. He has clearly declared that he will not remove his oppose contribution.

<p>I may dazzle you with this comment, since I am the one who initiated all this, but I'll go ahead and say it (and it is not a pretence of goodwill): Mustafa probably hasn't understood that vote-spamming is bad, because nobody explained it to him adequately (forgive me if I miss something). I suppose that if we explain why the community has decided that this practice cannot be tolerated, he will reform himself, as he shows many signs of goodwill (i.e. self translation of Turkish messages etc.) I am willing to proceed in doing this but maybe I am not the most welcome e-mail correspondent of his! I propose that someone does it, and if he is convinced to strike his unfounded comments from the RfA, he can continue to edit.

<dd>Sorry, but the problems with his actions have been explained to him in meticulous detail over email (he sent email to me, I replied). His response is above, a firm belief that he has done nothing wrong, is trying to maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and reach <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>. He genuinely does not understand the notion that spamming people known to oppose the candidate with his Oppose statement in the email might in some way bias the RfA proceedings. He also clearly stated that he intends that his allegations will leave " a stamp on this Rfa for ever". He simply won't admit any wrongdoing and has no intention of removing his comments. Someone this far from the vision of neutrality should not be participating in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 15:01, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He has been clearly told that his actions were wrong; and he appears to be unrepentant, and by his last messages, continuing his groundless accusations. As for that all this was done to "reach consensus", i.e. calling all the fellow Turkish editors he knew. He simply refuses even to remember of a simple thing called <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

I share Nikos' opinion on this.. He is a relatively new user and I don't think that we are being able to communicate with him effectively. I voted strong support for Khoi, OTOH I think that we shouldn't just bang up on people who might feel differently, especially if they r not native anglophones.. Instead we should try to improve mutual communication.. Believe me, there are much more serious nationalist POV pushers here, but they are native speakers and know their way around, so they never get caught; Mustafa however is relatively naive coz of the language barrier and hiw rookieness.. It would not be fair just indefinitely blocking him just coz of that. <b>As for the vote spam</b>.. He also sent me the same msg as email even though he knew I was a Khoi supporter beforehand from previous discussions.. I voted support and I find racist the suggestion or implication that all Turks r against Khoi's membership for whatever reason, TR users voted support more than oppose..

<p>I would like to request the rest of the users here to give Baris the chance to explain to Mustafa why vote-spamming is not tolerated in WP in his own language. Baris, if you don't know either, it is because the participation in the polls has to be from <i>all</i> wikipedia in a proportional way. Specific groups may have made up their mind for or against an opinion, and inviting <i>only</i> those that you presume will share your views is not permissible. As I responded to you in the RfA, it is not a matter of racism or IQ. It is a matter of POV, and there are many smart guys out there with a strong POV. In case the other users agree, you will have to convince Mustafa to retract his unsubstantiated accusations for Khoikhoi in the RfA, and acknowledge that vote spamming is not permissible. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 22:25, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to have to disagree with the inef. block. First off, I don't think it's appropriate for a first offense.

<p>Some months ago, I was forced to ban someone from the portion of the message board website, [www.nitcentral.com www.nitcentral.com], that I moderate for violating that site's rules governing civil behavior. This person responded by going on what another moderator described today as "a rampage", making countless off-topic posts on other boards to attack me or otherwise complain about his ban, and eventually attack the other visitors to the site as well, even after he was repeatedly informed that that site's owner had reviewed the issue and upheld his partial ban, and that he was to cease making off-topic posts to reignite that issue. His repeated refusal to do so, and insistence that he was a victim fighting for justice incurred the ire of just about every other moderator and visitor to the site in the process. He even attempted to get our server/host to shut down the site, and even followed me here to Wikipedia, where he created a single-use identity, <a href="../../../r/w/e/User_talk%7ERwetruck_cf21.html" title="User talk:Rwetruck">Rwetruck</a>, for the sole purpose of participating in an AfD to get an article deleted simply because I had created it, and lash out at nitcentral. Just today, <a href="http://64.33.77.146/discus/messages/110/23313.html?1161635970#POST331173" class="external text" title="http://64.33.77.146/discus/messages/110/23313.html?1161635970#POST331173" rel="nofollow">another moderator banned Rwetruck</a> from the site's "Kitchen Sink" (the area where visitors can discuss administrative issues pertaining to the site), for repeatedly ignoring his past warnings to cease this behavior, and informed me via email that Rwetruck flooded his email to excoriate me.</p>
<p>Now, Rwetruck is harassing me on my User Page, having made three posts just today, asking me to contact him, and demanding an "apology", and is even addressing me using my real first and last name, despite the fact that he knows I do not use my real name on this site.

<p>Shotwell has accused several editors of all being sockpuppets in retaliation for a question being raised about his relationship with another editor, both of whom are involved in various disputes on the following articles: <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocates_for_Children_in_Therapy_6452.html" title="Advocates for Children in Therapy">Advocates for Children in Therapy</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candace_Newmaker_0c22.html" title="Candace Newmaker">Candace Newmaker</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/a/Dyadic_Developmental_Psychotherapy_87fd.html" title="Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy">Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowlby.html" title="Bowlby">Bowlby</a> (User:Sarner was blocked for a brief period of time for similiar conduct on the Bowlby article). In addition, Shotwell has been engaged in a series of edit wars and revert wars and other uncivil actions that are not consistent with building consensus or reducing disputes. There is a mediator involved, but the mediator is new and seems over his head; he's not taken any action or made any recommendations and the issue is beyond the one page he "signed on" for. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 03:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

He mentioned in the summary the word - "Jawdropping". I removed the word and removed the tag. Then I informed him about me removing the tag. He retorted with this on my talk page - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83287140&amp;oldid=82947065" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83287140&amp;oldid=82947065" rel="nofollow">Personal Attack 1</a>. He said "<i>Repack that attitude, son, it's not going to get you far.</i>" He mentioned two more specific POVs, one which I promptly changed and the other wasn't a POV, for which I included a citation. I again told him that I'd removed the tags and rectified the matter. Again he comes and put the tags - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Machacek&amp;diff=83291279&amp;oldid=83175563" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Machacek&amp;diff=83291279&amp;oldid=83175563" rel="nofollow">this time he puts NPOV tag</a>. He posts on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83358582&amp;oldid=83301250" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83358582&amp;oldid=83301250" rel="nofollow">another personal attck</a>. He says "It's said often to me, kiddo, by trolls, the dishonest, the incompetent, and the fanatical." I add more references and remove the tags. He again comes and tags the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Machacek&amp;diff=83358632&amp;oldid=83357605" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Machacek&amp;diff=83358632&amp;oldid=83357605" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He then attacks me again - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83360283&amp;oldid=83358582" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:New_Rock_Star&amp;diff=83360283&amp;oldid=83358582" rel="nofollow">Third personal attack</a>. He writes "What IS your major malfunction?". I ask him twice, to mention the specific instances of POV, so I can remove/rectify them, but he doesn't reply.</p>
<p>These seem to be done in a totally bad faith. The <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a> is not interested in removing POV or doing any good. It seems he wants to put the tags just for the sake of putting 'em and harrassing others.</p>

<li>The article read neutral to me, so I've removed the NPOV tag. I've left the cleanup tag, and, while it may be a little superfluous, it's not harming the article, and may attract more attention to improve it.

<p>Before saying things like these and attacking other users as fanboys etc., the user must first take a look at my contribs. I am registered since last year. This is nothing but undue harrasment of other users. By the way, the idea of relation came after you tagged the article as advert. An advertisement would be done only by those people who are related to the subject or the subject themselves. And that's why I said that. I reiterate again, rectify your attitude, instead of treating everyone as trolls, wannabes, etc. (in your own words). --<b><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENew_Rock_Star_b619.html" title="User:New Rock Star"><font color="blue">N</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">R</font></a><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENew_Rock_Star_b619.html" title="User:New Rock Star">S</a> |</b> <b><sup><a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENew_Rock_Star_7caf.html" title="User talk:New Rock Star"><font color="brown">T</font></a></sup></b>/<b><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_New_Rock_Star_9a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/New Rock Star"><font color="red">M</font></a></sub></b>\<b><sup><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENew_Rock_Star_Trophy_Room_8be0.html" title="User:New Rock Star/Trophy Room"><font color="magenta">B</font></a></sup></b> 07:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've never seen anything like this, or at least been harrassed on here like this. The user above (and other IPs all beginning with 63.17) has posted psuedo vandalism-warnings on my talk page, reverted legitimate edits from other contributors on the Designer Whey Protein article in an edit war with myself and two other users (most notably <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a>). This user was improperly using <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_Value_36ef.html" title="Biological Value">Biological Value</a> article, which is fine, however he reverted attempts at fixing these sections using proper templates and the posted "vandalism" and "admin" notices on my talk page after reverting perfectly legitimate edits back after I'd fixed them. Finally this user is attempting to draw admin <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_S_8ece.html" title="User:Glen S">Glen S</a> into this by claiming that Glen knows about him, and by referencing/baiting him in his edit summaries. Then the user left the following edit on another editors talk page regarding this issue - suggesting that I may be sockpuppeteering the entire thing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_D.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83298842" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_D.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83298842" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>.

<p>Sorry this is such an unusual request. I'm attempting to keep a cool head, however my patience is limited. I've asked the user to stop, however providing boiler plate warnign is useless because of the mulitple IP addresses that are being used. And as you can see, from the last edit to my talk page, this user is not interested in doing anything other than what they want. Thanks in advance for any help. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 21:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Certainly, something must be done about this editor. Golbez had indefblocked him, pending that he come back and discuss things on his user talk (which he has), but he has just begun to repeat the same edits, the same disruption, and other such nonsense. Right now, he is sitting out a 48h 3RR block. —<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong">竜龍</a>) 07:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have just reverted all those. But the history of his userpage is fascinating. In his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:1QUIner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83402442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:1QUIner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83402442" rel="nofollow">very first edit</a> he suspects himself of being a Sock of JzG.
