<p>Miltopia is from Encyclopedia Dramatica doing what they do best. He was already indefinitely blocked twice for harassment of MONGO. I think he only got away last time because he deleted his LiveJournal entry. I recommend Miloptia be community banned. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 15:00, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I looked at the community ban list and it appears that Miltopia was trying to get the furry articles deleted because Encyclopedia Dramatica's article was deleted. Miltopia may have been doing this to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and may be the same person as the Hardvice on the community ban list who put up wikis for deletion after Encyclopedia Dramatica's article was deleted. Miltopia was particularly fixated on having WikiFur deleted because it is a wiki. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 15:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Doesn't seem much grounds for accusation of sockpuppetry here either. From the summaries in the edits leading up to the one linked above it seems clear that Miltopia was complaining that he was 'followed' to the page and reverted... that the reverted text related to Blu Aardvark doesn't really seem relevant. If the reversion had instead been on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<p>Everyone ignore DyslexicEditor here. I edited out links to articles not to be endorsed by Wikipedia s reliable, left comments on the talk page of that article AND the Wikifur article, and the editing out of Wikifur links has stood after many editors have continued the article since. His comments about me bringing "all these people in to delete the WikiFur article" is crap, since I was <b>the last voter</b>. His characterizations of my motives on the Wikifur deletion discussions are so false that it is inconvenient to explain why; instead, editors should read up themselves on what I said. To see my comments on why the article was deleted, please see these pages: the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WikiFur_%282nd_nomination%29_e6d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WikiFur (2nd nomination)">AFD</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_9&amp;oldid=88149199" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_9&amp;oldid=88149199" rel="nofollow">DRV</a> (in which I semi-argued for re-opening as a bad closure, despite endorsing deletion.</p>
<p>And please don't let MONGO hijack this header either. Everywhere where I'm brought up he comes around, looking for a way to get me banned, regardless of the relevance of his grievances to the situation. It's ironic that he says I'm stalking him when he shows up at everywhere I do to defend myself. Both MONGO and myself submitted evidence regarding my behavior during a recent arbitration "hearing" or whatever they're called. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Seabhcan_Evidence_823f.html#User:Miltopia" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Seabhcan/Evidence">His is here</a> (posted first, notice - MONGO had been editing this for a while before I ever showed up) and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Seabhcan_Evidence_823f.html#Evidence_presented_by_Miltopia" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Seabhcan/Evidence">mine is here</a>. ArbCom looked at both of them, did nothing to me (although Fred implied I should sorta continue to lay low, which I have) and found that MONGO didn't relate to other admins properly. So this has been dealt with.</p>
<p>In summary, here are the issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Miltopia may be socking as Aardvark or Hardvice - simply false. Already had a checkuser done. Ask Dmcdevit for details if you're unsure. In order for me to be either of these people, I would've had to have fooled far, far more cunning internet people with much less regard for privacy than Dmcdevit or any other Wikipedia Checkuser wielder.</li>
<li>Miltopia and the Wikifur deletion - old news also. Read the edits for yourself, DyslexicEditor is way off target. Don't flatter me by saying I can pull the wool over the eyes of two admins and get this deleted via trolling.</li>
<li>Miltopia, MONGO etc. - old drama. Been dealt with already. Stop bringing this up, MONGO.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now enough with the constant, drama-seeking shots in the dark. WE'RE DONE HERE. THREAD'S CLOSED. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 05:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you stop being brought up, then there will be no need to for me to mention the facts. I am sure the stalking of my edits by you is now over anyway.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:50, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the time I gave Daniel10 what is hopefully a couple of friendly but strong warnings.

<p>I could use a second look at what's going on at <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_metal.html" title="Glam metal">Glam metal</a>. One user in particular, <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">User:Deathrocker</a> - who is on 1RR revert-parole for past edit wars - has been removing content that is properly cited, but that is unflattering to the subject (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=97110384&amp;oldid=96992624" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=97110384&amp;oldid=96992624" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).

Anyway, I warned Deathrocker that given his history of edit-warring and the fact that the content was properly cited, he could be blocked if he continued to remove it. His response is <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html#Glam_metal" title="User talk:MrDarcy">here</a>, where he tries to wikilawyer himself around a block and threatens to try to have me desysopped if I block him. (He's also claiming a 2:1 consensus on the talk page, which I have to admit, I thought was funny.) At that point, it seemed that this was getting too personal, so I'm posting here to get a second opinion. Am I overreacting? Would blocking Deathrocker for violating the spirit, if not the letter, of his parole be inappropriate?

The information, added by one new editor is of little relevence to the section that it was placed in, and something about a similar and more widespread detorgatory term "hair metal" was mentioned in the very opening paragraph already. No other user who frequently contributes to the material on the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_metal.html" title="Glam metal">glam metal</a> article had stated that they agree with the inclusion of the sentence, they have only aposed it after discussion on the talkpage.</dd>

<dd>Enacting the same revert once per 24 hours just to stay on the right side of your 1RR parole is a textbook example of bad faith editing, as you're obeying the letter of your parole, but not the spirit. Given that the content you're removing is properly cited and germane, a block would seem to be in order if you persist.

<dd>The revert parole in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Deathrocker_ddb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker</a> was more complicated than a simple 1RR; it also included restrictions against doing more than two reverts to an article per week, or three per month. Looking at the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_metal.html" title="Glam metal">glam metal</a> page history, it appears that Deathrocker has been reverting the addition of the "hair farmers" sentence since at least November 25 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=90006676&amp;oldid=89871604" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=90006676&amp;oldid=89871604" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and has made at least 3 reverts to the page between December 7-11, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92627145&amp;oldid=92569857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92627145&amp;oldid=92569857" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (This revert was reverted: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92627145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92627145" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92822025&amp;oldid=92820976" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92822025&amp;oldid=92820976" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (sentence re-inserted: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92824512" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92824512" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92830964&amp;oldid=92826633" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=92830964&amp;oldid=92826633" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (sentence re-inserted with references: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92830964" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92830964" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=93522617&amp;oldid=93328156" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=93522617&amp;oldid=93328156" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (sentence restored the next day: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=93822457" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=93822457" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) and a more recent one on December 28. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=97110384&amp;oldid=96992624" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glam_metal&amp;diff=97110384&amp;oldid=96992624" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> He was blocked for 24 hours (by <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">User:Luna Santin</a>) on December 9 for these reverts to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_metal.html" title="Glam metal">glam metal</a>.

<p>Thanks to Wizardary Dragon for bringing neutrality to the discussions about me. I can assure you I do apologize for any mistakes I made in the past and I definitely intend to be a better Wikicitizen in the future and move forward from here. There are some issues with the article Barrett Vs Rosenthal {<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_v._Rosenthal" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_v._Rosenthal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_v._Rosenthal</a>] that I would really like help on. I would like people to really understand how this ruling in my favor, protected ISP's, blog owners, and users who post things written by other people. Wikipedia can be mightily protected from nuisance lawsuits as they host the words of others. I have not been able to keep the final words in the article. I'm going to re-open that topic on that page. I hope I have some support. The plaintiffs in this case have been spreading information about this case that is clearly unfactual. This paragraph found on page 39, are the final words of the 41 pages. From the Supreme Court decision, I quote: <i><b>"As the lower courts correctly concluded, however, none of the hostile comments against Dr. Barrett alleged in the complaint are defamatory."</b></i> Unlike those who wish this removed, I feel there was definitely a purpose for Judge Moreno to have added this. All I want as an editor, is the verifiable quote from the Supreme Court of California quote <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I would also very much appreciate being able to edit my own user page and have my links restored where they have been systematically removed. There are some excellent articles on this case: <a href="http://news.com.com/How+Web+providers+dodged+a+big+legal+bullet/2010-1030_3-6144464.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.com.com/How+Web+providers+dodged+a+big+legal+bullet/2010-1030_3-6144464.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> [<b>Perspective: How Web providers dodged a big legal bullet</b>] and <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1164103520282" class="external text" title="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1164103520282" rel="nofollow"><b>Califiornia Supreme Court Shields Web Republishers</b></a>.

<dd>Ilena, I think the best course of action is to fully address the issue of learning wikipedia's "ropes" so to speak before you try to make broad, sweeping changes anywhere. I can look into any links you provide, as I have said on my page. However realize that change rarely happens instantaneously but rather tends to take time.

<dd>I think it is important to note that the issue of neutrality is an important one. Recall it was a lack of such neutrality and calm thought that lead to the sticky situation you were in previously. I would suggest what would be best is simply to present the links and your opinion on the talk page, and let a person less involved in the case (on either side - including yours) add in what they feel is pertinent. That is why I offered to look at them, since I really have no interest in either side, except insofar as I want to diffuse this conflict.

<dd>This case is mentioned in the article on Barrett. In that article, Ilena's request for the concurring opinion's statement is included in the description of the case. There, is is notable. It was removed from the article on the case itself, because the notability there is somewhat different. <i>Barrett v. Rosenthal</i> is notable for the precedent it set regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (a federal statute). The case is rightfully called a 'landmark' case that may end up in the US Supreme Court. However, the case is not notable for dicta in the concurring opinion. I understand Ilena's wish for rebuttal there, but the case is properly described. If it would make her feel better, however, I see no problem with including that statement. It is a correct statement.Jance 23:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Mauco has responded on the userpage, and it has turned into a threaded discussion on the <i>userpage</i>. Both users have been blocked multiple times for edit wars, by me and by another admin.</p>
<p>I asked Marius yesterday to remove the comments from his userpage, as I knew this would only cause trouble, and appears to violate <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F" title="WP:USER">WP:USER#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F</a>: "using userpages to attack people or campaign for or against anything or anyone is a bad idea."

<dl>
<dd>That doesn't really matter in my mind. The user is constantly removing good material, without explaining their edits on the article's talk page (where their edits are opposed by several editors), and without responding to questions on their own talk page. If the reason is because they don't know English well enough to respond or do anything other than remove content, then I think we would all be better served by the user editing the localized version of Wikipedia in their native tongue. As it stands now, they are disrupting the English Wikipedia; whether their edits are in good faith or in bad faith is for the most part irrelevant.

<dd>Thanks. A few comments: I think part of the problem is that SoLongBaby's command of English may be poor, judging by his use of the word stub in his edit summaries and on the talk page (I can't figure out what he means by "stub" at all). I do think he understands much of wiki policy since he's avoided a sockpuppetry situation and actively avoids 3RR problems. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 01:33, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, as a defense, I will state my evidence that I have not been uncivil:</dd>
<dd>I would like to ask Just H to provide a diff showing uncivility. The only comment I made on the debated MfD that could be considered remotely uncivil would be "Why, what a sweet personal attack, Just H. A perfect attempt at making me uncivil, but an unsuccessful one. And please state exactly what policy forbids me from making a "demand"?", which, while sarcastic, is not uncivil. Considering it was made in reply to a comment by Just H, "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, Yuser - you're not in a position to make demands in this discussion.". I really don't see why <i>two</i> people have accused me of making "demands", namely Just H and Physicq. I ask these two people to provide a diff showing a statement in which I made a direct demand, and if I did so I am sincerely sorry. But meantime I feel Just H is merely fueling the conversation, and would politely suggest he did not make false accusations and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a>.

<dd>As someone who hasn't participated in the Mfd, but did go and read it, I think its something to do with your "tone". You're not breaking any rules, no one's gonna slap any templates on your talk page, but I do sort of see what they're talking about. I'm only mentioning it because you seem confused about why you're getting under a couple of editors' skin, and I think I see why. If you want specifics and diffs, I'll work some up and put them on your talk page. Cheers. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's not the fact that it was an essay in projectspace, but the fact it violated both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/k/WP%7EATK_b196.html" title="WP:ATK">WP:ATK</a> in its original state. Fresheneesz later modified it to a milder viewpoint and wording. Also, I don't think arguing over this is going to get anyone anywhere; let's just go and improve some articles like the essay suggested.

<dd>Several editors in that debate contested your view of ATK.
<dl>
<dd>It appears they contested my views without providing any policy to support their own.

<dd>The initial version could be argued as violating the ArbCom ruling against Fresh - see for example the comments about deleting "supposedly" non-notable articles (no, not at all "supposedly", they are not notable, and consensus says we can delete them, for good and sufficient reasons, and Fresh's opposition to that was assessed as disruptive). You'll note that I closed the debate to end the pointless drama, rather than deleting the essay. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So opposition to consensus in an <i>essay</i> is considered disruptive? Are you implying that <i>any</i> comment Fresheneesz makes on notability is automatically a disruption? The <i>facts</i> here are clear: this was an essay from the start and Fresheneesz never claimed it to be anything more; he promptly toned down a few slightly aggressive phrases when others requested him to; and he moved it to user space well before the MfD completed. There was no disruption or wrongdoing whatsoever on Fresheneesz's part. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 23:58, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

They state that articles that violate any CSD can be speedy deleted again; however, it's my understanding that this is written with recreation in mind, not undeletion.

<dd>I think I deleted most of these. I don't have a problem with this, as long as it's in good faith. At least one was AfDd not speedied, and restoring that was probably a mistake so I fixed that; it can be DRVd if he wants.

<li>Restoring an article is not an admin activity. Anyone can do it from the browser cache, Google cache or Waybackmachine.

<p>Why not just take them to AFD? Whenever someone so much as peeps at a speedy or prod deletion I did I just undelete and AFD it.

<dd>Good point about rules, though personally I'd rather just be cordial rather and avoid ruleslawyering&#160;:) For example, CSD requires a certain amount of judgement, and I make mistakes every once in a while on a snap judgement on whether an article contains an assertion of notability, or even after someone contests a deletion I might still think it falls under A7 but am always willing to open to wider discussion. My personal interpretation is that A7 and prod are for non-controversial deletions; if there is a good-faith objection then by definition it's not completely non-controversial and requires wider discussion. I don't think requiring DRV appeals for A7 deletions is really necessary because it's just another layer of bureaucracy; it's meta-discussion about deletion whereas AFD is the proper non-meta discussion. Just saying how I do things&#160;:) <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-31 03:13Z</small></i></span>

<dd>Well I proposed that requests for speedy restoration at DRV should be channeled through to AfD as soon as one admin agrees, but so far there is no consensus for it, so the "ruleslawyering" seems to be the consensus position. Part of it boils down to status quo bias. In DRV you need consensus to recreate, in AfD you need consensus to delete. Also in this case here we don't have a simple speedy reversion, we have a full-bore restoration of multiple articles to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> per comments ("help fight the deletionists") at Wikiproject Dead Malls above and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=DavidLevinson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=DavidLevinson" rel="nofollow">edit summaries</a>.

<li>Consensus should be gained, rather than wheel-warring. If I was an admin now, I'd take it to deletion review, then get consensus before undeleting it to re-AFD.

So I exposed that biased action on the village pump misc area on the English site. finally, this administrator Ran added the word <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> on 22:50 2006-12-29, then wrote back: "Also, the Chinese Wikipedia article on the People's Republic of China has an entire paragraph on human rights, in which Falun Gong is mentioned as well.

<dd>To sum up the situation however:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>SummerThunder was banned about two weeks ago at the Chinese Wikipedia, for making personal attacks and spamming the Village Pump;</li>
<li>Since then, he has become convinced that he was blocked for political reasons, and arrived at the English Wikipedia to complain;</li>
<li>While reading through his complaints, I noticed that one of them was that the Chinese Wikipedia article on the People's Republic of China did not mention Falun Gong anywhere;</li>
<li>I thought that this was a legitimate problem, so I went to the Chinese Wikipedia and changed it, while at the same time informing SummerThunder in a reply to his complaints;</li>
<li>He evidently did not see it, and continued claiming that Falun Gong was not mentioned in the People's Republic of China article on the Chinese Wikipedia.</li>
<li>I corrected him on that, again.</li>
<li>He accuses me of "lying", and comes here to complain about me.</li>

However, Sugaar and one other editor insist that the English Wikipedia should use the official name/spelling of the town in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_language.html" title="Basque language">Basque language</a>. The majority of editors do not agree and this view appears to emanate from a political view — the spelling "Guernica" originated with the Spanish language rather than with Basque — and not with Wikipedia policy. This conflict with policy has been pointed out to Sugaar at length. He has been accusing me and others of bad faith, while we feel that the reverse is true. A RfC has failed to resolve this and as it is "either/or" situation, I don't think mediation will work. If possible, I would like an admin to take a look at this and comment.

<p>I find it rather insulting towards my country that <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrince_Stephen_6159.html" title="User:Prince Stephen">User:Prince Stephen</a> has placed a fake Danish royal title on his userpage. Will somebody please either remove it and the associated "royal title infobox" or persuade him to do so of his own free will? Such nonsense is probably legal under Danish law, since the modern Danish criminal code seems to only ban actual physical attacks on members of the royal family or of the lawful government (§§ 112, 115 and 133)<a href="http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/htm/baggrund/tema2004/bryllup/511.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/htm/baggrund/tema2004/bryllup/511.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> but I still find this highly insulting towards my country. Just for the fun of it, I did a little investigation. His edit history begins with a claim to a Prussian title, which he suddenly changes to a Danish one. I don't know why. On his personal webpage <a href="http://danish-royalty.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://danish-royalty.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> - to which he links - he also claims to be of German royal stock, but he can't even spell the Prussian royal house <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenzollern.html" title="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> or the name of his presumed Prussian ancestor correctly. The latter name would be "Heinrich". Other oddities include that he claims on his personal webpage to belong to the House of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg_ead1.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg">Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a> which would mean a decendent of King <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_IX_of_Denmark_cd26.html" title="Christian IX of Denmark">Christian IX of Denmark</a> (king 1863-1906), but this is one of the best described families of Europe - and naturally no proof is presented. No proof on the internet either. He claims to decend from a 5th Duke of Saxe-Weimar named "Harold Earl", but no such man is listed on the relevant German list: <a href="../../../../de/s/a/c/Sachsen-Weimar_%28F%C3%BCrstenhaus%29_c160.html" class="extiw" title="de:Sachsen-Weimar_(Fürstenhaus)">de:Sachsen-Weimar (Fürstenhaus)</a>. Not surprising since these are not German names. The user also bases his fake Danish title on presumed decent to <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dietrich_of_Oldenburg_e57c.html" title="Dietrich of Oldenburg">Dietrich of Oldenburg</a>. Apparently he hadn't noticed that this man never ruled Denmark, but that his <i>son</i> was elected King Christian I.</p>
<p>The user has never made any actual edits to Wikipedia, only to a userpage and one post on a talk page. If anybody wondered, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Danish_Throne_9f44.html" title="Line of succession to the Danish Throne">Danish law</a> limits claims to the Danish throne to direct decendents of King <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_X_of_Denmark_6bc4.html" title="Christian X of Denmark">Christian X</a> and Queen Alexandrine born in lawful wedlock. The title Prince / Princess are reserved for such persons, which is why the "Counts of Rosenborg" lost their princely titles the moment they married commoners. I find such fictional titles insulting towards my country and they don't belong on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 13:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to ridicule me, but with all due respect, Sir(e), I see no reason to accept insults towards Denmark's leading family this way. I don't expect you to recognize / appreciate the level of respect that surrounds this family in my country. Wikipedia cares about protecting the rights of copyright owners, howabout protecting the rights of those that hold an official title protected by centuries of history? I thought we had rules about inappropriate usernames / self-promovation just for starters. It seemed rather apparent to me given that <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUsername_b87d.html" title="WP:Username">WP:Username</a> e.g. prohibits trademarked names and names of religious persons "which may offend other people's beliefs". Danes have more respect for the royal family than for God. You might not find it insulting, well standards are different in different societies. But thank you for informing me about the other page, I did not know of its existence. Btw, Majesty, allow me to humbly suggest upgrading your "HRH" to "HM"? That would seem more in tune with ancient tradition. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 14:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, it's clearly a troll to me. It's also distorted the talk page by rewriting previous edits to skew the conversation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97345124" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97345124" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>]. (Incidentally, this edit is unintentionally funny [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97370191" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97370191" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>] and proves, I think, we're dealing with someone who's simply pulling our leg). But edits like this [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97370086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97370086" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>] do strongly indicate we're dealing with a banned user with a grudge operating surreptitiously. I suspect their intention is not to improve this encyclopaedia. Nevertheless, as you say, only minor damage so far. I just thought admins might want to keep an eye out for it. If it continues of course, further action is in order. I'm particularly concerned about the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre_5893.html" title="St Bartholomew's Day massacre">St Bartholomew's Day massacre</a> page since it used to be a notorious POV battleground until I and some other users fixed it up. I don't want a war re-erupting there just because some malcontent has it in for ArbCom.

<li>I doubt whether it is worth the effort to try to figure out who this is. I've semi-d the St-Barts page; I'm reluctant to semi the talk page, where tolerance is higher. I suggest that you try to ignore him. If he trolls two or three times in the next few days, repost here and an admin will look at semi-ing the talk page temporarily. As for his blathering on his own talk-pages, I think we should let him spout. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 15:56, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seems a fair solution. If he starts putting a load more nonsense on the St Bart's talk page, I'll probably just delete it if it's offensive. At least he gave me a good laugh with that one particular edit.

<p>I need some help with someone who claims he is a new editor who is belligerent, abusive, and continually reverts. I have made edits to Barrett-related articles that are sometimes 'for' and sometimes 'against' Barrett (not that this is a good label). He is not just accusing me of being biased, he is being abusive.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97434587&amp;oldid=97433578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97434587&amp;oldid=97433578" rel="nofollow">here</a>] FIRST: On <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a>, an editor tagged the article with COPYRIGHT violation, which asks editors not to edit. Curtis has nonetheless edited it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97437165&amp;oldid=97400703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97437165&amp;oldid=97400703" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud" rel="nofollow">is the tagged article</a></p>
<p>SECOND: I objected to this editor's massive edits on <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a>, deletions etc. He has added huge edits that I tried to summarize. (After he reverted about the tenth time, another editor tagged the article as a copyright violation.</p>
<p>This is an example of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97402369&amp;oldid=97401519" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud&amp;diff=97402369&amp;oldid=97401519" rel="nofollow">response to his accusation</a>.<br />
Here is his response - I can't find the diff, but it is on the talk page:</p>
<p>... As to your concerns about the length of the article, I would suggest that if you lack the concentration to read and understand a simple article like this, perhaps you ought not to be trying to edit it. --Curtis Bledsoe 21:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is this allowed in Wikipedia? How insulting can one be?</p>
<p>Here is the direct quote from the source he cited:</p>
<p>"Although some forms of mercury are hazardous, the mercury in amalgam is chemically bound to the other metals to make it stable and therefore safe for use in dental applications." I wrote this: "Some forms of mercury are toxic to humans, but the NCAHF argues that the form used in dental fillings is not. [7]. "(the citation is from CDC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Could this have been more accurately written? Of course. And I did change it. When he objected, I changed it to what he wanted, Immediately. And <i>after that</i>, he ridiculed and insulted me, and was abusive. I feel overwhelmed with this, and amazed that no admin has already stopped it. Also, stopped the 3RR, and the editing after a Copyright tag has been placed..</dd>
</dl>
<p>THIRD: He continually reverts now on another article (he followed me to this) --<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_implant&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_implant&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> After there has been extensive discussion on this sentence, and on the entire article.</p>
<p>He will not discuss it on the talk page.<br />
And he is abusive.</p>
<p>Please, I ask anyone just to read all this over -- this is nothing less than an attack: constant reversions, unwillingness to discuss on talk page and unwillingness to be civil by ridiculing, belligerence, insults etc. I do not know what to do.Jance 01:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm looking over the situation right now. I'm not an admin, but I can help a little with comments and such since I understand the policy here pretty well. I've already commented on the 3RR report the other user created. I would say that the other user seems mildly incivil from what I've seen so far, but it's nothing terrible. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildnox_f5f1.html" title="User:Wildnox">Wildnox</a><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWildnox_93bf.html" title="User talk:Wildnox">(talk)</a> 01:22, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This has been a constant barrage, aggressive reverting, incivility (insults, ridicule, accusations etc), following me to another article and disrupting that when it has already been contentious...I say 'disrupting' because it is pretty evident he does not care to discuss this on the talk page, or anywhere else. Again, he is constantly reverting. Jance 01:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>MORE by Curtis, just a second ago. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=97440657&amp;oldid=97408731" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=97440657&amp;oldid=97408731" rel="nofollow">here</a>. No court found Rosenthal had libeled Barrett. On the contrary, three courts (at least) found she did <i>not</i> libel Barrett. For Curtis to make this statement, in an article on Wikipedia, is in itself libel. Rosenthal is not a public figure. Fortunately, someone promptly removed it. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with Ilena, it is not appropriate (or legal) to make this kind of statement. It is undeniable libel, since there are <i>court findings on this very point</i>! This is breathtaking. But this is the problem with this editor. He is indiscriminate about what he says, and about whom. He is abusive. This is all within one day!!!Jance 01:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That wasn't just a second ago, that edit by curtis was over two hours before your comment above.

<dd>I believe Rosenthal may be a limited public figure, at least in the context of Usenet, so I don't know if Curtis's defamatory statements constitute libel. (Count the number of her posts on misc.legal.) But the statements there still clearly violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 03:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, possibly. However, since the articles have stated the court's decisions clearly, this statement on its face demonstrates "actual knowledge of falsity" and "reckless disregard for the truth." Therefore, I believe that this would meet the standard for even a public figure. Not that it matters now. The real issues are what are going on at NCAHF now. I have backed off and now Curtis is attacking Ronz. Jance 04:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate all of your comments. In brief, Curtis's recent edit on Barrett Vs Rosenthal placed this knowingly false statement on Wikipedia: "...even though the information she posted was libelous."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=97575644&amp;oldid=97408731" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrett_v._Rosenthal&amp;diff=97575644&amp;oldid=97408731" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.</dd>

<dd>This level of propaganda is one I have been dealing with on Usenet, blogs of the losing plaintiffs, the healthfraud list <a href="http://www.ssr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?1:iis:4294967295#b" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ssr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?1:iis:4294967295#b" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and various other medium since the Ruling. The losing plaintiff/attorney even posted a probably libelous comment similar to Curtis'. In fact, when I came to Wikpedia earlier this month, it was because the article on Barrett vs Rosenthal was basically unrecognizable and totally biased to the losing plaintiffs. I would appreciate any support to get the final words of the opinion on the article. Judge Moreno wrote (page 39) <b>As the lower courts correctly concluded, however, none of the hostile comments against Dr. Barrett alleged in the complaint are defamatory.</b><a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>.

<dd>Curtis has been consistently abusive towards Ronz, Ilena, me, and probably others. I might note that any person that makes an edit (like what Ilena described above), after the article and others like it that the user has read, has knowingly (or at the least recklessly) defamed Ilena. I don't care how inflammatory or outrageous Ilena's previous comments were. The issue has been adjudicated. It wouldn't matter if Ilena was a private,limited public or public figure. This is defamation and is actionable.
<dl>
<dd>If Curtis is not reigned in, there will be many more problems on Wikipedia. I have watched him edit other articles, and he is similarly insistent on having his own way, regardless of others' input. However, he has been absolutely abusive on <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v.

I accept there may be a debate to be had on the talk page about sources - but Mitsos' starting position here was that he wanted factual information removed from the article - and when sources were presented, he adopted a new entrenched position in line with the Greek nationalist / neo-nazi agenda pushes constantly on Wikipedia. I accept you may not want to be involved in this - but without an admin watching this, all articles Mitsos edits will constantly be subject to a barrage of edits by him seeking to push his POV. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 23:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</blockquote>

<p>I will note that Curtis has again reverted <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a> - this is after every single editor on that talk page had reached a consensus that his edits were unencyclopedic. He is flatly ignoring every other editor. I would like to see something done about this. This includes editors who like Barrett, those who are neutral, and those who dont. So why is one user allowed to run rampant reverting at will, despite a 100% consensus that what he was adding was inappropriate, long etc?Jance 19:39, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>instantnood quite clearly pointed out that edit, and also pointed out that it occurred after having performed the move twice. I agree that discussion should continue there. Also, I doubt the "disabling of redirects" was intentional, my guess is that the user didn't know that placing text in front of the #REDIRECT breaks it. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 23:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, that appears to be a dynamic IP controlled by Comcast Cable. An indefinite block is likely going to hamper other users in the future, once the current user is assigned a different IP address and someone else is assigned their old one. I'd consider scaling the block back to maybe 1-2 months? I'm not sure whether any further action has been taken in past similar incidents, such as contacting the ISP or law enforcement. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 02:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like a good block; it looks like it may be a dynamic IP, however, in which case there would be little practical difference between 24 hours and indef (which is why we try to avoid indeffing IPs, generally). Might be worth shortening it, with a clear understanding that continued such behavior would lead to an "on-sight" block. WHOIS suggests the IP range in question is 69.240.0.0/12 -- very wide range, so sprotection might be a better option, if they're persistent. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 02:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's Comcast, you won't have to worry much about the IP changing. As a former Comcast customer, I once had an IP for a year and a half (if not a little more), and if not for the fact that Comcast pulled out of my area, I'd almost certainly still have that IP. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">jgp</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/g/p/User_talk%7EJgp_a553.html" title="User talk:Jgp">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jgp_810b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jgp">C</a></sub> 02:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hm, fair enough. It looked like the IP only had edits for today and back in... May, I think it was. I still prefer "awhile" to "indefinite," with IPs. 24 hours, a week, or some such.

<dd>No, you may <i>have</i> the IP for that long, but if you were to wilfully reset your modem, you would be assigned a new IP. That is, the banned user can, relatively at will, get a new IP. Even supposing that he did not do that, the unlikely 1.5 years is not the same as indefinite and, even if he did not get a new ISP 3 months from now, he will be dynamically assigned a new IP sooner or later. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment from an experienced Comcast usr: Comcast assigns IP addresses to cable modems based on the MAC address of the outward-facing port (Router/Ethernet card). I've reset my modem (And had it force-reset by Comcast) well over 10 times and still have 68.39.174.238. Depending on the user behind this IP, they may have ditched it immediately or they may still be on it. 68.39.174.238 19:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The MAC address that a router uses can be manipulated.

<p>Thank you to all for your comments and for taking care of this. One minor question: My understanding was that "indefinite" blocks were meant for two situations, the first being when there is no plan to ever unblock, and the second being when an admin has not determined how long it should be. Since I did not know how long it should be, I made it indefinite and then asked for discussion here.

<dd>I received two e-mails from him after the block. In the first, he denies being the same person, which I believe is a lie, based on stylistic similarity and completely identical behavior and interests, and then he goes on to wiki-lawyer about his behavior not really constituting making a threat and so forth, which we've heard before on the various talk pages. In the second mail he admits to making personal attacks, although he says he was previously unaware of the policy, and he promises to respect the block, and not make future personal attacks.</dd>

<dd>I don't really see <i>any</i> reason to unblock him. We are talking about a very disturbed individual who views people disagreeing with him as "use of force" that must be stopped "by any means necessary" and has already demonstrated by both committing the action and writing in defense of it afterwards that yes, he <i>does</i> include 'making people fear for their lives' as a morally acceptable means. Why on Earth would we allow such a person back on Wikipedia? I hope no one's under the impression that he could not find equally vicious means to conduct the persecution he already announced as being justifiable "by any means necessary". If anyone is, I'd like to point out that this is also the user who previously posted as 69.180.7.137 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.180.7.137.html" title="User talk:69.180.7.137">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.180.7.137_ba05.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.180.7.137">contribs</a>) and under that IP his antics not only include a similar pattern of personal attacks but also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMonty_Hall_problem&amp;diff=40722310&amp;oldid=40721476" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMonty_Hall_problem&amp;diff=40722310&amp;oldid=40721476" rel="nofollow">altering another contributor's comments</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMonty_Hall_problem%2FArchive_3&amp;diff=41465856&amp;oldid=41068983" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMonty_Hall_problem%2FArchive_3&amp;diff=41465856&amp;oldid=41068983" rel="nofollow">falsely accusing <i>them</i> of having altered <i>his</i> comments</a>.

<dd>when csloat testifies that my addition of a single, relevant cross-link is "disruptive," that is a chracterization, albeit one that fails the standard of reasonability. it's a relief to see that you don't endorse that charaterization. but when he asserts that i "refused to explain" my "actions in talk", it is - i really don't want to use harsh language - but it is a lie, and one which can be exposed by simply reviewing the talk page.</dd>

<dd>In reviewing this block, and Giano's history, I don't think this was likely to be an effective block (from the standpoint of reducing overall drama and increasing overall effectiveness).

Warning for <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">PA</a>, and blocking for PA, just don't work with Giano. I therefore decided to unblock. I expect that will not be a popular view among everyone but I think we really need to try other measures.

<dd>Giano, wiki pages are a written medium. You don't need to be able to pronounce someone's name in order to spell it, especially when it's written in front of you. (I don't know whether you pronounce your name Gee-ar-no or Gy-ann-o, but I don't need to in order to communicate politely).

<dd>I've no comment block itself. (Although for the record, I have not been party to, nor aware of, any pre-block discussions.) However, I think there are real problems here. Lar is right, blocking Giano is counter-productive: it neither causes Giano to halt the incessant incivility, nor does it reduce the general wikidrama. I blocked him several months ago (as a then uninvolved admin) and learned that lesson the hard way. That's why I asked Jimbo to <i>unblock</i> him the other day, However, there is another problem that is increasing tension: that is the general perception that Giano is getting special treatment. He is incivil and aggressive, but every time he is blocked a number of users point out the (no doubt also real) problems with the blockers, the medium and the discussion, and do anything rather than say that <i>Giano needs to knock it off</i>. (Sure IRC can be a problem. Perhaps the exact thing that Giano is blocked for isn't quite right. But there IS also undeniably a huge problem with his behaviour - just go through his edits and look!). Personally, we really need to move on from here. We need people to stop blocking Giano, and stop provoking him (and, yes, he has sometimes been trolled). But we also need him to stop provoking them - and stop spoiling for a fight (why on earth was he on my talk page today, I've stayed clear of his for weeks??). Please, rather than fly at the other side, can Giano's friends try to influence him for the best? And can those who are seen as 'opposing him', please knock it off. The only other end-game here is that the temperature rises until someone leaves or gets banned. I, for one, don't want that. Let's all try to de-escalate this thing whilst we can. I'm willing to work with anyone who's willing to see wrong on all sides.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 23:15, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Once more: is everyone sniffing glue? (Note: that's a question.) Am I around the largest single group of computer-connected blushing violets in the world? Your responses to someone being catty are to <i>block?</i> You must be joking or ... or... invoking-standards-you-don't-believe-because-you-are-upset (there: I avoided maligning anyone). Cyde has been absolutely horrible to me. Kelly has been to me. Some of you have been. <i>Life goes on.</i> Do you support censorship of television, too, so that there are no scenes that could be upsetting? If you want Wikipedia to have a society and community of editors, then that means having one where people are occasionally snippy, occasionally unpleasant. No, you don't get to block them for that. Please, please, please read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. In "extreme cases" a block might issue. An extreme case, is, oh, an adenoidal 16 year old writing, "You are a child molestor" someplace permanent. It is not, "You have an unpronouncable name" (which isn't even a <i>personal</i> attack in the first place) or "I don't expect Doc to understand not talking behind peoples' backs." The standard you are all applying would have nearly every one of you yourselves already blocked for things you have said in the past.

<p>Until now I had respected Naconkantari as a one-man anti-vandal army and one of the <i>good guys</i>.

Now I see him make a <b>highly questionable block</b> of a highly regarded writer, who has been subjected to an obvious campaign of harassment in an apparently sucessful attempt to drive him away. The actions of Chairboy and his like really don't surprise or disappoint me...they are merely pageboys with ambitions above their proper station.

<dd>And Luna Santin, it would seem. I suppose I ought to clarify my (our?) position: I have no problem with, and fully support the continued existence of, an administrator-only IRC channel to which access is restricted to trusted users. I have used the administrator-only IRC channel in the past and found it to be very useful. I do not endorse the activities, past and current, of <i>certain users</i> (not everyone) who frequently use this channel. I am concerned by the lack of civility displayed by certain users on both "sides" of the debate. I recognize the issues that this causes and the need to remedy them – and I will accept changes to the way in which the channel works in order to achieve this, including but not limited to the introduction of public logging if necessary. However, I do not believe that the channel should be removed altogether, as I believe that such a move would impact those who use it in a legitimate and productive manner – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 00:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I can add a few words, I really hope nobody will be taken by the whim to reblock Giano, as if this really would solve anything. To begin with, I'm quite shocked with the block by Naconkantari; it almost seems to me, and I'm really sad to have to say this, that there is a sort of impulse to block good editors, while blatantly uncivil and pov-pushing editors are completely ignored, and this explains why the talk pages of many articles have fulled themselves with tons of hate speech. Giano may have a difficult character, but he's perfectly capable of collaborating in bettering articles, which is, IMO, the only thing that wikipedia exists for. All this speaking of blocks hasn't done anything in easying relations in the community; quite the contrary. May I give a small piece of advice? Lets cut it here, and start editing - after all, shouldn't it be our chief occupation. I hope I haven't offended anybody with this message; if I did, I can only say it wasn't my intention, and I'm sorry.

<dd>As I say above, I do not endorse the activities, past and current, of certain users of the administrator-only IRC channel. I have not responded to these activities before now primarily because of a desire to stay uninvolved with such things, remain uncontroversial, and avoid stirring up conflict where none exists. I am presenting my opinion now in response to the conflict that <i>has</i> arisen, as I feel that at this point I should at least attempt to engage in discussion. I have argued a number of points, outlined my experience with the issue and made my position quite clear above. I don't intend to talk extensively about individual people unless they approach me first. However, as far as Kelly Martin is concerned, I have already said that I don't endorse some of her actions. When I first used the channel, Kelly Martin was an administrator with whom I had no previous contact; I certainly saw no reason to question anything at that point. Had I been particularly eager to participate in a dispute, I may well have chosen to question that and many other things at the same time as I decided that use of the IRC channel was no longer a good idea – at 05:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC).

As an uninvolved editor, the whole thing is a shame, but in the end, no matter how valuable an editor somebody is, they still have to play by the rules. The rules are flexible to a degree - productivity counts, circumstances such as prior baiting count - but one can't continually and flagrantly violate them again and again without eventually having to face the consequences. And regarding the role of admins in this and other cases - without naming names, I will say from personal experience that admins who 'adopt' users and defend them to the bitter end are doing just as much a disservice as those who will cut a user no slack at all. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 01:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe that the reblocking of Giano was a characteristic expression of abuse of power. I endorse Aldux who asks here anybody to show a little more respect for the great editors of Wikipedia and let them do what they now best: edit! I think that actions like Giano's reblocking for a minor reason (I have difficulty to qualify his wording as a PA) achieve only one think: to make Wikipedia poorer and to deprive it of the persons who can make it richer.

<ol>
<li>Officially we are told that the 'Wikipedia' IRC channels are considered to be 'off Wikipedia', outside the control of ArbCom, and actions there thus not subject to results here (and vice versa). So... theoretically someone on IRC could call a Wikipedia user every manner of foul thing, give out their real life name and address, and openly hold a discussion about how best to murder them... and no action could be taken against their account on Wikipedia itself (though hopefully someone would at least notify the police). Correct? Yet... paradoxically, if someone took a log of any IRC discussion and publicly posted it on their equally 'off Wikipedia' web-site their account could then be banned. Is it me or is there a logical contradiction here?</li>
<li>I have in the past seen an admin chortling on IRC about how he just blocked a "douche" for being incivil to him... seemingly oblivious to the irony. This, and the fact that incidents like it happened nearly every time I opened the channel, is why I no longer use IRC and never asked for an invite when the admin channel was created. Now we are hearing (admittedly disputed) accounts of things which seem like incivility, failure to assume good faith, turning Wikipedia into a battleground, et cetera in reference to the admin channel. <i>Are</i> there standards of behaviour for the IRC channels? If so, where are they documented? Or do we really have a situation where users on Wikipedia are required to abide by all these behavioural niceties or be blocked... but admins are free to toss civility and cooperative fairness to the wind on an IRC channel where the only action forbidden is revealing what went on there?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think that anything openly discussed in IRC or an outside web-site ought to be treated exactly as if it had taken place on Wikipedia... it is the same community and pretending to a fictional separation between 'PhilbertWikipedia' and 'PhilbertIRC' doesn't change that. If there are disputes about what was really said (no log available) or the actual identity of the person saying it then <i>that</i> can (and should) be excluded, but otherwise there seems no reason to create this dichotomy where 'on Wikipedia actions' are discussed and coordinated free from any sort of 'on Wikipedia consequences'. Failing that, IRC participants should be held to the same standards of behaviour as on Wikipedia... you make personal attacks, start planning how to 'get' someone, or call for 'vote stacking' on IRC then you get blocked from using the IRC channels just as you'd be blocked from Wikipedia if doing so there. If we are going to continue this 'separation' then the two areas should <i>at least</i> require the same standards of behaviour to be allowed to participate. Otherwise we create a situation where 'IRC users' can (and do) behave in fairly despicable ways and 'Wikipedia users' can (and just did) get blocked for anything which looks like it <i>might</i> be a civility violation if they get mad about it. Its inherently a double standard and it is wrong. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, I was never comfortable with the notion that off-Wiki behavior doesn't count. There are problems with identifying who's who and gathering decent evidence though.

<p>I'm actually in agreement. It never made sense to me that someone's posts on Wikipedia Review didn't have real consequences in here, especially when those posts were really vicious. Oftentimes, we have the problem of identifying who is who, but a lot of people have admitted both here and there that, say, "Yalej" on Wikipedia is "Yalej" on Wikipedia Review. Actually, this has started to change. We've already seen Everyking lose his sysop bit over something he said on Wikipedia Review, and I think we're headed down the path of being held accountable for all actions that can be proven. "That can be proven" is the hard part, though. If it is something said in the #admins channel and a dozen people have logs, then yes, it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>but</i>, if it is something said in private correspondence, either email or IRC PM, there's really no way to prove it unless the person has been signing their statements with PGP. I could see #admins logs being used (privately) by arbitrators (although posting them here for everyone to see would be a big no-no), <i>but</i>, I could never see private conversations being used, as those are utterly too easy to fake. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 15:41, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The #wikipedia channel is 245 people at present; this doesn't qualify as private, and I wouldn't oppose people being held accountable for death threats, posting private information, etc there (although they would be kickbanned from the channel <i>anyhow</i>). #wikipedia-en-admins might be similar, might not be. Regardless, what people say in PM or in email is their own business and should be left that way. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 15:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry if I misunderstand what you're saying, but evidently one of us is somehow confused by the indenting, and/or you haven't read my comment below. My above comment is in reply to Cyde, not Fred Bauder or CBD. My comment is intended to flow from the last sentence of Cyde's comment. Please read them together. Cyde says that he "I could never see private conversations being used, as those are utterly too easy to fake", and I am agreeing with him and elaborating on the notion that conversations between two people can never be trusted. In other words I am asserting, for that reason and others, that the idea of accountability for a user's actions <i>cannot</i> be applied to a private conversation. Cyde asserted the same thing. So we are in <i>agreement</i> with you, yet you indented your reply below mine; if your comment is directed at someone else I'd appreciate it if you could make that a little more clear.

<dd>I could be completely misunderstanding, but Cyde's comment sounds to me like "private conversations can be easily faked and that's a shame", implying that if they weren't so unreliable, we'd <i>want</i> to hold people accountable for them. Your comment seemed to follow from that, that they can't be trusted and that's a shame (though that idea isn't really as implicit). Anyhow, my point wherever the indenting is: even if we <i>could</i> reliably prove what's said in private conversations, we <i>shouldn't</i> and shouldn't want to... Private conversations are private... I discuss Wikipedia with my mother, but it's not anybody's business but hers and mine what I say. All this "OMG PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WIKIPEDIA IN IRC" seems to be heading in a very thinkpol direction. (So perhaps I'm not addressing anyone in particular, just the desire to unearth all IRC logs we can muster, whether we should or not.&#160;:]) --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 22:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regard to "unearthing" logs, I am of course completely against that and don't even understand why it is being discussed. I have no problem with <i>introducing</i> new rules to the channel which specify that conversations will be publically logged, or logged in a secure location accessible only to a certain group of people (e.g. ArbCom, or all administrators); I won't discuss the merits or drawbacks of such options now. But when I used that channel I did so on the understanding that conversations were not publically logged, as I'm sure many other uninvolved people have done. I may have made statements there which I do not wish to be available to the Internet in general. (And no, I'm not talking about a conspiracy to bring down Wikipedia, or whatever it is). If you look further up (and down) this page, you'll find other statements to this effect. I may possibly accept a review of channel logs by, say, the Arbitration Committee (though right now I'm disinclined to trust them with anything for various reasons), but public release of logs is a violation of privacy – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 23:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No, we should not be blocking people for their actions at Wikipedia Review, or WikiTruth, or Encyclopedia Dramatica, or <i>their blogs,</i> or LiveJournal, or e-mail, or wherever and whatever else they do. To even think so is nuts, and it <i>appears</i> that Cyde would have it. We can only have accountability for IRC (in either sense -- as a rationale for a positive action or as a rationale for an injunction) if we have logs with solid integrity or ops who will always act consistently in enforcing a set of guidelines of behavior. We have neither. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Geogre, actually Cyde (and Fred) did not misconstrue me. I <b>was</b> talking about outside websites too. If this makes me "nuts" then so be it. To take an example 'from the other side'... I recall that Kelly Martin wrote something on an 'off Wiki' website which had people up in arms a while back. That wasn't on Wikipedia and or a 'Wikipedia affiliated' site (IRC channel or whatever)... but there was no question that it was Kelly. Should it really therefor be treated as 'separate'? Can people just 'hop over the wall' and break any Wikipedia rule they like... knowing that it is going to have the same impact as if done ON Wikipedia, but is now 'shielded'? Had Kelly been (to take the absurd example again) talking about killing another Wikipedian would it really make sense to say, 'Nope... no action can be taken on Wikipedia since this happened elsewhere'? You are absolutely correct about the dangers of this being abused to go 'hunting' for connections between 'WikipedianA' and 'OffWikipedianB'... but I think that can be prevented by disallowing such sleuthing entirely. In short, unless the Wikipedia account has identified the off Wikipedia account/text as being their creation it can't be used against them. Short of that it could never really be proven and is far too open to abuse... e.g. someone could go to MySpace right now and create a 'CBDunkerson' account and pretend to be me. That's probably the biggest reason this 'wall' exists, but there are plenty of cases where identity IS known with certainty. The invite only IRC admin channel being probably the clearest example. Even then the authenticity of the text would be an issue too... if there were only two users on the IRC channel (or they opened a private channel / conversed in e-mail / talked on the phone / et cetera) then there is no way to prove what was really said if they have different stories/logs/copies/whatever... but if their accounts match or there are a dozen matching 'witness statements' then that ought to be treated as fact. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>CBD, my objection to Kelly's blog was not that she had it, although I find that twisted, personally, since I can't imagine blogging about my web actions, but to its <i>inclusion into Wikipedia deliberations.</i> I.e. if someone goes off to MySpace and pretends to be you, it's kind of irrelevant to us, unless that <i>translates</i>. We have control over ourselves, but we can't get into the game of determining who is the "real" person or the first person, or the anonymous person, etc. If we do that, we go crazier sooner. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, nothing to fear except a ban from IRC for posting channel logs, which as of this moment is (as far as I am aware) still a rule for that channel. Perhaps people don't want the hassle of having to deal with that? I have logs from a few months back myself, but so far all accusations I have heard that mention a specific date refer to periods that I do not have any record of, mainly periods within the last two weeks (I stopped using IRC December 6, anticipating that something like this would come up); so even if I were to post anything, it would apparently demonstrate little.

Also, except for people who can go to IRC and make an announcement every 5 minutes for an hour and reach many more people. Also, except for the fact that Giano was not randomly "spamming." He was, instead, telling interested parties, which is not talk page spamming at all. (If four authors worked on an FA, and it went to <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>, all four would be contacted. Giano got up to 11.)

<dd>Because you folks were ready to explode. You wanted to continue to be hypocritical about things, submit that Giano is the problem, to never admit that the issues are being unaddressed, and because he had decided that you were timorous or small minded, I expect. Guess what the response was: the very worst possible thing: another "Yeah, tough guy, we'll fight you!" block. How dumb do you have to be to try to play playground games like that? The guy edits away nicely, but no...that's not enough...no...every comment has to be watched so that there can be a chance to piss him off. He gets pissed off. Congratulations! How much skill did <i>that</i> take? Take a look at my talk page right now. Should I have blocked Ling Nut for that personal attack, or should I be attacked for my giving as good as I got? Well, what Giano was facing was his own comments getting blocks, while the people insulting him in the first place were just "doing their jobs." Yeah. Well, if we want our volunteers to stop volunteering, that's easily accomplished.

<dd>First of all, I'm not sure who 'you folks' are. Don't assume that everyone who disagrees with you, or is critical of Giano is part of some overarching cabal. Who is ready to explode? Who is a hypocrit? My take on this is that we have a vicious circle caused by everyone (you and me included) jumping to the barricades to defend our side, and unable to say that there is fault on both sides. One side feels the injustice of the way people are out to 'get giano' and they thus defend him to the hilt, and look for the faults in his critics. The other side feel the injustice of Giano getting special defence and a perceived 'free pass', and they thus looks for ways of convincing the community that something needs to be done about the Giano problem. Oh, we'll disagree about which is the cause and which the effect, but each is feeding the other. Everyone needs to calm down and ask themselves: 'why are intelligent people, who we assume are acting in good-faith, and certainly are committed to this project, feeling the way they do? Why do they perceive the situation to be like that? How can I help to address their perceived concerns, even if I think they are baseless?' If we can do that, perhaps we can get to a place where Giano stops being incivil, and people let him alone. Then in a calmer atmosphere, we might look at some of the perceived structural issues that have got us here. But, while everyone is playing the 'we're the victims' blame game, there is little chance of that.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks for sharing it. But I'm not seeing the connection here. Kelly started an RfC on her conduct, and wanted input. She left a very neutrally worded message on the talk page of (I believe) everyone that had voted in her ArbCom candidacy to then, positive or negative, letting them know of the RfC, and soliciting their feedback. I think people do things similar to that all the time. It seems pretty on-wiki and pretty in tune with soliciting input from others and improving ones self (all things you presumably approve of? Or do you prefer off-wiki communication? I'm not quite sure). I'm not sure I see the connection to what Giano did yet, except that both incidents were posts to a number of posts to talk pages. Did Kelly repost things when they were deleted? Did her comments contain excerpts of material that, per WMF policy as I understand it (although I could be wrong about it, I've been told it is WMF policy, not just freenode policy), isn't supposed to be republished? Did the comments contain anything other than a polite request for input? I in fact was thinking of doing that very thing on the meta talk pages of all the voters (including yours, which, strangely, was the tipping vote that sealed my loss, and turned up at 23:59 on the very last day of the vote, when there was no possible way to address whatever concern you had... just out of curiosity, how did you know to turn up then and put in the tipping vote? I looked for on-wiki communication on your talk and didn't see any...) in my recent failed steward candidacy. If I post to everyone's talk page that voted in my steward candidacy politely asking for feedback on what I can do to be a better candidate and more worthy of the post next year, is that behaviour equivalent to what Giano did, in your eyes? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 05:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar, Kelly's request went only to those who had voted 'oppose' (reverse chrono order). It was the first RfC I ever got, and had already left (unanswered) questions on her ArbCom questions page, and a comment with my vote.

Sorry I didn't have time to comment — it was mostly about your approach to the "anal sex" trolling; it's unlikely you could have persuaded me that, at the very least, you needed more time.

<dd>Nonsense. The "bang" is annoying the people he calls IRC fairies who say amazingly nasty things on IRC and then say, on Wikipedia, "Prove I ever said it, and, if you do, I'll block you!" He called the bluff. That's a bang. He was "leaving anyway" because of the moronia of the "Giano on civility parole," which was instigated by the "owner" (I think he indicated that about himself) of the en.admins IRC channel and signed by him and two others who are very protective of en.admins. In other words, it is painfully clear that this is not a "screw you I'm gone" as much as an ongoing argument about en.admins, where three or four non-administrators spend vast amounts of time and even have ops, and the proponents of those people and that channel would rather use their administrative powers against Giano, who is not an admin, than ever, ever, ever debate the issue on Wikipedia. Using that as a rationale for blocking is just more evidence, not any part of any solution. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Giano has problems with civility, for which a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Giano_placed_on_civility_parole" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">potential remedy</a> has been proposed. But the block log doesn't mention civility, it describes IRC log spamming. Now that is a rule of the IRC channel, so I highly recommend they block from their channel whoever it was that leaked, if they can work out who it was. But our rules are not their rules and their rules are not our rules. If some of the big kids have a rule that what happens behind the shelter sheds stays behind the shelter sheds, that's their business but it doesn't bind the rest of us, and it doesn't give them permission to take on-wiki action however angry they are. It has been claimed that 'privacy' has some legal protection. (Does that constitute a legal threat? I don't really know and I care less.) I am not a lawyer, but a quick check of a law book seems to make clear that information is confidential only if there is a contract between all concerned parties in place, and if the information is genuinely confidental and if steps have been taken to keep it so. None of those conditions appears to apply here, at least, not as regards Giano. (This may well be different in your juristiction, please consult a real lawyer if you need to.) I don't have all the facts and I could be wrong but it appears on the surface that Giano has been blocked for breaking a rule that we don't have.

<p>The block is for mass-messaging, apparently in an attempt at a disruptive good-bye, and would be warranted whatever the content of the message. If a user states "I'm through here anyway, but lets have some fun" and then proceeds to post something eleven times despite being told to stop and with no indication that he would stop, the appropriate immediate response is to block the user until such time as he, being reasonable, stops, or until some other decision is made regarding the matter. That the content of the message was an "IRC log" is important only in that the user specifically intended the message to be disruptive. It was not a mass message about multi-licensing contributions or an RfA thanks; it was not a naive user vote canvassing or inserting borderline external links; it was not a malfunctioning script or someone who hastily or accidentally did not see the message about stopping; it was not a chocolate-chip cookie recipe or a Christmas card with a fair use image. There are other reasons why posting what was supposedly the verbatim text of a private conversation is probably wrong, but the solution to a dispute over those reasons is not to then engage in the disputed activity to the extreme, while edit warring and spamming. As far as I can tell, he would have continued to repeatedly post this message, across several pages and on the same pages over again, and he was doing it to be disruptive. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 12:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Ignoring posts to his own talk page, I count about 5, not 11, though I agree he probably would have continued. So, hardly a mass message, and they weren't distributed at random. But yes, disruptive, or at least intended to be so. I trust you'll forgive me for assuming you blocked him because of the content? You probably should have dropped a note here once you'd made the block. But otherwise, yes, good call.</dd>
<dd>OK. For better or worse, the cat's out of the stable door. Does anyone claim the logs, however they've come into our possession, are not a true and accurate representation of things that have been said? And either way, does it matter? #admins is not official. The logs don't seem to contain any admision to have commited any deadly sins on wiki. Only a claim to the ability to do so, but that's hardly the same thing. Absent evidence of foul play on wiki, does anything else need to be done?

<dd>I'm not saying it shouldn't have been deleted two weeks ago - that was a good call.

<p>If there was good-faith discussion going on, can someone please undelete, move the discussion, and then redelete the page (which will at that point be a redirect), and inform those involved in the discussion where to carry on their discussion. If there is good-faith discussion going on, it doesn't matter where it is taking place, deleting it is just rude. It is equivalent to someone coming along and ripping up a piece of paper that you were writing a letter on, or pulling the plug as you are writing an e-mail. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is the use of the page by ED members and others to whine, complain, and generally troll, and without any other use for the page there's no point in us trying to moderate it. Why are we even thinking about it? There are dozens of salted pages which no-one wrings their hands over. Why are we bending over backwards trying to avoid the impression of vindictiveness because we're deleting pages that failed to meet policy, just because the subject was the cause of massive disruption and the premature exit of some of our best editors? Anyway, this is not deletion review, discussion about undeleting a page deleted per policy and previously endorsed belongs there. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sam Blanning, I would suggest that the point is <i>harm reduction</i>. There are dozens of salted pages that don't periodically re-erupt into questions about "why is this deleted?" This one does re-erupt, and the point of the explanatory text JzG wrote is to prevent further re-eruptions. If the deletion didn't come across to many as vindictive, we wouldn't have to take steps to demonstrate that it was actually deleted for boring policy reasons. Our job is to prevent drama, and a policy-based explanation, <b>caked in salt</b>, does that better than a simple {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedtalkpage_726e.html" title="Template:Deletedtalkpage">deletedtalkpage</a>}} template. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what JzG meant is that you actually deleted an already salted page and salted it again. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Nandesuka&amp;page=Talk%3AEncyclopedia+Dramatica" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Nandesuka&amp;page=Talk%3AEncyclopedia+Dramatica" rel="nofollow">deleted and salted</a> the page a day before you did, JzG then changed the {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} to an (IMHO) useful explanation of <i>why</i> the page was salted. This was then deleted and salted once more, probably because you didn't realize that it was already a salted page. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 17:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
