<dd>Question: Should we investigate a semi-block, analogous to the semi-protection? I.e. disallow unregistered and new accounts from an IP address/range, but allow established accounts to edit.

<p>Alright, right after the block expired I decided to go check Recentchanges again and found voila! about thirty edits from this range, all vandalism. I've now blocked 207.200.116.0/24 for three hours and will look for any edits from the range that didn't get reverted. I know this is not typical dealing with AOL, and the vandal clearly wants to be blocked to invoke a DoS; however, I think this may be the only solution. It looks to me like a vandalbot that clicks back on immediately following unblock and edits at quite rapid rates--no doubt an attempt to force a change in policy regarding AOL. I'm off to bed right now, but please review the block, and I wish the rest of you luck in dealing with this. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:57, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, I put up the vagina image for now; good thinking. Jimbo's pic I think probably should not go on there, and the other one he only used a couple of times. I still doubt that this three-hour block will effect many people at this hour (the IP's being used are all North American, currently 4am in mountain time), but the bad image list may well help with the next attack, which I anticipate occurring at around 12:52 (UTC). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 10:22, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually, the BIL wouldn't be used for vandalism, but if it really is a bot, it can slow it down connsiderably, and may well take out the desire to vandalize, if the individual has to sit and reset the image constantly. Obviously, any non-"bad" images that are added should be removed ASAP; I'd say a standard of 15 minutes or so, moving up the scale as the blocks did. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 10:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Be aware that blocking the vandal <i>never worked anyway,</i> if it is at AOL, and blocking all of AOL is the only way to stop it. Since we don't have a method of allowing logged in users to post while AOL is blocked, blocking the whole ISP will inevitably mean blocking several admins. At the very least, those admins will unblock themselves, which will open a single IP for the vandal again (and if it's a -bot...). The point being that blocking is not effective. Again, <i>blocking is not effective,</i> if blocking for&#160;:15 didn't stop the -bot, then blocking for 3 hours won't work (if it's a bot, it's a bot). Further, if you're finding more vandalism while there was being blocked, it didn't work. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:31, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The attack is still ongoing, as mentioned previously the vandal's new MO includes inserting random text, as well as images. The most recent image to be used is Image:Breasts1205.jpg. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 16:56, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not entirely sure that it is a bot. The vandal did not return immediately after the 15 minute range blocks were lifted, and generally operated in continuous periods of a couple of hours each. His/her MO also changed throughout the periods when he/she was active going from image vandalism to inserting gibberish and back again.

<dd>Netscott, see my talk page. See yours. See Brian's. The goal should be to stop all this spam, on the Guild (which I also watch, as you know), on WikiProject Islam (which I also watch), and on user talk pages (which for several of the posts I'd reported, I watch) in <i>all directions.</i> Your tone suggests that you're attempting, once again, to join BhaiSaab and Amibidhrohi in turning this on me, as you did in the FairNBalanced report. I spammed no one. I reported a spammer. It's not about me, except insofar as I'm sick of it occuring. You are muddying an attempt to get <i>non-partisan</i> clarity by raising absurd question of which spammers were right, or whether recipients of spam (across my watchlist, in my case) are invalid reporters thereof. Let's stick to the subject, and get some clarity on the spam guidelines which can apply to all.Timothy Usher 10:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Timothy gets very edgy when certain users contact each other on the matter of supporting each other or an article.He takes a strong stand against 'solicitation', and has made a virtual crusade of littering talk pages (article and user both) and project pages to voice his disdain for it, in all its forms. By strange coincidence, he particularly expresses outrage when said users happen to be Muslim. Actually, to my knowlege he only vocally complains in those particular cases. He's less outraged, downright appreciative in fact, when he RECIEVES and SENDS OUT messages urging the very same type of 'solicitation' he complains about here (and just about everywhere else): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Marriage" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Marriage" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Category_for_deletion_vote_you_may_be_interested_in" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Category_for_deletion_vote_you_may_be_interested_in" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Israel_Shamir" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timothy_Usher/Archive_4#Israel_Shamir" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pecher#Israeli_Apartheid_debate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pecher#Israeli_Apartheid_debate" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pecher/Archive_3#Battle_of_Mu.27tah" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pecher/Archive_3#Battle_of_Mu.27tah" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 03:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never spammed, Amibidhrohi/His excellency. The "strange coincidence" you report is a simple result of the fact that there is a "Muslim Guild", but no "non-Muslim Guild". It is increasingly tiresome to hear your denunciations of editors as enemies of Islam, particularly in light of your own history of anti-Semitic remarks made under your old username (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amibidhrohi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57300558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amibidhrohi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57300558" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, for starters) This report is about Guilds and spamming, not about your religious biases, so let's keep it on-topic, alright?

<dd>Read your first sentence. It's about a user, and user pages. I don't want to violate WP:Civil by calling you a hypocrite, but the dictionary gives me few other words with more flattering tones.

While going about my editing and discussion concerning topics of an Islamic nature I originally stumbled upon: Image:Islamist_hypocrisy.jpg on his user page. A short while later he uploaded: Image:Deadzarqawi.jpg with an editorial comment that said in effect "Zarqawi meets his 72 virgins.". He subsequently changed his user page to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FairNBalanced&amp;oldid=58067798" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FairNBalanced&amp;oldid=58067798" rel="nofollow">this</a>. His last flame-bait was to upload Image:I_found_Allah.jpg an extremely vile and inflammatory image that equates God (specifically <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>) with a pig and that despite its obvious photoshopped nature he added to the image summary: "snapped in June 2006". Outside of his userpage he's been posting inflammatory statements and has frequently shown a lack of good faith relative to the topic of Islam.

<dd>Dumb question: why should a pig with the Arabic word for God be treated any differently than a goat with the English "God"? Of course I'm fully aware of why, but let's be upfront about it.

<dd><i>Of course</i> it should be deleted, but we're not discussing the deletion here - and as you know I am the one who nominated it for speedy deletion, with your assistance - but the block. I'm uncomfortable with the way everyone's lining up to be the first to not be biased against Islam - not that we should be - but there's something about this that strikes me as unseemly, and kind of fake.Timothy Usher 12:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Timothy, your commentary is puzzling. This isn't about being the "first to not be biased against Islam" but rather about making an encyclopedia and encouraging neutral point of view and discouraging signs of lack of good faith <i>towards those ends</i> no matter what shape or form relative to a given subject such acts should take. Speaking for myself I happen to strongly edit in the realm of topics on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and so it's natural that I should become aware of demonstrations of a lack of good faith on both sides related to that. Perhaps my only difference from other editors is that I actually do something about this. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 12:11, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Timothy has brought up a legitimate point: why FairNBalanced was singled out for punishment, while other editors blatantly abusing their userspace are left alone? I also want to know why this happens. Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 12:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Does Faisal attempt a neutral point of view? Does BhaiSaab? Does Amibidhrohi? Does JuanMuslim (username, hello?) Does Striver? Does Raphael1? Does Farhansher? Does Autoshade? Does Mystic? These are just a few of the editors we see around these articles who don't bother with the faintest pretense of neutrality, and my understanding has been that we're required to accept it as an alternative point of view. It's pretty silly to make allowances for Middle Eastern religious fanaticism while not tolerating the juvenalia of western right-wing discourse. Were there a policy that editors had to be reasonable, or be hauled before ANI, someone should have let me know, as it'd have saved me and several more scholarly editors than myself (most notably Pecher, the single most valuable contributor to this space by a longshot) a whole lot of trouble.Timothy Usher 12:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well stated Tony Sidaway as I was about to make that point myself. To say that all of the others that Timothy Usher has listed were demonstrating a lack of good faith is very much a straw man arguement. Also regarding the part about "be hauled before ANI", you may not be aware of it Timothy Usher, but it is common policy here that when an admin gives this kind of block to someone their block is posted here for review by fellow admins. Since that's pretty standard stuff it seemed logical to me that <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a>'s block should undergo such review as well which is why I posted it here. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 12:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not a matter of <i>good faith</i>, Netscott, but of approaching subjects neutrally. Faisal (for starters) comes on talk pages and blathers on about his love for the "Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)" (see recent discussions on <a href="../../../m/u/h/Talk%7EMuhammad_736f.html" title="Talk:Muhammad">Talk:Muhammad</a>) - can we really believe he intends to treat the topic of Muhammad <i>neutrally</i>? And he's hardly alone in this. Tony is saying that this is a valid topic for the noticeboard, of which I wasn't aware.Timothy Usher 12:52, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Timothy Usher, please quit while you're ahead. Without excusing Faisal's (or anyone else's for that matter) demonstrations of lack of neutrality your comparing that to someone like <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a>'s uploading of an image (and <i>falsely</i> labeling its copyright status) of a gray-black pig scrawled with Allah written in Arabic across its body thereby labeling it <i>as</i> Allah (note the file name) is preposterous and borderline asinine. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 12:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello everybody. I am the person who blocked FairNBalanced for a week.

I deleted the picture on sight and then blocked him for one week, as I quickly glanced at the contribs list and saw from first glance that he was contributing seriously - for the most part, there was no obvious vandalism and so I only blocked for 1 week and said that I was fine if someone else amended this based on their previous experience and FairNBalanced' behaviour. If he has a long history of bad behaviour, by all means remove my block and reinstate a harsher block.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 00:08, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having taken a closer look at this editor's provocative edits to his user page, I'm going to recommend an indefinite block. As Bishonen points out on his talk page, he had also placed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FairNBalanced&amp;diff=58067798&amp;oldid=58066989" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FairNBalanced&amp;diff=58067798&amp;oldid=58066989" rel="nofollow">this</a> item on his user page, in which he showed <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Frederick_90fb.html" title="Ivan Frederick">Ivan Frederick</a>, a US Army Military Police Staff Sergeant, sitting on a bound prisoner and described it thus:</p>

<dd>This technique is known to relax the erector spinae muscles in the mid back. The side to side motion (not evident in this still photo) is purported to pacify the mind and calm the soul. This extra service is offered to prisoners who have not slept well due to the extra-firm mattresses in their cells. It should be noted that this terrorist did not leave a tip-- this is considered to be bad etiquette for a nice massage.</dd>

<p>There comes a point at which an editor's conduct is so <i>beyond the pale</i> that the community cannot accept that he is using Wikipedia for honest purposes.

<dd>I must admit to mixed feelings about the idea of a permanent ban. Users who are blatantly trying to flame-bait Wikipedia tend to be sources for serious disruption that impede what we're here to do which is build a great free encyclopedia. There is no doubt that <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a>'s user page edits are blatant examples of flame-baiting and there is no doubt that he's made inflammatory statements on talk pages but there is also no doubt that he appears to have made positive contributions to the project.

This sockpuppet seems to be created for equally harsh flame-baiting but in an opposite sense. Is this sockpuppet to be used as a tool towards disruptive ends or is it some sort of a black humor device to counterbalance his own user page? I'm not sure but if it is meant for opposing flame-baiting then I think that it's safe to assume that a permanent block is in order. Based upon others' view of these new details I'll make a final comment in support of a permanent block or not. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 17:05, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's clear that he has made some mistakes on his userspace, but he has already made it clear that he will not repeat these errors and will blank his userpage from now on: <a href="../../../f/a/i/User_talk%7EFairNBalanced_dac1.html#Unblock_request_reviewed_and_denied" title="User talk:FairNBalanced">User_talk:FairNBalanced#Unblock_request_reviewed_and_denied</a>. In my opinion an indefinite ban would be much too harsh, especially considering that he is indeed a new user, and that he promise not to repeat the early errors that he has made. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 20:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I think that's fair. He is pretty new and perhaps didn't realise that hate speech is wholly inappropriate to Wikipedia.

<dd>I think that's a good idea. This user has made a number of good-quality contributions that have made him something of a lightning rod for people opposed to his contributions on a political basis. I suspect that the "fair_and_balanced" new ID is not a sockpuppet but rather another editor angry at this editor.

<p>Strong support for an indefinite block. The content and style of his first entries suggest he's not a new user, just a user using a new ID.

<dd>A checkuser would only be apropriate if there's a plausible accusation related to a named second user.

Second, that the pig is a uniquely unclean animal, such that for any word written upon it, its meaning is besmirched. I grant you that it might be characterized as "flame-baiting", in that it's known that partisans of a certain ideology find this juxtaposition offensive. Perhaps flame-baiting of religious ideologues is disgusting. If so, let's establish it as policy: no statements, lexical or visual, which might be interpreted as offensive to or intended to provoke editors with religious belief. Comfortable with this? (<i>Cyde Weys, are you listening?</i>) I'm not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Otherwise, what can be the issue? I agree that, by the most natural reading, the image was intended to either challenge or make light of Islamic thought and prejudice, but why is this any worse that doing the same with Christian thought and prejudice? It seems that Islam is being treated as a race or gender here, something towards which one may has no moral right to arrive at any judgement except advocacy. That is not the way the unique sensitivities of other religions have been treated on wikipedia. Religions are not just backgrounds but also ideologies.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I accept that the proclamations of disapproval, including my own, were made in good faith, but in retrospect have come to believe that these were wrongly decided. My thesis is that pigs are not obscene, and the Arabic word for God is not sacred, nor is their juxtaposition in any way offensive, except to whatever degree that we've adopted and accepted - thoughtlessly, reflexively, defensively, politically, fearfully or otherwise - a religious point of view. This is the very same sort of dispute which has occured at <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoon_controversy_c69e.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoon controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoon controversy</a>, similarly <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piss_Christ_af32.html" title="Piss Christ">Piss Christ</a>, where one group finds something intolerably outrageous, where those outside this group find it perhaps objectionable, but within the pale of acceptable dialogue. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a>, one clause of which was clearly designed to prohibit the cartoons (hence its resurrection by Raphael1), was rejected.

Here, it's being said that Allah Pig is especially offensive in a way that Cyde's porn pix (acknowledged flame-baiting)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyde/Weird_pictures" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyde/Weird_pictures" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> or <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piss_Christ_af32.html" title="Piss Christ">Piss Christ</a> (institutionalized federally-funded flame-baiting) is not.

<dd>What constitutes "hate speech" is apparently quite subjective, as seen in the recent Cyde Weys Christian template controversy - and that was actively screwing with <i>other people's</i> user pages. Wikiethics is at least clear and consistent - if someone's offended by an image, remove it. Just as my position is consistent - nothing to do with Wikipedia, remove it. Yours is manifestly not.Timothy Usher 10:22, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nice, first you correctly submit the Allah pig image (no doubt knowing full well that an image of a particularly ugly gray/black pig with with the Arabic word Allah scrawled across it's body edited onto it with Photoshop is particularly hateful) for speedy deletion and subsequently edit it off <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a>'s user page prior to it's actual deletion and then you argue that his doing that wasn't hateful due to "subjectivity"? Ridiculous. You're equivocating Cyde-Weys rather discreet page of "Weird Pictures" that one actually has to search for or otherwise become aware through a means other than directly viewing his <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">user page</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a> <i>immediate</i> user page hateful display.

<dd>I believe my request said "inflammatory", not "hateful." The first refers only to how some others are likely to view it. Cyde's actions go beyond this - he also changed the Christian template such that the cross was spinning, and including a very lengthy deliberately rambling text in place of the previous template text.</dd>

<dd>There you go, it's like lynching. Look, this was a picture of a friggin' farm animal, with a word for God in a foreign language. It's only a <i>big deal</i> if one accepts one religious narrative, in which case it's blasphemy. If one doesn't, it's just a farm animal. Were the text "Jesus", I seriously doubt we'd be having this discussion. Nor was there any "you're next" involved. That's ridiculous, and unchivalrous. You know he can't respond. Stop kicking him.Timothy Usher 14:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, your failure to respond to my question about how the Allah pig image was inflammatory is telling. Your previous actions spoke much louder than your current words which makes them so puzzling and gives you that <i>genuine</i> appearance of a hypocrite. Not sure why you keep trying to state how I might have responded if this question surrounded "Jesus", from my previous statements it's clear that I would have responded equally in kind were I to be editing primarily on Chrisitianity related topics and encountered an equally hateful display relative to that religion. As well the "Stop kicking him" comment is out of place because this last part of the discussion revolves around <i>your</i> attempts at whitewashing FairNBalanced's previous user page display. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 20:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. For what it is worth, I became aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FairNBalanced" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FairNBalanced" rel="nofollow">FairNBalanced</a> from edits on article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Newman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Newman" rel="nofollow">Bob_Newman</a>. A read through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Newman&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Newman&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article history</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Newman&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Newman&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Talk page</a> shows several things. The article was created in two days, 1 to 2 October 2005, with massive cut and paste (including COPYVIO material later removed by others during cleanup) as a collaboration between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aj4runner" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aj4runner" rel="nofollow">Aj4runner</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.102.198.2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.102.198.2" rel="nofollow">67.102.198.2</a>, an IP for Covad Communications in San Jose, CA, US. Aj4runner did a few of minor edits later in same month and was silent until May 2006 when they added a thanks to FairNBalanced for restoring the article after an edit war. Aj4runnerhas done nothing since adding that remark which is suspicious. User:67.102.198.2 was only used for the building of the article. I believe it to be a sock puppet of Aj4runner. I do not know if they both are sock puppets of FairNBalanced.</p>
<p>The article, which read like it was written by the subject (unsourced and not NPOV in my opinion), was tagged for cleanup in November 2005 and this cleanup continued into February 2006. By that time, the article was stable and looked concise and NPOV (at least to me - I don't have any personal interest in the subject of the article) for about a month. It had minor tweaking and even was vandalized and reverted until the edit war started on 7 April 2006. The talk page exchanges heated up at this time as well. User <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=71.198.141.63" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=71.198.141.63" rel="nofollow">71.198.141.63</a>, was a major player and this IP address is an IP used by FairNBalanced as shown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karl_Meier&amp;diff=57645344&amp;oldid=57645226" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karl_Meier&amp;diff=57645344&amp;oldid=57645226" rel="nofollow">here on Karl Meier's talk page</a>. (Karl was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Karl_Meier&amp;diff=58357767&amp;oldid=57924322" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Karl_Meier&amp;diff=58357767&amp;oldid=57924322" rel="nofollow">departing Wikipedia</a> but came back. If that was for FairNBalanced, then Karl is commendable.)</p>
<p>On 15 April 2006, FairNBalanced re-grew the article, with a series of edits to nearly the original size, but without the COPYVIO material mentioned above. A series of reverts took place that ended with the article large, not sourced and not NPOV (again, my opinion) on 20 April 2006. Discussion on the talk page stopped at this point on the same day. This was the end of the edit war. FairNBalanced made some readability cleanups on 24 April 2006 and in May 2006 did clarify the copyright status of the photos that were in the article at the time. These are both commendable. However, <i>readability</i> was used as a reason to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Newman&amp;diff=50219393&amp;oldid=50216288" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Newman&amp;diff=50219393&amp;oldid=50216288" rel="nofollow">remove the source and pov tags</a> left at the end of the edit war.</p>
<p>On 29 April 2006, after the talk page had been silent for over a week, FairNBalanced went back in and replied to one of the cleanup editors with comments about POV and citing sources which I find both ironic and baiting. It did get a heated response from one of the cleanup editors. I call this baiting because the next day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=172.166.237.185" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=172.166.237.185" rel="nofollow">172.166.237.185</a> an AOL IP address, came in with a sympathetic encouragement for the editor to leave.

<dd>Yes I am new to Wikipedia. As for the jargon and formatting, it's because I have followed many of the conversations and also use "Show preview" a ridiculous number of times before saving. However, I am not anyone who participated in the edit war. I do realize what this looks like. But you don't know how much time this has taken from my real world job. I'm going to try very hard today to not even go to Wikipedia. As for FairNBlanaced, I think he'd be more happy in the Blogosphere. Now I need to get to work.

<li>Let us consider the bigger picture before rushing to judgement. So far the focus is the deleted image. Let's not only focus on the pig image that was deleted by Timothy. There is also the image of the tortured Iraqi, under which he added a snide bit of commentary. Go through the deleted conversations on the talk page as well as the user page. These weren't merely his own views.It is also to be noted that he added his name to the Wikiproject:Islam group and the Muslim Guild. He not only placed inflammatory hate speech on his page, he positioned himself in groups and participated in editing directly with the people whom he wished to offend and insult. This person has an advanced knowlege of Wikipedia, and has demonstrated advanced knowlege since his first posts. Though this particular ID is new, the character behind it is quite experienced, and is versed in WP rules when it suites him. He knows how to play rhetoric, obviously he knew precisely how inflammatory his userpage was. His ID and his IP should be banned permenantly.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>His primary defender here is Timothy Usher, the same person who deleted the offending image. A closer look at Timothy_Usher's edit history reveals his own interests in pushing a partisan perspective, particularly on topics where Islam or Muslims are involved. I intend on bringing up a separate case regarding Timothy's pattern of behavior here, particularly his baiting games on the Wikiproject:Islam page, though his actions on other pages deserve to be noted as well. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 22:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In case you haven't realized it, I'm not getting anything out of this. I fully recognize the political benefits of joining in the chorus of condemnation, and having recognized them, choose not to. I oppose the images, just as I oppose <i>any</i> editorial commentary in userspace unrelated to wikipedia, but also oppose the unseemly way in which several editors are tripping over one another to appease angry proponents of one religious ideology, where rather less angry proponents of another are fair game for said flamebaiting, some of which (e.g. the Christian template fiasco) went <i>far</i> beyond this incident.</dd>

<dd>As for <i>my</i> "baiting", if you mean that I've encouraged editors not to fill Wikipedia up with sectarian language (p.s., did you know I voted to <i>delete</i> the Christian userbox?) or to band together on the basis of religion, as per the Muslim Guild (see the reference to the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ECatholic_Alliance_of_wikipedia_6f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Catholic Alliance of wikipedia">deletion</a> of Catholic Alliance of Wikipedia below), or to run around attacking editors as enemies of that religion, as you've repeatedly done (and been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Amibidhrohi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Amibidhrohi" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> for) under your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">former username</a>, and have done again here - if <i>that's</i> what you mean by "baiting", than I plead guilty.Timothy Usher 22:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And actually by baiting, I meant you IMPERSONATING a Muslim (which you're not), going to the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> page, and 'daring' a user who expressed his opposition to "Islam-POV", to come to the Wikiproject:Islam page to 'express' himself to other Muslims. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muhammad&amp;oldid=57483535#Burial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muhammad&amp;oldid=57483535#Burial" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Less explixit is you commenting on the Wikiproject:Islam page on the "Conservative Noticeboard" here, which I think was for the same intent of getting people prone to anti-Muslim sentiment to partipate in editing articles dealing with Islam. I know you're considered an annoyance on Wikiproject:Judaism as well. The fact that you frustrate members of more than one religion isn't something to be proud of. I would request users to check out the changes he repeatedly makes to the Wikiproject:Islam main page and talk page, particularly his requests that Muslims refrain from so much as saying "salaam" to each other. Reasonless and unprovoked comments such as "your userpage is not an appropriate place for persuading other editors of the virtues of your way of life"...At times he's the expert on WP lawyering, at others he's oblivious to such simple rules as WP:NPOV, WP:Civil, WP:RS and most of all, WP:CONSENSUS. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 23:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The fact that you frustrate members of more than one religion isn't something to be proud of." - I wouldn't say I'm proud of <i>frustrating</i> anyone, but I've nothing to apologize for. The issue there, as with the Muslim Guild (though not <i>nearly</i> as egregious in this), was 1) whether or not it was okay to advise members that their religion was under attack ("be on the lookout..."), and that they must band together to stop this vilification, 2) whether "Jewish vs. Christian perspectives" was an appropriate section title. 3) whether editors should be advised to <i>take offense</i> if other editors say "Jesus Christ", rather than just to remind them that "Christ" is POV and ask them not to use sectarian language. I've no apologies to offer for any of this.Timothy Usher 23:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agreed. There's one issue I would ask be considered. These days it is considered more 'sexy' to attack Muslims and Islam than other minority groups. Fair game for political talking heads, fair game for comedians, and all that. Make sure that this bias attitude doesn't affect your decision here. Apply the same standards on FairNBalanced that you would if he had made corrospondingly offensive remarks and made use of equally offensive imagery targeting Jewish users or people of black skin color. Had the choice of target been anything other than Muslim or Arab, I feel the response would have been far more severe than just a 1 week block. <i>The standards should be same across the board</i>. Remember, not only did he make use of flamebaiting rhetoric and imagery, <i>he positioned himself so that Muslims could come in full view of this</i>.

<td bgcolor="#FFBBAA">For those not clear on why <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">User:FairNBalanced</a>'s pattern of displays were hateful (as I've just explained on User:Timothy Usher's talk page). Such displays are hateful when one displays an image like the <font color="black">Image:Islamist_hypocrisy.jpg</font> (now deleted) which showed a man clearly having a Muslim appearance dressed as a suicide bomber and thereby tending to incite non-Musims to view those having a similar appearance as potentially being suicide bombers. Then progressing to <font color="black">Image:Deadzarqawi.jpg</font> (now deleted) and adding commentary that says "Zarqawi meets his 72 virgins." and in so doing referencing the common Muslim belief in <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houri.html" title="Houri">Houri</a> (which again incites others to associate all Muslims with Zarqawi's acts). Then his making light of the convicted <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Frederick_90fb.html" title="Ivan Frederick">Ivan Frederick</a> torturing of a prisoner at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_ba45.html" title="Abu Ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a> would tend to incite others to view Frederick's acts as acceptable towards a likely Muslim. And the final straw in this pattern was to actually directly post an image (<font color="black">Image:I_found_Allah.jpg</font> (now deleted)) that could only have one purpose and that is to incite fury from Muslims by referring to the <b>highly revered</b> <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> as the <b>highly disdained</b> "unclean" pig. All this while <b>expressly</b> integrating himself into an environment where he was sure to encounter Muslims.<br />

<dd>I second Romarin's doubts. I've reviewed <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, and, aside from last week's "vandalism" section of the talk page, which got a little heated, the tenor of discussion doesn't seem particularly unusual for a controversial topic, nor does there appear to be any kind of full-scale edit war. While Alienus is known to have been incivil in the past - and been blocked for it - Alienus' behavior in this instance seems to me quite uncontroversial. Immediately prior to this, another administrator had placed an NPA warning on his talk page, accompanied by diffs which are not reasonably construed as personal attacks. This is completely puzzling to me. I can only guess that he is being judged primarily on the basis of behavior he appears to have ceased. If the point of previous blocks was to bring him into compliance, mission accomplished. The relentlessly negative treatment of Alienus has become unseemly.

<dd>Disclaimer: Alienus and I are nearly constantly at loggerheads. So this is not the dispassionate evaluation of an uninvolved admin, but the strictly personal opinion of an editor who has to suffer his nearly constant badgering and insults. With that out of the way: am mystified how you can describe the things he is being warned and blocked for as "behavior he appears to have ceased" when he is making edits, on a nearly daily basis, like these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Circumcision&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58968629" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Circumcision&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58968629" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58974880" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58974880" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59064500" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59064500" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:10, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nandesuka, your response is appreciated. I do not think the third diff unacceptably incivil. In the second, he appears to have removed his own comments. The first is clearly incivil, with the "snipppies" epithet which he's resorted to, and been warned away from, in the past. This diff was not presented on his talk page, nor is it on <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, for which he was blocked, and which I'd reviewed, so there was no way for me to have taken it into account.Timothy Usher 12:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're misreading the second diff. The point isn't what he wrote in the text itself, but the edit summary in which he provides his reason for removing it: referring to Arbcom as a "kangaroo court." With regard to the third diff, the key point here is that it is representative of this user's well-established habit of addressing arguments at people rather than issues. It is not incivil for Alienus to describe the <i>actions</i> he thinks I am taking, but he doesn't limit himself to that: he crosses the line with "Clearly, you do not respect the rules you are expected to enforce." Obviously, I take that as a rather severe and personal insult, and the people who reviewed his accusation on the personal attack intervention noticeboard agreed. His response to that was to imply that <i>they</i> are operating in bad faith as well.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=59111498&amp;oldid=59101969" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=59111498&amp;oldid=59101969" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Numerous editors have suggested, advised, warned, threatened, and begged Alienus to address his arguments to <i>subjects</i> rather than to <i>the people he is arguing against</i>. To date, he has shown no willingness to do this. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Timothy is right (and thank you for taking a stand); those examples that Nandesuka has given are irrelevant to this case. The quote that was judged "uncivil" in this particular instance was, as Tony Sidaway wrote on Alienus' talk page, "*sigh* the cult allegation is well-documented; please stop edit-warring against us; we have the consensus and the rules on our side." This is in no way uncivil; it shows someone who is wearly of having to revert what could be taken as vandalism, considering that the changes being made were against concensus. As Timothy stated, Alienus is being judged for past incivilities (which no one is denying he has made), <i>not</i> for what he has done here, as he has done nothing wrong in the particular instance for which he was apparently blocked. Unfortunately, it appears as though he got picked up by a trigger-happy admin. There seem to be many who would jump at the chance to block Alienus. Is this really the point of adminship? <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin">Romarin</a> 13:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>With all due respect, the chief commonality that this block shares with the previous one is its lack of justification.</p>
<p>While it's true that RJII had repeatedly changed the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randism.html" title="Randism">Randism</a> page against consensus to redirect to the wrong target and I kept fixing it, it's also true that I was done for the night. I had discussed the issue repeatedly with RJII on the talk page, but he kept punctuating each response with a revert. By the time I was ready to go to bed, I noticed that I'd made three reverts in short order, and decided that flirting with <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> was unwise. Instead, I started writing up adverts on <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a> to get more editors involved.</p>
<p>While RJII and I were at loggerheads, additional editors could overcome the stalemate, which I thought was the prudent action to end what was becoming an edit war. Unfortunately, Tony's block hit me in the middle of this and prevented me from taking the one action that would actually solve the problem. In other words, not only did the block utterly fail in its stated purpose, as I had no intention of touching the article again until other editors joined us, but it actually stopped me from getting other editors involved in the first place. How counterproductive!</p>
<p>If Tony felt the need to get involved despite the fact that I was entirely on top of things, a simple warning, perhaps with a helpful suggestion on how to overcome the conflict, would have been far more effective and bloodless. Unfortunately, Tony chose to shoot first and ask questions never.</p>
<p>What's particularly distressing about this bad judgement call is that it is part of a constellation of odd behavior by Tony ever since his previous block was overturned. If you visit my talk page, you'll see that he was clearly polling my contributions page, as he kept commenting on my edits and trying to engage me in disputes. This did not seem productive, so I very politely walked away from any conflict with him.</p>
<p>At that point, Tony did something truly weird and unexplained: he edited my signature to set it to the default, instead of the simple cyan "Al" that I've been using for a while now. If not for good faith, I would wonder if he was baiting me in the hopes of getting me to say something that might justify a block. Regardless of his motives, which I genuinely cannot fanthom, the results are creepy and demotivating. It's like being watched by someone who has a loaded gun and is guided by unknown and seemingly arbitrary criteria for shooting.</p>
<p>I've taken this with good humor, good faith and constant civility, but I really shouldn't be taking this at all. As much as I laugh about it, now I have an entirely spurious block on my history, which is a stain against my reputation and will hurt me in the future when dealing with other admins. To be quite frank, I think it is now apparent that Tony has some sort of difficulty working with me in a mutually productive way, so I must conclude that it would be best if he kept his distance. I ask that he recuse himself from matters that involve me and avoid frequenting my Talk page unless there is some really good reason.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm asking too much here. If you've been following this whole thing, particularly if you're an admin, I encourage you to respond here and try to persuade Tony to walk away from this mess he's creating.

First, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is not policy, but a guideline. Second, when people feel attacked, their response should not be to block. Third, only vandalism-only accounts are blocked indefinitely. I read the exchange, and saying that someone's actions show them to be a practicing bigot does not amount to hate speech or even an insult. The person may be disagreeable, but folks need to lay off the block button and start using other methods. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His Excellency/Amibidhrohi mounted that personal attack shortly after a previous personal attack and after Tom had warned him to stop. The user has just emerged after a week-long block for personal attacks under a new username, so a block was more than justified. Contrary to what was said above, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is an official policy and people are blocked every day for personal attacks; indefinite blocks for personal attacks are no rarity either. However, I also agree that any block must be serious, so if Tom does not intend this block to be permanent, I believe he should reduce the length of the block to, say, one month given that the previous block was for a week and the user shows no sign of repentence.

<dd>His "response" is just an ongoing personal attack, for which Wikipedia probably should not be providing a platform. The "bigotry" to which he refers consists, first, of the unforgivable failure to rationalize and excuse Muhammad's treatment of Jews, and, second, of the assertion that Wikipedia - and scholarship generally - is best served by a non-sectarian environment.Timothy Usher 07:28, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm? I don't see him doing that, Pecher, I see him on the contrary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:His_excellency&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59382350" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:His_excellency&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59382350" rel="nofollow">"removing heated remarks made in frustration"</a>. Netscott (above) directs me to HE's block log, suggesting that what's to be seen there is the actual reason (?) that Tom blocked this time, and asking rhetorically whether those blocks weren't justified either. I don't know. How could I? Two of them were for personal attacks: one recently for a week, by Tom Harrison, one in January by Bratsche.( I'm not in this context so interested in all those 3RR blocks, though they certainly show unacceptable edit warring.) I guess I won't bother Bratsche, since it was so long ago, but if it's significant here, as Netscott implies, perhaps Tom would tell me what the recent week-long personal attack block was for.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, I'm going to <b>shorten HE's block to three days</b>, for the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>HE's defence, posted on his page.</i> He compares his own indefinite block for calling Timothy Usher a bigot with FairNBalanced's week-long block, just now expiring, for hair-raising racist and religious slurs against Islam. Many administrators above argued for an indefinite block of FNB (I was among them), but nobody actually set such a block. I find this comparison cogent, and note that the contrast is likely to make HE feel yet more beleaguered as a Muslim editor.</li>
<li><i>An indefinite block is an indefinite block.</i> The notion that HE will remain blocked until and unless he apologizes to Tom's satisfaction is new to me, and unpleasant. It's humiliating.</li>
<li><i>The general situation between HE and Timothy Usher (the presumed victim)</i>. I regret that I can't realistically research all the contributions of HE and Timothy Usher, as they both produce a lot of text and I do have a day job. But just looking at their input on the FairNBalanced thread at the top of this page, the impression is of two users in long-standing conflict. They speak aggressively to each other, but Timothy Usher IMO definitely sounds <i>more</i> aggressive. Mediation would surely be more appropriate to such a situation than blocking <i>one</i> of the parties--has that been tried? I would caution against getting too technical with the NPA policy. Where two people are at loggerheads, blocking the first party provoked into calling an actual "name" isn't a good idea. There are many ways to offend without name-calling. See for instance where HE civilly voices his opinion that FairNBalanced merits an indefinite block, and TU (who was not being addressed) jumps in with "Be advised that <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">User:His excellency</a> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:His_excellency&amp;diff=58631196&amp;oldid=58623025" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:His_excellency&amp;diff=58631196&amp;oldid=58623025" rel="nofollow">new username</a> of <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">User:Amibidhrohi</a>, who has amassed an impressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Amibidhrohi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Amibidhrohi" rel="nofollow">block log</a> for 3RR, personal attacks, harrassment, disruption and incivility." Having just viewed that block log, with it's two blocks for personal attacks and the rest for 3RR, I consider that a highly exaggerated description (and not especially relevant to the discussion where it was offered, either). That's just one example, but it represents my over-all impression.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Tom points out that he won't re-block if somebody undoes his action. Well, of course not — what are we, wheel warriors? I won't re-unblock if my action is undone either, but I would expect any re-blocking admin to bring the issue here and engage with the arguments I have offered, as I have engaged with Tom's and other people's. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Needless to say, I concur with Bishonen's action and would have probably just unblocked until the proper steps were taken. This is not a condoning of the actions of HE. All I saw, though, were people clawing at each other and one of them had the block button. That is precisely when we cannot use the block function. That's when mediation (through whichever of the processes you prefer) or RfC is needed. We need to reserve blocks for fairly specific things so that users in general know what to expect and cannot legitimately accuse administrators of caprice or bullying. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:54, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tom, I have no sympathy for the user, only an objection to blocks for personal attacks that are made by the one attacked. If he was removing the attacks, isn't that what NPA says <i>should</i> be done? I know that it may be gaming the system, but being attacked makes any of us, in fact, the <i>wrong person</i> to do a block. We're supposed to hand the matter off at that point. Your mischaracterization (certainly, I think it was) of Bishonen's efforts suggests that you're too close to the matter. When someone conducts so many attacks, as Bunchofgrapes says, that they're disrupting the project and exhausting community patience, the blocks should come <i>after</i> community assent (and not lack of dissent). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:33, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

The phrase "<i>presumed</i> victim", according to its most natural reading, suggests that I am not in fact a victim, that I deserve these attacks, as does the "caution against getting too technical with the NPA policy."

<dd>I'm sorry, but you really need to read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> more carefully. If it has gotten to policy status, that has happened without the usual approval process. Secondly, I encourage you to read up on mediation procedures. I understand that you are angry, but being angry is the best reason to step back and stand well clear of this matter. Above all, your anger is a reason for you to be <i>totally uninvolved in the blocks.</i> If you are unhappy after the community deals with the situation, then that may be something you will have to live with, barring new offenses from the user that can be pursued through proper means. However, your anger appears to be leading you to make some very strained readings of Bishonen's involvement and comments. I agree with her actions entirely in this matter, although I probably would have simply unblocked and requested that the blocks be done by someone else altogether and afresh. It is policy that no one should make a personal attack, but it is not policy that there is any particular penalty for having done so. The armies have long since marshalled on this issue and the battle was fought long ago. However, I do hope that you'll simply take a break from this issue for a few days and then re-read your comments. I hope at that point you will be able to apologize to Bishonen for biting someone who was trying to be charitable toward you. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made a mistake in alledging that Tom Harrison blocked for attacks on him. He didn't. He was called in and then made the block. Not to mitigate the apology in any way, but I would reiterate my stance that NPA is a policy only insofar as it is our general policy not to insult folks. However, what actions to take after an insult is open. It is impossible to define an insult in any way that's reliable, and there is no way to ensure proportionality in responses to insults. Finally, blocks are not part of a punishment scheme, and therefore they really should be nearly blind. Users need to know what to expect from administrative action, particularly when it comes to blocks. As blocking is a defense mechanism for Wikipedia rather than an instrument for discipline, it should be invoked only when there is a danger that rises beyond displeasure. Finally, there is a slippery slope involved in blocking for personal attacks or allowing the severity of an attack to be weighed, as we start to decide which insults are worse than others, and that's no position for any of us to be in. If we allow ourselves to even once take that position, we start measuring the "attack" against the "taunt" and the "hate speech" and the "hate crime," and all of those are so valuative and denigrating (both in terms of which sector is protected and in what it means to be so weak as to need special shelter) that it's the devolution of Wikipedia's founding sentiment: the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

In addition, they usually have the {{busy}} template at the top of their talk pages which reads "Michael is currently busy in real life and may not respond quickly to queries". A checkuser <i>was</i> run a while ago on the accounts which were suspected sockpuppets at the time (I currently cannot find this, but I assure you it was done), and they were indeed proven to be sockpuppets, and <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> blocked the IP in question for one month; this was probably a few weeks ago, but I am alsmost certain it has not been a month since then.

<dd>It is a fine thing to ask people who have expressed interest in a particular topic to weigh in on a discussion. However, it is never OK to <i>selectively</i> invite those who have identified with a particular <i>viewpoint</i>.

<dd>Vote-stacking weakens the credibility of the poll or discussion in question. Where it has occurred, it should be noted clearly on the poll or discussion page, so that people who interpret the poll results or discussion outcome are aware that it has occurred.</dd>

It will even further invalidate poll results, and prevent discussion consensus. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 08:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is important is not whether there is vote stacking or not. What is important is best summarized by Tony's post on the poll. He said that "You can't decide issues of fact with a straw poll". By responding to this offense of "vote-stacking", by removing categories and protecting pages, we tacitly give our approval to the process and encourage people to think that it is reasonable to vote on issues of fact. These actions give the appearance that we are protecting the sanctity of the voting process. There is no vote-stacking because there is NO VOTE. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 08:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What if everyone contacted in this case came and participated in a positive manner, and all the liberals were contacted as well? I bet with all those people one of them might figure out how to phrase things in a NPOV way. The problem is disruptive behavior, not the exercise of free speech. I created the <a href="../../../l/g/b/Wikipedia%7ELGBT_notice_board_1fde.html" title="Wikipedia:LGBT notice board">Wikipedia:LGBT notice board</a> because important decisions about deleting LGBT categories were being made by a handful of editors that were not involved in LGBT topics. Would it be alright if I informed one editor that a decision was about to be made? Is 5 too many? How about 69 (the current number of people signed up on the board). Should I not inform anyone because it would be vote stacking? How about if I just inform people I know are trustworthy? What if I don't know their entire history? Where should I draw the line? I don't think a line can be fairly drawn. What you can do is respond to inappropriate contacts. It is analogous to the difference between organizing a meeting and inciting a riot. Newspapers could possibly be used to incite angry mobs, should they all be shut down? Sorry that I'm going on and on about this, but I think this is very important. If AfD and other discussions are a mess, perhaps some other things need to be done to fix them. Let's have that discussion and come up with some creative ideas before we institute a police state. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 09:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that vote stacking and prohibiting "talk page spamming" are both wrong. Part of the problem is how it is done, and I don't think it's too much to say that <i>informing about an ongoing debate</i> is different from <i>soliciting support.</i> "As a person active on issues of X, you might be interested in the debate going on at Location" is not solicitation. I oppose the use of any association or noticeboard page to gather votes, and I actually oppose interest or politically based associations taking part in such issues. Basically, if Wikipedia continues having "factions" and "parties," it's doomed entirely. If cranks want to <i>perceive</i> the place as a gay liberal communist project, the world won't care, but if the project develops the gay block, the TG block, the conservative block, the Roman Catholic block, the Democrat block, etc., then it very soon <i>will</i> be "ruled" by some group, and it will even more quickly disaffect and lose the "losing" groups. Providing information to the interested is something that, theoretically, I <i>would</i> oppose, if we didn't have IRC. Given its existence and the efficacy of it in getting a huge influx of "voters," and given the fact that no one is inclined to stop it, I don't think we can rule very strenuously on the subject of "talk page spamming," as long as it's informational, even if we must, I think, come down very hard on notifications that are political or designed to develop a faction of any sort. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a comment but people are what they are, their views are also what they are. Removing affiliations just makes it so you may never understand why they have that view. You may argue for 20 days on wikipedia about an issue, for instance the war on terror issue. on the 21st day you find out that person is a staunch republican, wouldnt it have helped you to know before the 21 days began that this user was a republican? How about if they were a vet? These associations help users understand one another and their viewpoints, and help them relate to eachother and avoid saying things that may seem biased etc. It helps people get along and find a middleground. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If I argue with someone for 20 days, I hope I'm talking about issues, and not what the speaker is or is not, and I similarly hope that that person's words would be neither explained, lessened, nor endorsed by an affiliation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't really have a major dog in this fight, but just a heads-up on a few ArbCom cites: while researching a little bit to clarify the authenticity of the {{<a href="../../../c/a/n/Template%7ECanvass_aa90.html" title="Template:Canvass">Canvass</a>}} template, I found that the Arbitration Committee has ruled that "[t]he occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice"<sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_IZAK_d3bf.html#Principles" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/IZAK">1</a></sup>, but that <i><b>aggressively</b></i> worded cross-posting contributed towards an Arbitration Committee ruling of disruptive behavior that resulted in blocking<sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Guanaco%2C_MarkSweep%2C_et_al_f294.html#StrangerInParadise_is_disruptive" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al">2</a></sup>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 20:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to state that not everyone I contacted was in the conservative category, and instead had shown themselves to be constructive in their efforts in the past. I do however admit to doing it, and it was underhanded of me, however I did it with the knowledge that straw polls do not matter. Previous discussions I had found myself often debating with many more people then me, and it was not an enjoyable experience. Seeing a tool like a category including like minded wikipedians, I used this to have people who could possibly have helped alleviate some of the stress that had previously come with discussions on this matter. Obviously, it did not work and has shown itself to be quite counter productive on my part, as it could likely get me in trouble or the poll deleted - obviously avoiding no stress. If anything, I ask that the punishment goes to me directly. I strongly beleive that the argument put forth in <a href="../../../w/o/t/Wikipedia%7EWOT_a2ea.html" title="Wikipedia:WOT">Wikipedia:WOT</a> removes any reasonable doubt for its inclusion, and this can go on without me. I have no defense for myself, and will not put forth any. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley">Rangeley</a> 20:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't want to block a range longer then necessary, if (s)he switches ranges the first block will do more harm the good.

<dd>By the way, blocking for&#160;:15 <i>does</i> do some good, especially for a rapidly moving vandal like this one: it cuts off the next spot the vandal will move to.

<dd>Well, I can't say that I agree with the deletion, but I also think that there is very little good that <i>could</i> have come from the association. If the association had been present, like the saints portal, to be sure that neglected figures of conservativism (are there any?) were represented, it wouldn't be a big deal, but there's no need for a project to do that. Besides, eventually the thing would have to have succumbed to battling "liberals," and liberals are, according to the sorts of people who hang out at conservativism projects, everywhere and include pretty much everyone who dissents, so it's probably delete it now or delete it after the RfC's, RFAR's, etc. have gone on.

<dd>I closed the MfD as a matter of housekeeping: the article was already deleted (appropriately, IMO, though not by me). You keep going back to the LGBT board, but obviously political conservatism and LGBT issues are not at all of the same ilk.

<p>Some people want to delete a page, some people want to keep it. Outside the narrowly defined speedy-deletion criteria, our procedure in cases like that is to hold a discussion at *fD on the merits of keeping or deleting. Meanwhile the page itself is kept readable to all. After five days or so someone closes the discussion and if there is a consensus to delete, the page is deleted. This mechanism has served us well for years. When individual admins ignore all rules and summarily delete content they don't approve of they are spitting in the face of our community-based decision making. Now non-admins can't even view the page to comment intelligently upon whether it should be undeleted. I can understand that in cases where something is seriously embarrassing or damaging (and yet doesn't meet the CSD criteria) it may make sense to shoot first and ask questions later. But no one has claimed that allowing the page in question to stand open for five days would cause any damage. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 19:26, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand the impatience. Why bypass *fD, if it seems remotely controversial? Maybe this didn't seem remotely controversial to Nandesuka, but by now it's clear that there is difference of opinion.

<dd>(edit conflict) Thanks Haukur, you've said just what I've been trying to say. I rather think this page should be deleted, and would happily say so on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a>. However, I am very strongly opposed to this out of process deletion, and worse twice. It doesn't come remotely close to any of the CSD criteria, and is a perfect candidate for <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a>. I don't understand why the admins who deleted this are so bothered by it hanging around a few days while it undergoes the proper deletion process. Incidentally, I really can't see any difference between this and the LGBT one, it seems to have exactly the same purpose to me, and therefore either both should be kept or both deleted. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 19:41, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that when the page is such an outrageous violation of Wikipedia policies, like this one, it turns the situation on its head. It's not "what's the harm of letting it hang around a few more days," it's "why should we have to put up with this egregious misuse of Wikipedia for a few more days?" Crap gets deleted immediately, not after a waiting period. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 19:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cyde, you are quite wrong about that. Crap very, very often gets deleted after a waiting period. Your impatience (or Nandesuka's, or anyone's) is no reason to change how we do things. Take your time, explain why something is crap, and if it's truly obvious, everyone at *fD will agree, as very, very often happens. If it's not that way, it's possible that it wasn't crap, and that some course of action other than deleting might be wiser. It is utterly unobvious to me that this noticeboard is an egregious violation, when almost identical noticeboards exist unmolested, and I really don't see the argument that Conservativism is different from LGBT issues in a way that makes it obviously un-noticeboard-worthy. This seems to me to be a perfect candidate for rescoping in a way that educates all the editors involved about how we see the NPOV policy working. Handing them a cause to complain about process violation, practically begging to be criticized on utterly beside-the-point procedural grounds, is actually stupid, and helps to prevent the right conversation from happening. "Crap gets deleted" is a foolish motto to speedy-delete with, unless your goal is to generate DRAMA! -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I regret commenting about the LGBT page. <b>This discussion is not about that page.</b> It's about the merits of and problems with the now-deleted conservative portal. "Either they both stay or they both go!" arguments are rather pointless, as the page in question needs to be able to stand on its own merits. The deletion of the LGBT page would have no bearing on whether the page in question has any value.

<p>Folks, you are kidding yourselves if you think Muslim Guild and LGBT noticeboards are not centers for precisely this type of advocacy and solicitation. Alternately, you're fully aware of this, which is even more disturbing. I'd suggest that <i>all</i> such partisan Guilds and projects be deleted, but short of that, this smacks of manipulating the system to achieve a desired content bias throughout the affected articles. Nor is this the first issue in recent days which suggests that the idelogies of favored "minorities" are acceptable, but American conservatism is not. I'm not opposed to drawing distinctions, as some ideologies are broadly accepted to be beyond the pale (e.g. Nazism, segregationism), but I'd like us to be upfront about what they are and not play games like "conservatism is political, LGBT is sexual." There is a name for the ideology which considers Islamism and LGBT as oppressed classes worthy of special protection (never mind that under <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Islamic law</a> the LGBT crowd must be <i>executed</i>), while conservatism merits scorn.

<dd>It's never possible to delete schools. I think I figured out why - if they start to get deleted (as they should be), then people's vanity articles about their own schools would be in danger. So they just mindlessly vote 'keep please schools are notbale too' (spelling intended). Oh, yeah, and Nandesuka goes on my list of admins I like for applying common sense over some garbled, policy-wonking Wikilawyering. Sadly, it's still a small list. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 15:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As uncomfortable as I feel about people discussing me and my motivations, I would hope that people assume good faith whenever a notice board is created. I put some effort into the creation and management of the <a href="../../../l/g/b/Wikipedia%7ELGBT_notice_board_1fde.html" title="Wikipedia:LGBT notice board">Wikipedia:LGBT_notice_board</a> so that it is not seen as politicizing Wikipedia. The LGBT notice board has stated clearly from the start that it is for ANYONE interested in articles related to LGBT topics. The reason someone is interested may well be because they believe they should all be deleted. When I found out about the current controversy, I went to look at the deleted pages to see if they were so constituted. It concerns me that this page has been deleted, because it puts the LGBT board in a similar threatened position.</p>
<p>I think the conservative board was presented in a pretty much NPOV way, and I appreciate that it used the LGBT board as a model. The test for a board that has postings about controversial articles or issues, is if it would be useful to people <i>on both sides</i> of the issue. In this case, I would have found the board useful even though I in no way consider myself a conservative.</p>
<p>Anyone who works on controvesial articles, whether they be related to politics, reproductive rights, religion, or sexuality, more likely than not will bring their own bias into play to some degree. The question is, what is the best way for the Wikipedia community to address those biases. People may think that the LGBT notice board is attempting to organize support around LGBT issues. I don't see it that way. I see it as people being honest about the issues that concern us. The LGBT notice board is as much a vehicle for everyone to watch <i>us</i>, as it is about us watching an issue. I hope that the conservative board, and those like it can be restored, stripped of any POV bias if necessary, and allowed to peacefully coexist. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 03:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Has anyone looked at <a href="../../../l/g/b/WP%7ELGBT_a8aa.html" title="WP:LGBT">WP:LGBT</a>? Obviously, deleting this conservative noticeboard was correct ... but I see multiple xFDs listed on the LGBT board that all got plenty of vote stacking. Why is ANYTHING that serves as a clearinghouse for votes allowed to continue? Having a list of articles of interest that need work is fine IMO - for gays or for Conservatives - but listing xFD debates is pure vote stacking. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:11, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it is best to assume good faith. The notice board lists are a useful feature, not vote-stacking. And it exists in many Wikiprojects (Schools, etc) - not just notice boards. We all know there are MANY POV-motivated nominations for article deletion. Most of the editors who use the LGBT notice board are busy working on other projects - and unable to constantly check up on the VFD (AFD) boards every day (or every week), because instead of being involved in the politics of voting for deletion every day or talking on talk pages, we are writing - or editing actual content articles. The notice board allows us to give notice to each other when articles in our area of expertise are being discussed or voted on elsewhere - probably by folks who are honestly ignorant about issues and factual realities. Notice boards ensure a <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunshine_law.html" title="Sunshine law">sunshine law</a>-type running of this project and allows experts in topics to voice their opinions/concerns and helps ensure the quality of this project will steadily improve. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 06:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Logic:
<ul>
<li>A noticeboard is for those intereted in the topic, all are welcome.</li>
<li>Since all are welcome, a "conservative" noticeboard may attract conservatives, yes, but it will also attract those that wish to make sure articles related to conservatism are kept up to quality standards.</li>
<li>A conservative noticeboard will therefore attract a diversity of editors; this is <b>no different</b> from any other article on Wikipedia; it attracts people that are <i>interested</i>.</li>
<li>Since all are welcome, and since various groups may take an interest in a conservative noticeboard as they may take an interest in any other article, you cannot assume that such a board will only serve a conservative agenda just as you cannot assume that any particular article will serve any agenda.</li>
<li>If you cannot assume that an agenda will be served, you have no reason to oppose the creation of a conservative noticeboard as it will only serve to attract a diversity of editors, which is positive. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 08:55, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I nominated the project for deletion because of recruitment message that the founders sent out to 50 people, including unrepentant POV-pushers with a history of attempted votstacking, and because the only articles it targeted were ones that the founders were in meaningless revert wars over. I suggest if people want a conservatism notice board, they make one, and link articles that could use people with special knowledge about conservatism could be helpful with - for instance, <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Burke_4d22.html" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>, but not articles that people with special opinions could edit war over - for instance, Partisan Bitchfest with STONES. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 14:51, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Both sides are right... or wrong, take your pick. The organizer(s) of this page clearly 'leaned' towards one side of the political spectrum... but the page clearly did not (as yet) present any bias. It simply listed issues relevant to the topic like any other noticeboard - some of which also have 'leanings'. If one assumes (bad faith) that the page was going to develop into a 'bias springboard' then an out of process deletion would be justified... but I don't think we can, or rather <i>should</i>, make such assumptions.</p>
<p>All that aside... would it not make more sense / be more generally acceptable to instead create a 'Politics noticeboard'? Truthfully, a great many issues 'important to conservatives' are also 'important to liberals' and vice versa. You could put the same list of articles that this page had onto a 'Liberal noticeboard' and they would fit perfectly... all topics that people 'interested in liberal issues' might want to comment on. Putting 'conservative' in the name when the issues are really of interest to all sides might imply that the page is only or primarily for conservatives. Make it a page for the issues without reference to one particular viewset over another, put little 'noticeboard advertisement banners' on the talk pages of relevant articles, and try to work together. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:25, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This poorly-named page professed to be a place for organization of editing to topics related to conservatism.

<dd>The text which looks vaguely like a legal threat is
<blockquote>
<p>"Courts tend to regard "public figures" as people who actively try to put themselves in the public eye (like politicians or actors-- the people in your example list), and not people who are simply dragged into the public eye 40 years ago, by means of a single tragic occurance which made it into the news then. So have a care, because you're on thin legal ice, and complaints to Wiki are going to a lot more effective here than if Maddona was complaining. You understand?" -sbharris</p>
</blockquote>
(and note that this comment was in an earlier reply, not in any of the diffs Johntex provides) But anyway this looks to me like merely an explanation of why McCoy might have a case if there were libelous material in the article. Sbharris is explaining to Wookitty that in fact people are <i>not</i> prohibited from editing their own articles, something which Wookitty had claimed. In fact, Sbharris is quite right in this matter: people <i>are</i> allowed (though discouraged) to edit their own articles, and the courts do indeed take a disfavourable view towards damaging information about people who are only unwillingly famous. Wikipedia has acted on this theory before (see the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_wars_kid.html" title="Star wars kid">star wars kid</a>). Sbharris claiming that McCoy might have a legal case if there is false information does not constitute a legal threat on Sbharris's part. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 12:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've warned Fahrenheit451 twice to stop referring to Terryeo habitually as "banned user Terryeo". As the first warning was on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Talk%7EPatter_drill_9fa8.html" title="Talk:Patter drill">Talk:Patter drill</a> I've corrected an earlier statement that I had already warned him. Apparently he left that discussion before I replied.</p>
<p>Although Terryeo is banned from certain articles, Fahrenheit451's use of that term in addressing and referring to Terryeo is clearly prejudicial and has the nature of a personal attack. Terryeo isn't perfect but his current relatively civil behavior should be encouraged and I'm warning Fahrenheit451 off because it is important to rehabilitate Terryeo as an editor and his activities are prejudicial to that. I have warned Fahrenheit451 that he will be blocked if he persists in addressing or referring to other editors as "banned user". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I think calling someone a "banned user", even if it's true, shouldn't be done if it does not have a clear relation to a conversation.

However, if it is your opinion (and it would seem from your last post that it may well be) that Terryeo acted in complete civillity at all times and the sole party causing disruption is Fahrenheit then, well, I guess as a sysop that is your call and that is the end of that. I was/am of the assumption (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> even) that perhaps both parties were maybe over-reacting somewhat, but the reason I actually made comment here was purely on the basis by which each was handled. Regarding your closing statement, I of course am well aware that if someone reading this has already made up their mind then my comments serve little purpose. However, with respect, I believe the whole point in a venue such as this is that those persons looking into these concerns most likely have not formed a view <i>"different from my own"</i> until <i><b>after</b></i> they've actually read all the commentary herein. <a href="../../../g/i/e/User%7EGIen_ba45.html" title="User:GIen">Gl<font color="green">e</font>n</a> 05:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a false dichotomy to suggest that my rejection of Fahrenheit451's complaint about a personal attack meant that I think Terryeo acts with perfect civility at all times. What I did see when I investigated the complaint, however, was a clear personal attack on Terryeo by Fahrenheit451. There are nearly 1000 administrators on Wikipedia, and if none can be found to treat Fahrenheit451's complaint as actionable, I suggest that it was probably not actionable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 06:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am also very familiar with the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Terryeo_064a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Terryeo">Terryeo arbitration case</a>, because as a clerk, I opened that case on April 3 and closed it on 13 May, and have had occasion to block Terryeo for repeatedly breaching his personal attack parole.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The current case arrived from a bogus complaint of a personal attack by Terryeo, made by another editor. Upon investigating the complaint, I found that the complainant, having repeatedly engaged in personal attacks himself in the past, was still at it. I warned him not to engage in further personal attacks. This is not "rough adminning", it's what any good admin would do in similar circumstances. All we're seeing her is the fallout of an editor who was dissatisfied with the outcome of his bogus complaint.. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 08:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your opinion, Tony. My complaint about Terryeo was valid, and still is. You can attempt to intellectualize it and justify it, but it remains a valid complaint. You, as an administrator, failed to communicate the initial warning to me on my user talk page. Instead, you dropped it on an article talk page, at a point where I broke off discussion with Terryeo. As an administrator, you should know that if you want to be certain to communicate to another user, it needs to go on their talk page. Also, the issue was not the generality of "personal attacks" as you now state, but my epithet of banned user, which Terryeo is for Scientology articles. I think this instance of rough adminning is a result of your not taking the additional effort to properly contact another user with an objection, and, not recognizing or really knowing the scope of what constitutes a personal attack. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 15:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If your complaint about Terryeo is indeed valid, then you should be able to find at least <i>one</i> administrator out of nearly 1000 to block him under his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Terryeo_064a.html#Terryeo_placed_on_personal_attack_parole" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Terryeo">personal_attack_parole</a>].

<dd>While I agree that this is unlikely to be Tony it is obviously <i>someone's</i> sock-puppet. The account is also obviously being used to perform disruptive actions not sanctioned by any policy. We have a 'general philosophy', possibly even a <i>guideline</i>, to avoid identifying ourselves as members of a particular (non Wikipedia based) ideology... but we have a <b>policy</b> against going out of our way to antagonize others. Excusing harassment and promotion of bias (removing statements on just one side of the dispute) in the name of 'promoting greater harmony on Wikipedia by avoiding statements of affiliation' is as inherently absurd as it is wrong. That some here have gotten in on the action by helping to wipe out the 'Opponents of Kosovo independence' category, but <b>not</b> the other hundred or so user categories expressing a political position is also troubling... don't just pick on one ideology because you can get away with it. Imagine what would happen if you tried to wipe out the 'Democrat' and 'Republican' user categories and then explain why it is ok to just 'beat up on the little guy'. You can't promote greater harmony by pissing people off. That <i>should</i> be obvious. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Santayana_b06f.html" title="George Santayana">"Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim."</a> --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh the old "don't delete this one unless you delete them all" thing. It's inevitable that people will be pissed off, especially if they have somehow gotten the idea that they own their userspace and can use it as a private web page. Probably better to show them earlier, rather later, that it isn't so. This minimizes both the damage to wikipedia and the damage to the naive new user's expectations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 12:07, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

If you discuss issues with people fairly and reasonably they will sometimes agree to just remove the ideological statement / userbox / fancy signature / fair-use only image / whatever. Granted, they often won't, but at least then you have proceeded in a cooperative, rather than inflammatory, way. If you think the reverse serves to 'minimize damage' I'd suggest that it isn't working. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to thank those of you who've supported my bold actions but also express my concerns about some other people who have attacked my actions and made baseless accusations of harrassment and sockpuppetry. I have no hidden agenda. Just to make this absolutely clear I removed userboxes from "all sides", that being pro-independent Kosovo or against, pro-abolishment of Republika Srpska or against, pro-Chechnya and against. In all instances, these userboxes were divisive and inflammatory, in content and intention. I quitted Wikipedia just under two years ago for this particular reason (no, I was not banned or anything and this is my only active account). I'm sorry to see that many users are still harming the project with unencyclopedic political views. I just hope my pointless comeback exercise will set the right example. I am a busy woman but I wouldn't mind taking this all the way up to Jimbo. The spirit of the law's with me.

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCooler_eda6.html" title="User:TheCooler">User:TheCooler</a>, these userboxes are already on their way out. I agree entirely with what you want to get done, but going on the warpath is a very foolish way to do it, and if you really want to achieve your goal, you should find a way to be smarter about it. Prick up your ears, sniff the air - there's stuff going on around here, and there are right and wrong places to push to help it go on more effectively. Political categories are up for deletion right now at CfD, for example - why snip at user pages, when you can go for the heart of POV-organizing? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:15, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks GTBacchus. What should we do with userfied userboxes? These won't come up as part of any category but are still there? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCooler_eda6.html" title="User:TheCooler">TheCooler</a>
<dl>
<dd>I recommend patience. This is actually a mountain that needs moving, and there are good and bad ways to move mountains, but no fast ones. Jimbo said that our overall strategy is to get POV organization out of Template namespace, and then address users on a more cultural level about how they choose to present themselves on their user pages. This is because there's a bit of a cultural crisis going on here at Wikipedia right now, and some views are rather entrenched.</dd>
<dd>User Categories are another big thing to get rid of in large chunks, using CfD and building consensus. When Template space and Category space are clear of advocacy, we'll be presenting a much more consistent face when we argue that userfied userboxes are a bad idea, and by then, they'll feel even more out-of-place than they do now. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's keep it sweet, Grue; that edit summary wasn't necessary.

That doesn't mean the person is only here to cause disruption - it might mean they really care about Wikipedia, and figured grabbing a shovel and being bold about an important Wikipedia issue was a good way to contribute. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
