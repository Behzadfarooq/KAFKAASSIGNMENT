<p>This template was created shortly after an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> was filled against adminstrator <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> over the issue of her deletion of <a href="../../../u/b/_/WP%7EUB_d91d.html" title="WP:UB">Userboxes</a>. While Kelly has been told of this RFC, I believe it is highly inappropriate for this template to be used in order for an RFC to take place. Not to mention, some of the wordings of the template have attacked Kelly and does not follow the RFC's rules of displaying a neutral report. I ask that this template should be seriously considered for speedy deletion under the guideline that its only purpose is to attack a user. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 00:08, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have unblocked two of the three users that Phil blocked; the third was already indef blocked for other (albeit related) reasons by another admin. I won't re-unblock, but I think some concrete explanation needs to be provided for blocking them. Using <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> to delete inappropriate pages/templates is one thing—using it to block substantial contributors is quote another! -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 17:11, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In my view they are they same thing -- totally inappropriate, and highly damaging to the project. But I do agree that out-of-process blocks are even more clearly against policy and more damaging to the project than out-of-process deletions. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bullshit. I'm reinstating. We do not need a meticulous and exhaustive masturbatory discussion of this. Every part of this template is an insult to the community. It is a wholesale misunderstanding of everything that Wikipedia is. No policy, no rule, and no guideline exists that can possibly outweigh how monumentally bad this situation is. The message that this is wholly unacceptable needs to be clear and draconian. I am reinstating all the blocks and the deletion, and will continue to do so. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:13, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The justification is this - blocks are enacted when people do very bad things on Wikipedia. This template was more harmful than anything Willy on Wheels ever did. Ergo a 48 hour block for its creator and 24 for anyone who edited it to strengthen it is wholly appropriate. Because we construct electric fences with clear "Never do this again, EVER EVER EVER" messages when we have to. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:27, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What other methods do you think were appropriate of notifying userbox contributors of the ongoing out-of-process deletions?

<dd>They are clearly aiming to gather a lynch mob together, look at the various versions and the wordings. This is not an "advisement". It's aimed at gathering a group of like minded users to go to the RFC and attack a user whether by signing a view or by creating one of their own. Either way it's not a balanced and neutral message. When I tried to NOP it people kept reverting to a more alarmist version.

<p>Would an uninvolved admin please review <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">user:Talrias</a>'s blocks of <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bobblewik_03c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bobblewik">contribs</a>)? Talrias is involved in a content dispute with Bobblewik over the latter's delinking of stand-alone years (like <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>), and is arguably leading the opposition to it. He has also several times tried to delete the section of the MoS that Bobblewik is relying on; yet despite that involvement has blocked Bobblewik twice (the latest for a week) for following what the MoS currently says. I have unblocked Bobblewik because I feel Talrias is too involved.

<dd>Let's clean up a couple of misconceptions; I haven't blocked him twice for "what the MoS currently says", I have blocked him firstly for what I saw as bot edits despite not having permission to have a bot, and secondly for ignoring pleas to stop his edits given the significant opposition to them. Do you actually disagree with the reason for the block, or do you just disagree that I should have blocked him? If it was the former, you should not have removed it but asked me to explain my reasoning (which I would of course be happy to do), but if it was the latter, you should have unblocked him and reblocked him yourself. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 03:00, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I object to you blocking in order to gain the upper hand in a content dispute: not just a dispute you're involved in, but one that you are leading (and may even have started). I am tired of admins being accused of being "involved" over every irrelevant interaction with a user, and equally tired of admins undoing other people's blocks, so please believe me: this is uncharacteristic of me. However, this is a crystal clear case of an admin being directly and deeply involved in the very content dispute that triggered the block. Please don't block Bobblewik again over this particular issue. In fairness, I should add that I agree that it may be inappropriate to use a bot to make contentious edits. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:12, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, I can't believe you figured out my (admittedly shallow) motives so quickly! I of course blocked him so I could gain advantage in a discussion, and not because he had previously ignored a number of requests to stop his edits, nor that there was significant opposition to the section of the MOS in question. Come on SlimVirgin, your accusations are ludicrous. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 03:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reblocked. There is a lot of dispute at the moment as to that section of the MOS, which was slipped in with minimal input; it's very clear that, at the least, there is no consensus about what do with linking dates. This means that someone should not be running unlinking them at rapid-fire speed with what amounts to a bot. Bobblewik has been asked to, at the very least, stop making mass edits until this is worked out, and had previously agreed to, before silently beginning them again this morning. If he wants, he can create a seperate account for his bot edits (or bot-like tool edits); else I feel we have little option than to block his main account until this is worked out. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm of the opinion that firstly, users should only ever make large quantities of style-based changes if it is absolutely necessary to do so, because really it would be best if they were fixed in the course of ordinary editing; moreover, making masses of changes to what are essentially minor wikisyntax issues, but cause a big difference in the method of page linking, seems to me to be an unwise thing to do. If there was consensus for both this change and Bobblewik's bot/bot-like tool, and he was using a separate account for the edits, then I suppose it would be OK. But he is using his main account, which is not generally in accordance with Wikipedia norms (<a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> etc.) and performing a change which does not have consensus. Thus Talrias was perfectly correct in blocking him, since he had been warned - as his talk page indicates - and had clearly not heeded the warnings given. Bots are quick to run, but a pain to revert, due to the large quantity of edits. There was thus no other approach that Talrias could have taken. In addition, the accusations of Talrias' involvement being the sole origin of his intervention is a <i>non-sequitur</i> at best, and an attempt to claim fault by impugning ethics and motives at worst.

<dd>Inserting unformatted into articles, isn't really a problem, but repeatedly uploading images without copyright tags is. I've come across this behaviour before with another user about a year ago. I don't think there are any definite policy guidlines on it. In the end we had to use common sense and simply delete any untagged image as soon as it was uploaded. It was the onl7y way to get the message through. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 23:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Per the warning Extraordinary Machine gave on Delonnette's talk page, I'd suggest waiting two days for source information on the noted images, then delete them if none is forthcoming. In line with Theresa's comment above, I'd say that any additional unsourced uploads should be shot on sight until the user gets the hint. (If <i>that</i> doesn't work, then escalating blocks may need to be applied; I hope it doesn't come to that.) <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 23:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo has said, not too long ago, that it's OK to block users who are uploading unsourced images repeatedly even after warning. This is a real threat to the project and must be stopped.

<dd>I suggest that we not describe a process by which the community tells a user their opinion on their behavior as a "<a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a>." It's not just disrespectful to Kelly, and to the community, but also to those who have actually been lynched. Lynching is a process that typically involved mutilation, bodily harm, and gruesome execution, not discussion. Can you turn the rhetoric down about 11 notches, please? It's hugely irritating when trolls on the RFC page describe Kelly as a Nazi fascist (or whatever), and it's hugely irritating when those defending her describe the RFC process as a lynching. Believe it or not, there are <i>plenty of editors</i> on <i>both sides of the debate</i> that, surprise surprise, want to actually build a good encyclopedia, and not just cause harm to a group of way c00l IRC best fri3ndz forever omgwtfbbq1111one1. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:42, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear God. Let me just say I hope I'm not the first person to point out that there's an encyclopedia <i>somewhere around here</i>. I don't care about userboxes, I don't care about shortcut links to RFCs, and the sheer amount of time-wasting that's going on at that RFC and elsewhere is mind-boggling.

<dd>Umm, this is _so_ not about the userboxes. It's about the fact that one person's view of what constitutes the best way to build an encyclopedia shouldn't trample anothers. It's about having the smallest shred of respect for opinions that differ from your own. It's about people behavining as if they understood that when you've got some powers, you should use them responsibly. I think userboxes are dumb. But I also have never been more disgusted with the powers-that-be than in the last few days. For Mike's sake, "lynching of one of our most respected community members"?

<p>I agree that there are some tough things being said about Kelly Martin. I also think that she was trying to make Wikipedia more encyclopædiac. I support anything that achieves that but I think was Kelly Martin did, however well meaning, showed gross disrespect to everyone. I have worked with people in public office and there is one clear lesson directly relevant here. Where your actions arouse such intense anger you r career in whatever you were doing is dead in the water. You will have lost the credibility and respect you do to do the job. If you adopt an attitude of "I'm just going to ignore this and it will blow over" after causing such an enormous reaction (100+ endorsements of criticism of her so far, and growing by the minute!!!) you are finished. The only way Kelly can salvage her career on WP is to say</p>
<ul>
<li>I realise my actions have caused offence and that was not my intention. I did what I believed was in Wikipedia's benefit but obviously I misguided how I did what I did. I apologise.</li>
<li>Rather than compromise the credibility of the arbcom I am resigning from it.</li>
<li>I am also voluntarily resigning by adminship.</li>
</ul>
<p>If she does that, the entire affair will calm down. In a few weeks the whole affair will be forgotten and she will have done no lasting damage to her Wiki-reputation. She would probably find that she would at a future date be re-elected to the arbcom and as an admin, on the basis of her apology and that she acted honourably in stepping down.</p>
<p>If however she hangs on, the likelihood is that controversy will follow her to the arbcom. She will be criticised for everything she does as an admin and like others caught up in far less controversial incidents she will end up quitting WP in frustration. IMHO, putting on my admin-hat and political advisor-hat, her position is untenable. When your action causes such a firestorm of a negative reaction, either you apologise and diffuse the situation, or you stand firm (as she seems intend on doing) and try to hang in there. As anyone involved in leadership positions (whether in politics, business, non-governmental organisations, charities, general organisations, etc) knows, in instances like this to try to hang on is sheer suicide. If she tries to hang on she will be destroyed by it and will end up quitting Wikipedia. It boils down to two options: 'resign and rebuild', or 'be destroyed'. Those with experience of crisis management know that there is no middle ground. (BTW a political consultant would have charged at least €2000 to give advice to someone in business in a similar situation!) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 02:20, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We are having a bit of a problem with vaguely trollish behaviour on the part of an anonymous editor (IP: 24.60.161.63) He/she/it initially contributed just a bit of patent nonsense, which is easily ignored, but now the person is borderline disruptive in aggressively asserting original research and a few other more minor problems.

<dd>You're right, we're <i>not</i> going to block in revenge for the harm she has done to the FAC process (even though besides the puppetry it includes general disruption, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Hollow_Wilerding_3079.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Hollow Wilerding">comments and links at the RFA</a>).

<p>I now understand that the entire community has been against me since the day I signed up here. This displeases me greatly. Okay, I have some stuff to tell you people. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> and myself, User:Hollow Wilerding all share the same computer. <b>They are not sockpuppets of mine, they are merely a sibling and a friend who is living with me</b>. If you choose not to believe this, that is your loss, and your problem. Not mine. I was hiding this from you because I believed that if it had been revealed then I would have been blocked for inappropriate usage of Wikipedia. User:Winnermario no longer accesses Wikipedia because she is busy — she is currently studying English literature, and User:DrippingInk logs on occasionally as he is an artist. I am mortified to know that the entire community has been against me because I am different, as some of my contributions have been truly genuine, especially <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxurious_%28song%29.html" title="Luxurious (song)">Luxurious (song)</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakira.html" title="Shakira">Shakira</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/j/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Majora%27s_Mask_c611.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>. And no, Majora's Mask would have definitely passed even if they did not vote on the FAC, as it had five other support votes, and an object or two or something withdrawn. If I am blocked for misuse of Wikipedia, which actually is not misuse, I will be filing an RfC. It is not fair for us to be blocked because we feared we would be treated as sockpuppets of each other because we all share the same computer. That is why we kept it a secret. I apologize for any harm I've caused you, but this is the real me. I would appreciate it if I just edited the encyclopedia the way I want to — I'm disappointed, I must say though, as this is a ridiculous way to start the new year, but hey, this is Wikipedia. —Hollow Wilerding . . .

<p>I have restored the FA status of this article. The general rule has nothing to do with the number of support votes, and everything to do with whether objections are being met. Sockpuppeting in support of a FA is thus a kind of useless procedure - unless Raul has dramatically changed his evaluation procedure, what he does is look at the objections and see if they're actionable and substantial. If not, the article gets promoted. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:46, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark this date down: I agree with Snowspinner 100% here. FAC is not a majority or supermajority case: it is a unanimity case. There can be no substantial objections. Thus, it possibly shouldn't have been promoted in the first place. Further the "extraordinary measures" threat, along with the "the whole site is organized against me" (should that have been "we?"), indicates some very unhelpful attitudes, attitudes that don't belong on Wikipedia. Deception is never a good policy, and achieving your goals by lying is evil. The blocks are in place for lying, at least three times, and attempting to avoid the first block by setting up a new account. Setting up yet another account, as appears to be taking place, is only going to result in wider blocks, as well as attempts to actually contact some of the people this user is pretending to be. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:56, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What strikes me about this mess is that, taking him at his word, from the get go, User:Hollow Wilerding was aware that the activities of himself, <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> could be taken as sockpuppet activity, since they shared the same IP. And yet, instead of coming right out and saying, "Okay, we got three people here sharing the same computer - we are not sockpuppets, we are just two siblings and a roomie," they go to great lengths to actively <b>conceal</b> this information. Real conversations or no, those conversations were done in an effort to deceive. If the three of them had come clean from the beginning, and perhaps promised not to act on the same things to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, it could have been worked out. Instead, they opted for skullduggery. This does not engender trust at all.</p>
<p>My suggestions: Strip the article of FA status with leave to resubmit for FAC by someone else. Next, and this is the most generous thing we should do: remove the sockpupper notice from <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> and unblock both <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> and User:Hollow Wilerding on the condition that the two agree not to vote on the same actions, or have their votes invalidated (and notices on their user pages to explain the shared IP situation). --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 16:47, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm sorry, but <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> will remain indefinitely blocked, since I can't postulate that HW has any credibility at all, after all her twists and turns, always with the word "honesty" in her mouth. I have also blocked the new sock account <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESiblings_CW_0ee8.html" title="User:Siblings CW">User:Siblings CW</a> indefinitely. To Hollow Wilerding: if you have any interest in continuing to edit this site, <b>don't evade this block by creating any new accounts whatsoever during the block</b>. If you have any more sock accounts already established, don't use them while you're blocked. Note that during the block, you can still edit your own talk page, and people will be watching it. You can also e-mail any administrator, or e-mail the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMailing_list_0943.html" title="Wikipedia:Mailing list">Wikipedia:Mailing list</a>, if you wish to protest the block.

<p>Well, I don't know, I really don't. HW's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hollow_Wilerding&amp;diff=33525583&amp;oldid=33522694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hollow_Wilerding&amp;diff=33525583&amp;oldid=33522694" rel="nofollow">response on her talkpage</a> to my block, see previous message, contains among other things a legal threat (though admittedly a pretty ridiculous one—" I may even go as far as suing the Wikipedia Foundation for misuse of allowing its users to block innocent victims") and a promise that "when I come back, it isn't going to be pretty. A new account is once again going to be established for DrippingInk and myself to use come our return." IOW, a new multiuser (that's not allowed) sock (not that, either) account to replace the one I blocked a few hours ago. Going by past edit warring on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> and recent activities (see her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hollow_Wilerding" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hollow_Wilerding" rel="nofollow">contribs</a> for reversions of FAC, FARC, and sockpuppet templates today before she was blocked), I don't suppose it <i>is</i> going to be very pretty. I really don't know. Is there any point in keeping this user around at all? Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not a battleground</a>. She has always treated it as one, very much including when she edited as Winnermario. Should the present block be lengthened, in the hope of making the user more aware of realities before an RFAR becomes necessary? I won't do any further blocking myself, since, for one thing, HW is increasingly claiming the whole thing is a Bishonen grudgefest. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Bunchofgrapes that this user shouldn't have more than one account. But I'm very much against the "sibling" account notion also, as confusing, and a bypass of the normal way of changing one's username (which is to ask a bureaucrat to... <i>change</i> one's username). It seems to me to be a blatant attempt to obfuscate the sockpuppet issue. And with (supposedly) two people using one account, which of them is <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccountability_5e88.html" title="Wikipedia:Accountability">accountable</a> for what the account does? It's not desirable to provide problem editors with extra opportunities of blaming others for their actions, and that's why such accounts are discouraged. I've blocked <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESiblings_CW_0ee8.html" title="User:Siblings CW">User:Siblings CW</a> and reverted the redirects to it of Hollow Wilerding's userpages. Any admin can unblock the siblings account, but I'd like to be on record that I'm <i>against</i> it. I won't unblock it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:11, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, since they've just been blocked for using two accounts under the same IP, it seems illogical to disallow one account for them. This way, at least vote-stacking or similar antics won't be a problem. Also, "accountability"? If there's any serious problem, we have no more hard facts than the IP anyway. When they share one, they just have to take the blame for each other's actions, but that's life. --<span style="font-family:monospace"> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 02:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, sockpuppet accounts used for votestacking et al <i>are</i> not allowed, but that is not what you said. You said sockpuppet accounts aren't allowed. In addition, it says nowhere in the policies that public/shared accounts are not allowed.

<p>I have taken the following from User:Hollow Wilerding's user talk page:</p>
<p><i>...Wow. I am devastated. So multi-users are not allowed, are they? Then we have a</i> <b>huge</b> <i>issue. If multi-users are not allowed, why have <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> been blocked? If we can't have a shared account, then we have no choice but to access individual accounts, and as it stands, that's going to be under the same IP address! Yet for some peculiar reason, both of the accounts in mention above have been blocked! That means both William and Mariah will have to create new accounts, yet I am positive User:Bishonen will block them again because (s)he will assume that they are sock puppets all over again! What a terrible issue this is! I hereby demand myself to be unblocked so that I can file the RfC right now. You seem to have cut a thread.</i></p>

<li><i>You continue to believe that User:DrippingInk and User:Winnermario are sock puppets.</i></li>

<p>I agree with the user who has been blocked; 1) she seems to have been blocked in an attempt to exclude her from the conversation at the administrators' board in order for her to receive punishment without any objections or responses; 2) everyone believes the other accounts to be sock puppets which indicates that no one is following <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>; 3) is there a reason that User:Hollow Wilerding be punished for this in the first place? If there really are three separate users accessing the same computer, there is no reason to block all three of them because they did not want to speak the truth. This entire accusation is a form of abuse and also an example of over-powered admins whom have the ability to taunt oneself a bad name. Since no sysop has <i>verifiable</i> references or sources that User:Hollow Wilerding is one person, this block is unacceptable.

<p>64.231.128.57 immediately above is according to Kelly Martin's CheckUser check <b>probably being used by Hollow Wilerding</b>. It's in the same dynamic address range as the IP Hollow Wilerding posted from before she was blocked; it could theoretically have been used by another customer of the same ISP. But I don't believe that for a moment. (And no, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> actually <i>doesn't</i> mean "pretend you're stupid"; it means <i>assume</i> good faith, and if the assumption is disproved, so be it.) Here are some curious coincidences besdies CheckUser:</p>
<ol>
<li>The newbie anon is a wholehearted supporter of HW, which, not to put too fine a point on it, is a very unusual attitude outside of the small flock of users who live in HW's computer. No single user voted Support on HW's RFA.</li>
<li>HW has specifically expressed frustration at not being able to post to WP:ANI, and the anon has remedied that by moving a selected post from her talkpage here. The anon also actually raises the same point. Another similarity is that they share the same obsession with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, perhaps the only policy "they" know the name of, yet probably not the first that most people would refer to in a case like this.</li>
<li>After posting here, 64.231.128.57 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/64.231.128.57" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/64.231.128.57" rel="nofollow">went on to edit</a> several pop music articles, which is HW's great interest on Wikipedia. <i>Please note especially that the anon edited two articles, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garlic.html" title="Garlic">Garlic</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, that have nothing in common except the special interest HW takes in bringing them to FAC quality</i>, as shown on her talkpage (now deleted, but see the history).</li>
<li>64.231.128.57 talks like HW. Some people may consider this a subtle point, but I'm confident they'll know what I mean if they've read HW's articles before copyediting, or her input on talkpages. HW's writing style is very characteristic. Consider for instance the anon's phrase "over-powered admins whom have the ability to taunt oneself a bad name".</li>
</ol>
<p>IMO these points together easily amount to 100% certainty. I've blocked 64.231.128.57 for 8 hours only, on Kelly Martin's advice, to minimize any risk of collateral damage. I have also extended Hollow Wilerding's block to two weeks, starting now, for egregious block evasion and the attempt above to falsely insinuate support for her position as expressed <a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHollow_Wilerding_0116.html" title="User talk:Hollow Wilerding">on her talkpage</a> (go read it, folks!). If any more IPs from the same range should appear to edit HW's special-interest articles and/or support her position, I encourage admins to block them on sight. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:21, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could somebody help me here? I found an article that seems to defy any definition of a "good article" (it's extremely biased, outragious claims are made, and the sources used to back up those claims consist largely out of tiny newspaper snippets that are blown up out of proportion to make the subject sound like the second coming of the christ). So far, so easy, but there is a devoted following of wikipedia users that seems to prevent any sensible editing or removal of the article. What should I do? Article here: <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">Aladin</a>. Is there a way to look for sockpuppets in the article history and the currently running vote for deletion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">here</a>)?

<dd>Well, you've listed it in AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">here</a>, and an overwhelming number of editors, with no prior relation with the editing of the article, have voted for Strong keep (10 keep and strong keeps vs your single delete vote). Just because you have been thoroughly defeated in your nomination doesn't mean you have to go after the voters. And also, I strongly object to your accusation of the word <b>sockpuppet</b> here, people have voted according to their own judgement, which CAN go against your nomination. What you can do is to refrain from false accusations and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Personal attacks</a> like this.

<p>Maybe nominating it for deletion was not the best way to deal with the nauseatingly promotional text. Why not try making the tone encyclopedic, paragraph by painful paragraph?

<li>Hi, that's what I tried in the past 3 months - didn't work out (check the talk page and the history). But then again, if you remove all the promo-stuff, all that is left is an article about a unnotable person (abstract of aladin: he performs rarely, is portrayed in 1 book, and works for the City of London, that's all), so that's the reason why I nominated the article for deletion. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 22:31, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let me point out that many of the claims in notability in the article are highly deceptive. It, for example, quotes Inside Magic as having called him all sorts of great things, but actually reading the source shows that the editor of that publication had never even heard of the guy and was simply quoting a student newspaper, one that may have gotten information wrong or simply quoted from a press release supplied by the guy himself. The article in Inside MAgic was polite, but questioned the qaccuracy of one of the claims that magician made (to having allegedly quitting a society that didn't admit women, when he knows several women in the society). This whole article stinks to high heaven. Google results on this guy are practically nonexistent. There is no evidence of this person having ever actually won an award other than third hand info and the guy's own self-promotion, and the award certainly is not very ntoable in the field.</p>
<p>We need more editors to take a look at it, as it looks like a combination of spam/hoax going on here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:25, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The guy seems like an indefatigable self-promoter, but he IS featured in an up-coming National Geographic television feature <a href="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/SeriesSchedule.asp?Seriesid=385" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/SeriesSchedule.asp?Seriesid=385" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. I don't think they would have featured him if he were a complete hoaxer. Just clean up the article and don't try to delete, OK? If he's going to be on TV, people are going to be looking for him on Wikipedia. So, let them get a straight look without hype. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:34, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>TV stations have been duped before, Zora. Your linked program is about refugees, he was portrayed as a refugee. There are 100+ Million refugees in the world, not every one of those needs a wikipedia page (although they need shelter, food, money, peace and justice restored). The article claims "He performs from bombay to las vegas and has appeared on National Geographic", which is clearly a misleading statement. As I said before, once you cut through all the promo language, you end up with a boring person that doesn't warrant an entry in the wikipedia. Those are my reasons for delete. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:39, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regardless of everything else said above, I'm concerned about this issue because 30 hours after Peter S. listed this article on AfD, the discussion was closed as a "<b>Speedy keep</b>". Aren't we supposed to keep these debates open for seven days? Doing so would not harm the article (it's not going to be deleted <i>until</i> it gets a lot more votes for that). I just heard about this article, &amp; I feel that this premature closure of the matter will only harm this discussion over the article, &amp; lead to another listing on AfD almost immediately! -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Most seem to be of at least several months standing here, with at least hundreds of edits, and some are respected long-term editors.

Snowspinner has blocked the new account indefinitely. And I have blocked yet another IP from Hollow's range, 64.231.155.175, which was used to post on my page. If these accounts really have anything to do with the real person mentioned on the userpages, Toronto teacher Courtni Wilerding (which I doubt), I just hope school starts soon. The RFC hasn't actually been filed—it's not listed on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>—but it exists all right. I suppose I ought not to respond to it..? It's sort of temptiing, but it would be a) cruel, b) technically/policywise an atrocity, as it was created by a blocked user busy evading her block, and c) probably a waste of time, as I expect somebody or other will be in a hurry to delete it.

<dd>Bishonen - I am very offended by you accusing me of trolling, and by calling my behaviour silly or malicious, and your suggestion of any relation to Miss Wilerding.

<dd>Never did you encourage her to break the rules? You <i>helped</i> her break the rules. Or are you claiming you weren't aware that she was <b>blocked</b> when you supported and endorsed her so-called RFC on me—helping a blocked user evade her block, helping her create <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Bishonen_2b11.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen">a frivolous and absurd RFC</a>? Another question, from another angle: You're an established user. HW is obviously unrealistic and erratic in her notions of how wiki works, and of who her RFC would be embarrassing for. Couldn't you have told her what would happen? Didn't it occur to you to warn her against putting herself in the stocks like that, when she appealed to you to co-sign it? You must have had some idea what would happen. For your umbrage above: I'm by no means accusing you of any relation to HW. I'm only asking, because I would fain see <i>some</i> motive behind your incomprehensible behavior. I <i>am</i> accusing you of silliness and/or malice, yes.

<p>Since the previous discussion has become hopelessly stupid, I am lifting the block on Marsden. If he continues the trolling behavior that got me to put the block up in the first place, I am reinstating it at indefinite. My reasoning in this will be simple - Marsden exhibits behavior that has gotten many people banned before. He exhibits this behavior unrepentantly. He is, in short, more or less certain to get himself banned. Given the choice between a drawn out process that will result in a circus as he rants about the Injustice of it All, or quietly shooting him as the foregone conclusion that it is, I pick the latter.</p>
<p>If and when I reblock Marsden, I invite any admin to undo the block PROVIDED that they can actually give a substantive reason why the block is in error. That is to say, I do not care if it is against procedure - I want to know what's wrong with it. Procedure is not and never has been an end in itself on Wikipedia. But perhaps Marsden will take a lesson from the fact that he is so very close to the edge,and change his behavior - we'll see. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:52, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Phil, I suspect I speak for not a small number of Wikipedians when I ask, who exactly do you think you are? You seem to imagine that you are some sort of savior for Wikipedia, breaking all the rules in order to ... well, it's not clear exactly what you intend. Why shouldn't someone shoot you rather than me, Phil?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your comment on unblocking me, Phil ("OK, let's give Marsden a happy 'one last chance' and then see what happens."), belies what I think is a perverted understanding of what Wikipedia is: ultimately, this is a <i>charitable</i> effort, manned by <i>volunteers</i>. "One last chance," Phil? There seems to be a corrupt attitude among a lot of Wikipedians, especially admins (and cerrtainly not just you, Phil), that it is <i>punishment</i> to ban someone from Wikipedia. How long do you think the Red Cross would tolerate a volunteer manager who insisted that some other volunteers were unworthy of stacking sandbags against a rising river? And yet, isn't this pretty much the role you have tried to carve out for yourself at Wikipedia?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whenever Wikipedia drives away another editor of good faith, that ultimately is a loss for Wikipedia. Sometimes it no doubt is necessary, but to relish doing it, as you seem to do, frankly suggests some significant moral defects.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My participation in Wikipedia became relegated to trying to counter what I see as part of its systemic bias. This wasn't by choice, and anyone who thinks I enjoyed it should take a look at the early work I did make glacially paced changes at the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> article, and explain for themselves how <i>anyone</i> could enjoy that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But in doing this, I encountered an obstruction of reliable methods of inquiry from a couple other editors here: circular objections to changes, and the revert warring that sadly is ultimately what decides what stays in Wikipedia. It was not me, between myself and the group of editors that I have had conflicts with, who first abandoned discussion and reason in deciding what should be in Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the regime is very strong. I don't know the extent to which different editors are consciously promoting propaganda as opposed to just reflexively attacking any threat to an establishment that they see themselves as a part of, but at this point Wikipedia systemically makes unwelcome (to say the least) anyone who questions certain aspects of the project. That sort of attitude inevitably leads to a spiral descent.</dd>

<dd>With the comment that "Snowspinner was right", but as far as I can see, no other contribution to the debate. Great - doesn't he have better things to do than randomly over-rule community discussions? And more generally, what broader conclusions do we draw if Snowspinner's actions were entirely 100% correct (including failure to notify anyone of an indefinite ban, never mind justify it with anything other than block summary "hopeless troll" and WP:AN remark "Wikipedia does not need trolls with nothing better to do than accuse Jimbo of stacking the arbcom with Zionist Randroids.")? How long before users can be banned permanently by any of 1000+ admins (not there yet, give it time) for being persistently annoying or strongly backing a POV an admin disagrees with? This is a dangerous precedent, IMO. It's a slippery slope when you prioritise ends over means; product (user getting banned for bad behaviour) over process (proving that behaviour was bad enough to deserve it, and that ban has nothing to do with content dispute). Frankly, in circumstances where the user accuses editors of bias, we should be <i>more</i> careful about process not less, for reasons that should be obvious. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 00:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First, I am part of the community process, not overruling it, and acting in this instance perfectly in line with our longstanding norms and traditions. Second, I'm quite sympathetic with concerns about slippery slope problems and the importance of process over results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, in line with longstanding policy, Snowspinner made a block which not one of our hundreds of admins was willing to overturn -- to me, this suggests a very strong consensus that could be formalized with a poll or something but to be honest, why bother?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indefinite in this case does not mean infinite. If you'd like to start a poll or something as to whether he should be let back in, or start an arbcom case requesting the arbcom to consider letting him back in, I won't stand in the way. But, I think you can guess what the result would be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's another slippery slope to worry about, and this is that good people, thoughtful admins who care about quality, are frequently burned out by our excessive tolerance of nutcases. This can lead to a tendency over time toward having increasing tolerance of trolls and increased influence of trolls over policy. A very important counter-measure towards this race to the bottom is for us all to step back now and then and say, right then, this kind of thing is simply not welcome here, end of story.

<li>"I am part of the community process, not overruling it" - AFAIK, you didn't contribute to the discussion prior to your action, which was what I was referring to when I said "over-rule community discussions" (<i>not</i> "process"). The result of those discussions was that Snowspinner changed his mind (albeit mostly to get shot of the issue) and gave Marsden one more chance, unblocking him. You then overruled Snowspinner's change of mind with the comment "Snowspinner was right", and no other explanation. Frankly that strikes me as an odd and illadvised thing to do, unless you saw something inappropriate in the single contribution (comment above) Marsden made in the intervening period.</li>
<li>"Snowspinner made a block which not one of our hundreds of admins was willing to overturn" is incorrect: after the ban was brought to community attention (a week after it was done), and some discussion, I overturned it in favour of a 1 month block, and after that was reversed another admin overturned it again in the same way. And I recall a comment that a third would have done it if he didn't have Arbitration issues to worry about.</li>
<li>"Indefinite in this case does not mean infinite.". Really? Then what is the process by which indefinite is turned into definite? Is appeal to Arbcom really the appropriate means for dealing with all such concerns? (If there's another means, what is it?)</li>
<li>If "tolerance of trolls" is a problem we should define banning policy in a way that possible trolls can be warned of behaviour to avoid, and that admins considering such bans can use as a reliable yardstick (or at least a guide). "Trolling" is far too subjective a notion for as large a community as ours to allow individual admins to ban people on the basis of accusations of trolling without any attempt to prove it or to gain second opinion from others to support that judgement. That doesn't require the formality of Arbcom, but it requires <i>some kind of process</i>.</li>
<li>Failure of other admins to overturn a ban doesn't constitute process, because (a) we don't know the number of admins we can plausibly expect to <i>notice</i> a ban (even when it's announced properly, which it wasn't in this case) (b) we don't know the number of admins who'll serious consider evaluating the case; (c) the respect admins generally pay to other admins' decisions, mostly for reasons of practical efficiency (we'll generally assume there are aspects of a complex case that aren't obvious, and rely on others' judgement). In other words, the failure of anyone to overturn a ban cannot reasonably be taken as an endorsement: only explicit statements of support can be counted on. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 21:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"If I had the time to really thoroughly investigate several pending cases, I'd indefinitely block at least 20 more like him tomorrow." Which cuts to the heart of the problem: if we had a policy which was well-defined enough to deal with this sort of behaviour consistently, the risk of appearing to arbitrarily exercise these powers would be rather less. Perhaps you could suggest some changes to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:banning policy</a> to help clarify these kinds of situation in future. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 21:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Rd232, you distinguish between "process" and "discussion" somewhat disingenuously here, IMHO. Do you seriously expect that every time a user reads something on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or anywhere else, for that matter, and agrees with a statement someone makes, that they should clutter up the page and the servers by saying "I agree!"? Do you seriously think that Jimbo doesn't have this page on his watchlist? Categorically, "indefinite...does not mean infinite". Look it up in a dictionary. Jimbo even said that he wouldn't stand in the way of an arbcom case regarding the matter, <i>or even a poll</i>. The argument that an arbcom case has already been brought and rejected out of hand isn't going to hack it in this case, since the arbcom case was horrendously written, accusing a number of parties of being involved in "the dispute" without any indication as to <i>how</i> they're involved. It's even a stretch to say <i>I</i> was involved, yet I'm listed as an involved party. Not only that, but there was never any evidence presented that the supposedly "involved parties" were ever informed of the RfAr. If you value "procedure" so highly, do a decent job of creating an RfAr and maybe your complaints will fall on more fertile ground. As for your claim that the ban was not announced properly, that's just plain wrong. The fact that Marsden's defenders didn't notice the announcement for a week is an indictment against them, not against the process you claim to hold in such high regard. As for your recommendation that Jimbo propose changes to the blocking policy, perhaps you should consider doing so as well, since you seem to feel that the policy there doesn't sufficiently protect Marsden [in this case] from abusive admins. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Groan. (I didn't want to rehash this again; and you don't seem to have read my and Jimbo's comments as carefully as you might.) Fine. 1. The distinction between process and discussion arose from Jimbo saying he was part of the community process, missing the point because I'd complained that he'd acted without taking part in the discussion. 2. This (users don't say "I agree!") is precisely my point: absence of evidence of disagreement is not evidence of existence of agreement. But when relying (implicitly or explicitly) on the "community patience" provision of banning policy, it would seem reasonable to require some evidence of agreement. 3. "indefinite...does not mean infinite". - see my point 3 above. 4. As I've said repeatedly, I didn't want an RfAr or anything like that; I just wanted a straight answer, with some evidence, on why Marsden deserved an indefinite block; or, failing that, a revision of the block. 5. The ban was not properly announced (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive59#Marsden" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive59#Marsden" rel="nofollow">here</a>), because it omitted the rather crucial fact that the ban was indefinite. 6. I would suggest changes to blocking policy, but given the existence of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EControversial_blocks_d1da.html" title="Wikipedia:Controversial blocks">Wikipedia:Controversial blocks</a>, and Jimbo's endorsement of Snowspinner's action, it would seem pointless (or at any rate, low point-to-effort ratio). 7. If you multiply the Marsden case by 1000, allow for ever looser interpretation of policy and increasing number of admins, and you will soon have something resembling the "Wild West". <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point I'm trying to make is that you seem to prioritize process when it suits you, but not when it doesn't. The blocking policy says that we can't block where we're involved in the content dispute. You made a comment on the talk page shortly before the block that directly opposed the position RJII was reverting over, thereby involving yourself in the dispute, so strictly speaking you should not have blocked him, especially when the first admin to deal with the violation had decided not to. That's my only point. I agree that process should not be prioritized over product, I agree that RJII deserved a block, and I personally have no problem with you doing it. I'm only asking for consistency. Just as you're asking people to trust your judgement as an admin regarding RJII (even if strictly speaking the block may have been a violation of the blocking policy), so other admins were asking you to trust their judgement regarding Marsden. We do have to trust each other's judgement, even on occasions where we may not agree with it. If we don't, the result is these very harmful block wars. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've explained that I did not consider myself <i>involved in the content dispute</i>. (I've also explained - on my talk page discussion with you - why I took action when another admin didn't: inaction was driving editors away.) Now others may disagree as to whether I was involved or not, but I object to what amounts to an accusation of hypocrisy, that I will preach on process but ignore it myself. As to the block war: yes, that was exceedingly silly, since the discussion was ongoing and there were over two weeks left on the 1 month block I instituted: i.e. no pressing need for anyone to pre-empt ongoing discussion as to what the appropriate length was, and the resulting to-and-fro about indefinite or 1-month blocks. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 15:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the record, Snowspinner unblocked Karmafist (but not himself), claming that my 3RR block was unjustified. Judging it was inappropriate for him, as involved party, to decide that, I reblocked Karmafist.

<p>I'm appalled by all of this - the pile-onto Kelly, the opposition to alleviating that pile-on, the wheelwarring on karmafist's part, the wheel warring on SCZenz's part in his blocks, Aaron's apparent determination to step up his hostility in light of his admonishment - everything. This is not an environment in which people committed to what Wikipedia actually is can survive - they are forced to choose between watching the place come down around them, or behaving unacceptably in a desperate attempt to extinguish the forest fire.

This is not to excuse the other wheel warriors, but give me a break...

<dd>You don't get it, do you? I fucked up. I wheel warred. The problem is that there isn't another option to fix the problems. The problem is that every decision making process through which one could raise a reasoned objection has become clogged with the exact crap I'm objecting to. The only way to oppose it is to wheel war and push on with no regard for the consequences. Which is what I did. That is also, however, reinforcing the fundamental problem. So there's nothing to do.

<dd>Oh please, this sounds like hyperbolic <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken_Little_8ba3.html" title="Chicken Little">Chicken Little</a>-ing; Wikipedia worked mostly well yesterday, and, barring further wheel wars, will tomorrow. I get it. "<i>The only way to oppose it is to wheel war</i>" is overblown and preposterous. Edit warriors and uncivil people are fond of saying edit warring is the justified to correct POV, or that they don't need to be civil to POV pushers. And we're all fond of telling them that edit warring is <i>never</i> warranted, and that civility is <i>not</i> negotiable. I never thought I'd have to tell an admin that <i>wheel wars</i> are never okay. If there is something so fundamentally wrong with the system (IAR and all) that you cannot act without wheel warring, then perhaps you ought to say that and fix the system before wheel warring. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:13, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Users in good standing are naturally subject to shorter blocks than well-known troublemakers and (sadly) newbies and unknown editors. There's nothing wrong with being more lenient to admins, who as a general rule (there are exceptions) have a looong history of good behaviour and trustworthiness. The issue becomes when one decides that an admin has used up his supply of goodwill, and I'm not certain we're particularly good at judging that. When admins <i>do</i> meet up with the Cluestick of Fate, they seem unreasonably surprised, and that's surely an indicator that something's wrong.

<dd>Perhaps we ought to not use the full 24 hour block for 3RR violations unless it is a repeated violation. The main idea behind the 3RR is to <i>stop</i> people from edit warring, not to <i>punish</i> them for doing so. That is why we don't block people for 3RR violations which are a week old. If a one hour block is sufficient to stop the user from edit warring so that s/he can return to make good edits to other articles after the block has expired isn't that better than imposing the full 24 hours? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>(this might not be the best place for this) I started really adding to WP a little bit back (about a month). I thought I could really add to something to WP, by editing, getting experience - I was aspiring to be an admin to really help make this an encylopedia to is useful to me and others. But see what has happened (to KM, above) and seeing that even admins act like immature brats as well has made me totally disheartened and I think that the situation is now getting to the stage where it is <i>driving editors away from WP</i>. This is getting rediculous. (will I get blocked for this?) <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 10:25, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>ScZenz was absolutely in the right here, If I were him, I would have done the exact same thing.</li>
<li>Since nobody was responding on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html#User:Snowspinner" title="WP:AN/3RR">AN/3RR</a>, I had to IAR and stop Snowspinner's premature IARing since there was no policies or guidelines backing his actions.(all of this could have been easily avoided if Snowspinner went to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> instead of feeling that he was above doing so like everyone else)</li>
<li>Novacatz has gotten it right, and I think the comment he says at the end says it all. Right now certain people at the top echelons believe that they're above anything and can destroy users acting in good faith at their whim. If this continues, you will have a never ending series of things such as what happened last night or a never ending series of people leaving because they feel as though their voice will just be ignored. I've seen two people this week, and several more on the verge(when Redwolf24 is almost there, you know it's gotten bad)</li>
<li>I didn't particularly want to do what I did, but I'll act similiarly if I have to. And at this point, it looks like I probably will unless the community at large says to people like Snowspinner and Kelly Martin and even me that acting unilaterally is not necessary and will be stopped. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 13:22, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Snowspinner and Karmafist have both acknowledged that they broke process and 'acted unilaterally', but have stated that this was necessary for the good of Wikipedia. <b>No</b>. <i>Not</i> breaking process is what is <i>necessary</i> for the good of Wikipedia. How can <b>anyone</b> see that it is wrong and harmful for &lt;person A&gt; to go outside process, but not for <i>them</i> to do so? Wikipedia operates on consensus. This shouldn't be a new concept. Someone does something you don't agree with you go through the process... think those userboxes are harmful? Nominate some on TfD, start an RfC on whether they should be deleted, and/or talk to Jimbo about it. Wikipedia will not collapse and die if those userboxes stay around a few more days. Don't like a shortcut to an RfC on the mass userbox deletion? Put it on RfD... Wikipedia will not collapse and die if that redirect stays around a few days. Don't like the summary deletion of the shortcut? Put it on DRV... Wikipedia will not collapse and die if that redirect is missing for a few days. The fact that someone else violated process or policy (CIV/NPA come to mind) is the <i>worst</i> possible reason to do so yourself. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. Putting your own viewpoint of what is good for Wikipedia over the will of everyone else is 'killing Wikipedia to save it'. <b>Consensus</b> is the cornerstone of <b>everything</b> we do here. Putting oneself above that consensual process is <i>always</i> wrong... even if you are completely correct in your views of 'what is best'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CBD, you could have easily stopped things last night rather than getting up on your pulpit here, once again. Snowspinner would have likely reverted on DRV, RFD or elsewhere in this case since he feels justified to do whatever he wants, something you've said about me. Our world slowly <i>is</i> going blind, and that's not going to stop until fullscale reforms of all policies and guidelines occur.

<dd>Heh. Karmafist, I spent last night experimenting with the complexities of WeebleCode vs hiddenStructures and inventing what I think may be a radical new way of performing content variation (or a way to give all the devs coronaries... the jury's still out). I couldn't have 'stopped' last night 'cuz I wasn't part of the bickering last night. I provided some examples when requested and disagreed with the view that calling something 'moronic' wasn't a personal attack, but I was pulpit free. Yup, today we've got a pulpit. It needed to be said... even if you didn't hear it.

<p>This mess has stemmed from the actions of two people, yet seems to be dragging a whole lot more folks into it, as well as the image of admins in general. Overall, the issue that has been argued over is, as usual in these circumstances, a tiny one. We know that Karma and Phil both violated 3RR, and wheel warred into the blue with themselves and others. Blocking again is just going to cause more problems, and is ultimately futile anyway (though ScZenz was right in his actions). So, Karma and Phil should both <i>volunteer</i> a total 24 hour wikibreak - no blocking or unblocking or reverting, just step back for a day, take a nap, get a bite to eat... the differences between the involved parties seem too large for them to drop it, but they should at least try to chill a bit when they come back. Anyone else involved should leave them alone, too, if they aggree. If they aggree, January 4, 0:00 UTC to January 4, 23:59 UTC seems reasonable to me. --Jeffrey O.

So, is there any other avenue to stop this guy from making personal attacks on me other than ArbCom? --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 20:15, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I request <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra2_3a78.html" title="User:Dijxtra2">User:Dijxtra2</a> to be blocked, as it is obvious this acount is yet another sok puppet of the same person, and is stealing my identity. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 21:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I officially abandon this case. I contemplated about this situation and came to conclusion my actions are only worsening the situation and that I'm <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_feed_the_troll.html" title="Don't feed the troll">feeding the troll</a>. I requested my user page to be protected, and I'm not going to do any more reverts of this users actions as he seems to think I'm terrorising him for some wierd reasons (calling me a nazi, d'oh). I made my point, administrators are aware of this guy now. If somebody decides to put this guy before the ArbCom, I'd be more than thrilled to write a statement and do some digging on his contributions (apart from that alreadly supplied). Now I'll go do some usefull stuff. Cheerz, <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 10:58, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that either 1) <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBeckjord_caa6.html" title="User:Beckjord">User:Beckjord</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Joe_5203.html" title="User:Dr Joe">User:Dr Joe</a> are one and the same, or 2) they are acting in concert. It would be useful to know if Dr Joe is a sock- or meatpuppet of Beckjord, so appropriate administrative action can be taken.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBeckjord_caa6.html" title="User:Beckjord">User:Beckjord</a> is none other than <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Beckjord_11b0.html" title="Erik Beckjord">Erik Beckjord</a>, a "professional" paranormal researcher who insists on inserting his own unsourced POV claims into <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> and the article about himself. He is the proprietor of <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.beckjord.com/" rel="nofollow">beckjord.com</a>; at one point he published a "call to arms" to the readers of his site, asking them to come defend his POV on the Bigfoot article, among others. He has since taken the notice down from his site, but the effects still linger; the article has been semi-protected at least once to deal with repeated copyvio/POV postings. Beckjord refuses to read, understand, or abide by the most fundamental of Wikipedia policies. I have asked him countless times to read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, with various brush-offs.</p>
<p>Beckjord has a unique posting style. It is not clear whether or not English is his first language, and he typically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeckjord&amp;diff=33568113&amp;oldid=33566426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeckjord&amp;diff=33568113&amp;oldid=33566426" rel="nofollow">inserts unneeded line breaks</a> into his posts, as if it is necessary to hit Enter when one comes to the end of the edit box. Dr Joe has also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33818802" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33818802" rel="nofollow">exhibited</a> this same tendency, as if he either <i>is</i> Beckjord or is being fed material by him, inserted verbatim into articles. They also have the same style of "citing" their claims: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=32748626&amp;oldid=32746092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=32748626&amp;oldid=32746092" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> (compare to above diff of Dr Joe's edit).</p>
<p>Beckjord recently indicated he is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beckjord&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33688969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beckjord&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33688969" rel="nofollow">"leaving town"</a> for a time.

Dr Joe is remarkably proficient for a new user, even using abbreviations such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mythology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33819143" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mythology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33819143" rel="nofollow">rv</a> in edit summaries. He also made one revert (see previous diff) to <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">Mythology</a>; the user he reverted was <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">User:DreamGuy</a>, often referred to as an "opponent" or "enemy" by Beckjord.</p>
<p>The pattern here is obvious, but I am asking for CheckUser here so we can nip this situation in the bud with definitive evidence, if it exists. It's clear that neither Beckjord nor his supporters are interested in contributing meaningfully to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> or other articles. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 14:15, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure Dr Joe and Beckjord have done anything which makes their sockpuppetry improper (any 3RR evasions, block evasions, vote-stacking, or anything?) so there may not be grounds for a CheckUser.

<p>He is clearly not willing to listed to me, and I've made myself a party to this "dispute" anyway, so if some other "neutral" admins could <i>please</i> try to explain to him why he should be following the rules even if he disagree with them, in a way that doesn't trigger his rebellious streak I would apreciate it.

<dd>I spoke to Karmafist on several occasions, both on here and IRC, and he really just wants to wait for a real world response, which I frankly told him there will be none. I state this since laws take a long time to catch up to copyright and until "our issue" is dealt with by the courts, we will have to follow the guidelines on what we have at WP:FU and WP:FUC. Fair use is a grey area that many of us have little to no understanding of, but I stand behind the efforts of the above posters, and myself, for removing all Fair use images in userboxes. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use policy</a></sup></small> 00:00, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't know whether this a vandalism, or lack of good faith, but <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> is making destructive edits, and without following Wiki guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>I created a new article called "Intrinsic redshift" (latest version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33745333&amp;oldid=33729914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33745333&amp;oldid=33729914" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>), and invited other editors to take a look and comment (which they did).</li>
<li>Within 24 hours, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> created an Article for Deletion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> (AfD), fair enough, but without any discussion with any of the editors.</li>
<li>I note from the Wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion" rel="nofollow">Guide to Deletion</a> page the following guidelines: "<b>Do not remove or modify other people's comments</b> even if you believe them to be in bad faith". (my emphasis)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Yet a check of the AfD history shows that <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> has indeed moved two comments to the AfD's talk page (1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33726919&amp;oldid=33718936" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33726919&amp;oldid=33718936" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> (2) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33727031&amp;oldid=33726919" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33727031&amp;oldid=33726919" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></li>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Now <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> has withdrawn the AfD, and "rewritten" or "blanked" most of the existing article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33862045&amp;oldid=33749304" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33862045&amp;oldid=33749304" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, again without any discussion.</li>
<li>Unfortunately <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a>'s User page is protected, so I am unable to place a Vandalism template on it, though I have made this clear on the article talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Intrinsic_redshift#Joshua.27s_article_re-write" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Intrinsic_redshift#Joshua.27s_article_re-write" rel="nofollow">[45]</a></li>
<li>There were over 50 citations in the original article that have been deleted.</li>
<li>Wiki policy on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a> states that "Wikipedia should only publish material that is verifiable"</li>

<ul>
<li>Yet <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> is currently claiming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33867022&amp;oldid=33865234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33867022&amp;oldid=33865234" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> that ""Plasma redshift" doesn't exist.

<p>It looks like the user is a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationist.html" title="Creationist">creationist</a> partly pretending to be an anti-creationist (hence the user name).

<p>I unblocked because it had been about three hours and it was catching a legitimate user. If there is further vandalism from this range, you can assume the vandal to have been warned but you might want to block for less than 24 hours, given its a range on an ISP. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 06:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look at this: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sunfazer/Obesity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sunfazer/Obesity" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>] to see a new template I have designed that will alert the editor that an article is subject to edit wars. I would like to know if this is a good template. --Sunfazer 11:12, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what the point of it is. How would you see it being used? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 11:54, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh edit warring shouldn't link to edit conflict. They are different things. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 12:43, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The nature of a lot of article space templates is of a 'temporary alert' style, indicating something within the article is needing of attention. We've got templates to alert others to <i>wikify this</i>, to <i>copyedit that</i>, and to <i>expand this</i> too. I feel your template comes across as more of a permanent alert. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 12:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having seen the Jeremy Clarkson talkpage and the edit history of the article, I thought this would be a useful idea. It can be removed when the edit war cools off. --Sunfazer 12:28, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have a controversial one somewhere. It has less of a "this article is broken and should be ignored" feel about it. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 12:38, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
