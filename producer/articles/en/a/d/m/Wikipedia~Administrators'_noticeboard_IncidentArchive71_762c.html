<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive71_762c.html" title="Edit section: Netoholic blocked">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Netoholic blocked</span></h2>
<p>Per his ArbCom case, Netoholic is under a mandatory <a href="../../../1/r/r/WP%7E1RR_8afd.html" title="WP:1RR">one-revert rule</a>, and under restriction regarding the Wikipedia and Template namespaces. We are generally tolerant about his contributions to those namespaces because they're mostly positive and constructive.</p>
<p>However, Neto is currently party to <i>five</i> different revert wars, on three templates ({{<a href="../../../m/e/s/Template%7EMessage_e9ba.html" title="Template:Message">Message</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguageicon_274e.html" title="Template:Languageicon">Languageicon</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_a3dd.html" title="Template:Infobox">Infobox</a>}}), one template-related page (<a href="../../../m/e/t/Wikipedia%7EMeta-templates_3a8a.html" title="Wikipedia:Meta-templates">Wikipedia:Meta-templates</a>) and one article (<a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">Leet</a>). Revert wars are generally understood as disruptive, and he has violated his "one revert" restriction on several of these.</p>
<p>Hence, he has been blocked for 24 hours. Netoholic is requested to discuss controversial changes on the relevant talk pages, and to seek consensus on the issues involved. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANetoholic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ANetoholic" rel="nofollow">Neto's block history</a> show a remarkable facility for being unblocked without actually reforming his behaviour? In the last month he has been blocked 4 times for edit-warring and breaching his ArbCom restrictions, only to be unblocked almost immediately with a comment along the lines of "you children really should learn to get along": on 2 of those occasions a 24-hour block was reversed within <i>20 minutes</i>, and on one occasion having been unblocked 5 hours into a 24-hour block, he was re-blocked 90 minutes later for continuing to "make threats".</p>
<p>Those of us who have borne the brunt of his bad temper end up feeling like the victim of the school bully who is the "teachers' pet": we simply get patted on the head and told that we're probably provoking him. Neto began his <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> crusade on the strength of advice from <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a>, which he represented as the combined opinion of the development team: he appeared to recruit a team of admins who were willing to support his continued activities of intimidation and threatening behaviour even when they were in direct contravention of his ArbCom restrictions. Even now that <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> has stepped in and revealed that the situation was not nearly so grave as alleged by Neto, he has continued to insist that his opinion is correct—even alleging that Brion "would of course say that" the servers could take the strain "because he's paid for taking care of them" (my paraphrasing, which could probably do with a bit of merciless tightening-up).</p>
<p>Is there any chance that someone who has been the subject of an ArbCom case, and been heavily restricted as a result, might be actually made subject to those restrictions, or must those of us who have never even yet been the subject of an RFC continue to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in the teeth of abundant contrary evidence? —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 16:46, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think my block history shows that some admins are more than willing to "shoot the messenger". Every blocking admin was directly involved in a dispute with me either over a specific template they <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNed</a>, or on the <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> guideline itself. Wikipedia should be proud of the fact that there are more admins that can see through these sorts of non-neutral blocks. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK... if I'm reading the History right <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">User:InkSplotch</a> archived the <i>whole</i> page "per David Gerard" (who had asked for archiving because the page was so big, but had not expressed any wish that active discussions be buried alive). If I had noticed before a lot of new stuff had been added to the page, I would have reverted. The lively discussion I came here to post on has been left in the air, for example. We have an archiving bot, right? The bot archives discussions that have had no input for three days. If the page still gets too large (yes, I know that the page still does get too large), I suggest that the bot be set to archive after a day and a half, as a better alternative than killing active discussions ad hoc from time to time. Can we agree to change the setting of the archivebot, please? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:28, 1 February 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, David's request was simply to "archive" without details (it's available in the History from my link above), and my main fault was trying to archive things the same way I've seen people archive their talk pages - en masse. As soon as Cryptic pointed out what I'd done to active discussions (not to mention fumbling <i>where</i> I put the archive, and fouling up the nav boxes), I realized that a page like this <i>has</i> to be handled differently. I put that up to my own inexperience.</dd>
<dd>As for bots, well, I noticed the nav boxes seem to update via bots, but I don't know about the main page. If there is such a bot for archiving this page, may I suggest a (templated?) notice to keep well-meaning sorts like myself out of trouble? If there isn't, then I'm going to pay closer attention to how this page is manually archived around active/inactive discussions and perhaps go make some updates to <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EArchive_8a9c.html" title="WP:Archive">WP:Archive</a>. I'll make something useful out of myself if it kills me. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a><sup>(<a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkSplotch_71d8.html" title="User talk:InkSplotch">talk</a>)</sup> 17:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

</dd>
<dd>I can, probably without too much trouble, make the bot tailor the lagtime such that the current page is a given length after archiving. Pick a size and I'll see what I can do. (For the record, I think the root problem is that too much is posted here that should be somewhere else - straightforward requests to block a user (with subsequent comments about the lingerie), or protect a page, or edit a protected page - and we should just move them to the proper place. Or I can make the bot look for sections with little &lt;!--archivenow--&gt; html comments and archive those immediately when it sees them regardless of the timestamps.) —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 17:30, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You could perhaps make it so that, if the page is over 256kiB, it agressively prunes sections until it falls below that mark, even if 36 hours didn't pass yet (of course, archiving the older sections first). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 19:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I like the idea of the bot having the ability to archive sections tagged with html comments, as mentioned above.

<dd>Yes, but because this page is so closely monitored the tag could easily be reverted or removed for clearly active discussions. The 'bot wouldn't archive immediately.

<p>I bring this up not just to draw attention to the block, but to the removal of behavior warnings as a method to avoid consequences for bad behavior. We have generally "frowned upon," but not taken any action regarding, a user who removes such warnings from their talk page. But I think this stems from a day when most regulars had a general idea of what was going on with most problem users, and this isn't the case anymore. Most likely, if I am looking into bad behavior I won't know what warnings someone has received in the past, and with an extensive talk page history I don't think it's reasonable to delve through every one looking to see if they are there. That means that everyone who issues warnings has to keep an "eye" on people they've warned, lest they avoid further consequences for their bad behavior. I suggest instead we make it a practice generally to revert the removal of behavior warnings on user talk pages.</p>

<dd>Ideally, they'd stick until they were "properly" archived. But as David says, we have no real policy about how people manage their talk page in general, and many "editors in good standing" delete messages from their page, so it's hard to tell the "bad editors" they mustn't, or that warning messages are the unstated exception. (Recently I replaced such warnings on someone's talk page, twice, only to be told that I'd reverted five times, and thus needed to be blocked (and incidentally that another party had also reverted five times (when they had not), and needed to be blocked). He, OTOH, despite having 3RR'd both on this occasion and many recent priors, was of course being "unfairly" blocked. Silly me for not working all that out, obviously.)</dd>
<dd>In extreme cases, there's the option of adding them to the user:-space page and protecting, but that's not reasonable for simple warnings. The most likely karmic comeback for this is if someone files a 3RR or other "incident" report, and mentions the earlier warning(s) and removal of same, the admin attending to it is likely to take this into account, and if so very likely to the further detriment of the offending party. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree.

<dd>I agree with Demi - Jimbo's actions seem reasonable based upon what we can know from the diffs and the explanation Jimbo gave. I have personally removed comments from a Talk page when I had reason to believe they were harmful. As Demi says, the info is still in the history if it is needed for the discussion. This is a reasonable middle-ground between ignoring the complaint and over-reacting to the complaint by deleting page history. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Let's see what Jimbo actually says: "As a courtesy to a complainant, I have blanked this talk page. I'm not sure what the complaint meant exactly, but I see no harm in blanking this." If we don't even know what the complaint is about, how do we know not to add the disputed material back into the talk page or article?

Perhaps this complaint was "Marc Tufano" related. A few weeks back, an anonymous user (195.93.*.*, AOL in the UK) kept adding "Marc Tufano" information (hoax or prank) into various articles including <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Stone_5228.html" title="Oliver Stone">Oliver Stone</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_De_Niro_be83.html" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../7/7/t/77th_Academy_Awards_2627.html" title="77th Academy Awards">77th Academy Awards</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_Di_Caprio_79fc.html" title="Leonardo Di Caprio">Leonardo Di Caprio</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pacino_b483.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Cage_5687.html" title="Nicholas Cage">Nicholas Cage</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Ford_Coppola_16ad.html" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="../../../g/w/y/Gwyneth_Paltrow_5079.html" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and a number of other articles, suggesting that this "Marc Tufano" was the favorite actor or close friend or co-producer or whatever of all of these. More obscurely, he also posted to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reg_Cox_90cf.html" title="Reg Cox">Reg Cox</a> claiming that "Marc Tufano" guest-starred in one episode as the young Reg Cox in <a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>; IMDB does not corroborate this (it does list a Marc Tufano with only one acting credit, which is not EastEnders).</p>
<p>I suspect it was that odd message posted to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_characters_from_EastEnders_e01a.html" title="Talk:List of characters from EastEnders">Talk:List of characters from EastEnders</a>, signed under the name of "MS Tufano", that was the reason for the blanking. It's not clear what this person is referring to, I think possibly some kind of family or child custody type dispute (based on some other talk page messages which I can't find a link for at the moment).</p>
<p>Still, blanking the entire talk page was overkill, as there were perfectly valid discussions on other topics such as "Little Mo/Kacey Ainsworth" which were only a few days old and not in need of archiving. Why not just remove the Tufano stuff if necessary and leave the rest? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:19, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think that matters like this promote a certain "huh?" factor when it's not 100% clear in what capacity it's being done (maybe we should develop a Wikipedia:Simon Says policy to the effect that one must announce "in my capacity as an admin/bureaucrat/FAD/arbcom member/developer/godking/other I hereby..."), nor why it's being done. So people don't know if they're "allowed" to undo the edit, or what other solutions might achieve the desired effect. So in this case, an obvious alternative is to archive (the whole page, or the particular section in question, if that <i>is</i> the particular section), but if what's wanted is to (in the fullness of time) take the page off google and the mirrors too, that might not be sufficient. I'm extrapolating here from the reasoning expressed in a similar concern about AfD archives. Obviously the material's still in the history anyway, so <i>total</i> elimination of this material isn't at issue at present, and would require further admin action. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't feel Jimbo should be blanking pages like that. I also don't think that Demi should have reinstated the blanked page after it had been reverted. If that had been any other editor, people would have been screeching on ANI about how unilateral and bad faith it was. I'm inclined to restore the comments. Again. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 01:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest that a consensus be reached before a wheel war is begun. The reasonings behind such blankings aren't to obscure prior discussion, they are to prevent the often-negative nature of such discussions to be indexed by search engines. Due to Wikipedia's high rankings in search engines such as Google, a discussion filled with comments such as "Person isn't notable at all, not important, DELETE" can rise to the top of search results for a person's name, even if they had absolutely nothing to do with the creation of the article in question. I think we can all agree that this is not an aim of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>How about some sort of boilerplate message be applied to pages blanked in this fashion referring viewers to look at the history of the page in question for past discussion? In this way, absolutely no discussion is lost, and any user, anonymous, users, and administrators alike, can view the discussion, without it possibly affecting the person/organization personally. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><strong><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100">« give me a ring »</font></a> 01:56, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like this, and I support blankings of this sort in the future, though perhaps more selective if there is ongoing discussion about other topics. It removes the main source of harm while leaving discussion available in history. And for the record, if this had been any other editor, I should hope no one would have immediately gone "screeching [...] about how unilateral and bad faith it was", but would, rather, ask first why it was done. If the reason was not "I wanted to vandalize pages!"—which it generally isn't—surely either a compromise could be found (such as, say, a boilerplate message saying the discussion has been removed, please see history) or a more helpful explanation given for those who might question it. (As for Jimbo's actions, I do tend to assume he's got some sort of good reason for them and deserves at least to be heard out.) <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 04:48, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We must begin with the definition of the "right" thing to do, upon which there is clearly disagreement. These actions are not anti-<i>process</i> but anti-<i>consensus</i>. Despite cries of "moribund" and "process wonking" by IAR bandits, what is being discarded is careful, thoughtful discussion by editors who understand there exists a place for respectful disagreement and eventual compromise.</li>

<dd>The hilarity for me has been watching a malformed RFC start, get 20+ supports for Tony, then actual charges get added, see many people suddenly taking it seriously, and then seeing Tony crow that everyone agrees with what he's doing. It's depressing, of course. It is <i>not</i> better to do the right thing out of process than the wrong thing in process. It is better to follow the rules that apply to all, to get feedback from others, and to <b>change</b> the procedures if they're wrong. What you don't get to do is what Tony does fairly consistently: announce that he doesn't care if other administrators disagree with him, because "You'll never stop us" and use the admin tools to enforce his will. It is the crux of what has brought him and Snowspinner, above others, to so many RFC's and RFar's. Both fellows have their good points. Snowspinner and I agree more often than not on blocking problem users (I'm quick on the trigger). Tony and I agree to a large degree on what a good article looks like. That can't cover over or excuse deciding to wheel war and give the middle finger to one's fellow admins. (And I've been here longer than both of them, too, if it comes to that.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:22, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having said that, I do agree strongly with Geogre. There's a huge gap between "ignore all rules" and "ride roughshod over everyone else's opinion". Tony's often on the wrong side of that gap. If he knows he's right, why not trust the community and convince them of his rightness? I asked the same question in re Gmaxwell: do we just shit on each other because we're convinced we're "doing the right thing"?

<p>Lest this get any more entrenched, position-wise, than it strictly needs to be, can I offer the thought that ideally, this would be a <i>means</i> of dialogue, rather than an alternative to it, and a RFC <i>on</i> TS, not "against" him?

<dd>I absolutely agree with Alai. An RfC is supposed to be a way to improve dialog and resolve disputes, and so I have found them to be in the past. My first RfC led to an understanding of the sheer gulf between two different kinds of thinking on RfC closes--akin to the "bottle half empty/bottle half full" gulf between personalities. In my second RfC I was happy to have a chance to embrace and endorse the civility policy. When I finally formulate a clear idea of what the third RfC is about, then I've no doubt that it will improve my understanding of Wikipedia even further. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 06:35, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, bypassing *FD is something he probably shouldn't have done in a number of cases, but I honestly don't see anything wrong with temporary undeleting something for discussion at DRV. it makes the process a lot more transparent and not just available to admins. That's a good thing. Temporary undeletion doesn't mean it will get to stay. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tony has also been unprotecting the articles after they are undeleted, and then proceeded to list them on AFD, thereby forking the discussion into two different forums. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suspect that much of the problem would go away of there were an agreed and more or less standard process for making articles available during DRV, rather than individual admins making it up as we go along.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I know DRV is not supposed to be about content but about process. But that seems to have crept somewhat (due in no small part to discussion on wikien-l, which is all very nice but not really a substitute for discussion here). The upshot is that Tony considers, not without justification, that it is helpful to see the article content during DRV because in the end this is supposed to be an encyclopaedia so content is the be-all and end-all. I think that end can be served by undeleting and then immediately replacing with a template noting the DRV. For articles which are not particularly damaging replacing is probably excessive, but some undoubtedly are damaging so we need to allow for that. Tony also wants people to be able to "save" the article during DRV. That is not really what DRV is about, but it is what WP is about, so I have some sympathy for that, too, but with contested deletions there is a strong risk of sockfests and multiple nonsense, so if an admin bringing an article to DRV deems it appropriate to lock the article it seems to me wrong to undo that without consent.</dd>
<dd>It's all very well to say "fuck process" but in the end process is what stops rogue individuals.

<li>Err, one point. DRV is a check to ensure we on AfD don't delete anything we shouldn't have. If DRV finds that an AfD was carried out properly, but that the article deleted is really rather valuable, then the appropriate result would <i>not</i> be "tough luck, the AfD was completely within process". Wikipedia is not the real world, and we're under no obligation to follow the norms of real-world "appeals courts" just because we have things that could be considered (if you squint a bit) equivalent. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 12:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The encyclopedia is about content, and the rules and procedures exist solely to enable us to produce that content.

<dd>It's a lynching when a mob of angry people get together under a banner (okay, a section head) reading<b>RFC against Tony Sidayway</b> and plan how they are going to "get" him. And I have to wonder: if it's this difficult to find a way to "get" him, could it be that maybe he shouldn't be "got"? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">The Epopt</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Epopt_70df.html" title="User talk:The Epopt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Epopt_49e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Epopt">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it would be. But you're assuming here that this is a "mob" of people, and that they're actually "angry". Oleg's words were <i>"An RFC may not lead anywhere but must be attempted, and <b>if</b> that fails, the next step should be a request for arbitration"</i>. That doesn't sound all that rabid to me. Tony himself states that <i>"An RfC is supposed to be a way to improve dialog and resolve disputes, and so I have found them to be in the past"</i> so he doesn't seem to mind. Thus I'd say it's hardly appropriate for others to characterize that as lynching. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 01:10, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All I know about this dispute is what's currently here on ANI, but... humor is an extremely important tool in many functioning work and social groups. The root cause of this (people upset at Tony) is a valid concern regardless of which side is right or wrong, and this discussion looks useful, but I see no harm in it turning to the slighly silly as Tony seems to be responding in a positive and non-confrontational manner to the criticisms. It would be inappropriate as a response to a flame war, but given what seems to be happening, ... shrug.</dd>
<dd>There seems to be no lack of agreement to protect the encyclopedia; protecting people's good relations is also important, and humor helps there. Or at least that's how it seems to me.

<li>Well, it seems to me that people involved in the dispute resolution process (such as arbiters) should not disregard a dispute out of hand. Even if the accusations made by either party are unfounded, there's still a dispute that would be better of resolved. Even if there were a lynch mob, a dispute involving a lynch mob can be resolved in other ways than by giving in to the mob's demands, or by ignoring it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:14, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess the thing that makes it seem more about "getting Tony" than actually resolving something is that Tony Sidaway long since volunteered to address some of the concerns in the putative RFC, before it ever even existed.

<p>I think that David and The Epopt got it spot on, actually. It's natural to think in terms of disciplinary action if one sees someone engaging in a practise that seems to be against the rules. But that's not how we do it here on Wikipedia. Like everybody else I have a talk page. The only edit that has ever been made on that talk page by Oleg Alexandrov, who started this discussion, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=37635578&amp;oldid=37634752" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=37635578&amp;oldid=37634752" rel="nofollow">this one</a> notifying me that he had started discussing an RfC--this very discussion. Moreover, taking a casual look at his editing history I see nothing to suggest that our paths might ever have crossed on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Supporting this odd initiative was Aaron Brenneman, an otherwise good editor who has often been described by one serving arbitrator (who otherwise admires him, as do I) as having "a Tony-sized hole in his judgment" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Aaron_Brenneman_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=37842550&amp;oldid=37842376" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Aaron_Brenneman_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=37842550&amp;oldid=37842376" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, and whose last edit on my user talk page, in response to a polite complaint by me about his recent personal attacks on me, was a curt and rude message asking me not to put messages on his talk page. So, not attempt at communication there, either.</p>
<p>Now this is not the way we do things on Wikipedia. If we think that the encyclopedia is being damaged by someone, we ask them to stop in the first instance. If we don't do that, well it's not exactly <i>wrong</i>--as in this case an adept and courteous editor can handle such heavy-handed actions with ease--but it <i>could</i> rather, if it became commonplace, turn disputes into a kind of lynching. I think that the recent abuses of the RfC process, such as the Kelly Martin RfC, may have given some people altogether the wrong idea about the nature of Wikipedia and the role of the community (hint: it isn't the government of Wikipedia) and that it would be just as well if this way of treating serious disputes didn't become commonplace. I can handle it because I'm pretty resilient and very sure of my ground. Less experienced, or less adept, editors, might well be driven off by such treatment. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:48, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So basically what you are saying Tony, is that Oleg should have discussed this first with you on your talk page. I agree that probably would have been better (by the way, I think your response to the draft RfC has been very constructive, thanks). But I don't think it helps to characterize his actions as an attempted "lynching". I know Oleg well. He is a thoughtful and considered editor, who is an outstanding contributer to the encyclopedia. I think he has legitimate good faith concerns (as do other editors) about the appropriateness of some of your actions. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 18:25, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree that he seems to be a thoughtful and considered editor. And for me this way of starting a discussion on his concerns worked okay. But I think your average Wikipedia editor, administrator, even, might have felt a little intimidated by his style of approach, which was to go to a discussion forum intended for handling serious incidents and discuss his intention of opening an RfC on a person whom he has never once approached to discuss his problems, and in the same edit to raise the possibility of arbitration. This is not the way we proceed on Wikipedia, and I sincerely hope that it never becomes commonplace. David Gerard and The Epopt are experienced Wikipedians with, between them, four years of experience on the arbitration committee. They're not given to hyperbole. This approach to dispute resolution could, if it took off, become lynch law. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:47, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ok I agree with you that this could have been handled better, and we don't want this approach to become the norm. Can you also agree with me that it is unhelpful to describe Oleg's actions as an attempted lynching? In my view such a characterization is unjustified. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 21:05, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No. As I said before, I think the characterization is spot on. This kind of behavior should not be encouraged because it will lead to good editors being driven away over what are, when all is said and done, quite minor questions such as whether and when an article whose deletion is challenged should be visible to those who are making decisions about whether it should be permanently undeleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The power to undelete an article temporarily already resides with individual administrators, and the power to edit articles already resides with editors. This was a case, perhaps, for a sit down and a bit of a natter so that differences of opinion (already aired in various forums, but evidently that was not enough for some) could be resolved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Coming to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> with nonsense about wheel wars and abuses of administrator power is not justified. Talking of arbitration is not justified. Such loose talk tends to encourage the belief that Wikipedia administrators are abusive and given to acting irresponsibly. Talk of arbitration over differences of opinion tends to encourage a punitive, repressive culture. And use of <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> to air personal grievances only serves to worsen the unhealthy, punitive atmosphere. Oleg was not the only participant in this and he wasn't the first to brandish a torch. But it's not him I'm focussing on, but this kind of hysterical reaction of which his behavior--as someone who had never once edited my talk page and as far as I am aware had never interacted with me in any way--was a part. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:28, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that Demi's block was fair enough. But I don't agree that <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> who was involved in the revert war should have blocked me especially since it wasn't exactly a 3rr. I tried to contact him by email and through my talk page about the block but he didn't respond. Also I didn't know I could unblock myself; I tried it so I could inform Chris but still couldn't edit until about five minutes later when I thought that Chris had unblocked me. However I have no hard feelings towards Demi or Chris. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 21:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, the edits were clearly not permitted by the 3RR policy (see my comments at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=37720653&amp;oldid=37718909" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=37720653&amp;oldid=37718909" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>); I reverted Zocky, not a.n.o.n.y.m; I haven't received a single e-mail from him; and there's a lengthy discussion of this incident <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisO_965a.html#3RR_on_my_talk_page" title="User talk:ChrisO">User talk:ChrisO#3RR on my talk page</a>, where a.n.o.n.y.m posted it in the first place.</dd>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>For several days now I have been trying to add a factual entry to the "Harry's Place" entry.</p>
<p>It reads as follows... "Harry's Place consistently features articles that seek to put an anti Islamic spin on news events and never prints anything that is critical of the state of Israel.</p>
<p>This entry is being consistently removed by user Dbiv.</p>
<p>The above statement is factual. I have visited every day Harry’s Place for years. I have never seen a word of criticism against Israel and there is a never ending stream of articles that put an anti Islamic spin on news events. This description is true and it is verifiable.</p>
<p>Despite this I am being threatened by Dbiv with being blocked.</p>
<p>I have tried to compromise with Dbiv by moderating the entry to reflect pure facts but Dbiv continues to remove the post.</p>
<p>I suspect Dbiv is somehow involved with this site and that this represents a severe conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The entry as it stands is a public disgrace as Dbiv is effectively sanitising and promoting a racist website.</p>
<p>The least you can do is allow some factual comment that highlights some of Harry's Place less attractive characteristics.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Harry</p>

<dd>Dear Harry, thank you for bringing this to my attention so that I know to put the site on my watchlist and assist Dbiv in removing your addition to the article. The point here is that your characterization of the site's content represents your own point of view, with which many readers of Harry's Place would disagree. This does not mean that your view cannot be reflected in the article, but it certainly cannot be presented as "the simple facts" about the site.

Either way, it is quite outrageous for Elonka to try to use a little-used guideline in a way it was clearly not intended for to erase comments she objects to.</p>
<p>I have removed these templates, because there was no declaration by any policy here that Elonka was allowed to determine for Wikipedia what gets deleted and what doesn't. Phil Welch above has claimed he would block anyone for attempting to do so, other admins disagreed. If he does go ahead and block me I would hope that his action would be immediately undone as soon as it is noticed.</p>
<p>This is here so it's all out in the open: If Phil Welch blocks me he is clearly doing so without any authority and to assist an editor in a situation he has already taken a side on. We don't need cowboy admins here going against everyone else, we need to either just drop it totally like mature adults or an actual, real decision that's fair to all sides, which certainly is not just letting Elonka erase whatever she wants and keep whatever attacks she made. I note that one of the things she claims is a personal attack for saying that she lied... yet she feels unrestricting from claiming over and over here and elsewhere that I and Bishonen and others lied. The proper response from mature adults here is to just move on, not to try to erase history and censor other people's comments. She claims on her website that everything she has labeled as a personal attack against her must be removed and that that is non-negotiable. That's not how Wikipedia works, and if she thinks she can force her way through on it based upon the comments of just one admin, she has another thing coming. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:39, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, unlike everyone here, I am frequently confused. Nevertheless, the two users seem to share a similar propensity for wanting to remove comments or attacks (call them what you will), on talk pages or elsewhere.

<p>Good afternoon Mr. DreamGuy. Forget whether it's policy or not for a second. Is it really necessary for you to keep these comments on the Eenasul Fateh talk page? What reasons do you have for you to be so keen to hold onto them? Could it possibly be because you feel that you shouldn't be censored? Are they really of such an importance to wikipedia that you oppose these comments be removed? Or is it a personal importance? Sorry for all the questions, I’m just curious of why you want these comments to remain. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 14:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've recently come around to what has become a heretical viewpoint: if policy and process get in the way of doing what's right, then screw them. DreamGuy has frequently engaged in needless personal attacks against Elonka, and it's perfectly reasonable for Elonka to seek their removal. That said, can you block someone for making personal attacks? I'd say yes, and if you can block them for *making* the attacks, why can't you block them for *repeating* the attacks once they're removed? Can you delete an attack page? CSD says yes--and if so, why can't you delete attacks *from* a page? In this case the attacks aren't even going to be deleted, just blanked, with a link left to the appropriate diff so those concerned with reading the full history can do so. All I have seen here is DreamGuy beating up on another editor for no good reason. If DreamGuy really, *really* cares about Wikipedia keeping detailed evidence of his uncivil behavior, Elonka may be willing to indulge him with an RfC. But since RfC is a distinctively useless process, and Elonka wants to get this over with more than anything, I think this is the better course of action. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 18:53, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"and to assist an editor in a situation he has already taken a side on".

<dd>You certainly not unbiased at all. The problem here is that "what's right" in her mind means censoring other people for the kind of statements she herself makes on a continuous basis. You just take her at her word that she will be removing "personal attacks" when that's not what she is doing at all. Look at what she removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Mesopotamian_mythology&amp;diff=37696011&amp;oldid=37670110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Mesopotamian_mythology&amp;diff=37696011&amp;oldid=37670110" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Come on Phil, get real, and stop trying to ignore policies. If you accept her claims that my pointing out the she lied was a personal attack, then surely her claiming over and over and over that I am lying in the claims that got her temporarily blocked means she should be blocked for those personal attacks. She (and you, by extension) are conveniently picking whatever it is you want to call personal attacks without any sense of rhyme or reason for purely selfish reasons. It'd be one thing if you were also applying your angry statements here to Elonka for her "attacks" and asking to block the Casteneda Denata guy for calling me a "true evil" "psychopathic" etc. etc., but, conspicuously, you are not.

<dd>Upon further examination, it appears that Elonka also took the opportunity to remove *her* personal attacks against *you*. Rather than "censoring other people for the kind of statements she herself makes on a continuous basis" she appears to be removing personal attacks on a more or less even basis.

<p>DreamGuy asked me to comment and I will though there are some articles I'd rather be editing :) First of all I can understand Elonka's reasons for wanting to remove some of the back-and-forth between her and DreamGuy, especially since, like me, she edits under her real name. But I can also understand that this is frustrating to DreamGuy. I'd rather not have someone I've been in conflict with go and refactor our past discussions.</p>
<p>Could both parties agree to a neutral third party for doing the refactoring? Or is DreamGuy opposed to any modification or blanking of past discussions? - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 20:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

The whole removing personal attacks thing is not policy, and those people who are in favor of it do so only for real personal attacks, not whole conversations she now finds inconvenient.

<p>I found Haukur's suggestion intriguing, so I'm stopping for now and asking a general question as to what other people (besides DreamGuy) think of the idea of a neutral third party doing the refactoring. I'm willing to consider it, though I'll caution that it's a painstaking and detailed headache to do, and I'm reluctant to ask someone else to clean up the mess. My recommendation is that I continue doing it, and then I can show the diffs of what I have done, to ensure that it is reasonable.</p>
<p>As proof of my <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFACTOR_6166.html" title="WP:REFACTOR">refactoring</a> ability, here's what I've done so far:</p>

<li>User:Elonka/DreamGuy dispute</li>
<li>User:Elonka/DreamGuy dispute/Evidence-1.</li>
<li>I have also (messily) refactored <a href="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">my webpage</a>, though the information is still in the HTML source at the moment.</li>
<li>Other comments at issue have been voluntarily removed off of their respective pages by Admin <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">Android79</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPetros471_6357.html" title="User talk:Petros471">Petros471</a> (thank you).</li>

<p>Once the final refactoring is completed (and "sticks" without being reverted), I will also blank related discussions off <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">my talk page</a>, and (hopefully) we can all move on. :) <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looks reasonable to me. DreamGuy's complaints are, of course, noted, but given (a) his bias and (b) the fact that he's the only one complaining at this point, I think the civil thing is to move on. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 00:30, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh for crying out loud... what about your bias and Elonka's bias? This is simply absurd. We cannot "move on" by simply allowing one editor and a rogue admin to delete anything and everything they want from any talk page just by falsely labeling all of it "personal attacks". This is nothing but censorship, and abuse of the fundamental policies that Wikipedia is built on. We went from saying Elonka's behavior was unacceptable and blocking her for it to letting her get away with making up her own rules, enforced by an admin with a grudge and who insulted other admins who were dealing with the situation and who is protecting article talk pages for no reason other than to have his way.

<dd>Since Elonka removed some of her own personal attacks against you, she seems to be acting *against* her own bias. I have no grudge—I don't even know who you are—nor have I insulted other admins. As for your accusations of bias, I didn't know you or Elonka before I involved myself in this. If anyone wants to examine the diffs in question and seriously believes some of the removed comments shouldn't have been removed, we can discuss that. But your behavior in this dispute has been, to put it simply, uncivil, overemotional, and obsessive. There's really no point discussing this with you further—the only reason I'm writing *this* message is for the benefit of any third parties who are reading this exchange. If you regain your cool and are willing to discuss these issues reasonably, I'll be the first to listen.

<dd>All right, I'll review them. I object to this sanitizing of archives. "Archives"? What exactly are they archives of, in this state? Why keep them at all?

<p><i>I trust Elonka's discretion, and if she steps over the line I'll address that issue as well. RPA does include blanking entire comments if the only substance of the comment is to make a personal attack, for instance. But if someone makes a "you asshole" remark in passing while raising a substative point, the "you asshole" remark is all that needs to be removed. To make myself clear: people restoring personal attacks that Elonka is deleting will be blocked for violating NPA. If people complain about that, then I'll just speedy the whole page as an attack page. If you want to talk about policy, I have the policy backing to do both; if you want to talk about doing the right thing so we can have a productive encyclopedia-writing community, I'm fully justified. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b></i> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a> <i><small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 18:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>&lt;Sigh&gt; This is what I get for letting the clerk mess take over my time and then <i>trying to write articles</i> (yeah, I should know better). Ok. What I was referring to is now contained in RPA. It <i>was</i> contained in NPA, which was first proposed by Snowspinner as "semi-policy." That came up in one of the nasty RFar's of 2004. Well, that "semi-policy" never got to be policy (and I don't even know how what's <i>presently</i> in NPA got to be policy, quite) <i>because</i> it was "all personal attacks will be removed." I.e. it was what is now RPA. It's a policy not to make personal attacks. Great. Now, who decides when something is an attack? Is it the speaker or the reader? Is it a third party? Who determines whether they're to be removed by deletion or moving? Who determines which parts are the personal attack? No consensus on that. As for people making personal attacks being the #1 problem, I don't know what to say. Maybe I just don't get insulted enough or something, but I don't see that many personal attacks made by anyone, and especially not enough to compare to vandalism, porn spam link insertion, cronyism, substubs, AOL blocks, sock puppet abuse, vote busing, or even vandals trying to nominate to FAC and RFA. For me, the amount of personal invective on Wikipedia is far below the least of those. But so it goes.

<dd>See, and that's the problem. Stating opinions, especially ones based upon the fact that you are clearly violating all applicable policies and ignoring the clear consensus of tother admins, are not the things that No Personal Attacks was meant to cover. Besides, anything in my statement that might be construed as a "personal attack" has just the same level, if not greater, amount of "personal attack" in your comment. You are extremely biased in what you identify as a personal attack and feel no need to follow the same level of civility you insist out of your opponents, which means all you are doing here is enforcing your bias onto articles by sheer stubborn policy-breaking and hoping to prevail. Multiple admins have clearly stated they completely disagree with your actions, yet you pay no heed, and you count on the fact that they'd rather not get into a wheel war to stop this clear abuse of power. That also means you are gaming the system.

<p>This situation has devolved, again. No reasonable solution (like putting the image in the center, and a link at the top to the image) can be reached with an ongoing revert war with a series of POV-vandals. Given the consensus on the talk page, removing the image should be considered vandalism regardless of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, and treated as such. I hope that some adminstrator rosse shows up and solves this problem with judicious use of the block button, using <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, if no other excuse can be found. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:21, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am one of the users who is being blocked.</p>
<p>We were contributing to the Abramoff page and our edits were reasonable. At some point in the discussions STUFFOFINTEREST AND MP4wav decided to change the status quo and an editing war ensued. They then went to heavy guns bringing in Admins who would shut us out altogether.</p>
<p>We are being treated unfairly when, and you can see this in the history, our edits were just one word: Jewish, in the "early Years" section and we changed some of the conjecture in the "organizations" section without changing the basic meaning.</p>
<p>Why do you have this liner on the MAIN wik page if it isn't true: <i><b>Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.</b></i></p>
<p>Because we changed one word we are not WELCOME anymore?</p>
<p>It is not reasonable that we can't edit the page the way we want. You can't call our edit "VANDALISM" JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE IT or it doesn't meet your agenda.</p>

<p>During a block of user Tina M.Barber on 1/26 a new Wiki account was made with IP 24.242.252.125. Posts by this new user continued in the same manner as Tina M. Barber but were signed as "Carmen" Today, 2/2 this same IP address was again used yet this time the signature was MaShiloh, also used in signing Tina M.

It appears that the new account 24.242.252.125 was created either by Tina M. Barber or a meatpuppet as a way to circumvent her block and continue with attacks. There is a current Rfc on this user yet she continues to break Wiki policies with total disregard. I would ask that this be investigated and yet another block on both accounts.

I have chosen to do something different, for which I'm now asking feedback. In the article, Flameviper12 begged not to delete it. I therefore decided to move it to his userspace, at User:Flameviper12/Randomness (Ninjas). On his <a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlameviper12_76b3.html" title="User talk:Flameviper12">talk page</a>, I explained to him that I did this on one condition: that he improve his behaviour. The feeling (illusion?) I get, judging from his talk page, is that he is a bored child who means well. I have also told him that if he ever creates one more unencyclopedic article or makes one wrong edit, I will immediately retroactively delete Randomness (Ninjas) from his user space. I did this because I wanted to give him an incentive to improve. I wanna know if I did this the wrong way. If so, feel free to overrule me and delete the article from his user space. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 23:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You followed precedent in that, although I have my own discomfort. When an editor has generally good edits and then pulls a boner, moving the whoopsie article to his user space is a great thing, but when an editor has a terrible record and merely says "donot delet," I worry that we are a free web host. What I'm saying is in no sense a condemnation of what you did. You did the right thing in showing Wiki-love. I am just personally worried about how often and how much we do this. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I've told him that I will immediately delete the article if he ever makes another wrong edit. So if he continues his behaviour, the article will be deleted, and if he stops his behaviour, we'll have lost a troll and gained a contributor. Calling it a win-win situation would be stretching it, but I don't think it can do us much harm. Anyway, if you ever come across another wrong edit from him, please notify me so I can delete the article, or delete it yourself. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 13:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The question is whether I'm being too lenient and if should just block him now for two days (since the edits are generally a day apart, 24 hours probably wouldn't even be seen). I haven't blocked anyone yet, but if this guy keeps up, he may be the winner of my first block sweepstakes.

<li>I'd give him one more warning, then block him. You're right, he seems to vandalize a little bit then run off somewhere else, but he doesn't do it just one day at a time. If he vandalizes again and you give him a final warning and he keeps going, I think it's reasonable to block him. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 16:56, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I got the above message on my page from a user who has helped revert vandalism on today's Main Page article. OK, I don't understand these things. Does it make sense about the virus? I have semiprotected the article; no, I know I'm not supposed to, but a concerted attack like this warrants it, I think. I'm going to bed now, could somebody please look into the virus thing, and unprotect the article whenever it seems possible/reasonable?

<dd>Here's a fool rushing in where angels fear to tread: It kind of depends on your definition of "virus." There was no code downloaded to you, NicAgent, that replicated itself in your memory. It ran once. Now, that one run meant "Open everything! Play obnoxious noises! Show disgusting pictures!," and it could even have meant "Overwrite the home page on the browser to us," and it might even have been "Redirect all searches to our Pr0wno site." Those things are malicious, damaging, potentially very, very, very damaging, but they're not replication. So they can be fully awful, immoral, evil, bad, stinky, uncool, stupid, pustular, vaccuous, invidious, abhorrent, vile, assinine, puerile, criminal, and otherwise <i>bad</i> without actually being viruses. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:23, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't, and won't, comment on the supposed harrassment here, but Zapatancas is definitely right about the "copyvio". The article SqueakBox linked to is from TheFreeDictionary, which is a copy of Wikipedia. Thus, not a copyvio.

<p>More riuibbish from Zapatrancas, who is the one harrassing me not the other way around. I did not put the copyvio notice on the article but I do nknow Zapatancas has no right to take it off. When Ihe first reverted I told him to get an admin to look at it but he would rather harrass me. If it isn't a copoyvio someone else can remove the notice. Zapatncas cannot so if Mark wants to he can. Zapatancas has now done it a third time.

<dd>I have removed the notice. The article is obviously <i>not</i> a copyvio, and I see no reason why Zapatancas couldn't have removed the notice himself. In principle, we probably don't want "authors" removing copyvio notices. However, this tagging was so obviously a mistake that <i>somebody</i> had to remove it, and forcing Zapatancas to go get someone to do it is just silly <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:Instruction_creep">m:Instruction creep</a>.</dd>

<p>We've been having a problem with someone spamming www.esotericgoldendawn.com across the External links of a wide range of articles recently, with the descriptive line modified to fit whatever article the person is putting it on. See for example, the contributions of <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.46.183.16.html" title="User:66.46.183.16">User:66.46.183.16</a>, <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.30.172.221.html" title="User:216.30.172.221">User:216.30.172.221</a>, <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.22.204.79.html" title="User:24.22.204.79">User:24.22.204.79</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.200.60.124.html" title="User:209.200.60.124">User:209.200.60.124</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Gold_1c27.html" title="User:Dr. Gold">User:Dr. Gold</a>, and I think lots of others I could track down if I spent the time.</p>
<p>The person doing this seems to have the sole purpose of adding that site to as many articles as possible, but occasionally adding one other or (more often) removing some other links). Normally I'd just undo these by hand, but there have been soooo many of them lately and sopersistent, it'd be nice if the site was added to our blocklist (I know it exists, have edited articles and not been able to save because an existing link buried in the middle of the article somewhere was on the list). Anybody want to tackle this or knows what's best to do, please be my guest. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 17:04, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Blocked the lot of them for 48 hours so we can discuss this with a time-out from further linkspamming.
