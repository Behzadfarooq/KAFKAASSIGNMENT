<p>Due to a somewhat critical <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204" rel="nofollow">bug</a> in MediaWiki 1.4, no blocks are expiring at or after their given date and time of expiry - a block is only lifted if the user/IP is manually unblocked. I did a lot of unblocking this morning, but until the bug is fixed, if anybody has a few free minutes, I suggest periodically browsing through <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> and unblocking the users whose blocks have expired.

<p>I've done a few more this evening. I hope the bug get's fixed soon.

<dd>I whack at it every time I play with wikipedia. It's gotten to the point that it's almost the only thing I do on wikipedia. Even so, I've been slacking lately, and spending time on my other hobbies. Every little bit anyone does helps. When (the rare times anyway) I finish with CfD, I start whacking at the categories marked for deletion (in the category) but not listed on CfD. (Essentially, if they are empty, they go. If not and they are not on CfD, the notice gets removed.) --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 05:01, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have spent a few hours deleting only the categories most obviously needing deletion, and there are still some left. However, I have not cleaned up the residue from the CfD page; some non-admin can do that as well as I can probably. Also, there are a large number of things that have been voted on, but no action taken (like moving articles to different categories). This should probably be done by bot by large category, and either person or bot for smaller ones. (This also could be done by a non-admin.) <s>There is a bot, but I think it is on vacation.</s> --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 08:06, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, such a proposal will not currently solve any sock-puppet issues if the users in question are editing from a secure browser (java disabled) and using an anon proxy.

<p><i>Question</i>: Why do you need to spy on users through the IP addresses? Contributions should be judged on what they are, not who wrote them. Sock puppets are annoying, yes, but there's nothing that can be done about them without massive changes to Wikipedia (for ex., requiring proof of identification before one could create an account, and blocking anon. users) that wouldn't be popular. I'm against the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">Big Brother</a> type activity. If someone's contributions are so one-sided that he's an obvious sock puppet, then delete/demote them on POV grounds rather than surmised identity. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> 05:57, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Welllll'</i>... normally I would have agreed with you on this one. But lately we've been blocking for violation of the 3RR. We've been seeing many similar edits on the articles we've blocked for, and the first thing a lot of admins thinks is that those edits come from blocked editors. So it would clear up a lot of issues if we could see the IP addresses used of editors. Mind you, from what I understand its a bit of a moot point because the autoblock automatically blocks those IP addresses anyway... <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 20:39, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, fair enough these are your views. However, where have admins violated the 3RR? Also, why do you think we have to block because of repeated violations? Well, because the point is that people are reverting and not even bothering to discuss their changes. Then when we block because of it they get all pissed off. Well, I say tough. If they had been making edits in good faith they would have taken their comments to talk to work on. And they would have tried to gain consensus. Reverting in the manner they do is bullying, plain and simple. Why? Because they are trying to impose their own POV on people. Take for instance CheeseDreams. She reverted and lost at least three changes on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus_53d0.html" title="Cultural and historical background of Jesus">Cultural and historical background of Jesus</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus&amp;diff=7792535&amp;oldid=7792036" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus&amp;diff=7792535&amp;oldid=7792036" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and along with other editors has forced the protection of that page.

The 3RR policy should be followed to the letter by the admins. Now, without getting off topic, I would characterise the practices of these editors as very far outside of what I would consider civil behavior. But policy should be applied evenly and justly, which the admins have failed to do. I don't think admitting that is a radical stance to take.</dd>

Whether they stuck to the letter of the 3RR or not is irrelevant, if they intentionally tested its boundaries so blatantly. No editor needs to revert an article over a disagreement with another editor more than once in a blue moon, and we always have the option of modifying instead of reverting where it is appropriate to do so. The 3RR is so absurdly generous as to encourage revert warring, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Page_Footer" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:19, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Edits</i> should be judged for what they are, not by who made them. But the concept of <i>voting</i>, and the 3RR, are undermined by sockpuppets. E.g., votes for deletion are a regular target of sockpuppet attacks. Take RFA into account, and they become a direct threat to the project. Recording IPs is not spying. Come on. Every website you visit has your IP, and they can do with it what they like. WP accounts are a gratuitous way to <i>hide</i> your IP, but I don't see any inherent users' <i>right</i> to this service. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Discretion and skill are needed in interpreting the IP numbers with a view to sock identification. I'm currently suffering intermittently from an IP block that was applied to my ISP's http proxy legitimately because of a vandal who is sharing the same proxy. There's nothing much we can do about that; it doesn't render editing impossible (but this is also true for the vandal).</p>
<p>One way to move forward may be to permit editing only by logged-in users. This would mean that a vandal can be blocked by username. Vandals attempt would get around the block by storing up usernames prior to vandalism and switching to an unblocked username when required. However this strategy could be defeated by recording the IP number under which each username is registered and then raising an auto listing (on some Special page) of users performing recent edits using the same IP number as banned users. This would provide a watchlist of candidates to watch for further vandalism.</p>
<p>It would also mean that crude and often ineffective bans on IP numbers, such as the one I'm suffering, would not be necessary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Page_Footer" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:56, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Banning all anons is anti-wiki and frankly extremely infuriating to editors who don't want to register and subsequently log in all the time. But, I think that admins ought to have the developer power of viewing IPs. Unlike what Event Horizon said, this isn't a "big brother" tactic - Wikipedia is not a government or a public place, it's run by Jimmy Wales and the Foundation and so on, and the owners of websites can view the IPs of their visitors anyway. In Wikipedia's case, developers already have that power as well. The only difference here is giving that status to appointed admins. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 06:20, Dec 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've been thinking about this for some while now, and though I personally don't see the harm I do think publishing everyone's IP (even just to admins) would be a bad idea. I propose that instead we publish a <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hash_function.html" title="Hash function">hash</a> of the both each editor's entire IP, and just the first 20 bits of their IP. To prevent brute-forcing, it would have to be the hash of those values concatenated with some secret key. That way, anyone can verifiy whether two users are using the same IP and whether they're using the same ISP, but noone can retrieve their actual IP, and their ISP can only be revealed by someone using the same ISP. It seems like a reasonable compromise to me, the only drawback would be that we couldn't distinguish an IP from a named user with that IP. This could be resolved by not using the User:IP name anymore but User:&lt;hash of ip&gt;; That would lose us the ability to see the address of anon's though, which I rather wouldn't. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 19:15, 2005 Jan 5 (UTC)</li>

<p>I ask here because I think it may be the best way of getting a quick feel for the consensus on a recent change. Recently the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">three revert rule</a> was made enforceable. Now the case of a simple revert is easy to identify and most edits which are termed "reverts" fall into this category: a diff between two different versions of the text of a page or section shows that they are identical, with all intermediate changes reverted.</p>
<p>More recently I have noticed users deleting the added text of other users selectively. This is slightly more difficult to recognise because a diff between two versions isn't identical. What shows up however is that if two versions are compared, added text in intermediate changes is selectively deleted. So for instance in one example the first user made a cosmetic edit, correcting the spelling of a single word, and a second user made a more substantial edit in which text was added. A third user then came along and performed an edit to delete all of the added text of the second user while retaining the cosmetic edit of the first, and also tweaked the heading of a section. The effect was to remove the added text of the second user.</p>
<p>This becomes a question because the third user had very shortly before performed two reverts on the same page, and the third edit could be seen as an attempt to evade the three revert rule.</p>
<p>I'd like to open the question up. Is this kind of edit covered by existing policy or practise? Does it qualify in this case as a third revert? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Page_Footer" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:41, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My opinion is that a revert which includes minor changes (such as spelling changes and capitalisation) is still a revert. The purpose of the 3RR is to prevent revert wars, and clearly spelling changes don't make much difference to most such wars. I think a warning might be a sufficient rebuff for a first offence.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> <a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">(talk)</a> 03:08, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I thought it was pretty clear in the discussion at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_20b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement">Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement</a> that reverts that also make other changes <b>should count</b> for the purposes of the three-revert rule. For example, see my vote on that page. It shouldn't matter whether the other changes mixed in with a revert are major or minor, it's still a revert. However, I have just checked back at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_6e05.html#Spirit_vs._letter_of_the_3RR" title="Wikipedia talk:Three revert rule enforcement">Wikipedia talk:Three revert rule enforcement#Spirit vs. letter of the 3RR</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_6e05.html#Mixing_reverts_and_significant_edit" title="Wikipedia talk:Three revert rule enforcement">Wikipedia talk:Three revert rule enforcement#Mixing reverts and significant edit</a>, and things no longer seem as clear as I had remembered.

<dd>I think a revert mixed with changes is still a revert; if someone wants to make unrelated changes, they can certainly do so in a separate edit. And indeed, if someone were to do the revert change, and then make other unrelated changes, they would definitely be blocked under the 3RR.

<dd>I think the key word here is "unrelated" changes, because those are just cosmetic and an attempt to get around the rule. Substantive and/or responsive changes whether contiguous with the disputed text or not, as is appropriate to the article and issues involved, should not count as a revert. I propose also, that in the interest of community, mere <b>deletion</b> reverts be treated more critically, since unless the additions were vandalism, the assumption should be they are good faith contributions.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 04:43, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree. Users have used this exact excuse to get around the rule before; on the fourth revert, re-inserting a disputed paragraph, while making substantial edits to other sections. If they want to make their substantial edits to the other sections in good faith, they can certainly make them in a separate edit.

<dd>It's crystal clear to me that if we <i>don't</i> consider a "reversion+edits" as a reversion, to count toward the 3RR, we might as well <i>ditch</i> the 3RR rule - because otherwise everyone will make an edit as well, every time they do a revert, and will thereby avoid <i>ever</i> triggering the 3RR. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:23, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another possibility that comes to mind is that your browser had a cached version of the history page from before the undelete and it was showing you that rather than retrieving the updated version. I've had that happen to me while doing deletion-related stuff before, and it freaked me out because I thought I'd irretrievably lost the Cassini-Huygens probe article while trying to move it. On many browsers holding down the shift key (<i>or control key</i> <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a>) while clicking the page reload button will bypass the cache, that could fix things if you run into this problem again. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:18, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, can anyone tell me how to list the sub-pages of a given page (i.e. a command or page which, once given/looked at, provides a list). I've looked in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpages_22af.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpages">Wikipedia:Subpages</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Link#Subpage_feature" class="extiw" title="meta:Link">Meta:Link#Subpage_feature</a>, but neither says anything of how to do this. Sub-pages always include a link to the parent - is there anything analagous in the other direction?

<dd>One method is to do a Wikipedia search for the page; see, e.g.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns2=1&amp;ns3=1&amp;search=User%3AMatt+Crypto&amp;searchx=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns2=1&amp;ns3=1&amp;search=User%3AMatt+Crypto&amp;searchx=Search" rel="nofollow">this search</a>; that brings up some of the subpages for my User pages under "Article title matches". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 00:53, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On another note, we need a specific place to report 3RR violations (e.g. not on the talk pages of large numbers of individual sysops). If there were a particular page (Wikipedia:Excessive reversions in progress? Wikipedia:3RR violations?) then people could discuss (quickly) which users did or didn't violate the 3RR. <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> <a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">(ark a pan)</a> 20:45, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is the best way to alert administrators to 3 revert rule violations? Now that blocking is policy, should they be brought here so admins can deal with them? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 01:14, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think so. Offenders often feel that the opposing side cherry-picks admins sympathetic to their cause. Violations are typically obvious enough that any admin should be able to block infringing parties, and posting them here would unify any revert-count disputes in one place without having them sprawl across user pages. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 01:28, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good for now. If it picks up to be too much traffic here, we can move it to a separate page. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 07:18, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this where we report 3RR violations now? I tried to find a proper place for it (not wanting to block somebody over a dispute I am myself involved in). I ended up putting a note on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> (please see there). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:25, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> probably isn't a good place, for several reasons. First, if a user violates the 3RR, the solution is to block them temporarily (repeated violations should be taken to ArbComm, who may ban them). Second, my sense is that policy was not to protect pages because of edit wars unless there's a really heated edit war among many parties, and two people warring doesn't meet that standard (and see the first point). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:06, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My concern is that Chinese users using these to get to WP may be putting themselves in a potentially rough situation (whether by doing so, or by saying things on WP that might be found objectionable). Of course, that's their choice. I do think if the GNAA, our favorite psychic, and friends are actively using a proxy, a brief block as per AOL proxies to get rid of them is in order (or wait and rollback).

<dd>As far as I understand the mediawiki setup for wikipedia: No, we're not damaging the database (apart from by repeatedly hitting submit while creating articles, but the corruption this causes isn't serious and occurs without what's currently going on too). When you change an article, the change gets fed to the master database, which pushes changes to the slaves which serve database reads. Currently the slaves are lagging in processing the changes, so it takes a while for changes to show up and in the meantime things may be displayed inconsistently.

<p>would it be possible to consider an automated mechanism for blocking open proxies (i.e. an 'admin-script' that auto-blocks IPs after establishing that they are open proxies)? They are a bane, but I cannot be bothered to go after Cantus' list, because there are just too many of them.

<dd>Deletion of those images via either copyright problems or possibly unfree images should be unlikely - they are obviously fair use and I'd hope that nobody would delete them on the basis of simply an unsupported listing as possible problems - anyone deleting from the copyright issues areas should at least be able to recognise listings of images as obvious as these as without merit. Perhaps someone with an excess of zeal and lack of understanding of fair use? The previous possible copyvio requirement of removing the image from the article using it (and thereby letting those who watch the article know there is a problem) now seems missing. That's good (because fair use requires knowing where the image is and it used to be hard to find those uses after the image was removed) but bad because it doesn't notify those who are best placed to both know the status of the image and find a replacement. Adding a requirement of a notice on the talk page of the article seems a suitable replacement. While there's ongoing work on improving the reliability of the links to images, it's <i>always</i> necessary to use an image search to verify lack of use before deleting. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 22:24, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a bug. It's a glitch :-) Old revisions (I think all those prior to December 2004) have been compressed in the database to save space. As a side effect, this makes deletion of revisions before Dec 2004—and hence articles created before that—impossible for the time being. A future software release will contain the fix that allows deletion of compressed revisions, and then such articles <i>can</i> be deleted. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 07:44, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The compression of article old revisions is in progress. [...] The most visible sign after this has happened is likely to be the temporary inability to delete articles created earlier than 1 December 2004, done to ensure that there won't be any data loss with selective undeletion before full support for that is present in the software. The temporary workaround is to blank and protect the article. Developers will deal with any cases where actual legal action makes that insufficient. JamesDay 09:03 Jan 6, 2005 (CET)</dd>

<p>So I guess we'll have to live without delete for a while.

<p>It's not a bug. It's Tim Starling's sense of humour in the notice. Old article versions for en are about 80GB. Compressing one article at a time takes that to about 40GB. Combining many article revisionss into one record and compresing the combination is expected to reduce that to about 15GB. The new feature to undelete only some revisions doesn't understand the block compressed format so deletion of articles with block-compressed history was turned off to prevent selective undeletion causing data loss (and missing body text in the deleted article revision history or the restored history). Both features were desired so limiting the deletability of some articles for a while seemed like the best approach, compared to delay for the selective undeletion feature. It'll probably be taken care of in the next software revision, if not sooner. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 14:42, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the process of closing discussion on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Tom Sutter, i noticed that the VfD-Cat tag (added as part of the VfD template) had been removed from Tom Sutter by an anon ed (Summary: "reinstated 'irrelevant stuff' as it is not irrelevant it is his entire hitting career!") in the process of an otherwise verbatim-et-literatim restoration of old material.</p>

<li>Arguably, consulting the Cat page is a viable approach to seeing what is on VfD, avoiding the voluminous VfD-page mechanisms, and this action reduced exposure via the Cat to 18 hours instead of 120 or so.</li>
<li>That alternate means of accessing VfD debates may never have been used, but we could only know that by polling everyone who ever votes on VfD.</li>
<li>This particular vote was close (6 D, 4 K), so two more votes could have shifted the result.</li>

<dd>Hmmm. Although I'm something of a deletionist, I'm always in favour of taking enough time to make sure we have rough consensus. Generally, it doesn't matter if we wait a few extra days to delete something, <i>if there's no harm involved</i> (e.g. libel or other problematic material). So, in this case, I'd say there's no harm in waiting, after adding it back to the category. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:30, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'd say it is enough if the entry remains listed in the main VfD page and the subpage stays readable most of the time; in cases of persistent vandalism that seriously hinders voting, allow it remain listed for extra few days after blocking/reverting. Your suggested wording in policy would just encourage trolls to stealthly remove the cat. tag and then pester everyone with their claims for extra voting round, admin abuse, or trolling in VfU. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 12:18, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IPs are not commonly available for a very good reason: having them readily available would facilitate harassment of users one disagrees with. Even to admins is too large a pool.

<dd>I accept that there is no consensus to publish IPs. But I am not convinced by David's argument above at all: Alberuni of all people is a perfect example why making public IPs could be a good thing: It could encourage people to <i>behave</i>. Many people edit under their real names. You can find out my home address in two minutes, if you like. As I see it, the editors we are interested in are the ones who take pride in their work. The trolls and sockpuppeteers could still post from public IPs, but I don't see the need to go out of our way to protect their anonymity. If I visit a website from work, well, I am aware I give away my IP, and fully expect it to be listed on a server log somewhere. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 16:10, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>You could try making a non-invertible hash function but this woudn't help much because the search space is necessarily extremely small (the set of registered dotted quads, which collapses to a tiny set of <i>candidate'</i> dotted quads in a real life situation) and candidate guesses can be entered. The salt could be deduced, the algorithm is known and an IP number always corresponds to the same hash value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:15, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "salt could be deduced" - ah, no.</dd>
<dd>First, the fact that "the algorithm is known" is irrelevant. These algorithms are often published openly (see, e.g., <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174">RFC 3174</a> "US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)"). (It's called a "one-way .. function" for a reason!) So you can't deduce the salt from the resulting hash - and having part of the input (e.g. by looking to see what your own IP turns into) doesn't help you either - you <i>cannot</i> deduce the input from the output, even knowing the algorithm. (The transformation is not reversible.)</dd>
<dd>Second, if you make the salt long enough, you can't figure it out via a dictionary attack (i.e. try every possible value of the salt, to see which one works - which is why I said "make the salt space large enough that people can't find it by an exhaustive search" above). E.g. if the salt is 992 bits long, to which the IP address is appended, producing a 1024 bit result which is then hashed, then it is still the case that knowing one 32-bit-input/output pair won't help you. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:17, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think some of the misunderstanding here is due to your use of the word salt. In most cases, salts are public, which they are explicitly not in this case. I think a better term is key, even though that doesn't fit entirely either as under normal operation the key is never used for decryption or verification. Anyway, since the last discussion I've realised that the only way I'm going to get this on wikipedia is by coding it and <b>then</b> starting the discussion on whether we should turn it on, so that's what I'll do. My Wikipedia-plate is a bit full at the moment though, so I haven't started yet. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 21:17, 2005 Jan 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, generally, a salt is a value which is added to the process of computing one-way hashes in order to hinder dictionary searches and/or precomputation of an output_value -&gt; input_value reverse-mapping table (by means of precomputation on all possible input values). So it's pretty well on-target here, I think. It's true that in the most well-known case (Unix passwords) the salt is public, but in our specific application I don't quickly see a way to do what we want (allow comparing hashed versions of IP addresses, without being vulnerable to pre-computation reverse lookups) with a public salt. However, maybe I'll think one up in the morning when my brain is fresh! :-) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 23:20, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think I made myself particularly clear. I know that security algorithms are often public, and that a salt value, which can be kept secret, can be very large indeed and will indeed be proof against a naive dictionary attack. In this particular class of security algorithm, however, the dictionary size is tiny and the utility of the salt is constrained by the requirement that the hash must always be the same value for a given input, to enable duplicate IPs to be spotted without access to the salt. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:00, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is secure for hashing IPs. Basically, we hash something like "Some really long phrase you'll never guess in a zillion years fhwuefhihqi:10.2.3.4" when we hash the IP 10.2.3.4. They know this hashes to "e4bdf4208373ad7b". The attacker knows the "10.2.3.4" part of the plain text. They <i>don't</i> know the "Some really long phrase you'll never guess in a zillion years fhwuefhihqi" of the plain text. Until they do, they can't figure out what "10.2.3.5" or anything else will hash to.

<p>Why couldn't a feature just be created that allows a person to type in two usernames and have it tell you if the ip's are the same? They can't find the person's ip unless they type in many many combinations. If that is an issues you could limit it to 1 query a day or somthing.

<dd>That is a possible solution too (in combination with a "They're in the same IP range" indicator), however the system where a hash of the IP is published you'll be able to find all sockpuppeting users in a group of <i>n</i> POV-pushers in <i>n</i> operations instead of <i>½(n<sup>2</sup>-n)</i> operations (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of taste ofcourse. I just happen to think that my taste in this is the correct one). An added problem of having a form working on users is that an IP is not associated with the user, but with an edit. Each edit can have a different hash-of-ip. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 17:11, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is finding sockpuppets a big problem for Admins? At least from my view on the outside, most of the sockpuppets look pretty obvious, as if they want to be caught. For the much smaller number that are questionable, don't most of the questions concerning sockpuppets revolve around enforcement of Arbitration Committee decisions? If that is true, then would it be better to have one (or perhaps two) of the Abritrators given access to developer priviledges? Just curious. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">BlankVerse</a> 10:18, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's the policy for blocking shared ips? There are a few which have the shared template on their talk page, but all of their edits seem to be vandalism. There are several that would qualify for a 24 hour block (repeated vandalism, ignoring test3 messages, etc), but I'm hesitant to do so because I don't know what the policy is.

<dd>I Don't know about policy but my appraoch is that as a general rule the more people who are likely to be using the IP the shorter the block.

<dd>Yeah, the same problem occurs on AOL and networks with large DHCP pools. I usually don't even bother blocking, it's just going to annoy innocent bystanders.

<p>We could require people who edit from DHCP pools that are the source of lots of problem to acquire user-id's and log in to do edits; i.e. disallow edits from non-logged-in users for some address ranges. I know this goes against previous practise, but you can be just anonymous with a user-id as you can with an IP address, and if I have to trade off not being able to control anon's from DHCP pools versus this very incremental loss of anonymity, that's an easy call to make. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 05:49, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a solution, and not one I'd object to (but then again I'd also like to block the AOL proxies); I doubt you'll get anything close to consensus for it though. My preferred solution is to make all edits of blocked users freely revertable by anyone (as is currently the case with hard banned users. This would probably be more effective too, as there's no way to block people entirely even when disabling IP pools (dialup accounts are pretty much free these days). --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 05:53, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another solution is not to count the revert of an edit by someone who is not logged in for 3RR purposes. An anon editing a controversial article might then have an incentive to register and log-in in order to enjoy the "protection" of the 3RR. Indeed it seems a bit unfair to count reverts of anonymous edits for 3RR purposes, since this means that anonymous editors actually enjoy a considerable advantage over registered editors in an editing dispute. A registered editor is constrained by the 3RR, but the anon's are not: an anon can either simply overstep the 3RR knowing that he can't effectively be "banned"; or he can simply dial-up again and get a different IP in order to do the next revert. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:17, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good point, and I personally would agree with this. However, I suspect you're going to get push-back from people who don't want to treat anon editors as second-class citizens. Also note that an editor with a user-id can pull the same stunt; come back as an anon for 3RR warring purposes, and use multiple dialups to exceed their quota. So it's probably not worth the trouble to change the policy. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:49, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can anon editors get their IP encrypted into their cookie? If they redial to avoid a block mediawiki can identify their last used IP and autoblock.
