<p><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">User:Elonka</a> has been adding a nonstandard template to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_fd20.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)</a> which, when viewing the page, looks identical to {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedpolicy_8817.html" title="Template:Disputedpolicy">disputedpolicy</a>}}, but is not, most noticably because it does not link the page to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Category%7EAccuracy_disputes_ce25.html" title="Category:Accuracy disputes">Category:Accuracy disputes</a> as the original does. It seems deceptive to make it appear to page viewers that the guideline is in dispute, yet keep it out of the appropriate category as the template is in part meant to do. While there is an active ArbCom hearing on matters discussed on the talk page, there has been no consensus in discussion to declare the guideline in dispute, using a genuine or ad hoc dispute template. (The hearing does not dispute the guideline, only the matter of exceptions to it.

<dd>I believe it's pretty clear that if a dispute has proceeded all the way to ArbCom accepting a case, that there is, in fact, a dispute.As such, it is appropriate to notate that guideline as being in dispute, and it is disruptive to repeatedly <i>remove</i> the dispute tag. <a

<dd>The dispute tag itself says that it should only be added by consensus decision.Isn't any unilateral editing of an active guideline disruptive, especially when it becomes a revert war, and especially when that edit is one that says the guideline is disputed (which you have said you believe means the guideline shouldn't be followed)?--<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 23:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>To be accurate: the television naming guideline is <b>not</b> disputed by consensus. A subset of the guideline, the implementation of pre-emptive (and thus currently unnecessary) disambiguation in episode article titles-- contrary to the established <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a> guideline-- has become a ongoing campaign of a handful of editors, of which Elonka is the principal advocate. Progressively insistent attempts by a small cadre to carve out an exception to Wikipedia-wide standards does not throw a current guideline into "dispute", as Elonka claims above. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 01:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<p>The dispute is about <i>how</i> to use the guideline. So issues such as moving articles to fit the guideline, whether or not to allow exceptions...etc. The guideline itself is not disputed - no one's asking for the actual guideline to be changed. The entire debate is about how the guideline is applied.</p>
<p>This tends to result in a beautiful circular argument in Elonka's favour. By adding the dispute tag, it causes people to remove it, causing a bit of an edit war on the guideline page. This results in discussion on the talk about whether the guideline is disputed. Elonka then points to the edito war and the discussion and says "oh look, of course there's a dispute." --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 01:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will remind everyone at this point that this listing is not about the use of a dispute tag, but of the use of a <i>fake</i> dispute tag. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueSquadronRaven_0385.html" title="User:BlueSquadronRaven"><font color="blue"><b>BlueSquadron</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlueSquadronRaven_188d.html" title="User talk:BlueSquadronRaven"><font color="black"><b>Raven</b></font></a> 08:43, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Speaking in general, one of the purposes of templates and tags is a form of standardization. It is generally accepted on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> and <a href="../../../r/t/_/WP%7ERT_8584.html" title="WP:RT">WP:RT</a> that if you don't like the way a template looks or is worded, you should <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">edit it</a> (or discuss changes on its talk page) rather than "forking off" a variant template. Such templates tend to end up on TFD, where the outcome is almost invariably to merge it back or delete it.

<dd>Actually it doesn't prove that I am a "sockpuppet." This is not the first unsubstantiated conclusion that you claim to have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.. Does the Daniels page help your case? Sure, but it doesn't prove it. Does the XPW page help your case? Perhaps slightly, but not nearly as much as the Daniels page considering I was simply reverting a removed link on the XPW page. As far as the Daniels page, what I did was add a reference to an article, and I explained in the Requests for Comment section how I knew who the author was.<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyakaDell_739a.html" title="User:BooyakaDell">BooyakaDell</a> 02:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, JB (I'm not pretending any more), Only YOU have used that "article" for anything, and you caused a great amount of disruption on the XPW page when you put it on there before (just look at the talk page, admins, if you don't doubt me). There was no reason for you to add that link to any article, unless you are exactly what you are, a sockpuppet account to get around your ban <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 03:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>JB, As I said before, there are only two accounts that referenced "Bleeding Was Only Half the Job" as a PRIMARY source in an article. JB196, and BooyakaDell.

<p>I have created a new entry to Wikipedia. The article is "AUFORN" The contents of the article have been deleted by a vandal and instead of the contents, there is a redirection to "Disclosure Project" article. I have put back the contents of the article but feel that it will be deleted again. I have also added a logo (AUFORNLogo.png). I feel that too will be deleted by the vandal. Side note: Before setting up this AUFORN article, I went to an article named "Australian UFOlogy". I added factual information (i.e. prominent ufologist) to the article, but to my dismay, it was deliberately deleted the next day&#160;! The following is the History log on this event:</p>

<dd>Errr....a pentagram has 5 points, not 6. And since when has the pyramid been an American seal? Why is the picture of the serviceman a statement on all Americans? Maybe it's just a statement on those who take photos of themselves sitting on prisoners? The sword <i>is</i> an important symbol of shia islam (it's compared to excalibur in the description page).

<dd>Right... we are discussing the IDF barnstar, and you're really jumping to conclusions with quite a few things. For example, the purpose of the hexagram is to show the connection between the letters that spell <i>MASON</i>.

<dd>The discussion of the Wikiproject page says that the IDF barnstar was created since most Israelis would recognize the distinctive shoulder bars since Israeli armed forces service is compulsory making it extremely common in Israel. I find nothing offensive about it existing. Despite what the IDF might have done, it is no worse than having US army type awards or userboxes on Wikipedia.

<p>Having this barnstar apply to any Israel-related contributions, and not specifically to the Israeli military, is absurd, and the barnstar below it advertised as "for Israel's defenders" similarly makes it seem that this WikiProject seeks to advance or protect particular interests, rather than write a neutral encyclopedia.

<li>It's not complicated. I only brought up Striver's userpage when he asked if he could make a UBL or Hamas barnstar. To be even more clear, he wanted to make something offensive - I explained that his user page was already offensive. Just drop it already. As for me, I'm using logic. I don't actively participate in any Israeli projects, I'm not known to, and I don't intend to.

<dd>I'd be in favour of getting rid of this. The whole old "barnstar of national merit" idea is suspect too - as Wikipedians, we are simply <i>not</i> supposed to act with the motive of promoting the interests of a particular nation. But this one is particularly bad, with its implied reference to "defending" the interests of one particular nation, and to military violence as a means of achieving this. The image clearly alludes to military organisation, and the filename is part of the message too. If this was technically a template and not just an image it would certainly have been speedied under T1 long ago. I'd say that images designed primarily or exclusively for quasi-userbox purposes should fall under the same criteria as userbox templates proper. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:32, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think its quite funny that you guys are taking this serious, has anyone actually looked at Strivers edit history, this is what he does, start drama. Anyway the idea that the barnstar be given for anything doesn't make sense, but me giving a barnstar for the wrong reason does not delegitimize the barnstar itself. Wouldnt the simple answer be to revise the banstar text instead of deleting since it will just be recreated with the new more acceptable text anyway? Also this whole issue over "defense" meaning defending Jewish ideals is insane considering it most likely means defending articles against vandalism, takes some bad assumption of faith to assume its for ideological reasons. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The IDF barnstar is a stupid and ridiculously POV barnstar, and ought to go (I suggest any admins to speedy the thing right away). And, for that matter, so should all the Muslim barnstars which are distributed as often as a way of saying "thanks for pushing our Muslim POV" rather than "thanks for helping out the Muslim articles". And so should the LGBT barnstar or any other barnstar which is a subtle way of saying, "thanks for the POV pushing". And, finally, Haizum is right, Striver, your userpage is incredibly offensive.

<dd>Yes great and who gets to judge why a barnstar is given, anyone cited as not being given for the right reasons is going to look like a violation of WP:AGF. Why is the barnstar POV again? because you personally think some people are given it for pushnig a POV instead of just contributing to articles. Who cares if its a Isreali article or not, If I give a friend a star of David for a gift for doing something nice for me, does that mean something more then it just being a thank you? It is what it is, just because you can imagine grave circumstances in which its used for a more horrible reason, doesnt mean it actually is.</dd>

<li>This discussion has gone way off point. The topic was not about the IDF Award, but if Striver could make an OBL or Hamas one. The answer, obviously, is no. Further, a quick look at Striver's edit history will show a ridiculous amount of POV edits that push an anti-Semitic, Holocaust denying agenda, particluarly <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EInternational_Conference_to_Review_the_Global_Vision_of_the_Holocaust_f955.html" title="Talk:International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust">here</a>.

<dd>The main goal of the Barnstar of National Merit, when I created it, was that it was awarded for articles on nations (not a specific one), since nations usually give out medals for doing deeds for it. This was, hopefully, going to be used instead of nation awards, as what the Wikiprojects were doing. But, the Wikiprojects made their own awards, so I just noded and moved away. As for this specific Barnstar, I would really like for it not only to avoid using the IDF connection, but I would really think we should change the design. I state this because the central emblem of the award is a Wikipedia logo, under a copyright license. I do not think we can make it PD at all, so I would suggest replacing the logo with something else (maybe a puzzle piece). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 21:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Apparently that professor's instructions also included ignoring warning messages.

<dd>Sorry, but I reverted the copying of this ANI report to his talk page with the snide remark at the bottom - there is no reason to inflame matters further - he's already been told that there is an ANI report here and he can be directed to it if there's any question, but if discussions are occurring in multiple different places then things get needlessly difficult. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 02:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Wikipedia the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_pig.html" title="Guinea pig">Guinea pig</a></b> (hey, how come there is no article on Guinea pig meaning test subject).Oh, we did this in a class, too, my introduction to Wikipedia.The professor was amazed (and <i>eventually</i> pleased) that all you punk editors reverted our nonsense and deleted our accounts--really fast, too.In fact, that Wikipedia acted like it promised to act was quite surprising, as the professor intended it to be an object in the failure of volunteers and committees to accomplish anything useful.There is no Wikipedia policy saying we should allow ourselves to be Guinea pigs, waste our time as Guinea pigs, or give special privileges to the conductors of experiments--it just shows a lack of respect to the more and more people who every day turn to Wikipedia for real information.So, how about show some respect for users, the people this is being written for?<a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 23:57, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User claiming admin abuse</span></h2>
<p>I was accused of abusing my administrator powers today. Basically, here's what happened: I indef-blocked a user (Mr.POV (<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.POV_8544.html" title="User talk:Mr.POV">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.POV_feab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.POV">contribs</a>)) due to the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">username policy</a>, which states that usernames with "Wikipedia terms" (the listed examples from the policy page includes "POV") are not considered appropriate. It was a very soft block, so that user can still edit via another username or anonymously; only the Mr.POV account is blocked.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the user posted from his IP on my talkpage: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABuchanan-Hermit&amp;diff=94212718&amp;oldid=93864851" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABuchanan-Hermit&amp;diff=94212718&amp;oldid=93864851" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. I gave him a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> warning after that and removed the messages from my talkpage. Today, he posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABuchanan-Hermit&amp;diff=94416432&amp;oldid=94236567" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABuchanan-Hermit&amp;diff=94416432&amp;oldid=94236567" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> accusing me of abusing my admin powers and using my userpage as a "blog" (which is ironic, since I loathe blogs and find them annoying).</p>
<p>Basically, I created this section to invite others' opinions about this matter (ie. Did I do the right thing? Was I simply carrying out Wikipedia policy?); I've also posted on that user's talkpage to invite him to post his two cents. Thank you. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#948663">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1">?!</font></a> 07:57, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically you were probably within your rights. Nevertheless, you could have probably avoided this turmoil by first pointing out the policy and giving him a chance to plan ahead before the block got slapped on him. Imagine what a surprise it was to him when he was logging in only to find out he'd been blocked. A little forewarning wouldn't have hurt. Even so, you were probably in the right, and he should just dust himself off and move on. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:06, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, reading <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">username policy</a> will show that you are not 'within your rights'. There is a procedure to follow to avoid just this scenario. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 08:10, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, there it is: "Co-operative contributors should normally just be made aware of our policy via a post on their talk page. Voluntary changes (via Wikipedia:Changing username) are preferred: users from other countries and/or age groups may make mistakes about choosing names -- immediate blocking or listing on RfC could scare off new users acting in good faith." and "Where a change must be forced, we first discuss it. This can take place on either (A) the user's talk page, (B) a subpage of the user's talk page, or (C) a sub page of Wikipedia:Requests for comment. It should be listed on Wikipedia:Requests for comment in the appropriate section. The user should also be made aware of the discussion." That word "should" in the first sentence might give B-H an out, but yeah, someone with admin power should read every word of something like that before taking action, and then <i>should</i> do as it instructs. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also told the user that he/she can sign up for another username (in other words, that the block is restricted to that username only). Although yeah, I admit I should've given him some warning first. However, the result would've been the same. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#948663">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1">?!</font></a> 08:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if it is a sockpuppet being used against policy, then that is what the account should be blocked for, but that is a different issue. I don't think that it is too much to ask that administrators follow policy and request the change before blocking. It helps prevent resentment and accusations of high handed abuse, so reducing vandalism. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 19:51, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On User name choice:<b>"Someone choosing such a username clearly knows what they are doing."</b>This statement is absolutely against assume good intentions.I'm not Internet savvy and chose a user name the first time I signed up for an account that was instantly blocked.No explanation, no way to ask why or what was going on, and I could not figure it out--AND I couldn't change my user name because my IP was blocked from signing up for a new user name.Finally I e-mailed some administrator who patiently did whatever was necessary to get me a user name.This attitude that everyone is so Wikipedia savvy that they know all Wikipedia acronyms is 100% against everything Wikipedia should strive for: namely an encyclopedia created by a diverse group of people on all the major topics in the world.If everyone is required to be a computer geek and know everything before they can even join, it will never happen.For one thing, if I spent enough time on the computer to be as familiar with the Internet as necessary to have not made the mistake, I would spend no time in the field getting to know my subject.Oh, the offensive user name that caused all this trouble was simply a common abbreviation in my field that has been adopted for Internet use.It was used my way for about a hundred years before the cyberspace came along--I'm a researcher, but not a researcher into cyberlingo, a little assumption of good faith could go a long way in making Wikipedia open to a much diverser group of people.<a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no doubt Armodios and Ephestion are Iasson; they are pushing his pet issue, and use his naming style; but there is some difficulty in finding an Iasson sock recent enough for Checkuser to work. Can there be community consensus, by looking at the edits to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece_ad37.html" title="Slavery in ancient Greece">Slavery in ancient Greece</a>, that these editors are Iasson? It would be a bad thing if he could evade an indefinite block by just staying away a couple months. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 18:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since I have quite a good knowledge of Iasson's sockpuppetry, I can say there's really no doubt that these two are socks of his. I could eventually block them myself as blatant socks, but first I would like to hear if there are any objections.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also have some knowledge of Iasson's edits, and these ones fit him to a tee, though they are less obvious than his earlier ones. Perhaps these are sleepers, or perhaps Iasson is trying to restrain himself. I'd say with confidence Armodios is definitely Iasson, Ephestion a little less obviously so; therefore, I heartily endorse the permablocking of Armodios, but Ephestion is less obvious. If a checkuser could be run confirming a connection between Armodios and Ephestion, perhaps that would be enough to permablock Ephestion. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 19:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can't move a page like that.When you do a "copy paste" move, the edit history is orphaned, which is very bad. Please consider tagging your newly created page <a href="../../../5/_/d/5_Days_A_Stranger_series_28dd.html" title="5 Days A Stranger series">5 Days A Stranger series</a> for speedy deletion using {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}}.Once an admin deletes it, you can perform the move using the "move" link at the top of the page.If you do not have a "move" link or are not permitted to make the move, it may be because you are a very new user.Very new users are not able to move pages as a precaution against vandalism. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi, nobody, anywhere, ever, calls this series "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Days_Series_6a76.html" title="The Days Series">The Days Series</a>" which is a ludicrous and meaningless title (and original research). the series does not have an "official" name, so, by default, the first game (and the best known one, with highest google count) should be the title i.e. 5 Days A Stranger, or alternatively <a href="../../../5/_/d/5_Days_A_Stranger_series_28dd.html" title="5 Days A Stranger series">5 Days A Stranger series</a>.

<p>I strenuously object to how this was done. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Romanian_discrimination_b530.html" title="Anti-Romanian discrimination">Anti-Romanian discrimination</a>, which had hundreds of edits by over a dozen contributors, including quite a few administrators (none of them me) does not look to me like the sort of article that should have been summarily deleted. It contained significant material (including quite a few citations) that, even if this article is deemed inappropriate, belongs somewhere else in Wikipedia; such salvaging of parts of articles often happens in the course of an AFD, but there is virtually no chance for it when an administrator acts unilaterally. I'll also add that the article did not particularly read like a polemic, and even explicitly acknowledged regions outside of Romania where Romanians are treated well (e.g. "The <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians_of_Serbia_9ffc.html" title="Romanians of Serbia">Romanians</a> living in the Autonomous Province of <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence…"). At most, I think it should have been retitled more neutrally to encourage discussion of positive as well as negative treatment, but it seemed to me on the whole to be a decent article. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, the Romanian term for anti-Romanianism is antiromanism: of course, occasionally that same term (usually in English) means opposition to Roman Catholicism, but a Google search turns up literally hundreds of on-topic hits from what are usually considered reliable sources. Some of them are debating whether there is such a thing, others are assuming that there is, but it seems to me that there is plenty here for a topic. Again, there may have been problems with this article, but I would certainly have opposed simple deletion if there had been an opportunity for discussion, and I do not like the fact that discussion is taking place only in the face of a <i>fait accompli</i>. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The last time Tajik was blocked for 24 hours, he immediately returned to incivility, and was blocked for 48 hours for incivility, then he came back and immediately plopped a bogus Stalking warning on my user page in retaliation for my reporting him.When I complained about Tajik posting the bogus stalking warning on my page, I was ignored, except that administrator Khoikhoi came to his defense, without any evidence, and while evidence to the contrary existed on Tajik's talk page.I certainly hope administrator Khoikhoi can read German.I would hope, though, after a user has been blocked for 24 hours for incivility, then almost immediately reblocked for 48 hours for incivility, then comes back and acts incivil, again, and then posts the incredibly nasty comments about other users (not just E104421) and about Wikipedia in general, that Tajik did, that an administrator would block him for longer than the 24 or 48 hours that did <i>nothing</i> the first time. As long as Tajik OWNS Afghanistan on Wikipedia, no one else will be able to edit it.And, considering how he feels about the competence of other Wikipedia editors, it's no wonder he feels he should own the article.And, yes, I am biased against Tajik, he is attempting to instill hostility into my experience on Wikipedia, in retaliation for a copyedit of the Herat page, and he has a lot of administrator support in owning his pages.Actually, I hope more administrators than Khoikhoi can read German. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fut.Perf, you said on my talk page, "for the moment, I propose to impose an informal 1RR regime on them both, on all the articles they've been reverting each other recently". To clarify, this 1RR would only apply when Tajik and E104421 are edit warring together, right? If so, I would support it. However, if it applys to <i>all</i> articles, I don't think it would be very fair both to Tajik and E104421. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 02:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And what's fair to other editors who go in and try to do a copyedit on some article Tajik OWNS, and become a target for his incivility and visciousness?Tajik has been blocked twice recently and warned numerous times, and what does he do?Blast all of Wikipedia for being inferior editors to him.And administrators have done nothing, there's even a notice above Tajik's complaint about E104421, on the 3RR board, another editor complaining about problems with Tajik, another editor ignored by administrators.I tried to use WP:DR, including just withdrawing from the articles for a while, and <b>Tajik blasted me for NOT CONTINUING AN EDIT WAR</b>!And Khoikhoi supported Tajik posting a blatantly false retaliatory stalking warning on my talk page--which is, in fact, the very essence of stalking: creating a hostile atmosphere for other editors, with the help of an administrator.</dd>

<dd>Well, obviously I am ticked off at being the target of Tajik's abuse, and of having him targetting me and so many others be ignored by administrators, however, Tajik's behaviour has been ignored for a long long time.Ultimately I don't think unilateral action against Tajik <i>is</i> fair, because I truly believe that he was created by administrators thinking they were <i>doing him a favor</i> by siding with him and ignoring his behaviour--ultimately, imo, administrators who ignored his bad behaviour early on created what he has become: an uncivil, edit-warring, reverting, abusive, personally attacking editor.He does not appear to be able to work with other editors.This has not always been the case, though.</dd>

<dd>The next time he puts phony warnings on my talk page, or attacks me for a copyedit, I would really like to see an administrator take it seriously, and when Khoikhoi comes in to defend his atrocious behaviour, I would like an unbiased administrator to come in and take it seriously.It's a great technique he has, though, attack attack attack, get supported by an administrator, and bam!, there you go, he's got rid of another editor.<a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS, And I <i>am</i> going to start editing the Afghanistan and Herat articles and other Afghanistan articles.I never should have allowed Tajik to bully me away in the first place.And I do know better now than to try Wikipedia DR, because administrators don't support editors who try it, and editors like Tajik, who see newbies like me foolishly use it, are probably just snickering.<a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calm down.

<dd>Wikipedia administrators allowed Tajik to "simply throw around accusations anywhere and for any reason," against me, and Administrator Khoikhoi did the same thing to me, in support of one of Tajik's "thrown around accusations."<b>When I complained about unsupported accusations by Tajik and Khoikhoi</b>, <i>I</i> was ignored.I wasted my time with <i>supported</i> allegations, Tajik and Khoikhoi countered with unsupported allegations, and <i>I</i> was the one ignored.That's where I learned it from, from another editor, far more experienced at Wikipedia than I am, and from an administrator.Wikipedia does not only allow it, but seems to prefer it, as the unsupported accusations against me carried far more weight than my supported accusations against Tajik--the unsupported accusations carried 100% of the weight, and the supported accusations 0%.</dd>

<dd>If it is harmful to Wikipedia for users to "Simply throw around accusations anywhere and for any reason," then administrators should not have stood by in mute silence while Tajik and Khoikhoi did it to me.But, administrators did just that, <i>ignored it when it happened to me</i>, probably <i>because</i> I'm a new user.</dd>

<dd>When administrators and editors use a technique to gang up on a newer and less sophisticated editor, and Wikipedia administrators support it by ignoring it, it's a bit confusing to then have <i>another</i> administrator come in and say, what was allowed to happen to the new editor, what more experienced Wikipedians used against the newer editor, is "not allowed" to be used by the new editor. Khoikhoi is an administrator and Khoikhoi supported Tajik's unsupported accusations against me, without Khoikhoi providing any support for his own support of Tajik.All the more experienced editors and at least one administrator know how to profit form this technique, to scold only the newcomer for following established practices of more experienced users simply gives Wikipedia more of an appearance of bias towards established editors and administrators and against newer editors. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 15:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We block editing access to the IP address as requested - students can still read articles</li>

It is mainly a post outline details on the other banned users. I assume that some of the banned editors have been contacting each other. Flavius explains the story behind the sockpuppet group. I wouldn't be surprise if one of the banned editors contacted him to ask him to rejoin the NLP page under a new name. Unfortunately he mixes some useful comments with suggestions on how to evade sock checks. He also discloses some personal details about editors which is not appropriate. Unfortunately the collaborative efforts have been distracted by arguments on the page but new socks of the banned editors.

<dd>That has been extensively discussed on the talk page of that article. See my response there. In brief, Nixer wants a version that only contains Marxist criticisms of liberal demcracyy (See his latest edit, he only restores the Marxist views but not the opposite view <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democracy&amp;diff=94320759&amp;oldid=94319994" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democracy&amp;diff=94320759&amp;oldid=94319994" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>). I do not object to this criticism of liberal democracy, but it should not be in the article about democracy without mentioning opposing views and without mentioning advantages of liberal democracy. Detailed advantages and disadvantages of specific forms of democracy should probably be in the appropriate article, otherwise this overview article which presents numerous form of democracy will become too big. However, if Nixer insists, I will, as previously, copy the advantages of liberal democracy to the the Democracy article and copy the disadvantages of Soviet democracy to the Democracy article. But I think that a better solution is to discuss this in articles about specific forms of democracy.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 18:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Umm, the image description page asserts "fair use" of the image.Almost every fair use image on Wikipedia is copyrighted with all rights reserved.But "fair use" gives you the ability to use someone else's work without permission, under certain circumstances.In the case of an album cover, nearly every article about an album has an image of the album cover at the top of it. It is rendered unneeded because of the existence of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Image%7ECharlie_and_the_chocolate_factory.JPG_9e3a.html" title="Image:Charlie and the chocolate factory.JPG">Image:Charlie and the chocolate factory.JPG</a>, but it's hardly a bad faith upload.<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, Doc. I appreciate that bringing it here is a result of your concern over a series of rapid decategorizing, but I think it's misguided in this case, though certainly well meant. Str1977 is a longstanding valuable member of the community, with well over 10,000 edits to his credit, many of which are reversions of vandalism, archiving talk pages, helping other users with formatting, etc., and many of which are also completely unrelated to Christianity. So "on a mission" seems rather loaded language. It seems likely that he saw an article in that category which didn't seem to belong, removed the category, and then looked in the category to see what other articles were in it, and removed the ones that he thought misplaced. It seems that the first place to express concerns should have been at his talk page. Bringing it here suggests that admin action (rather than user discussion) is required, especially by using the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} template instead of simply the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_1544.html" title="Template:User">user</a>}} one. I don't <i>think</i> we need a quick access to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Str1977_0a7b.html" title="Special:Blockip/Str1977">this</a>, though others may disagree :-)</p>
<p>It's possible for good editors to disagree over the appropriateness of categories. Sometimes it's more about POV pushing than about honest disagreements between users. For example, there could be a notorious serial killer, who happened to have Jewish parents, but who was himself an atheist. Someone who shows by his pattern of making anti-semitic edits that he has an axe to grind adds the murderer's article to the category (if there is one) of famous Jews. Other editors quite rightly protest. There can also be misunderstanding of what it means to be in a category. Months ago, I took <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Roper_f9d0.html" title="Margaret Roper">Margaret Roper</a> out of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category%7ECatholic_martyrs_dfd1.html" title="Category:Catholic martyrs">category of Catholic martyrs</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Roper&amp;diff=37937809&amp;oldid=20691232" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Margaret_Roper&amp;diff=37937809&amp;oldid=20691232" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> because she wasn't a martyr; her father was. Geogre reverted me, and gave a very reasonable explanation <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMargaret_Roper_28cf.html" title="Talk:Margaret Roper">on the talk page</a>, which I accepted.</p>
<p>Str1977 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Str1977_13ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Str1977">seems to be offline</a> at the moment, and someone has already left a message on <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977">his talk page</a>, <i>about</i> him, not <i>to</i> him(i.e. in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_person.html" title="Grammatical person">third person</a>!), and I'm sure he'll be open to discussing it when he next logs on. In this case, I would certainly agree with some of his decategorizations (or recategorizations), and can see the reasoning behind the others. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the responses, and the time that you all put into reviewing this issue. I'm not always clear on when to talk versus when to call for attention, and I did have concerns about the speed of the changes being made. I didn't realize that "appears at a casual glance...is on a mission" would be considered loaded language; in fact, my intent was rather the opposite. I was trying to indicate that I wasn't quite sure what was happening, and at 2:00 a.m. (my time) I simply wanted someone else to look into because it was way past my bedtime. Likewise, I didn't realize that the various {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_1544.html" title="Template:User">user</a>}} templates were associated with specific "threat levels"; I almost always use {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} on this page because it makes all relevant info easily available. I actually tried to ensure that my post wasn't accusatory or inflammatory, but I did want someone more experienced to review the situation. It appears that he removed the cat from 40 articles in about an hour, which strikes me as odd, but if others are unconcerned about the issue I'll not worry about it any further. Thanks again for your time, and sorry for any inconvenience. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 16:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, no problem, you were quite right to bring it here if you thought it <i>was</i> a problem, and I don't think Str will get huffy. Regarding the different user templates, a lot of examples can be seen at the bottom of the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} one. There used to be a problem with one that was called "vandal". It was eventually moved to {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserlinks_5339.html" title="Template:Userlinks">userlinks</a>}}, so we don't use it with the "vandal" name anymore. It gave user, talk, contribs, block user, and block log; and a decent user who had been blocked for 3RR (yes, there is such a thing!) would have his name appearing on the noticeboard with the word "vandal" in front of it in the source code! <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 17:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Ann for the heads up. Indeed I will not get huffy at Doc for bringing this up here (in contrast to Wetman's reaction filled with his usual condescension and insults.)</dd>
<dd>I am indeed not on a mission. I got drawn into the category by a posting on my talk page by Storm Rider, a Mormon editor. I had a look into the items of the category and found many inappopriate for various reasons. The "mythology" = "myth" angle was not one of them, though I see the danger in a reader misunderstanding this and also suspect that some editors did indeed post it with this in mind). Very broadly, my concerns were about the misidentification of mythology (concerns deities and supernatural beings) with legend and folklore. The category contained various Saints, even uncontroversial ones. It contained a number of items on relics (again very real objects, regardles of one's beliefs about them), it contained items that were mythology but more precisely Mormon mythology. Regardless of whether one sees Mormons as Christian or not, if an item is specific to only group alone it should not be associated with a wider (or different) group as such. Also, Biblical monsters did not seem very Christian too me. (And of course, the Islamic "al-Rakim" beat it all.) Finally, note that removing the category was not all I did - I also did some edits on problematic bits I came across (especially the Seven Sleepers).

<p><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a>, since I brought your name up on this forum in a negative fashion, it's only appropriate that I should make a formal apology to you in the samevenue. I have reflected on this little debacle that I wrought, and now consider that I made the following errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeing activity that I didn't understand, I jumped to conclusions not in keeping with an <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption of good-faith</a>.</li>
<li>I acted without taking the time to thoroughly review the situation. If I had, I probably would have seen that some of the cats were indeed inappropriate in the first place.</li>
<li>I posted here instead of trying to open a discussion on your talkpage. Bad judgement and no excuse for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result of this was that 6 editors wasted time on a non-existent issue, and I'm sure it caused you some consternation. So I hereby apologize to all involved, and most especially to <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> for bringing his name to ANI so frivlolously and improperly.

<dd>Policy specificly say revealing the "alleged" name of another party. It does not have to be correct to be a policy violation. It also says that the intent of the policy is to keep the information from being found with web searches using the user's legal name. Since the user has nowhere stated his name publicly on Wikipedia, stating it together with other information constitutes a privacy violation as it will turn up in web searches by name when the user himself has been careful not to make the direct association.(This is most applicable to the original violation by <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman">Paul Pigman</a> above).—<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 16:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Answer for administrators of wikipedia</p>
<p><b>KALPESH SHARMA -</b> Now I will answer to all your queries mentioned above. Good that this is the first time aksi who calls himself great and utcarsch who calls me a jealous has talked in a proper manner on this user page. This could have been done before also, instead of speaking worst kind of language you two administrators. I talked on user page of Jimbo, sam blanning and also to nina eliza. Check it and let me know or ask them what kind of wrong things did I follow. I talked with due respect with them because for every word and every sentenece they gave me a deep and detailed explanation. I request the honorable management of wikipedia to check this where always a shortcut code was specified by these two users. Even there are other administrators working with wikipedia, who work in a proper way. This policy is not being followed by aksi and utcarsch resulting to this issue. When a new user comes to wikipedia he may do many wrong things, because he is not going to read thousands of links availabale on world's biggest encyclopedia. It's the job of administrator to show him the right path as mr. sam and nina did. See their word and detailed sentence. I am an information security expert and not a wikipedia administrator or editor who knows what and how to use and work out withmillions of links in the site webpages. You both administrators did not treat that way and then blaming me. Every where WP:shortcuts were mentioned. What do I know what does these shortcuts mean, you both have not given any proper explanations even a single time. At the end when you were both tired of again and again deleting kalpesh sharma pages, then mr. patruat gave this instructions that stop doing it. This was when I understood why my article was deleted. But patruat had informed first of all on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalpesh_Sharma" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalpesh_Sharma" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> with respect and detail explanation.</p>
<p>In my case utcarsch and aksi had never given detailed or proper explanation and their lanaguage was further bad when due to un understandability my several pages were created. You never did your work properly though so many times the deleting actions were taken by you. Not even a single time you have given any proper explanation. Now, when a person who is technically little aware has so many problems then what would you both be doing with non-technical peoples. You are a spoiling wikipedia's reputation between users of wikipedia. In this way how the wikipedia will be filled with valuable, reliable and notable contents. You both are trying to show that you are innocent. In of the sentences utcarshch says that</p>
<p>I could find <b>only one reliable link</b>[1] that doesn't indicate any notability.<a href="http://www.cybercellmumbai.com/case-studies/hacker-hacks-into-a-financial-website" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cybercellmumbai.com/case-studies/hacker-hacks-into-a-financial-website" rel="nofollow">[69]</a></p>
<p>I will show you the evidence that this is a wrong thing, if keyword 'kalpesh sharma' is mentioned in google the following so data is found from search engine. And for your information all are from reliable notable sources. You have till now mentioned only one link of cybercellmumbai.com and if so many times edition and deletion was done why did you not mark even one of below notable sources out of so many:</p>

<p>Then comes the topic of great aksi ! sorry but the great word is being insulted by aksi by putting behind his name. He says above that</p>
<p>"He has also been contantly vandalising the article Ankit Fadia until I had to semi-protect it. A complete timeline of his disruption can be found here. His article has been deleted through AfD. Since then he has created multiple sock accounts and created the same article across many namespaces."</p>
<p>I have allready mentioned that my member of groups or some one else who might be knowing about me has vandalized and not me. As concerns to IP if a single internet connection is used with sharing basis from a big company network or e-governence network or somewhere like such place then it's possible that same IP address range is being seen for every user who tries to do modification. My reputation has spread amongst several peoples and I have already worked with chief minister (where Egovernence network exists) as technical assistant. I went to university of gujarat where mr. parimal trivedi is the vice chancellor for some personal matter. There I met many peoples of university staff. May any director, professor or someone even operator level employee would have been directed to post my details on wikipedia. This is not sufficient evidence for saying that single user is vandalizing. I saw the history pages at that time, they were are with different IP address. Every time when some one tried to post about me from my group it was deleted by these two peoples. Then one of my group member mr. agrawal said me that this is happening on pages and contents of your name. After that I tried to edit personally with my own hands my own simple and easy article on</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalpesh_sharma" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalpesh_sharma" rel="nofollow">[85]</a></p>
<p>But, when I saw same deletions as my members did ! I went to Mr. Prabhat and gave my opinion that either ankit fadia is a administrator who might be protecting his own pages or administrators who are deleting(utcarsch and aksi) might be playing games so that ankit fadia pages could not be removed. Something is definietly wrong. Because if you look at the data posted on wikipedia about me carefully every time whenever a deletion was made the editing member either from my group or whosoever has placed the contents, has tried to correct the content or article through a modification. Then also it was every time deleted and no proper reasons were given. Now give me explanation whether is it not the job of administrator talk and explain every matter in detail.</p>
<p>Other then this when I was informed by sam on jimmy wales user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94273775" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94273775" rel="nofollow">[86]</a> that go to deletion review, I had edited a message which was also deleted by either of them without any secific reasons. I have mentioned this also in a talk with sam on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Samuel_Blanning#Jimmy_Wales_Talk_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Samuel_Blanning#Jimmy_Wales_Talk_Page" rel="nofollow">[87]</a></p>
<p>I have been trying to get off wiki support is right. But I don't think that utcarsch or aksi has anything to do with that. And one more thing that India is country with freedom to speak in order to give their opinion, protest or give suggestions for one which is wrong. So this is useless reason. don't talk out of wiki topic. Else again I will have to say that do you both have any relations ankit fadia because again and again you are stopping me against my personal protest against ankit fadia. My personal protest or whatsoever I do out of wikipedia has nothing to do with current topic.</p>
<p>The following articles does not even contain single word about wikipedia encyclopedia company nor I have disrupted wikipedia. These articles mentioned complaints against the particular administrators who have been given special powers. Check it here is evidence</p>
<p>"<b>About Wikipedia Administrators</b></p>
<p>This article is a copy of matter posted by one of my group member on wikipedia because whether or not good, if any one edits ankit fadia's article on wikipedia these adminsitrators do not allow them to do so. Wikipedia administrators are not the employees of wikipedia group in any way they are instead simple persons like all of us working on internet. They have been provided rights of administration for modification of contents on wikipedia to make it more better. Not one or two or three but many peoples edited ankit fadia's contents, but the administrators are relatives of ankit fadia who do not want any one to modify anything about ankit fadia. I am daily recieving many emails of my members and peoples who are in touch with me. Other then this some of wikipedia administrators are going falling to such a useless level that even if any one who does not have relation with me, and if he/she edits ankit fadia's page the wikipedia administrators say it's kalpesh sharma itself. And that I am doing so because my publicity is less then ankit fadia. "</p>
<p>Article 1 - <a href="http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976863338" class="external free" title="http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976863338" rel="nofollow">http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976863338</a> Article 2 - <a href="http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976861802" class="external free" title="http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976861802" rel="nofollow">http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976861802</a></p>
<p>I don't think that any one can say that I have mentioned any things wrong about wikipedia. But definitely ,I have mentioned about some administrators because I believe that they are really wrong. I don't think that saying anything about peoples, "who are doing something wrong in any way" is incorrect. In short if such peoples are given administration rights who does not allow anyone to edit wikipedia for truth and facts then soon wikipedia will lost reputation and as concerns to utcarsch and aksi they can find work anywhere else also. Without going in depth of the reality and fact about any particular matter, no one can be said to be wrong - niether me, niether ankit fadia, niether utcarshch, nor any of my group members. This is what utcarshch is doing after getting administration powers?</p>
<p>Again utcarsch has mentioned the same thing which aksi had specified that</p>
<p>" I posted a message to LUG-Indore mailing list. User:Prabhat linux, the moderator of LUG-Indore has asked Kalpesh to stop using ILUG-Indore for self-promotion and Ankit-bashing. "</p>
<p>Wikipedia or it's data or policies have nothing to do with what is mentioned on any forum, or what way we work or so on. And if utcarsch is trying to mention that I was stopped by prabhat for ankit related bashing then see this where prabhat has specified on LUG Indore Group on one of my topic against ankit fadia:</p>

Hi Kalpesh,</p>
<p>This mail is a good evidence to AFCEH fraud. Lets spread the word. Fadia is nothing but money making machine for himself and Relience web world. No ethics, no shame.</p>
<p><br />
Read these reviews of his books on amezon.com : 1. Official guide to waste your money!, 2. oh no ankit fadia again...., 3. Official guide to Unethical copy and paste (plagarism) 4. If I could I'd rank 0 stars 5. HIGHLY INCOMPETENT</p>
<p><br />
Read them all here and have a good laugh: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unofficial-Guide-Ethical-Hacking-Miscellaneous/" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Unofficial-Guide-Ethical-Hacking-Miscellaneous/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Unofficial-Guide-Ethical-Hacking-Miscellaneous/</a>... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Network-Security-Hackers-Perspective-Second/dp/" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Network-Security-Hackers-Perspective-Second/dp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Network-Security-Hackers-Perspective-Second/dp/</a>...</p>

Hello Prabhatji,</p>
<p>I am too doing this. And I am proud as well as all the member of our group should feel proud because we are all spreading this message with a good intention, for nation and citizen interest. Every citizen should know everything about him else they are all going to loose lot of money and by that period ankit fadia will fill his bank accounts.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your support. and specially for this group that you have started... Else everything would have continued as it was moving... It's good that you are the first person across country to protest and gain so many peoples to join you... I am too feeling proud to be a member of your group...</p>
<p><br />
Go Ahead --- I am always with good peoples only.</p>
<p><br />
Kalpesh Sharma</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>In, short I found only one problem with both these adminsitrators Aksi and Utcarshch, that they have:</dd>
</dl>
<p>1)Again and again tried to save ankit fadia page though several peoples deleted or commented against ankit fadia excluding me, as if ankit fadia and their some personal relation of benefits exists.</p>
<p>2)Every time no particular deep and proper explanations were given about my page deletions</p>
<p>3)Every time tried to showcase that I am self promoting myself by vandalizing ankit fadia. The clarification of difference between self promotion and achievements is not clear to both aksi and utcarsch, so I had to specify this to sam blanning using jimmy wales user talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Information_Security_Expert.2C_India" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Information_Security_Expert.2C_India" rel="nofollow">[88]</a></p>
<p>4)Without sufficient evidence they self understood and claimed the article of Kalpesh Sharma as edited or posted by single user. Even if it was posted by single user that doesn't mean that they will come and directly catch my throat. They don't have this rights to say me(A reputed person) jealous or sock puppet which may be concern of legal matter and/or otherwise.</p>
<p>5)In the whole matter no where these two peoples have marked or specified any notable good matter for me. All they have mentioned is bad only about me. Why ? I ask. I have many achievements, why their eyes did not see this? Why their eyes did not see what prabhat of lug-indore group said good about me ? they tried to give all my weak points and overall behind that the matter is these two peoples have some beneficial relations with Ankit Fadia and that’s why this issue has gone so long.</p>
<p>I kindly request Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia Management and Any other Authorised person to look into this case from their views and not give my matter to any two these administrators utcarsch and aksi. Not at all.</p>
<p>Thnx – Kalpesh Sharma</p>

<dd>You all see what I am talking about, right? I have tried to explain to this user that he is not notable. And that posts that he himself makes on online groups, blogs and forums cannot be considered reliable.

<p>Out of following five none was specified above. What a useless talk is this administrator creating evertime. He gives his own story without sense. In which above link did I mentioned this blogsites or articles site. I have specified that this was a search engines result. and none of them has been posted by me. Does wikipedia publishing is done acccording the great aksi law or according to legal procedures mentioned by wikipedia management. Thjis aksi is creating his own stories every time and posting incorrect about me. He also tries to explain every one that what ever comments, peoples list I have on gather.com is all created by me. Then why doesn't he give evidence. Who is aksi to directly give this statement on wikipedia. His is just a nominated administrator and not the owner or founder of wikipedia.</p>
<p>This person is again and again posting his message every where to harass me that I ma creating my own messages in comments ever where. I have 200 peoples in all these 5 sites connected to me, and only 30-30 peoples overall have commented. On some articles there are no comments at all. Then why this aksi is not saying that kalpesh sharma has not given comment on particular article. Then I should give more then 70 or 80 such comments myself. What a useless person - talking again and again same matter which I replied him atleast 5 times. If he has any evidence that these comments are posted by me then prove it. Else don't debate and go away ? Simple .</p>

<dd>Policy specificly say revealing the "alleged" name of another party. It does not have to be correct to be a policy violation. It also says that the intent of the policy is to keep the information from being found with web searches using the user's legal name. Since the user has nowhere stated his name publicly on Wikipedia, stating it together with other information constitutes a privacy violation as it will turn up in web searches by name when the user thamself has been careful not to make the direct association.(This is most applicable to the original violation by <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman">Paul Pigman</a> above).—<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 16:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is so much of this discussion ad-hominem?I do not understand what the discussion above has to do with protecting my user space? Also, It was Sarah who made the block 1 week; does coming here for help result in blocks being made indefinite? btw I am not a sockpuppet and since no evidence was provided do I not have the right to remove the "suspected" template? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanuckster_0231.html" title="User:Canuckster">Canuckster</a> 15:57, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Canuckster had bothered to ask me, I would have unprotected his pages when his block expired. With all his huffing and puffing and pestering other people, some of whom aren't even admins, to unprotect his pages, he hasn't bothered to ask me once. As far as the sock tag goes, I don't mind if he removes it as long he stops using both Bell Sympatico Dynamic IPs and his accounts to troll Michael Ignatieff, Talk:Michael Ignatieff and my talk page. And I'm warning him now that this is his last chance. There is no doubt that Canuckster is Ottawaman's sockpuppet but I feel reluctant to post evidence because they are currently very easily identifiable and I really don't want to educate him. I don't think anyone who reviews the contribution history of any of these accounts would be left in any doubt at all.

<dd>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is Ottawaman, whom Sarah indefinitely blocked for trolling.The only thing we should be debating is whether Ottawaman (as Canuckster) deserves yet another second chance.With 4 blocks for disruption and trolling and 4 more for block evasion through sockpuppets and IPs, and considering he only here to attack Michael Ignatieff, I'd say he's at the end of his rope.Sarah should be commeneded for her patience with this editor, and if he is going to get a last chance then this really is it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The user page protections are still in effect.I do thank Sarah for apparently offering to remove the page protection; I assumed she would have removed the protections herself but I was obviously wrong about that and apologize for that assumption. I certainly have tried to only add reasonable material to the Ignatieff article which is quite important to Canadians and I would urge any interested to have a look to see those well cited edits which were just deleted en-masse by someone with no talk page discussion.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=94726073&amp;oldid=94712092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=94726073&amp;oldid=94712092" rel="nofollow">[101]</a>.

<dd>In such cases we have to weigh the pros and cons. I personally think the downside of the trouble this user and his socks has caused (assuming for the moment that our suspicions are well-founded) enormously outweighs any benefits of allowing this single-issue editor to edit here. I am against giving a last chance.

<p>I must say that I agree with Guinnog that the downside completely outweighs any minor positive contributions Ottawaman might make. If he was going to become a productive editor, I think he would have done so by now. He has shown here and on Wikinews that he has no interest in following policies and simply has an anti-American, anti-Ignatieff agenda to push. An interesting block log <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Neutralizer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Neutralizer" rel="nofollow">[104]</a> and edits from the same ISP <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:DragonFire1024/Neutralizer_IP%27s" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:DragonFire1024/Neutralizer_IP%27s" rel="nofollow">[105]</a>. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 01:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to note that the vicious attack above was <b>entirely</b> unprovoked. Sarah said she would gladly unprotect my user space. She did not. She said above "And I'm warning him now that this is his last chance"; now she says she does not want to give another chance; she accuses me of having an "anti-american agenda" which is a blatant lie and she makes all kinds of other crazy accusations. The anti-american slur is particularly libelous and, these days, a potentially harmful accusation to make. I did say that Ignatieff's allegiance to the US should have been in his article but at most I am anti-Bush foreign policy. Perhaps Sarah thinks Cindy Sheehan is also anti-american. It is shameful that here on Wikipedia I am having to defend my political opinions in this way. I came to this noticeboard to ask for help with the userspace protection issue. That has been settled by an admin. who unprotected the space. I then tried to remove this incident report that I placed here but was told I could not. If Sarah (or anyone else) wishes to be making ongoing and false accusations I am willing to engage in dispute resolution but I do not think this is the place. In the meantime I hope her supporters here will encourage her not to continue with the libelous namecalling.<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanuckster_0231.html" title="User:Canuckster">Canuckster</a> 02:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't unprotect your pages because you didn't actually ask me until after I had gone offline and when I came back and received your message, it had already been done. I never said I would "gladly unprotect [your] user space". What I said was I <i>would have if you'd bothered to ask me.</i> Please stop twisting my words. As for whether you get a second chance, I'm leaving that in the hands of the community. As for you being anti-American, the evidence is in your edits. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 03:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
