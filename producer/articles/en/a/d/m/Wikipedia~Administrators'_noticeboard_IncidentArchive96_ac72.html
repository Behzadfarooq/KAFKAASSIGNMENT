<p>The original <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicinius_c6d0.html" title="User:Licinius">Licinius</a> edited pages related to various codes of football in Australia. He aggressively and inflexibly pushed a strange POV and refused to work towards consensus. He abused and frustrated numerous good faith editors who were trying to work on the related pages (see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_Archive_7_%28Australian_rules_debates%29_55b0.html" title="Talk:Football/Archive 7 (Australian rules debates)">Talk:Football/Archive 7 (Australian rules debates)</a>). Eventually he spawned sockpuppets <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_man_from_OZ_5711.html" title="User:The man from OZ">User:The man from OZ</a> and <a href="../../../j/_/i/User%7EJ_is_me_d6ce.html" title="User:J is me">User:J is me</a> to help him with a vote at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_91b5.html" title="Talk:Football">Talk:Football</a>, and was blocked after being caught out by a checkuser request.</p>
<p>User then spawned numerous abusive socks.

<p>I have blocked Mr nice guy indefinitely, subject of course to review by other administrators.

Its pretty likely I'll be blocking more socks of Licinius in future. I'd appreciate some community support here. How do you all feel about imposing a <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html#Users_who_exhaust_the_community.27s_patience" title="WP:BP">"users who exhaust the community's patience"</a> ban on this user? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 00:46, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree that he is exhausting people's patience, but I am slightly uncomfortable with the idea of a ban. It seems to me that he has come back this time trying to make a new start, be reasonable and stick within the rules. The exhausting thing now is that he has a really twisted argument. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 09:08, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, objection noted. I grant that this incarnation is editing articles rather than abusing people, but I don't consider the edits an attempt to "be reasonable and stick within the rules". This user is repeatedly inserting and reverting to POV material that he knows has been rejected by the editing community numerous times. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 23:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I basically agree with you, but I think the reason he is not going with the consensus is because he feels that the previous discussions were not valid. One of the reasons for this is because they became more discussions about his behaviour than the content.

<dd>So..? Sorry, I don't understand what you're doing, Bonafide.hustla. The "personal attack" is highly dubious.

The NPA tag is intended to be used for <i>very</i> clear cases only. Please don't add frivolous tags to people's userpages. Also, your tag has no greater authority than if you'd written something in your own voice; Henry Flower is perfectly entitled to remove either kind from his page. <i>Don't</i> edit war to keep your posts on somebody else's page, unless you want to get blocked. Also, why exactly do you care if he removes it? You put it there for him to read, didn't you? See, his removal of it shows he <i>has</i> read it. You should be pleased.

<p>Please explain why it is not personal attack. This user said "I would do better to put my own house in order." while i was negotiating another issue, when i tried to negotiate on his talkpage, i was scoffed at and disrespected. he even said rofl (rolling on floor laughin) if this is not personal attack, I don't know what is.

<p>I'm on the verge of thinking I should really withdraw from further discussion on the matter. I'm incredibly disgusted with the behavior of several editors who have acted, IMHO, grossly inappropriately, either by their "wrong" actions or by their defense of those actions. The discussion is ongoing at <a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucaman_2cc1.html" title="User talk:Aucaman">User talk:Aucaman</a>. I'm feeling very close to wanting to pass out UN sanctions, so I think I should probably just sit down and shut up for a while. The actions [rollbacks on a number of users' talk pages] were <i>admittedly</i> performed without the rollerbacker's bothering to spend a moment's consideration figuring out whether or not doing so were warranted, on the sole basis that Aucaman is under an arbcom injunction to watch his use of reverts [which, as it happens, hello, has nothing to do with leaving messages on other users' talk pages]. I'm disgusted, nay <i>appalled</i>, that this activity has been supported by 2 other users, at least one of whom is a fellow admin [for whom I voted!&#160;:-\] ... If someone with a level head and the interest and time to actually <i>investigate</i> what's going on instead of pronouncing uninformed snap judgments could take the time, please comment on Aucaman's talkpage. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:45, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really think it's worth spending a lot of energy on this now. The deed is done anyway - whether or not one considers A's talkpage postings as spamming, or whether or not one considers reverting them to have been appropriate, the messages will have reached their addressees by now (and they would have done so even if they had remained deleted).

<dd>What the heck is this? There isn't any question: he misused protection. Why is everyone saying, "Well, he unprotected, so that's alright?" Sheesh. That's not what protection is for. It's what {{inuse}} is for. For years administrators have edited busy pages. For years they haven't resorted to protection to do it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 09:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I too find this shocking. Note that the edit Phil wanted to get through wasn't some kind of sysop intervention or meta message that everybody needed to get as soon as possible. It wasn't a message that he was about to protect the article, block contributors, issue a general 3RR warning, or anything like that. It was perfectly "normal editor" editing, in the form of several argumentative replies in the ongoing content debate, the same as everybody else. To then use sysop powers to make a special window <i>not</i> available to others when the editing is hot and fast, that's just ... bad. I don't see how it can be defended. Admins aren't supposed to be a privileged caste. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:11, 4 May 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Oh good, we haven't all gone insane. Special powers are for helping the community in special ways. Using them to make posting on talk pages easier for yourself and making it temporarily impossible for everyone else is not justifiable. It doesn't matter that he unprotected shortly after, because users were still inconvenienced temporarily - the very reason he applied protection, the high traffic on the page, is the very reason why he should not have.</dd>
<dd>The ability of admins using their powers to benefit themselves pretty much ends with being able to delete your own user subpages, in my view. Phil Sandifer misused protection. It's not a big incident, so let's not make a big deal out of it, but please, let's not see any more of it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is with pain in my heart that I have to agree with Bishonen and Geogre. I know Phil to be a decent, reliable and responsible admin. However, I disagree with his action on this talk page. His comment was that of an editor, not of an admin. In such cases, admins should not use their privileges, but act like normal editors are able to do. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a> explicitly states: "Admin powers are not editor privileges." <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 11:12, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I'm not calling for a rope and a posse. I just can't countenance it as all Ok. It's not Ok. In fact, if there were people who were complaining about Phil for other reasons, it would be evidentiary, but it's not an ArbCom case by itself. (Some of us who don't like the clerks office and their ability to expand into all fissures in power might see it as an argument, but that's a separate issue.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:39, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I requested the block on AIV and then I saw that Bishonen had blocked it one minute earlier. IPs from The Planet seem to be in the Dallas/Ft Worth area and there is a user down there who likes to post from IPs rather than register; nicknamed the Anon Texan for lack of a better word. He is pro-Republican and it would not surprise me if he was spamming for the AfD against "Rationales to impeach...". I would be very surprised if this was one of our regulars. In any case the anon Texan is annoying but rarely is actually disruptive. I would support reapplying the block in 12-24 hour increments if he begins spamming again as well as blocking any other IP that resolves to The Planet that behaves the same way. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well for starters, you might want to see if they can track down all accounts created from the anon texan IPs, I get the feeling that he wouldn't make it this obvious if there wasn't a replacement merecat lined up already--64.12.116.65 15:20, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, Merecat doesn't really have sock puppets in the traditional sense. Assuming Rex071404 is merecat, Rex stopped editing in November, about the same time Merecat started up, Rex also had an IP he appeared from when he forgot to log in, which he acknowledged and linked the talk pages. This IP was not in Texas. I'm going out on a limb, but I think he moved to Texas around November and started a new account at that time, for whatever reason. Only this time, when he didn't log in (accidentally or on purpose) he didn't admit who he was. The last contributions by Rex look a lot like the first contributions by merecat, but the early contributions by Tbeatty and BlueGoose don't look similar, except they are all Republican-leaning. Plus, I think when Mackensen looked at the server logs he would have spotted any more socks. (When we asked him to check a couple of suspected socks of VaughanWatch, he found 30 in one go.) At this point my opinion, worth every penny you've paid me, is to pull back and see what Merecat does next. If he's learned a lesson, then live and let live. If IP accounts from The Planet or Everyone's Internet in Texas start helping him avoid 3RR penalties or double-vote, then some further short term blocks might be in order. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:04, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that I read up on Rex' dismal history, I think the remedies section of his (Rex') most recent ArbComm require that a review of Merecat's edits be made to establish whether any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rex071404_4#Problematic_editing_at_other_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rex071404_4#Problematic_editing_at_other_articles" rel="nofollow">terms</a> of that hearing have been violated.</li>
<li>As an aside, the ability for one editor, the subject of four prior RfA's, to be permitted to distract so many from the effort of writing an encyclopedia is quite jarring. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 04:25, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't aware of that. If you want to press the matter you may want to start a new discussion at the bottom of the page. I feel I'm being led into this by an anonymous AOL user and two anti-bush editors who have filed an RfC and RFAR that were highly stacked against him.

<li>Mentioning historical fact, however uncomfortable to Bush, is not equal to "anti-Bush." You disallowing facts (calling it POV), merely because they show that Bush is not the <i>Hero</i> you want him to be is totally against wikipedia policy.

<p>It appears that I keep being unfairly blocked from editing anything in the Wikipedia with my registered user name, <i>Art Dominique</i>, due to illfated actions taken by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> in reference to the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> article.</p>

<p>I now ask for the assistance of administrators in reference to the clearly unfair protecting of the Kven article, and especially in reference to the "weird" and <b>totally unfair blocking</b> of my editing privileges, please, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Despite of many pleas for him to do so, the above mentioned user with "weird reasoning" - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> - has not provided sources for his claims in the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> text or on its discussion page. His claims presented are not - to our knowledge - supported by known historians and/or other scientists. Instead, the views presented are contradicting those of known historians and other specialists on the related fields, as has been proven on the <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> discussion page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the users opposing the views of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> have provided their own distinguished sources on another Kven text page version and the Kven discussion page as well. However, without presenting sources of their own and without discussing their claims, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> keep reverting the Kven text into a text version by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>, which includes his unfounded claims, not supported by science. Furthermore, the sources offered on the bottom of that text version do not agree with the views/claims presented. The given sources have been carried on from the contributes of other editors.

(Assuming we buy the idea that CBDunkerson was wrong to protect, which I'll note so far few, if anyone, believes except you). Third, your unprotection was absolutely uncalled for given your obvious involvement; I believe it's appropriate to bring this to other administrators attention so they can verify that your actions are incorrect and biased. Finally, Voice of All already said that he <b>agreed with the protected status of the pages</b>. He's said nothing to date to nullify that statement. Please stop twisting what others say to your own ends. Please also stop abusing your sysop powers in disputes in which you are directly involved.

<li>I've looked through the various recent prod removals. Two of the last 11 prod removals were counter to current policy and/or consensus. In one case, she removed a prod from a musician who clearly did not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and in another case removed a prodded movie actor on the basis of the individual having an <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> entry (the consensus as a matter of precedent on the AfD page seems to be that IMDB is not by itself enough to justify notability of an actor). However, many of the other prod removals were reasonable. I'm also concered about this block coming from Zoe in particular given that Zoe has had past run-ins with Monicasdude about precisely this issue. Overall, this block seems unjustified. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:27, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd have to agree with JoshuaZ here, I'm concerned since Zoe has made statements in the past that she feels Monicasdude is randomly removing prods, which I don't think is the case. Regardless, isn't the whole point of prod that anyone can object and remove the tag? While we may disagree with his reasoning on some of the articles, they were all completely civil and appeared to have some thought behind them. I would appreciate it if you would consider unblocking. .:.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJareth_d262.html" title="User:Jareth">Jareth</a>.:. <sup><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJareth_7e10.html" title="User talk:Jareth">babelfish</a></sup> 03:29, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I also fail to see the reason for this.

<li>As backed up by emerging consensus here, I have unblocked because I don't think the blocking rationale was valid.

<li>I concur with <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> here- blocks for disruption are all well and good, but this block wasn't well justified.

<dd>The initial block was the one you are describing and only resulted in a short block, however it is more complex than this, as the sources were provided at the time. It is a difficult situation to explain and is in relation to the <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jock_Stein_e520.html" title="Jock Stein">Jock Stein</a> page, where the number of reverts or vandals(not me but people trying to put on the same information as I was, often in a crude way) is high due to the information that I was putting on the page deliberately being suppressed despite sources being provided. See the talk page on this article for details. The admin who initially blocked me I felt was possibly too friendly with one of the users in a revert war and without wanting to sound rude, would by appearance be diametrically opposed to my views. The indef block occured because I blanked my user page to hide the fact that I was blocked previously, I did this as I felt the previous block was unjust. I must also point out that this only went noticed when another user who objected to some of my edits went trolling through my posts and referred the matter of me blanking my own user page to an admin. Whilst I admit that some of my edits may be looked at as POV by some, I would disagree that they are vandalism. I would obviously say that I will not blank my user talk, and will not deliberatly vandalise. --TheKarateKid7 04:00, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I have a question. Gator1 blocked Karatekid7 on March 21 with an expiry time of indefinite, but I can not find where it was posted to AN/I for ratification as a community ban, and there was certainly no Arbcom ruling. Can one admin permanently ban a user withouot discussion? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:53, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the block, it looks like Karatekid7 was blocked for 48 hours in December and created John79, a rather obvious sock, that was caught and blocked the same day. No big deal, happens all the time around here. But then on March 21 Gator1 blocked him first for a week, then escalated it to indef, for reasons that I can not understand based on the record. He created KarateKid7 which operated trouble-free for a month before being blocked as a sock. I perfectly understand blocking the sockpuppets, I do not understand the March 21 indef block. In fact, the blocking policy for disruption says, in part, "<i>However, indefinite blocks should not be used...against user accounts that make a mixture of disruptive and useful edits.</i>" Sometimes disruptive accounts are permabanned by Arbcom, and sometimes by "community consensus" but I see no evidence that Gator1 ever sought consensus because the indef block of Karatekid7 was not posted to AN/I. Since Gator1 has left the project there is no way for Karatekid7 to appeal directly to her. None of Karatekid7's conduct, including using socks, justifies a unilateral permanent ban. I would like to hear from some admins (and not just from an anonymous Columbian IP with an obvous agenda to keep Karatekid blocked) on what is the reason for sustaining this block. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

RESPONSE:</p>
<p>If you view the history of both 'Siamese Fighting Fish' &amp; 'Discus Fish' you will see that Goldenblue is the user responsible for removing existing links. For almost, if not over 2 years, a couple of prominent sites have been listed on Wikipedia, yet a few small minded people decide they want to play musical chairs and start deleting sites, and adding links to firstly a site that does not exist (refer: www.betta-australis.com) it isnt even a valid or live site, then to another site at the expense of other sites with publically available data, whereas they keep all relevant information hidden in some secret fashion that is not in the spirit of sharing information freely.</p>
<p>Goldenblue also makes slanderous comments against the person who owns several of the other sites, who has nothing to do with these eidts, stating that they hack into sites etc etc. Making such a public claim is slander without proof, something which they will not have, as no website has been affected at all by the person or persons they claim against.</p>
<p>I would be suggesting Goldenblue be removed from using such a resource as Wikipedia, as they have shown they are interested in nothing more than to cause trouble, the history of both pages as mentioned above will prove this without anything else needed to be said.</p>

<dd>Indef blocking vandal only accounts is pretty common, but I agree in this case it could be seen as a little harsh, as the vandalism wasn't extreme (bad, but I've seen far worse).

<dd>For a new account that has only produced vandalism, an indefinite block is not an extreme measure. After all, there's no useful edit history to be preserved. If the perpetrator decides to clean up his act, he can always create a new account or request an unblock on the old one. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 14:34, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aye, I was just pointing out that it could be seen as a bit harsh, and suggested another possible course of action in similar situations.

<p>I'd just like to chime in that I think indefinite blocking is the preferred method for dealing with new accounts that haven't done anything useful (and have done stuff that was destructive). --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></font></a> 19:33, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Accounts that do nothing but vandalise articles, I warn and then give a 24 hour block just like (non-shared) IPs (the first time, that is).

<p>Hi there - I would like to complain on a number of fronts about ChrisO - he has been less than helpful. When the trouble started, ihad a banner on my userpage proclaiming a particular viewpoint on a controversial moral issue. ChrisO kept deleting it, never explaining why - and he blocked me after a few re-uploads. Thankfully, <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:Pgk</a> told me of a page explaining what Wikipedia is not: many thanks to him for doing so, because now I understand what I did wrong. On a number of occasions, he has objected to me adding 'Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics/Content' stickers to various album covers. Also, after having seen a number of requests for it to be done [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Train_station#Objections|(see" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Train_station#Objections|(see" rel="nofollow">them here)</a>], and going by correct English, rather than incorrect/colloquial 'American English' (which bears little resemblance to the real English language), I reversed the roles of the articles 'Train station' and 'Railway station' - they had previously had the content in 'Train station' and a redirect in 'Railway station.' For some time, my arrangement stayed, but then ChrisO, RexNL and Tawkerbot all came along and undid what I had done: why are these people not challenged? When I went to add some valid content to 'Railway station', I found that the <i>&lt;expletive deleted&gt;</i> that is ChrisO had protected it from all editing! Talk about an over-reaction... --RichardHarrold 13:58, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the station debate, I would suggest reviewing the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a>, specifically the section entitled <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Disputes_over_style_issues" title="WP:MOS">disputes over style issues</a>. I don't know if your logical constitutes "substantial reason" for change. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 14:05, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've read your post and taken a look at the conflicts, and here's my opinion.
<ol>
<li>I can see even without looking through the history of your talk page that ChrisO attempted to explain why the image had been deleted, and he even gave you a link to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a week before Pgk did. In fact, it appears to me he was the most helpful of various admins who deleted it, given that some of them never posted to your talk page at all, as far as I can tell.</li>
<li>As I understand it, album covers should not have Parental Advisory stickers because they are just that, stickers, not a part of the official album cover. In addition, there are copyright concerns related to altering copyrighted album covers and posting them in an altered state. In a case like this, the burden is on you to explain why album cover pictures on Wikipedia should have the sticker, and also to at least consider the copyright concerns.</li>
<li>If you'd like to avoid conflict as much as possible here (as any sane person would, I think), claiming that American English is "incorrect" and "bears little resemblance to the real English language" probably isn't a very good idea. In this case, as far as I can tell, neither <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_station.html" title="Train station">Train station</a> nor <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_station.html" title="Railway station">Railway station</a> is particularly more correct than the other, but again, the burden falls on the person who wants to make the change. When you repeatedly change things back to your way rather than engaging in a discussion, protection is a likely result.</li>

<dd>Read a little farther up on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETrain_station_4005.html" title="Talk:Train station">Talk:Train station</a>; the discussion over the article's name has been going on for quite some time, and comments on that page alone about the title date to July 2004. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> <small><a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlambo_46ea.html" title="User talk:Slambo"><font color="black">(Speak)</font></a></small> 14:50, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an aside, I think that article should be at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Station.html" title="Station">station</a> and the current contents of station should be at station (disambiguation). As normally understood, station implies a railway station, and a qualifier is added for anything else. The qualifier of railway / railroad / train station for stations is a recent and far from universal thing as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:03, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To be fair (and I guess this isn't really the place for this discussion) station is also used fairly often in a transportation sense for bus, gas, and subway stations, and in other senses to describe television and radio stations. I don't really think the word "station" alone is much more likely to refer to the train variety than any of those.-<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet"><font color="blue">Polo</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolotet_bad8.html" title="User talk:Polotet"><b><font color="black">te</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Polotet_728d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Polotet"><font color="orange">t</font></a> 16:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yet another case where the two naming principles collide. Names of articles should be 1) at <i>their most well known forumulation</i> and 2) <i>in the most accurate form.</i> So, which do people type in more, when looking for the place the choo-choo stops, "station," "train station," or "railway station?" I think the middle one. Which is more accurate? Depends on where you are. Therefore I'd say "most common" wins. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:40, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we're getting <i>way</i> off topic here. The issue at hand is that (a) he has repeatedly been recreating images and templates that have gone through AfD/TfD and speedy deletion, even after I've explained why he shouldn't do this (the claim that it's not been explained to him is an outright lie); (b) he's been altering Fair Use images, which presents a copyright problem which I've pointed out once (not "on a number of occasions", which is another lie) after another user raised it; and (c) he's been creating POV forks by copying and pasting the contents from one article into another (viz. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_station.html" title="Train station">train station</a> vs <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_station.html" title="Railway station">railway station</a>, again even after I've explained why this isn't a good thing to do. The message he's posted to the top of his talk page sums up his attitude: "Chris - don't even bother adding a message, because I'm not listening..."

<p>Accordingly, as Rex has now been the subject of <i>four separate ArbComm hearings</i> and has willingly sockpuppeted to violate a remedy from the last one, I don't know of any more stringent remedy available at this point, leaving only a wide-scale, permanent ban from Wikipedia. I only feel comfortable saying so because the amount of time and effort that this user has drained from the development of dozens of what are almost exclusively political articles is a detriment to the Wikipedia project as a whole. Simply dismissing violations of the remedy of the ArbComm is a disservice to the ArbComm process and the users who participated in the process.</p>
<p>Note: I am compiling evidence of other term violations around disruptive editing, vote stacking, etc. - but this particular violation of remedy is important and <b>should be considered apart from any claims of disruption or POV concerns.</b></p>

<li>So even though Merecat's edits to John Kerry have not been disruptive, and even though Mackensen said "likely," not "confirmed," and even though the penalty specified by Arbcom is blocking for <i>up to a week</i>, you think he should be permanently banned.

<p>As far as I can tell there was no disruption to WP because of sock puppetry. It appears that the worst abuse was trying to get other editors involved in an AfD. Certainly nothing worth a permanent ban. RyanFeisling is currently in a RfC because of a disput with merecat.

<p>If he had edited the Kerry article using a sockpuppet then a permanent ban is automatic, irrespective of content.

<dd>Actually, the enforcement states that if he violates the terms of the arbcom decision, he can be blocked for up to a week at a time, up to a year for multiple violations. Obviously there were multiple violations, but I don't think it's entirely fair to levy them all at once since the sockpuppetry is just now coming out. I'm going to block him for a week, and I suggest editors consider appealing to the arbcom to reopen his last case to consider the charges of circumventing the arbcom decision with sockpuppetry. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Ka</a><a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_TC_c598.html" title="User:JCarriker/TC">t</a><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">efan0</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 20:43, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am inclined to think that Mccready's version is not only syntactically superior to that to which sundry editors are reverting but is also appropriately neutral. Notwithstanding my preference for Mccready's version, though, and irrespective of what are surely good faith attempts on his/her part to justify his/her version on the talk page, where an addition is persistently reverted, especially by more than one (otherwise competent and esteemed) editor, it is likely appropriate that, even as one believes he/she has properly discussed the issue on the talk page, he/she nevertheless discuss further. It is, I understand, exceedingly hard for one to engage in such discussion where it appears that others are content to revert without discussion, but there appear to be willing participants on the article's talk page, enough such that a consensus version might be reached and the extant edit-warring might be ended. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:04, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mccready is a relatively new user who has made around 500 edits to articles. He's been involved in conflict with a number of editors since he began here, regularly issuing threats to people who revert his edits. He has demanded apologies from Xtra, David Cannon, Jayjg, Pecher, Moshe, and me; has threatened to report Sethe and Justen for vandalism; has threatened Seth, Nortman, Ombudsman, and me with separate RfCs (for separate issues); has complained about me, I believe, four times on AN/I; has stalked me to four articles; and has been warned by at least three admins.

I forgot to mention that he'd had a very slight disagreement with FloNight (I mean very slight: all she did was politely disagree with him), and he not only turned up at her adminship nomination to oppose, but e-mailed several other editors he didn't know to do the same, e-mailing one of them six times apparently. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMccready&amp;diff=51022017&amp;oldid=50912833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMccready&amp;diff=51022017&amp;oldid=50912833" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> He does seem to be out to cause trouble, then presents himself as the victim when he succeeds.

Users last comment "Just stating that I dont agree with your last sentance.DivineShadow218 19:04, 5 May 2006 (UTC)" seems to be simply attracting 'flames'.

<dd>SPUI can be a big bloody pain in the arse, and his <i>methods</i> have received some critisicm, but everytime I see someone uninvolved enter into the fray it's the same story: "Don't be a dick, but I agree with the move/smaller template/that sixteen year olds are sexy/that ducks in prams must die/etc/etc." Different day, same story here.
<ol>
<li>Those page moves all look fine, and follow the naming conventions for other parenthetic disambiguators.</li>
<li>Calling that link a "warning" is a big stretch. It was localised by definition, not a blanket "Never ever do this again."</li>
</ol>

<dd>I'd encourage this to be worked out at the lowest level possible, and also advise that this "consensus" be worked on a bit more, because what's there on the I 75 talk page isn't it.</dd>

<dd>That's hardly the point. I agree with some of what he wants to do too, but his chosen implementation method is to steamroll everyone else in order to get his way, including acting abusively to anyone who thinks that, gosh, maybe other editors should be allowed to participate in these decisions too. Believe it or not, this gets my back up just a bit—to the point where I even end up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Interstate_Highways_in_Washington&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Interstate_Highways_in_Washington&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit warring</a> in defense of a position that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_10&amp;diff=47885465&amp;oldid=47885106" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_10&amp;diff=47885465&amp;oldid=47885106" rel="nofollow">I don't even agree with</a>. I would add that when the assembled corps of administrators emits a collective yawn at SPUI's antics every time the subject comes up—as it does every few days, like clockwork—it sends a message that some people's actions and contributions are just naturally more valid than everyone else's, which is very alienating and is contrary to the principles upon which Wikipedia is supposedly founded.</dd>

I don't understand how this User manages to stay here on Wikipedia. His own user page references a log of blocks and unblocks almost a full page long. Hello? Wikipedia is becoming a safe haven for what I call 2nd generation Trolls. These are the trolls that are clever enough to not technically violate enough rules to get tossed out. But they walk the thin line, intentionally, and cause grief for most of the people they come into contact with. Abusive people don't belong in a co-creative and co constructive environment. Once again i feel the need to urge; Wikipedia shouldn't be COMBAT.</p>

<p>Bmt86 restored the discussion of that article, which says exactly nothing, and is unsigned. It is not related to the article. It does not show a will to understand policies. The term is used by different IT companies, and in mathematics. It is pointless to hoax it. It does not make sense to call removal of "discussion contribution", which is vandalism, vandalism. so-to-say "vandalizing vandalism". A Clear user page gives me edit rights. Bmt86 looks unable to check my user page forehand, or to contribute to the article in any way.</p>

<dd>I do not see it an "<i>incorrect</i> anon comment", because its author basically says he does not understand much about the article. <i>I</i> could add this to (any) article i do not understand. This does not make sense, and it reads vandalism to me. I believed removing unrelated data, which has nothing to do with the article. Basically it gets a discussion about discussion, or a trial to push the effect button <i>vandalism</i>. I believe it is something different...the data was only able to produce comments like "I do not understand it too".

This violation consisted of <i>seven</i> reverts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adana&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adana&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. However, there are other factors that influence my decision, tha major one being this: it came to my attention a couple of days ago that TuzsuzDeliBekir has been participating on a racist Turkish nationalist (anti-Semitic, anti-Armenian, anti-Greek) website coordination his POV warring with the banned user <a href="../../../-/i/n/User%7E-Inanna-_9e9b.html" title="User:-Inanna-">-Inanna-</a> (<a href="../../../-/i/n/User_talk%7E-Inanna-_0390.html" title="User talk:-Inanna-">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Inanna-_ada5.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Inanna-">contribs</a>) (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive86_55fc.html#Seeking_consensus_for_community_ban_of_-Inanna-" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive86">banned for edit warring and racist attacks</a>) and advocating "intimidation" of <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> (who she refers to as the "troublesome Jew"). The forum thread was removed when I filed a report with the site for violation of their terms of service (namely, hatred, racism, and harassment), but the full text can still be seen at <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit__Wikipedia_Sorunu__translation_1aa9.html" title="User:Dmcdevit/&quot;Wikipedia Sorunu&quot; translation">User:Dmcdevit/"Wikipedia Sorunu" translation</a>. And indeed, Inanna has been using dynamic IPs to attempt to intimidate Khoikhoi on his talk page for days now.</p>
<p>In response to his latest 3RR block, he left the following message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TuzsuzDeliBekir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51545952" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TuzsuzDeliBekir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51545952" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, which included more harassment and accusations against Khoikhoi "<i>When a Turkish editor comes and adds, then Khoi comes and sees it. Afterwards, he alerts all of his watchdogs...You can put a tag on Wikipedia like</i> Sorry, because of Khoi, we are totally close to all turkish editors<i>.</i>" and a promise to continue edit warring when he gets back: "Anyway, I will have a holiday then I will be back and revert the page again unless you will hear me." For relentless edit warring, using off-wiki forums for POV-coordination, racism, and harassment of other editors (which is carried out by his comments here), and even promising to keep edit warring when he gets back, I don't think he <i>should</i> be allowed back to Wikipedia, and I've extended the block to indefinite.

<p>Vandalism warning Welcome to Wikipedia. We invite everyone to contribute constructively to our encyclopedia. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing. However, unconstructive edits are considered vandalism, and if you continue in this manner you may be blocked from editing without further warning. Please stop, and consider improving rather than damaging the hard work of others. Thank you. --Strothra 22:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>My edits could only be construed as attacks in that they are cuttingly cogent, and that they are directly proportional to what is being thrown at me. Nothing I have said is an attack as such in that everything I have said is born out by a rational and cogent examination of the facts.</p>
<p>I am admittedly rather long winded at the rfc. I think thats fair considering that half the people there were summoned there by talk page spam. It seems to be up in the air wether this is legal or illegal. My understanding is that it is illegal. If it is legal, then please forgive my anger, I'll just get to work right away on spamming every mailbox on wikipedia i think is likely to be sympathetic to my side.</p>
<p>Strotha should recuse from any admin actions against me as strotha is biased, and attacked me first. In particular, the only things i said that could be construed as personal attacks against him were when he first attacked my educational credentials. The fact of the matter is, Strotha is either lying out of ignorance, or lying out of intention. To assume good faith is to assume that he really did read those articles, and, still failed to understand them well enough to try to bait me with a straw man argument. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:31, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am attacking the integrity only at this point of merecat, and strotha. These people have demonstrated bad faith through the use of manipulation, ad hominems, and other rules violations which nobody seems responsible enough around here to ketch.</p>
<p>Theres an interesting note on my talk page. Somebody is now using my words to start shooting down Wikipedia. I think thats unfortunate, and i think they are taking what i am saying out of context. However, I expect people &lt;Admins&gt; to start listening to me, and for the manipulations and con games and rule breaking to be attended to, or i might end up saying more things that somebody might use to defame Wikipedia, and that would be unfortunate. I have the gift for fire of the tongue. I also make a good research assistant. Wikipedians gmaing the system, breaking the rules, using ad hominem attacks, and underhanded manipulations are making the system broken. This is a test of Wikipedias integrity, and I reserve the right to be the final judge. I also resent being put in the position of verbal combat in the first place, because yes, I am good at it, and no, its not fun and i don't enjoy it, and i'd rather be cooperating with people to build something; "The best encyclopedia ever." My comments as a whole are neutral; I have even in some peoples minds given the deletionists "ammo" by admiting that the article in question is biased. Let me be even more clear. The article is a factual article written in neutral language about a noteworthy topic. Period. Logically, there is no bias in the logic per sey. In order to conform to WIKIPEDIAS NPOV standards, the article still needs its MPOV defense Echo. Instead of using a pov driven mob to delete the article, fix the article. And quit giving me flack about my factual evaluations of people. If i call somebody a liar thats because they lied. If i call somebody to be acting in bad faith, its because a series of ad hominems and straw men arguments have logically demonstrated that to be fact. Strotha does do what he does lightly; strotha uses his position as a shield and then attacks. I'll assume good faith with anybody who continues to act in good faith. I'll not assume good faith for people who through their actions demonstrate that they are just republican pack psychology mob members. If that is a problem with Wikipedias admins, then Wikipedias problems are bigger than I or anyone can resolve. To some degree, Wikipedia DOES owe its fealty to THE FACTS, not the form of false consensus that is created when people operating in bad faith initiate a bad faith VFD and then vote stack. And certainly not the facts according to Strotha; who is willing to attack me to get a reaction and then play the poor innocent victim. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:19, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

She did not take that well, she kept sending me warning messages for every little thing she found on me. First she refered to this talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iranian_peoples#Voting_to_include_Iranian_Turkic_speaking_groups_here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iranian_peoples#Voting_to_include_Iranian_Turkic_speaking_groups_here" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> stating that i have committed another PA! Later she sent this exact message: <i>I'm warning you again, do not attack other users as you have here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nelson_Frye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51402214" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nelson_Frye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51402214" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> and do not continually revert the edits of other users either</i>.

I had previously reported that very same user for vandalism because he kept reverting that very same article the word <i>well-known eminent</i> to <i>distinguished</i> stating that they came to an agreement in the talk page, which they did not and he is clearly lying. She then sent this exact message in my talk page: <i>accusing other users of being 'liars' and calling anything you don't agree with 'vandalism' is uncivil</i> obviously because i said in the talk page that moshe have lied about they coming to an agreement. Shanee constantly sent warnings even after i did not touch one page, and i kept answering her that i will not respond to her threaths and injustice and that she can go ahead and block me, then i will report her for abusing her powers. Here is what she said later in my talk page: <b>You can report me to whomever you like.</b> Again i did not even touch one page at that point, the only thing i did was keep sending her the very warning messages she sent me, that i will report her for abuse of power and taking sides. She sent me a so called final warning, after i replied she blocked me and sent this message: <i>Regarding this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nelson_Frye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51416095edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nelson_Frye&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51416095edit" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> and others: You have been temporarily blocked from editing for disrupting Wikipedia by making personal attacks.

<p>I must admit that I have found this whole situation quite confusing. The very first article where I ran into him was the Richard Nelson Frye article where he immediately began hurling insults at me. I tend to try to be civil, and although I sometimes lose my temper I must say that my patience here has been exemplary. I didn't even report his obsessive behavior until well after it began, and when he stated that he was going to report me for "vandalism" I even instructed him how (admitedly I only did so because I assumed it would not be taken seriously).- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 21:14, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From what I've seen, none of these accounts seems to have been used by anyone <i>but</i> Amorrow. I don't know whether than means a range block is safe; it's a pretty big range.

<dd>Yeah, but he's only used less than a dozen of the IPs out of the 71.139.x.x and 71.141.x.x ranges. Unless you want to check the other tens of thousands of IPs manually, we'll need someone with CheckUser.

<p>Amorrow's editing this page right now, please rv on sight.

<p><br />
If range blocking, use care not to specify the ranges overbroadly. According to ARIN, the ranges are</p>
<ul>
<li>71.139.160.0/19</li>
<li>71.139.192.0/20</li>
<li>71.141.0.0/19</li>
<li>71.141.32.0/19 (according to ARIN, though not yet used?)</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be used, rather than overbroad /16 ranges implied by 71.139.*.* and 71.141.*.*</p>

<dd>I've never been able to figure out or find a satisfactory explanation of what that notation means - what range of IP addresses is specified by "71.139.160.0/20"?

<dd>It's more or less explained in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Range_blocks" class="extiw" title="m:Range_blocks">m:Range blocks</a>. But the main thing is, when blocking you can enter IP ranges as well as merely IP addresses, so you can just enter <tt>71.139.160.0/19</tt> into the appropriate input field (and then redo it for <tt>71.139.192.0/19</tt> and <tt>71.141.0.0/19</tt> as applicable). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:17, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you both. I generally understood that it specified a range, and that I could block a whole range at a time, but as a mathematician, I just needed to know that the number on the other side of the slash was a power of 2, so 71.139.160.0/20 actually means 71.139.160.0 through 71.139.175.255... huh, should that /20 be a /19 or a /18, to cover all the IP addresses he's editing from? <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:49, May 7, 2006</dd>

<dd>Well, you already reverted. The account that made the edit has only made that one, and it was pretty harmless, so I've given the user a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} message. If he keeps making bizarre edits, then he can be blocked.</dd>
<dd>By the way, are you sure you want to put your email on your userpage? Anything you post on your userpage has very high visibility on the Internet, due to the number of Wikipedia mirrors, and it can easily be picked up by spambots. If the 'Email this user' button on the left is too obscure for you, I would recommend either putting a special link to it on your userpage (e.g. "<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Amit_jain_online_f974.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Amit jain online">Click here</a> to email me") or at least bowdlerising your address, e.g. "amit_jain_online at yahoo dot com". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:53, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree with the assessment of "pretty harmless".

<p>This anonIP 201.51.176.238 is adding links to a great many geographical articles. The link goes to a page saying that you must download and install a program to see a 3-D globe.

Please help. He needs a mentor and advice, not a permanent block. The media is watching this article in New York state, please don't abuse blocking policy.

<dd>I apollogise for not assuming good faith, Mr. Connolley.. I am concerned that your statement "on the off chance of good behaviour" may also show a lack of AGF too. Once this article is re-created, the edit warriers on both sides will come out fighting, and the New York media will be watching how we handle it.

<p>Hi everybody. I'd like to point you towards the <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki_talk%7ECommon.css_e2a2.html#Please_revert_.22resizing_of_footnotes_by_CSS.22" title="MediaWiki talk:Common.css">common.css talk page</a> in which a dispute is going on at the "<i>Please revert "resizing of footnotes by CSS"</i>" paragraph (the debate is also going on, less actively, at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html#Change_to_MediaWiki:Common.css_requested_for_references" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">the Village Pump (Technical)</a>).</p>
<p>To summarize what happened: a request was made to make an addition to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">common.css</a> file that brings the font size of all references down to 90%. When the change was made, only two people were in favor of it, and they were the only ones who had commented. The admin made the change very early before waiting for dissenters to show up in order to find out if there were any at all (to quote the admin who made the change, <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R. Koot">R._Koot</a>: "The best way to see wath the opinion of the community is would be to change it and see what the reactions are." - quoted from <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki_talk%7ECommon.css_e2a2.html#Please_revert_.22resizing_of_footnotes_by_CSS.22" title="MediaWiki talk:Common.css">the common.css talk page</a>).</p>
<p>Right after the change was made, a lot of people indeed did show up to dispute the change. There are now two large discussions going on about it. A lot of people disagree with the change and feel that the consensus-seeking community has been avoided in the making of this decision. While it's true that it's not uncommon for admins to be bold in making changes, I feel that since now it's been established that there is no consensus on this change, it should be reverted. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive&amp;oldid=50504855#proposed_change_to_css_.28.references.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive&amp;oldid=50504855#proposed_change_to_css_.28.references.29" rel="nofollow">previous discussion</a> on the matter also ended in no consensus.</p>
<p>I feel as though this dispute has gone on for long enough now, and that it's been established that this is not what the community wants (regardless of the actual reasons provided by either party). I hope that an admin will have time to look into this matter soon. —<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a>, 10:24, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This needs to be reverted. I wondered why some page's references were suddenly very small. Now I know why. The css change is combining with the habit of some editors to use div tags to reduce the font sizes on a per-article basis and the lovely "synergy" results in unreadable references. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></font></a> 19:59, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed on both counts. The website actually states its purpose: to take advantage of Bond films' popularity and act as a repository for those involved who wish to market "genuine handsigned [sic] merchandise".

<p>I am, admittedly, having a content dispute with <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianbeck_d209.html" title="User:Brianbeck">User:Brianbeck</a> on this article. As it stands, it makes a gross generalization which tries to claim that all people who hoard animals have the same motivations, the same methods, and the same results. I've added the pov tag to it, and asked on the Talk page that it be rewritten to make it less an attack and more of a descriptive. But Brianbeck keeps removing the pov tag and refuses to make any changes. I don't really know <i>how</i> to change the article without completely deleting a lot of what's there, but repeated removal of the pov tag without any consideraton is, in my opinion, vandalism, but since I'm involved in the dispute, I won't be blocking Brianbeck.

<dd>Just a notice about this - The admin has clearly blatantly violated the policies, as there was no concensus at all (in fact majority of vote was keep). Since he mentions the comment "dont be so sure" as refering to possible recreation of the article, that is clearly not what that comment meant. It meant that the complaint will go about his ABUSE of adminship, rather than about the article itself - I am much more concerned about the blatant and shameless violation of AfD process than about the article itself. So, Samuel Blanning's abuse will be reported on the apropriate place, and the relevant community, that have interest in this, will have opportunity to comment. Why there is AfD process at all if people, who possibly have grudge against editors of certain nationality and/or POV, can abuse it in such blatant ways. User Dzoni might care about the article (as do many other users, to a lesser extent), but the people who care about abuse are much more numerous. It will not pass just like that. Article is not the main issue, but the abusive, arogant behavior agains all wikipedia policies of the (self-proclaimed) rogue admin S. Blanning is not to be tolerated. His hasty decision will certainly have to be justified against the weight of those who he has been abusing. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 01:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>AfD is not simply a vote count. It is a discussion of the pros and cons of the article. If an article doesn't assert the notability of in this case a song, and no proof of notability is provided during the AfD, it is within the admin's discretion to delete the article, even if the votes don't add up to a delete. In this particular AfD, I note two things: 1. No proof of notability of the song is provided during the AfD. The article contains one dead link and two geocities-level (i.e. not very reliable) websites. The only proof given during the AfD is proof by blatant assertion, and wikipedia needs more proof than just that. 2. Several users engaged in voter canvassing to skew the consensus, by targetting selected users hoping that they would vote a certain way. In view of this, closing the AfD as delete is well within the discretion of Samuel Blanning. Threatening to recreate to the article without going through Deletion Review also does not speak in favour of the users making the threat. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 08:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

The discussion that seems to have lead to this accusition is <a href="../../../h/i/g/Talk%7EHigh_Speed_Train_696b.html" title="Talk:High Speed Train">here</a>; the specific edit that Captain scarlet seems to be claiming was vandalism is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=High_Speed_Train&amp;diff=50338089&amp;oldid=50337532" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=High_Speed_Train&amp;diff=50338089&amp;oldid=50337532" rel="nofollow">this one</a>... unless I'm missing something here, it simply isn't, although given that that is the case <i>both</i> users appear to have violated the 3RR on that page in the ensuing dispute (several days ago, of course, past the statue of limitations.)

<p>In another AfD involving a bank scam, Executor-usa posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Consolidated_Credit_Bank_Limited&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52005037" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Consolidated_Credit_Bank_Limited&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52005037" rel="nofollow">this</a>, including the words <i>"Labelling an institution a fake bank and a scam is very defamatory and is unsupported by fact or truth."</i> I suggest he be reblocked for the word "defamatory" and the key thrown away. Normally it would be too vague for a block, but considering his previous block I think it would be justified. He is quite plainly not a positive contributor. I'd rather a different (not necessarily uninvolved) admin did the blocking for the sake of a second opinion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not a admin, but who here is? Saying that labelling a bank as a scam isn't supported by fact isn't a legal threat, and to the bank it -is- vert defamatory. I'm not familiar with the case, but it doesn't sound worth the trouble. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#4169E1">Av</font></a><a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU"><font color="#228B22">ill</font></a><a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><font color="#FF00FF">ia</font></a> 14:33, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The threat is baseless and the statements are not defamatory because these were comments in an AfD debate rather than main article content. I have no opinion on whether he should be blocked/banned for making these comments in Afd. Certainly if Executor makes similar comments about well-cited material in main article space he should be banned per NLT policy. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not what admins do. We'll delete old versions if they contain damaging personal information, but that edit does not. Personal attacks should be removed from the current version (current version, not history. But you don't have to be an admin to do that), but it's not even clear to me that the edit is a personal attack. Perhaps you should either rebut the user, or simply ignore. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 18:10, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to challenge the decision to delete Conservative Underground from wikipedia.</p>
<p>The members of CU were unaware that this discussion was taking place.</p>
<p>Our listing was nominated by BenBurch, who ironically used criteria that his own site (White Rose Society) does not even meet, yet his site was not deleted when nominated for deletion. His nomination was bolstered by an organized band of his malcontent buddies from Democratic Underground, because they are upset that we monitor and comment on their activities.</p>
<p>A number of notable events have occurred at Conservative underground, such as an exclusive interview with Jeff Gannon, former member of the White House press corps.</p>
<p>My own recent work on CU was picked up and linked on a tremendous number of conservative sites, which was my outing of supposed "Ashamed Republican" Jeb Eddy, who gets his picture on the AP wire at every northern California anti-war protest by holding up a sign stating "I'm Republican and Ashamed". I discovered that he has been a Democratic donor for many years, and heads a progressive foundation. The disemination of this information throughout the conservative blogosphere resulted in the SF Chronicle pulling a photo of Eddy from their online edition.</p>
<p>CU has recently also been falsely accused of issuing threats by DUer Ava on the Alan Colmes radio show.</p>
<p>I think these things are quite notable, and considering that we at CU were unaware of the attempts to get us deleted, Conservative Underground deserves to be undeleted.</p>
<p>Wikipedia was manipulated in this case.</p>
