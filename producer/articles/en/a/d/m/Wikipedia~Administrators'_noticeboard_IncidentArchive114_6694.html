<p>Somebody has a name that nobody has ever previously objected to. They are notified that their user name must be changed. Before the warning period even expires that person is banned permanently. It is obvious from the above, that ElC personally disliked the name and banned as soon as possible based on ElC's personal dislike of the name (*This is an utterly unacceptable username. It <u>must</u> be changed). Is that actually in the Wikipedia rules, because it appears that ElC is abusing them based on ElC's own personal likes and dislikes rather than properly implemeted procedure. It also appears to be in breach of the requirement to give proper notice of banning and the reasons. Is it right some Administrators exceed regulations based on their own personal bias.</p>
<p>Much of this discussion is based on what JFW has written. He himself was criticised by an Administrator for the excesses and inconsistencies of his actions. So why have decisions taken notice of what he has written when he himself was shown to be at fault&#160;? Why also is he allowed to get away with personal attacks ("a well-known troll from Braintalk"), especially when discussions elsewhere of this personal attack showed that the personal attack had no factual basis&#160;?</p>
<p>Are Administrators allowed to abuse or disregard the regulations as ElC and JFW have done&#160;? --Jonee G. Ralto 21:48, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nonsense. A quick scan of <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> shows several rules which would forbid the use of username "General Tojo".

<p>ElC has just proven his intolerance and inability to rebut his abuse of power. If he can't answer somebody he tries to shut them up. He has also just proven that he is a liar. Nowhere during the discussions was General Tojo racist as he has deceitfully claimed in order to try to justify his misconduct. This can be fully verified in the correspondence. So the excuses for his misconduct do not stand up to scrutiny. Also, General Tojo, who I know very very well, is actually a member of an anti racist organistation, thereby making a mockery of what constitutes libel. Is libel allowed on Wikipedia&#160;? Arrogance is such a vague term - deliberately vague on his part so that it cannot be properly assessed. He himself has shown that he is remarkably arrogant. He was completely unable to rebut any of the criticisms of his abuses of power and instead rushed to a permanent banning. Do what he says - he won't and can't explain himself - or he'll ban you even if his actions are in breach of Wikipedia guidelines.

<p><b>El_C has here blatantly lied by claiming that he banned a member for racism (a member, who incidentally is a member of an anti-racist organisation). He has been completely unable to rebut that fact. He instead dispensed with all of Wikipedia's guidelines and procedures by banning a member solely because of his personal interests. He now admits above that it was because the name annoyed him. This is because El_C is a lecturer in Japanese history, and it was a Japanese military name that he objected to. Somebody who abuses Wikipedia, blatantly lies about his reasons in order to cover them up, and bases his own actions solely on his own needs and prejudices is not fit to be an administrator. As can be seen above, when faced with criticism he tries to deflect the criticism by arrogantly criticisng the critic.

<p><b>El_C must have something seriously wrong with him. The name General Tojo was only on the editing page of one Wikipedia page. Yet to him the mere mention of the name is intolerable even though in such an obscure place. However, General Tojo gets an entire article on Wikipedia yet he says nothing. Such illogic shows how emotionally iunadequate and irrational he is. Ironically I have added more as General Tojo since then making a complete mockery of his banning. he is so powerless. Jfdwollf, you're a pathetic keyboard coward. Insults and criticism when you think you are behind the protection of the Internet. Yet in the real world you wouldn't dare say the same things. A pathetic coward of the worst kind. I am far bigger than you intellectually, emotionally and physically. I now know where you are.

<p>Has been doing a lot of disrupting of Wikipedia lately to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. On <a href="../../../a/s/p/Talk%7EAsperger_syndrome_c0a4.html" title="Talk:Asperger syndrome">Talk:Asperger syndrome</a>, bottom of the page, he admitted to forking arguments he personally disagrees with and "hiding" them in obscure locations to make his point that Asperger syndrome is not a medical condition, that it can be self-diagnosed by a layperson, and that it is a blessing. On deletion review under my proposal for undeleting Gilles Tréhin, he has made a snide remark about User:JzG's reasonable actions to prevent Rdos from spamming Wikipedia with his "Aspie-quiz" website link instead of addressing whether Trehin should be undeleted or not. On my talk page, he made another snide remark about me and JzG being "pals" when he shouldn't be communicating with me at all after I gravely insulted him and was blocked for three days for it. He has been clogging this notice board, the Asperger syndrome talk page, his talk page, JzG's talk page, and any other forum he can find with his protestations that he should be allowed to make his point that people with Asperger's are part Neanderthal. I realize that <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is only a guideline, not a policy, but Rdos has been doing a lot of disrupting to try to make people listen to his ideas. He has disrupted deletion review further by trying to get his "Neanderthal theory of autism" undeleted when it has been posted and deleted many, many times, which is a disruption in itself. I don't know what to do about him, and I can't go off on him again, so I'm leaving a message here so I don't get angry and say something inappropriate. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>I think you got this wrong, Brian. I suggest you provide some diffs to prove your point. I've not talked much, if anything, about the Neanderthal theory at Wikipedia before I saw its deletion and was demanded to remove it from my user page. This is clearly when these discussions arised. As for moving content out of the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspergers_syndrome.html" title="Aspergers syndrome">Aspergers syndrome</a> article, this was done by consensus and the need to reduce size of the article. You are trying to make the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspergers_syndrome.html" title="Aspergers syndrome">Aspergers syndrome</a> article a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> article again. Not everybody shares your view that autism is a disorder or disease, and Wikipedia should be neutral. As for the reincarnations, I'm not responsible for any of them.

<dd>Ah, but read that first paragraph in full, where it notes how sentences are rewritten to avoid what is clearly controversial in treatment of "the people constituting the team, rather than with the team as an entity." "Walt Disney Pictures presents" is perhaps the preeminent example of the treatment of a singular entity with a "plural" name.

<p>Well, RadioKirk definitely gets an <b>A</b> for grammar, he knows his stuff. I too have gotten involved in this silly dispute (and quickly got <i>un</i>involved). It's amazing how few people actually learn grammar anymore. Then you have these ridiculous arguments of people arguing that something that "sounds right" should be used, even though it sounds wrong to people who actually know what sounds right. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 14:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am reporting a flagrant misuse of admin powers by <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husnock.html" title="Husnock">Husnock</a>. Firstly, I have replaced a terrible mess he has written in <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Slovakia_40f2.html" title="Tourism in Slovakia">Tourism in Slovakia</a> by a normal long text (I was forced to do that, although I certainly have more important things to do), secondly I have removed completely irrelevant information about a movie Husnock obviously likes and Husnock's FACTUALLY WRONG and ridiculous introduction text (tourism is not defined like promotion). As a compromise, I have left a link to the article on the movie in the See also section, but even this was – rightly – removed by another user – HywkerTyphoon. I have told Husnock repeatedly that his text is wrong and this information is irrelevant. Husnock's reaction to all this that I have allegedly violated the "4 reverts rule", although in fact it his him, who has violated it – he just keeps reintroducing his original text how ever stupid it might be and how ever the article changes. As a result: I request that <b>I be immediately unblocked</b> and that user Husnock be immediately blocked for the "reasons" he gave for blocking my account. Finally, I do not understand how a user like Husnock, who is unable to write normal content and is able to write what he originally wrote Tourism in Slovakia article, can be an administrator, and if I had the power to do that I would deprive him of admin powers, because admin must exhibit at least an elementary level of intelligence and non-personal attitude. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">User:Juro</a></p>

In the interest of full disclosure, I have been involved in editing articles he's worked on, largely in regard to trying to explain/enforcec <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, whic he habitually ignores. In the past he has been blocked for a week for abusive sockpuppetry, and further back he made threats to take action against a user in real life. (Because the user in question was me, I elected to explain the rule in this regard and not to take further action at the time; however, he continues to allude to legal action in an effort to intimidate other users.) For more detail, read my warning.</p>
<p>Although the particular offense he just committed is not deserving of an indefinite block, on the heels of the warning I gave him it indicates to me that the user has no interest in following Wikipedia's rules and policies, either regarding basic civility or regarding our core rules like NPOV and NOR. He has been warned and reminded of these things an extraordinary number of times, with no result, so I no longer believe he has any potential to be an asset to the project.</p>
<p>If anyone has concerns about this blocking or is tempted to reduce it, I urge you to review the case in more detail. I am happy to provide more diffs and to discuss at length if requested. However, as his recent edit all by itself (his second block for personal attacks in the last few days) merits an extentended block anyway, I do request that time be allowed for discussion <i>before</i> the block is reduced. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 10:48, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say that the NOR issue is disputable, it seems to be in part a lack of providing references in time (and he excused himself of being temporarily unable to do so). However, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> are sufficient for an extended block IMHO. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 12:07, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If Krause's work is verifiable and notable, regardless of its possible fringe position, WP would want it properly described, with appropriate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">due weighting</a> alongside other views. It seems that KraMuc is eager to present this theory, but needs to learn a collaborative and civil WP style to do so.

<dd>Your points are both good. However, I think I gave him many extra chances to learn NPOV and NOR (and would never block for those alone anyway), and many extra chances on CIV and NPA as well. In the end, I gave him a "one strike and you're out" ultimatum on the civility, and he responded by making a scathing and deliberate personal attack on another user. I believed for a long time he might become a good contributor once he learned the rules, but at this point he's had every opportunity. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 15:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This appears to be the minority view, but I don't see anything wrong with what she was doing. It's not like she was spamming one link over and over; she was adding a different link to each article, and the links in question seem relevant to the article content. User:Erck made similar edits to a bunch of articles last week, and I only noticed because the link he added to <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Benson_d69a.html" title="Amber Benson">Amber Benson</a> was potentially helpful in resolving a content dispute.

<dd>All this proves is that it is an ongoing spam attack. I've removed all of the links added by the above user.

<dd>I think that'd be a bit sharp, since we aren't sure that it's being done at the behest of the site, and up until now nobody's actually told the involved party to stop. Particularly in light of the fact that this isn't overtly commercial spam, like a guy selling penis pills, I think a less confrontational approach would be better. Give them a warning, maybe copy it to the SG site admin via e-mail, and if the behavior persists then add them to the blacklist. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the appropriate forum to raise this issue, however I am having a recurring problem with User:Netwriter. I have a long history of being harassed by this user in various internet venues, and he is currently posting my name (and those of several others) on his user page. I have removed mine and one other three times now, and have posted requests that he not put our names on his page. He continually reposts them and removes our requests from his talk page. He is also accusing us of vandalising his entries and conducting a vendetta against him, which is odd since the edit history proves we have done no such thing. I have made a concerted effort to avoid this guy, but I refuse to let him use my name without my permission. Could someone please look into this. Mine is not the only name he has been told to remove and has reposted.

<p>OrphanBot orphans images that have been tagged as having no source or no license information for five days, because these images will be deleted after seven days. If OrphanBot is orphaning your images, it means you need to add a source for the image and correct license information to the image's page, so that Wikipedia can continue to use your images. In doing this, OrphanBot is providing a useful service, and I'll bet if you <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html" title="User talk:Carnildo">ask Carnildo nicely</a>, he can help you out with any problems you're having with it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 11:51, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You guys are incredible. You say: "stop being an anon, get an account", and when I get an account, you say "transparent sockpuppet". And if people are harassing IronDuke, I can see why, since he seems to call everyone who disagrees with him a sockpuppet or something. What a bunch of head-up-orifice echo-chamber bozos. -- 217.22.230.193 17:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC) (P.S.

I just checked <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a>'s contributions, and it certainly seems that anyone who disagrees with him indeed gets labeled a "wikistalker" or a "sock", including <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomicene_da7b.html" title="User:Anomicene">User:Anomicene</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlindVenetian_775e.html" title="User:BlindVenetian">User:BlindVenetian</a>, User:Nyanyoka, and others.

<p>Let me just add this: I know nothing of IronDuke's history, and don't really care. I have tried to do what I think I've been told: get an account, edit within the rules, etc, and I think I have been treated unfairly. I have been told by CommanderKean that there is no appeals process except to him, and now SlimVirgin swoops in out of (apparently) nowhere, with no history with me, and bans me from Wikipedia. I am NOT out to create a problem on Wikipedia, or with IronDuke as an individual. I just have an issue with this cadre of admins protecting one user, and who isn't satisfied with my voluntary banning from articles, and insists on personal attacks. Perhaps this is the venue to ask: what <i>is</i> the appeals process for this treatment??

<dd>This happened to show right at the top of my watchlist and piqued my curiosity, if only because I have recently realized the importance of editing by anons in the light of what might be termed Wikipedia's philosophy. I've briefly reviewed the situation and think there is only one user involved. The pattern looks suspicious but the explanation is plausible. I have not looked into this user's actual edits and can imagine there may be other problems but socket puppetry does not seem to compute. The subsequent block evasion looks like a genuine mistake. I suppose this all looks rather Kafkaesque to this user. I suggest that the BlindVenetian account be unblocked (or that the user sits out a 24-hour block to think this over). The user has already been asked to stay away from the "problem area" for a while. When reinstated, hopefully s/he will get some more experience editing Wikipedia, read up on policy, and generally stay out of trouble from now on. If not, regular procedure will suffice. We can't do much about changing IP numbers but this user who could so easily have become a REAL sock puppet insists on being treated as one person (the exact opposite of sock puppetry) so I believe this would be the end of it. Or am I being naive? <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 23:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that it is felt that the word <i>Roman</i> is meant to diminish the sense of catholicity of the church (the universality of its jurisdiction). Many documents of the Roman Catholic Church do refer to it simply as <i>the Catholic Church</i>. However, there are plenty of occassions where Catholics do add the word <i>Roman</i>. This is especially so in ecumenical contexts. Of course, there are other churches that use <i>Catholic</i> as part of their official title, and many churches that describe themselves as being <i>catholic</i> though without using the word as part of their official titles. The Roman Catholic Church has given us a long history of disambiguation — it is the Catholic Church in union with the see of Rome. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 10:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I opened an AFD for the <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> article which is hopelessly POV biased. The talk page dialogues reflect a deadlock with all sides totally devout to their POV.

After roughly 1 hour of opening the AFD, <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a> closed the AFD while votes were coming in. His statement on the top of the page suggests his own judgement that the 'article was not completely POV' was his reason for stopping the process. I would like the process to be opened again, and for appropriate communications to be made to the admin who, in my view, is abusing his powers to push ongoings on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:39, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If an article is POV, it doesn't need to be deleted, just edited to make it neutral. The article seems to be on an important subject, and notability is the primary criterion on which inclusion in Wikipedia is based. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Lefty_bcf9.html" title="User:Mr. Lefty"><b>Mr. L</b><span style="color:green"><b>e</b></span><b>fty</b></a> <sub><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr._Lefty_44c9.html" title="User talk:Mr. Lefty"><i>Talk to me!</i></a></sub> 17:42, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The phrase 'article is POV' is itself suggestive of a failure to understand what POV is (see WP:POV). If a violation (and this is the most blatant violation I've seen) of NPOV were never to be justifications for an AFD, <a href="../../../a/d/f/WP%7EADF_31d1.html" title="WP:ADF">WP:ADF</a> wouldn't mention NPOV as the first of the standards articles must abide by. Obviously a user is obligated to go through other avenues before filing an AFD. I've tried correcting the Dhimmi article, even bending backward and allowing the flagrant vioation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a> to go on, albeit with opinions being described as opinions and misleadingly portrayed as undisputed fact (see Talk:Dhimmi). It is clear that there is no possibility of <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> reflecting a NPOV. I've fulfilled my obligation in taking other avenues, and used the last option that's justified under <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lefty, an additional point: if the article deserves to stay in its present condition ( I think it shouldn't), the AFD process is what should be used to make that judgement. For the process to be ended in 1 hour and 10 minutes because an admin has a strong view on the 'POV' isn't a fair move. If a solid arguement for not having the AFD at all could be made, it should have been voiced by <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a> before killing the vote. The reasons he's given so far aren't cogent ones for the action he'd taken.He voiced his own view of things without giving a credible basis for his view, acting like a judge who has no regard for the jury.

<dd>As a general rule, AFDs last for 5 days unless I'm mistaken. This AFD lasted for 1 hour and 7 mins due to Crzrussian's interruption. His reason for stopping it seemed to be his own judgement on the matter. He followed up with the following note on my talk page: <i>I'd like to ask you to AfD Judaism because everything within is written from a Jewish POV. Ridiculous. - CrazyRussian talk/email 17:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</i>. Meaningless rhetoric like that is difficult to even respond to at first. However, it seems the point he's trying to make is that a POV-bias is to be expected in articles, and that my demand for a <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> article that reflects a NPOV is 'ridiculous'. I would question his credibility as an editor with comments such as those, and more so as an editor with such sweeping powers. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 18:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Explain the "I'd like to ask you to AfD Judaism because everything within is written from a Jewish POV" comment.The votes that came in the first 50 or so minutes were made because of the notability of the topic. "Dhimmi" is a popular word these days. However, notability is not the ONLY criteria that determines whether an article should exist. The AFD should have gone on longer.

Even as I think this one fine, though, I wonder whether permitting an AfD to run for a few days in situations where it is obvious that the article will be kept is disruptive or <i>counterproductive to our encyclopedic goals</i>. An AfD such as this might generate much less-than-helpful discussion and consume the time of users who might be otherwise inclined to more encyclopedic purposes, but so too might it bear out the idea that deletion is not the proper means (in general) by which to remedy article bias, in order that <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">User:His excellency</a> and others might appreciate that they ought to collaborate with other editors on the article's talk page to produce an NPOV article.

<dd>If indeed the discussion was sure to degenerate as you observe, then the harms of keeping the AfD open would outweigh the benefits, such that closure is appropriate. I intended only to express a view similar to that of Netscott, namely that, where there is no harm to come from running an AfD for a good period of time, the AfD should run, if only because some good often comes. I trust Crz's judgment enough to know that if he says the AfD was going to degenerate, it likely was; my notes was, I suppose, more to the meta-question of <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOWBALL_47ec.html" title="WP:SNOWBALL">snowballing</a> AfDs after just a few hours. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:26, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you look at <a href="../../../d/h/i/Talk%7EDhimmi_0098.html" title="Talk:Dhimmi">Talk:Dhimmi</a>, speficically the section "This article has no regard for NPOV", Merzbow offered a maliciously deceptive analysis of my contribution to the article. I responded with a correction of his analysis, and pointed out how his work on the article has been in bad faith. WP:AGF does not require one to assume good faith when there's overwhelmingly reliable evidence to suggest an editor works in bad faith. I have made solid observations on Merzbow's work, as I have of Timothy Usher's works and Pecher. Their work is effectively POV-driven vandalism that is aimed at turning Wikipedia Islam-related articles into indictments against Muslims and Islamic history. If you're bothering to read this, please take the time to look at <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> and its talk page. I've noted on the talk page that out of 114 cited sources, 40 of them are from Bat Ye'or, an author who has been labeled as a polemic and an Islamophobe by many and has been critisized repeatedly for her lack of education in the subject she often talks about. Other sources include Stillman, Bernard Lewis, etc. Virtually all the sources represent a single rigid and critical POV, with no significant representation of any view that does'nt host a condemning tone. The flooding of Islam-related articles with less-than-credible and POV-driven (I'd say hate driven) content is a problem in all the Islam-related articles.</p>
<p>On the AFD, I question the intelligence of anyone who thinks the votes that flooded in within the first 1 hour and 10 minutes can be assumed as representative of what the product would have been in 5 days. Many of those who voted did so instantaneously, without actually looking at the articles or the WP policies that were the basis of the complaint. It's entirely plausible that other voters chose to take the time to research the reasons for what I proposed. It's plausible that they didn't expect the procedure would have been shut down in 1 hour and 10 minutes. The AFD was entirely justified, even if the result wouldn't have been to delete the article. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 16:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The issue is evident on my talk page. Another user called an AFD I filed 'ridiculous', and sarcastically suggested I should file an AFD against the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">judaism</a> article because it exibits a pro-Judaism POV. In response, I called his rhetoric 'ridiculous'. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> then placed a 'final warning' for this 'personal attack'. I've posted responses in his talk page which he has not responded to. Though the 'personal attack' I made was preceded by the usage of the <i>same</i> word against me, the other user was not served with a warning, or so much as a comment. I pointed all this out to him, he merely responded saying the warning stays, and that further 'incivility' will result in a block. He did not do the fair thing and offer a comment directed to the other user on his same offense. If you ask me, I think this is harassment. I request that the threat be removed, and that Inshaneee distance himself from this harassment. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 19:14, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lol. Entertaining entry in my honor there, Tom. I'll discuss that later. This particular issue involves a comment that couldn't have been understood as a personal attack under any circumstance. The justification for the warning was a single comment directed at some other guy's telling me to file an AFD on Judaism. Funny how he saw a personal attack in my usage of the word, but not when used by the person who first used it. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 20:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>Either way, filing an AFD on Judaism is pretty much trolling.

<dd>Some we do, and some we don't. Generally, a player doesn't get an article just for being a minor-league ballplayer, but there are a lot of minor-league players who qualify under other grounds: notable amateur achievements, membership on a national team/international competion, presence on a major-league 40-man roster, etc. There's currently some discussion of this on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)</a>, which suggests extending it to a few other categories (players in the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Star_Futures_Game_2ab4.html" title="All-Star Futures Game">All-Star Futures Game</a>, minor-league <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Star_b7cd.html" title="All-Star">All-Stars</a>, etc.), and if you have an opinion on the matter we could use some more feedback. As things currently stand, a lot of these player stubs seem to be the sort that'd be deleted with the current precedents in mind. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 21:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Being on a minor league team simply <i>can't</i> be sufficient for a biography. First, the athlete's career isn't established yet. Second, the numbers are staggering. Third, the athlete doesn't rise to fame/notability beyond the very local area or the very devoted interest group of scouts. I'd want to know that the <i>other</i> notability is pretty danged huge. Otherwise, the person would just be a name on a "List of players in the all star minor league game" or something like that.

<p><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">User:Lysy</a> started a move request at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Kreva_a297.html" title="Act of Kreva">Act of Kreva</a> on 26 June, and just before submitting it, he moved the page to the location <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Krewo_af13.html" title="Union of Krewo">Union of Krewo</a> where he, concluded from his vote, supports it to be. This no doubt was because he wanted to put the burden for getting a clear majority to burden his opponents, and not his own camp. This is why we generally frown upon and regard bad form, if a requester of move makes a move to his location just before the request. However, now the situation has escalated: some other users moved the page back where it was before Lysy's combined "move and request" antics. And Lysy has now at least three (Four?) times countered it. His last move was just a bit over 24 hours had passed from the previous. So his conduct seems to be circumventing barely the restrictions upon 3RR. We call it gaming the system. Situation seems to be that two or three others counter his moves, and on his side, he acts alone. Clear move war, and clear case where Lysy dos not want to respect a majority, but regards himself alone having the right to act. Of course he may be able to fill pages and pages with explanations why he is materially right and how everyone other is wrong and that all previous doings are in his opinion of course procedurally wrong. But that all should not matter much, in face of clear move warring when his own move request is ongoing. Lysy had been requested not to move the page to the location he votes for. So, warnings were sufficiently given, I think. Requests and warnings do not hnder his disruptive warring. I hope you mandate a longer block upon Lysy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarrtel_9c5d.html" title="User:Marrtel">Marrtel</a> 23:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nah, it shouldn't just be a 24 hour block. The penalty for violating an ArbCom injunction is "stay blocked until an ArbCom member deals with it", not "stay blocked, but just for 24 hours".

<dd>It's somewhat long term addition of nonsense. I'm not sure it's vandalism, per se, but it's repeatedly adding unsupported private usage. (Misogynists do not turn into houseflies.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at the page now, and <i>no wonder</i> the user keeps inserting it: the article is a <b>wiki-mess!</b> People are just adding every "maggot-" to it. Our dab pages tend to be undisciplined, but this one's just a dump. We really ought to disambiguate things known only as "maggot." Everything else is "me too." Further, the page hasn't a single reason for anything lexical, and yet a lot of lexical stuff is on there. Blug. Someone needs to come down like Thor from the mountain, kick out most of the stuff (not just the misogyny ref), put some hierarchy on the disambiguations, and then, on the talk page, explain to people what should and should not be disambiguated. Aren't there dab-warriors out there? (I ask honestly. There were some people who were attacking dabs rigorously and trying to make them have some sense.) I hope one sees this need and steps in. I just tried to organize <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inspiration.html" title="Inspiration">Inspiration</a> so that it moves logically from concept to specific item to artwork. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I am putting the list I found above. I would appreciate not speaking to him at all. He has been harrassing me about his articles over a few days now. I am too new to know if this should be handled at a higher level, or what level that would be. What I find detestable about what he is doing in articles of deleteion is: "How can anyone trust the words written on the page of those dicsussions now??" Ste4k 12:49, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He has made comments that are gender related, but that is probably because he believes I am male. I don't believe that he is doing anything more than taking an impersonal matter personally himself, getting excited about it, etc., and misbehaving as a result. That's just my guess. He believes that I am acting in bad faith, I think he actually believes that. Ste4k 12:52, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure about your commentary here but if you yourself have been systematically targetting <i>his</i> articles (I'm guessing articles he created?) for deletion then your own behavior may fall under <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a>. This of course wouldn't be the case if you were to have found an article created by him/her that was nonsense and from following their contributions history found other corresponding nonsense articles that merited deletion.

<dd>I have been looking closely at the entire category. It appears to be recursively linked and resting on very weak sources. There is a difference between a category and personal attack.

<p>I'll try my best to summarize. I am a registered user since mid-April. I have worked exclusively on Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) and the related article <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a>. The former article was recently deleted because of lack of evidence to support this musicians claim to fame "Na Na Hey Hey". (In fact, newspaper articles and books indicate that the lead singer was another musician.) During discussion and mediation, the editor(s) who supported the Greg Bravo article ended up being blocked for vandalism.</p>
<p>Other editors have popped up to change the related <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a> article. I had revised this article to clarify who the lead singer was (I did this in response to the Bravo hoax). I added the newspaper and book sources. I am now being harrassed by an unregistered user on my talk page. There are veiled threats of legal action because he claims that I am cyberstalking. Another statement was that I would be easy to find. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">Fortheloveofhampsters</a> 14:20, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, unless you have given out personal information like your real name, address, etc, you are definitely not "easy to find." Unfortunately, threats coming from AOL accounts are hard to deal with because AOL IP addresses can not be blocked for any significant length of time. I'm afraid you'll just have to ignore it. If <i>registered</i> users make threats, or act in a way that ties them to inappropriate activity by anons or previously blocked users, you can report it here and they can be blocked if needed. It's hard to do anything helpful with AOL anons. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:03, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

While he supposedly was a new user his behaviour strongly leads me to suspect that he is a returned blocked or banned user on a serious vandalism spree. Specially he redirected <i>every</i> page he touched to a totally unconnected topic (an article on a British constitutional topic was directed to some town's article, for example!). Newbies don't start editing on WP by doing mass redirects. Usually they don't know how initially to redirect anything. The user seems to me to be someone with plenty of experience and to be deliberately trying to do serious damage, with a number of articles being wiped out and replaced by circular directs, so that they simply would redirect to each other <i>ad infinitum</i>. The fact that he had experience, knew what he was doing, and was deliberately making nonsense redirects, led me to think that this was no first time user, or first time user just messing, but a deliberate serious attack on WP by someone with a vendetta, as so probably someone blocked or banned, hence the block. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I blocked this user for a week for several reasons. First of all, he was just coming off of a 4 day block. Secondly, he went right back to attacking others users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61051377" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61051377" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61057865" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61057865" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We also have him putting <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> up for deletion. It's an article that has been up for over 2 years now. Asking that an article be deleted to resolve a dispute is completely against policy and disruptive. And these are just the first few posts that I ran into when I looked through his contribs. He has an attacking style that I don't think we should tolerate here. And he has alot to learn in terms of civility. His email to me requesting an unblock talked about how he wasn't attacking others. The subject line? "Unblock me, you moron". --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 04:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

In the same diff, more personal attacks: "That Islamic articles would be flooded by people like yourself who fill articles with polemic rants masquerading as fact" which is directed to me; he even attacks Aminz: "Even Aminz is more concerned with not disappointing his Western friends." It doesn't appear as if there is anyone left in Wikipedia who he has not attacked.

<dd><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">User:His excellency</a>'s frequent lack of civility is problematic. His pointed commentary regarding User:Pecher, User:Timothy Usher et al is also very problematic as it sets up a battleground on Wikipedia which no doubt is disruptive (one can be sure that if I were in their positions I'd likely be making efforts to see his full departure). In my view his recent tendency to discourage Muslim editors from contributing to Wikipedia is additionally problematic (the way I see it when a person repeatedly does this it becomes rather trollish). I think it is wrong to think that his recent AfD for <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> was done in bad faith. As I mentioned in the above <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#CrazyRussian_Summarily_Closes_Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FDhimmi" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">discussion</a> I have seen much good come from the AfD process in terms of article improvement. If there was such thing as a AfRC (Article for Re-Creation - essentially starting over from scratch on an article) I'm sure he would have gone that route as such was his goal... but there isn't something like AfRC so he went the AfD route. As I mentioned on Woohookitty's talk page I honestly believe that <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">User:His excellency</a> was acting in good faith in following <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">User:Aminz</a> lead in helping to improve the <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> article of late and that I thought it was a pity that he was blocked in this regard. At this point this discussion may not matter as he may have already decided to just leave the project but if he expresses a desire, based upon what's happening on the <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> article I think he should be given one last chance and have his block reduced back to 1 week. Given his "moron" comments I will understand if this suggestion isn't followed but under the circumstances I think such commentary isn't surprising being that he wasn't warned prior to this last block and he was not notified of his being discussed on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>. Additionally it is true that his commentary on my talk page was a bit excessive but in the light of my own last semi-censored commentary on his talk page I feel that his response was relatively civil.

My point here is that we have a user who was warned for no personal attacks, did it anyway, was blocked...came back...attacked people again...put an invalid afd vote...when it was pointed out to him that it was invalid, he misquoted a policy and then instead of responding back to Anon's note, he just attacked others again. It's very troll-like. It's disruptive. and we can't tolerate it here. I don't think he has any intention of following our policies. The users who tried warn him that his afd was incorrect were an admin (CrazyRussian) and a very good newer user (AnonEMouse), who both know what they are talking about. In other words, they didn't have an axe to grind. In fact, they were both trying to be helpful. And yet he ignored them just like he ignored the warnings and the blocks. He knew that what he was doing was against policy and yet he kept at it anyway. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 11:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> says, "A sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name". So if the other account was effectively abandoned and wasn't subsequently used to edit does it still qualify as a sockpuppet? With that line if a person ceases editing on a previous account then if they start a new one, where's the policy obliging that person to refer to their previous (and abandoned) account.

<dd>My main point isn't that he was using a sockpuppet. My point was that this isn't something that just started on the 14th. He's been blocked for various offenses going back several months. I think it's a moot point whether this new account is a "sockpuppet" or not. Honestly, I don't really care. I was pointing out that his history goes back much longer than his time as his excellency. I'm sorry I wasn't clearer. I also don't think that we should give someone credit or "points" for not using an account as a sockpuppet. Points for making good contributions? Sure. But for not using a sockpuppet when he could have?

<p>There is not consensus for this indefinite block. I for one disagree with it, and I appeal to the people who want to keep His Excellency indefinitely from contributing to the encyclopedia to at least do it right: unblock him and <b>request arbitration</b>, with a writeup of actual evidence. What I see at present is a week-long block on the basis of listing an article for AFD (a listing I can't for the life of me see as trolling) and two instances of speaking sharply/sarcastically to a guy who was yelling at him (the "victim" Netscott seems to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=61139941&amp;oldid=61139271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Woohookitty&amp;diff=61139941&amp;oldid=61139271" rel="nofollow">agreement</a> with this view).

<dd>"two instances of speaking sharply/sarcastically"? You can't be serious Bishonen. Just last night on his talk page (before his new block) he attacked three people in one edit. Did you see all the cites posted in PAIN <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;oldid=61151497#His_excellency_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;oldid=61151497#His_excellency_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>?

<dd>What about them? The Amibidhrohi account hasn't edited since June 7. The list Timothy Usher posted on WP:PAIN is pretty old, too. Blocks aren't supposed to be punitive, they're supposed to stop something ongoing, and be based on something recent. Woohookitty's block <i>was</i>—on an AfD listing and two particular edits—that's fine, but I suppose I may have an opinion about the substantiality of the basis. I'm perfectly serious. Woohookitty, I'm sorry you don't see the difference. I was not suggesting the same thing, as I don't think it would have been in the least discreditable for you to be influenced by TU's list and his (actually untrue) claim that it was recent. It's good to assume good faith. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I think I am having bad luck, because I already contacted two absent admin and left a message on a possibly wrong board? The user:Grandmaster has some sort of problem with me and insists on defaming me to other editors. He also leaves a angonictic message next to mine on talk pages or makes uncivil attacks. These are attacks are baseless and notting can validate uncivil behaviour and trolling!</p>
<p>These accusations have no sources and I even let them go out of good fiath originally, but they persist against me and now include <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">user:Baku87</a> As show here for example.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=61060716&amp;oldid=61060190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=61060716&amp;oldid=61060190" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>]. The user who made this also did not sign which put together with an anoymous comment is not a good sign.</p>
<p>I would like to know on what grounds <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">user:Baku87</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">user:Grandmaster</a> are making these claims and how they can justify outright attacks. I have never made any negative comments or contributions. I notice also that one of the users has been warned continously to be civil. They continue to make these claims without any proof.</p>
<p>Here are more examples; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASamuel_Blanning&amp;diff=60974869&amp;oldid=60974361" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASamuel_Blanning&amp;diff=60974869&amp;oldid=60974361" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> Once, again can this user please provide proof for these claims especially if he is going to continue to make them, especially the anti-Azari statments he keeps claiming I made??? I have already warned but he ocntinues.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">user:Grandmaster</a> is continuing to make unfounded accusations and attacks against me. As shown here again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=60972606&amp;oldid=60968242" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=60972606&amp;oldid=60968242" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. I left him a polite warning, but noticed that this has been a discourse of behaviour and that he has been warned for uncivil behaviour in the past. I told him once on his talk page to <b>be polite and keep all comments directed towards edits and that he has no right to make such accusations and additionally no grounds; I said I will let it pass as a warning and act in good faith and consider it an honest mistake on his part.</b> But after looking at his talk page and contributions I have noticed he is making accusations to other editors about me and is still continuing to do so as you can see above. Any comment I make on a talk page is labelled POV and attacked right away? It is automatically lablled anti-Azari! I have no idea how saying every human being is equal and that we are all brothers and sisters is bad or anti-Azari? These comments are groundless, uncivil and simple attacks.</p>
<p>Can an administrator please talk to him as an administrator. I do not appreciate this type of harassment. Like I have said and will continue to say again I am not here to fight, I am here to edit and to enjoy editing. Feel free to scutinize my contributions to Wikipedia and see if there is anything negative about them. I have expressed views that are commonplace amongst Iranian Azaris which I feel does not automatically categorize me as another user with the same views.</p>
<p><br />
User:Grandmaster continues to accused me of being anti-Azari when I myself am a Azari!? I do not know what makes him an authority to make such attacks or conclusions? He is basing some of his rationale on articles I have edited and continuing to claim I am another user, which is okay as long as it is civil, <b>but it is not civil these wrong assertions are expressed through actually uncivil attacks.</b> Once again my views are a commonplace view amongst Iranian Azaris and that in itself does not mean anything. I have warned him and acted in good faith, but he still persisits with his attacks. I would like him to stop making uncivil comments about me to other users and on article talk pages. Can you please get him to provide proof about the anti-Azari statments I have made! I am pretty sure I would be blocked if I made any anti-anything statments! It is easy to make such assertions, but can he provide proof before attacking my name on talk pages?</p>
<p>His claims does not make personal attacks legitmate or okay nor do they allow uncivil behaviour. He continues to make them and say I am anti-Azari! I do not appreciate this type of trolling and personal attacks.

<p>I've been watching this user for a couple of weeks. He is going through the Wikipedia entries for English football league teams and making amendments. His usual practice is to add a summary of some recent information about the club near the top of the article, irrespective of the content of the rest of article. Cue alarmed response and warning messages from an editor with that article on his watch-list. This is odd behaviour... I'm inexperienced here, but I doubt that most of what he's done counts as vandalism. He ignores all messages on his Talk page. From the photos he posts (which get deleted) he's clearly young and he's also pretty new to Wikipedia. Please take a look at his Talk page and review his contributions... be glad of some more experienced (and heavyweight!) input here.

<p>This IP range has been making edits to the Japanese future year categories on year pages (changing them to "unknown") without any discussion. They have also changed categories in certain ways (sometimes removing decade categories, or placing an asterisk in categories (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2016&amp;diff=61137319&amp;oldid=61128913" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2016&amp;diff=61137319&amp;oldid=61128913" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a prime example.)

<p>Wikipedia's worst sockpuppeteer, <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a>, is now operating accounts on Meta.

He <b>is</b> sockpuppeting and vote-soliciting on Meta, too. I would prefer to remain anonymous due to his off-Wiki stalking.</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Why are you telling us here? Wikipedia administrators have no special powers on meta.</li>
<li>b) Seeing as the account was created in January 2006, I don't see how this can be described as 'now operating accounts on meta'.</li>
<li>c) The accounts' sole contributions are to the user page and user talk page.</li>

<dd>He is using Meta to further his agenda, and spamvertise his website. Given that Wikipedia projects are NOT for self promotion, it is asinine for anyone, let alone a permanently banned POV pusher, to self-promote. Should he be allowed to use Meta to promote his agenda when he is permanently banned from all Wikipedia projects? He has used sockpuppets on Meta (the most obvious of which is Ruth Ginsling) to keep his self-promoting userpage in place, and round up a posse of meatpuppets, in typical Gastrich fashion. I posted this here because I am not familiar with dealing with problems on Meta. Surely there are WP admins who are also Meta admins.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with Proto; if he's abusing process on Meta, take it up with the admins on Meta. It's not like we can round up a posse here and charge across the border in hot pursuit. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 14:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd agree. We run into that on AIAV. "Someone's vandalizing the Korean Wikipedia". Great.

<p>I have no love for Jason, but reading his talk page on Meta, it looks to me like there are some users who just will not let it go, to the point of stalking and provoking him.

<dd>As a note of explanation, "Yoji" is <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">User:Stephen Hodge</a>'s nickname for <a href="../../../v/a/p/User%7EVapour_251e.html" title="User:Vapour">User:Vapour</a>, a person entirely unknown to me outside of Wikipedia.

I regard this as a form of intended harassment, and I take his message on my talk page as an implicit threat to continue to try to find information about me and publicize it on Wikipedia. And although there is no actual link to any correct information about me, I am concerned that <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">User:Stephen Hodge</a>'s message may lead, or may have already led, to harassment of the person he has incorrectly identified as me.

<p>This request was rejected for arbitration with the following comment:</p>

<li><b>Reject</b>. The posting of personal information about other editors is already forbidden.

<p><i>From my talk page:</i> <code>Hi El C, there are some antics occurring on the <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> talk page. No it's not a content dispute surprisingly, it's a user named <a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeemu_Ruskeep%C3%A4%C3%A4_d03d.html" title="User:Teemu Ruskeepää">User:Teemu Ruskeepää</a> attempting a radical experiment in talk page restructuring. He's trying to have all comments pinned to his "discussion tree", rather than in the traditional chronological manner. He tried this on the blocked Cuba page which had some merit - but subsequently attempted it on the busy Castro page. Users gave it a go but universally became bamboozled by the lack of clarity and the apparent loss of comments.</code></p>
<p><code><code>Teemu took this badly. He tried to move everyone's comments to various points of the page - unilaterally rejected the concept of archiving and insisted that he had the answer to wikipedias problems. Of course, a consensus poll proved otherwise. This has not deterred young Teemu, and he is now adding lengthy polls to each discussion! With some rather uncivil comebacks to users calling for him to come down from his "discussion tree". I've laid out a programme of response if he continues causing talk page chaos <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zleitzen#Fidel_Castro_--_what.27s_going_to_happen.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zleitzen#Fidel_Castro_--_what.27s_going_to_happen.3F" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, but need an administrator to enforce the will of the people if he continues.

<p>We have a very limited number of cross-namespace redirects and we should try to delete new ones quickly when they show up. But there was some historical justification for keeping this one and since that seems to have been the will of the DRV I don't see why admins should feel the need to override that - even though they've got a cool button and an opinion.

<p>(edit conflict) Ah, this is the central place for the discussion. Well, I just want to say that I support Xoloz's actions.

I disagree strongly with people reverting him and sending him outraged messages because he is simply closing a DRV within the DRV process. That being said, I made my opinions in DRV, and I simply don't care where <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_bold.html" title="Be bold">Be bold</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_Bold_d435.html" title="Be Bold">Be Bold</a> redirects to as much as the edit warriors involved apparently do, so enjoy your edit war, but please don't go flaming an admin who is simply closing a DRV according to consensus. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:31, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a difference between saying "Admin X made a bad/stupid decision" and "Admin X <i>has no sense or reason</i>". The first addresses an action, while the second addresses the individual who performed the action, and as such is a personal attack. As I stated earlier, there are ways to make the point you're trying to make without speaking the way that you are, and your language here is not conducive to a reasoned discussion. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 21:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you take another look at what I wrote, you'll see that I said you were "pretty close to" a personal attack on Xoloz, not that you'd committed one. You could've said what you wanted to say in a much less confrontational manner, if you'd been so inclined, and with people's feelings running hot on this already there's no point in ratcheting up the tension (my opinions about your "trolling" remark are of a similar nature). If you feel that Xoloz is a "robot" who "shoud be desysoped", he's an "admin open to recall". Find five other people and drop him a note on his talk page, instead of muddying things up here, where the discussion should be focused on the redirect (or lack thereof). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 00:32, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is, an approved process came up with a result which violated policy. In that case, the best thing is for the closing administrator to exercise good judgement (as I said above), and close the discussion <i>in favor of policy over process</i>.

<p>This is insane. It is not possible to achieve real consensus on DRV in many cases, unlike *FD, because DRV is only of interest to deletion/inclusion partisans and DRV process cogs. At least the *FD processes will attract the attention of interested parties. I would never have supported undeleting those redirects, had I been aware of the discussion... and I have no doubt that many other users would hold the same position. It was no appropriate to undelete these reader confusing self references (BOLD-&gt;WP:BOLD? Come on! the sort of person who would type with their caps on is in the least need of the confusion of being redirected into sausage making space). That the people arguing against the redeltion are leaning on an expectation of people to blindly follow DRV policy even when it violates our written guidelines and longstanding community behavior ... well, that is just shameful. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree -- this is rather loony. I closed a DRV. In the DRV, some people were hard-line on ASR, some said we should override it per IAR. The latter were greater in number, and -- in my view -- made more sense as well. For my reason extended, see my conversation with Cyde at his talk page. I take some exception to Mackensen characterizing my judgment as grossly in error. I did not count numbers -- I weighed two conflicting interpretations of policy and went with that one most compelling in this instance. This is what discretion means.

<dd>As Mr. Sidaway always reminds us, DRV is open to new evidence, so your characterization of it as a process-review only forum is incorrect.

<p>(several edit conflicts) I agree that cross-namespace redirects and other self-references should be avoided, but I don't see the harm in have a very limited number of them when the is no chance of them being mistaken for an article, especially when they have been around for a long time and deletion will break a lot of old links (I don't know if this is the case for this particular redirect). But, if they are to be deleted entirely, so be it. However, the absolute prohibition should be noted (an absolute prohibition is not given on (WP:ASR]], "...but not necessarily be deleted as they serve their purpose here on Wikipedia") and perhaps even made a speedy delete criterion. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 22:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One thing nobody has pointed out yet: Xoloz is a relatively new admin, as of May 17. And he had <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Xoloz_da48.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Xoloz">a lot of support</a>, making it to <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">WP:100</a>. However, being a new admin, he has the potential to make mistakes. Just as we have a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> policy to avoid biting newcomers, we should apply the same logic to new admins. In this case, some reasoned education would have been more appropriate than remarks like "bad", "stupid", "no basis in sense", and so on. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 15:35, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing out of process with Xoloz's decision. <u>Cross-namespace redirects are not against current official policy</u>. There is in fact quite a community split over the issue at the moment; read through <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> right at this very moment and that will become obvious. With that in mind I completely fail to understand Kelly Martin / Mackensen's arguments that Xoloz made an incorrect action. ~ <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudoSudo_e48d.html" title="User:PseudoSudo">PseudoSudo</a> 17:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, there really isn't a controversy over this one, and saying there is is nothing more than trying to manufacture one. It's long-standing practice that self-references are not allowed in Wikipedia because we are writing GFDL content for a free encyclopedia that is used in many places; we aren't writing merely to perpetuate Wikipedia. As a direct consequence of this we don't use self-references in the encyclopedic content. If you look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> it uses <i>external links</i> to refer to itself, because we are <i>not</i> writing Wikipedia articles, we are writing encyclopedia articles, and any sort of cross-namespace internal link is broken on every other site that hosts our content. Not having cross-namespace links (or, even worse, redirects), is a simple no-brainer. There's no real controversy because anyone arguing <i>for</i> them is basically arguing against the fundamental goals of the project. If you want to go work on an encyclopedia whose goal is to perpetuate itself you can go do it ... you always have the right to fork. But Wikipedia isn't the place for that. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 19:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

To deny this fact is to perpetuate exactly the type of behavior we are trying to condone in this thread. The point of my post, aside from vanquishing the ridiculous claims that Xoloz was at fault in any sense, was to re-iterate what I've said previously in these discussions: <u>policy on cross-namespace redirects needs to be formed</u>, else the same two-point debates on RFD that occur on a daily basis will not ever end. ~ <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudoSudo_e48d.html" title="User:PseudoSudo">PseudoSudo</a> 20:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>None of those people you listed are in charge of setting policy though. In a project the size of Wikipedia there's <i>always</i> going to be dissenters.

<dd>This seems a bit misleading, as the cleanup-style templates are self references, for example. (of course, that can get interesting as well - see Template:POV-tag) <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 19:25, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>As you can imagine, the subject of 'tort reform' is very controversial - on Wikipedia as in the 'real' world.</p>
<p>Several of us are collaborating on this article. There is not an edit war. It is taking time to revamp the article, since we so disagree, but we are working together. However, someone named Jarod wrote outageous posts a number of times, and finally wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>::'Sorry to interrupt ' .,,but this last exchange got my dander up again. Dali, listen up. You seem okay (basically sane, sober, clean-shaven, etc), but you're completely and totally nuts. Why are you even having a conversation with these beautiful, amazing, flawlessly reasoned people? After all, isn't it clear that the TTP, since it was contracted by insurers, is hopelessly biased (as opposed to trial attorneys and their consultants, who have no vested financial interest in tort reform whatsoever, and therefore are free to quote studies as they please?) A slice of advice, my friend - this arguement is completely absurd. With a straight face, they are arguing that civil trial lawyers and their backers don't have any financial interest in enforcing strict caps on punitive damages and contingent fees, then in the next breath, say that insurers and their countless minions do. Ga-huhhh??? (Actually I don't know if they have a straight face. They may be giggling psychotically. In a bathtub full of tobacco money.) The point is, at least one has already admitted to being a trial lawyer, and therefore probably has more money then 6 rooms full of me and you. She argues for a living, and will argue, inanely and illogically, forever. Her condescension is emblematic of why we need tort reform. Trial lawyers have forgotten that all citizens in a free society create law. They just practice it. So stop being so sycophantic and start kicking some tail, buddy. A mildy special third grader could dissect the nonsense about "factoring in the value of life" (of course its an editorial comment Molly - are you even SERIOUS?)</p>
<p>Now watch this magic trick. I'm serious watch... In about forty-five seconds, what I just wrote is going to be interrupted at least four times, and will include howling appeals to censor me, claims that I'm a Republican operative or a child and at least one sentence with a subtext of I know much more about everything than you. It's their livelihood their fighting for. I get it - even respect it - but that respect is not mutual my friend. This is why you must stop sitting on the fence and fight. Love, Jarod--65.135.43.33 02:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a call for fighting and warring, and anything but civil (not to mention atrributing things to me or Gfwesq that nobody said). I fear that this is a troll, or a vandal that will completely undo any attempts at collaboration.jgwlaw 02:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tort_reform" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tort_reform" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tort_reform</a></p>

<dd>Personally, I don't mind being called "nuts", but I do have a sickening feeling when some stranger (especially one who can't even spell "argument") addresses me as "my friend" or "buddy". So I'd agree, this looks bad. Well, hang on a little and see whether this really <i>is</i> a vandal who will completely undo any attempt at collaboration. In the meantime, perhaps the best thing to do is just to ignore the provocation: as long as you think he might be a troll, don't feed him. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
