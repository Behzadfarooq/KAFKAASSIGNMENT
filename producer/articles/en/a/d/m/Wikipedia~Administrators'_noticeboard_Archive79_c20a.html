JzG has participated in an edit war over the inclusion of an amazon link as a reference and his edit was to once again remove the link. I find an administrator abusing his privileges to edit a protected page due to his participation in an edit war unacceptable.</p>
<p>To be upfront: I have reverted twice prior to protection and I reverted JzG's post-protected edit on principle of his abuse (I'd do it even if someone added the amazon link back). However, I have also been the sole initiator in discussion on both JzG's talk page and on <a href="../../../s/c/r/Talk%7EScreamers_%281995_film%29_993f.html" title="Talk:Screamers (1995 film)">Talk:Screamers (1995 film)</a>.</p>
<p>You tell me what's worse: a link to amazon because I can't find another reference or an administrator whom abuses his privileges to continue an edit war?

<li>Um, Guy answered you several minutes ago, and said that his edit was inadvertent. (He didn't notice the page was protected).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=116250662&amp;oldid=116249816" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=116250662&amp;oldid=116249816" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> For what it's worth, (1) I think the "remove the link" camp is right - Amazon is a great website, but for Wikipedia purposes, it manages to combine the reliability of IMDB with the commercialism of E-bay; (2) the original edit of a protected page is probably not as bad as an intentional reversion, which starts to edge towards wheel warring; and (3) surely this isn't so vital an issue that you couldn't have waited a day or two to talk it out.

<dd>So we need something bigger and better than a red "WARNING: This page has been protected..." notice if an admin doesn't notice it.

<dd>Do we <i>need</i> something bigger? No. It's not a problem that crops up often enough to need fixing. But it is quite easy to scroll it off the top, and the eye does tend to get a bit inclined not to see the red stuff when one spends a lot of time with <a href="../../../p/t/_/WP%7EPT_cabf.html" title="WP:PT">WP:PT</a>, the currency of red is somewhat debased these days.</dd>
<dd>I hold to my view that we are both taking this <i>way</i> too seriously. I come to this from a position of spending a lot of my Wikitime dealing with spammers, and seriously I find it really hard to believe that the date of release on an obsolete format is really so vital and so controversial as to require a link to a "Buy it here! Buy it now!" advert page on Amazon, but at least I have opened the debate and there are some thoughtful inputs above. Your view seems to be that it's a fact, therefore it must be included, therefore it must be cited, and if nobody can be arsed to find a more authoritative source than an advert then so be it. Which is another way of looking at it, not necessarily wrong, either, but again probably not worth the effort of a lame edit war. Me, I'm ashamed of both of us. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think TheronJ summed it up well. Before Cburnett starts casting stones, perhaps he should ask himself if he could have handled this situation a little better. My involvement with this was to remove the Amazon link (once) and received a sarcastic and condescending note from Cburnett. I'm baffled that he's so concerned about this link that he was willing to intentionally revert a protected page and risk initiating a wheel war. What a terribly absurd matter this has become... <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 14:13, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Amazon is a valid tertiary/possibly secondary source, it's inappropriate of JzG to abuse his administrator abilities to edit war. Another user has however found two other possible sources, that's good. --Matthew
<ul>
<li>Please read what's already been written above. Guy already remarked that he didn't realize he was editing a protected page. Cburnett did realize he was editing a protected page and proceeded to make a revert. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 14:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Cburnett was very correct in proceeding to revert such a heinous edit, I'm flabbergasted at how one would go about not noticing it was protected, to be honest, firstly it would of show in history and watch list this edit: "21:14, 18 March 2007 Majorly (Talk | contribs) m ({{protect}})", secondly there's a big honking "{{protect}}". However, I will observe <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and assume he just happened to scroll really quickly, miss the big honking box.. notice Amazon was there.. edit.. forget that it states the page is protected and put the edit through and still miss the protected box.. --Matthew

<li>I have unprotected because I have no intention of making further edits, this I made clear on the article's Talk page. I removed the factoid because we have two low-reliability sources which say one date, 23 July 1996, a more relibale source which supports that date but does not confirm it (a review dated after the first but before the second date, note it says <b>Columbia Tristar Home Video</b> - what it was on Betamax? a year ealier than VHS?), and the Amazon date which is dated a year later than <i>three separate reviews</i> explicitly of the video - in other words, a classic case for taking it to Talk.

<p>A) Ray Tomes was blocked for following my advise. He was blocked without discussion. He has followed Wiki procedure. If anyone is at fault here it is me rather than Ray. B) At 18:26, on 17 March 2007 I gave Ray the advise that "My suggestion now will be that we hold any action on the Category:Cycles until The Foundation for the Study of Cycles and List of cycles have both been through a discussion and survived.". Ruud later stated that he would unblock Ray if I advised him not to create that category again. I pointed out that is what I have done. The procedure now is to look for consensus on other areas of cycle theory, if that consensus is not found then there is nothing more that can be done. Having fulfilled that requirement there seems no continued reason to block Ray Tomes. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 18:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Ray Tomes was blocked for following my advise" so are you saying you advised him to ignore the outcome of the deletion and recreate it, rather than engaging in discussion with the deleting admin or taking it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>? Yes you've now advised him not to do it, but from reading his talk page, I can't say it seems he agrees with you. Can I ask a question about what you believe the role of an advocate is? You seem to basically be supporting him however ill-advised his actions, rather than pointing him the right direction to resolve any issues. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 18:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To answer the first question. I understood the category in question to have been deleted in Sept 2005. Enough time to have passed to have another go. I have since learned of the more recent deletion. My advise has changed. To answer the second question. I believe my role is to support editors to resolve conflict through discussion. I will confess I am not making the best out of this case, but I still fail to see where Ray himself has gone so wrong as to justify a block. I have been engaging in some dialogue regarding this case, and I would have thought some contact with either myself or Ray about his recent actions - a warning, perhaps - might have been more useful than a block. It has never been my policy to be confrontational or to deliberately abuse Wiki. But mistakes may occur. However, discussion usefully resolves errors. Things like blocks seem harsh in the circumstances. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 19:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dammned if I can make much sense out of that, but I'll try. Blocked for following your advice? He re-created a twice-deleted category, which is disruptive: you surely didn't advise that?

<dd>It was not a twice deleted category. The first category was a wider one including many articles relating to cycles. The second one was a much narrower one. The original one did not follow procedure and the majority vote was actually to keep the category. It was my complaint about this that led to SilkTork getting involved. Please read all the material that he has and you will find no fault on his part. The new category that I created is a narrow one - simply articles that are very specifically about particular cycles. There can be no reasonable objection to this. People like Christopher Thomas who maintain that I am pushing something that has nothing at all to do with this are constantly muddying the waters. I will not answer his lies because for every lie I answer he adds three more.

<p>The Foundation for the Study of Cycles was never deleted under consensus. The result of the discussion was no-consensus. While researching into Ray's case I found a link to the article which was a redirect to another article. At the same time I saw that an article with the title <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_the_Study_of_Cycles_8d1d.html" title="Foundation for the Study of Cycles">Foundation for the Study of Cycles</a> had also been redirected. Looking at the edit summaries it appeared initially that someone had attempted to merge the two articles but instead created a redirect to another article. I undid that. Upon further investigation I realised that the article had been subjected to that discussion, and despite the non-consensus, the article had been merged, so I stood by my undoing of the redirect. I left messages on the talk pages of those involved, and suggested a new Afd take place on that article as there is doubt about it. So. In short. I did not recreate a deleted article. Also, I have previously advised you of this situation as recorded in the links above. Would you please strike out the accusation I restored a deleted article. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 19:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looking at the comments on his talk such as "I complained about a vote for category cycle (or cycles) deletion and asked for a case to be heard.". SilkTork was assigned to the case." seems to indicate he thinks you are some sort of authority who could rule on the dispute. Further "SilkTork re-established the article on FSC...", Although you may not have been aware of the apparent confusion as to your role, and the subsequent misunderstanding concerning the deletion of the category, it looks to me like you've got far too involved in this. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 19:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

Neither occurred, so it ended up getting merged to ERD (counting the contingencies, that's 6 delete, 3 merge, 0 keep; not counting contingencies, it's still 9:4 against keeping as a separate article).

<p>I am becoming aware that my actions in this case could have been better. I have not researched enough, and I have not consulted enough with other people. There appears to be greater history to Ray's involvement with Wiki than appears from the available records. I am not, however, convinced that all my actions were bad, nor that Ray should have been banned without a warning. In retrospect my advise to go ahead and recreate the category was unsound, as I hadn't looked enough into it. I still, however, defend my action in undiverting the Foundation article and suggesting it be put to the test of another discussion. And I still feel that Ray is currently being punished incorrectly. He will not recreate the category, and only did so under my guidance. His previous attempt at creating the category occurred over a year after the original one was deleted, and it was done slightly differently. His record on Wiki doesn't show him to be a disruptive person. He seeks out advise and acts accordingly. My own record on Wiki also shows me to be a not disruptive person who follows advise. Under these circumstances - would Ruud please reconsider the block. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 19:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The study of cycles is not <b>non-mainstream</b>, although several people active in trying to delete cycles material have tried to maintain that it is so. Cycles research is done in every field of science by main-steam researchers. Even the collection together of cycles material is not properly described as non-mainstream, it is just less well known. The list of people involved in FSC that I put there and was immediately deleted by you shows quite clearly that those active in FSC included a nobel lauriet, a vice president of the US, a number or Sirs and many university professors, some quite famous ones. The collection of cycles reports put together by Dewey and FSC numbers well over a thousand, many from peer reviewed journals. To those that say there is no such thing as <b>cycle studies</b> I say try google <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=(cycle+OR+cycles)+(study+OR+studies)&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=(cycle+OR+cycles)+(study+OR+studies)&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and find 153,000,000 pages. Of course many of these are on different meanings of cycles, but you might note that the top article is the wikipedia article on Dewey and that CRI and my home page (old version) are in the first 10 of these 153,000,000. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 21:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Famous Cricket Coach (not an oxymoron in the Commonwealth) died today.

I'm a little concerned that there may be other unsourced nonsense added and I'm away to my bed shortly.

<p>To bring everyone up to speed...</p>
<p>There's an article about the fictional substance, <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberium.html" title="Tiberium">Tiberium</a>. For about 4 years, the article has been relatively stable. Then, on March 4, 2007, <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">AMiB</a> decided to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiberium&amp;oldid=112732589" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiberium&amp;oldid=112732589" rel="nofollow">purge the entire article</a>. For the last, say, 14 days, there's been edit wars over the topic. I've been involved in it, but others have as well: AMiB purges the content, people revert it, people begin citing / improving the article, and AMiB purges it again. If you'd look at the <a href="../../../t/i/b/Talk%7ETiberium_4964.html" title="Talk:Tiberium">article's talk page</a>, one can see that it's generally AMiB versus Everyone. I'm getting sick of seeing this happen over and over, so I decided to put this here and see what'll happen. This is <i>especially</i> important, as it's only going to get worse when the <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberium_Wars_3518.html" title="Tiberium Wars">next game in this series</a> comes out. I'm not saying the article is perfect, but purging the entire article over and over and over again isn't the way to go about it. <a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScumbag_07c4.html" title="User:Scumbag">Scumbag</a> 02:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've protected the article in the version without the paragraphs upon paragraphs of original research and unverifiable info. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 02:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Endorse Picaroon's actions. We regularly stub articles which are hopelessly outside of policy to allow for a full rewrite. Indeed, Scumbag's sequence of events isn't entirely accurate. Looking at the history, it appears to go: AMIB removes tonnes of <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">in-universe</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">unattributed material</a>, AMIB and others begin to rewrite it, Scumbag or someone else blanket reverts the entire thing, rince &amp; repeat. – <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 02:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Why don't you just rebuild content from AMIB's purged version as opposed to rv'ing and trying to cite all of that? I presume that AMIB is purging it again because there the article is being written in an in-universe style (or has a lot of in-universe info that isn't needed), which can't be fixed by just merely citing it.

<dd>When will the page in question be unprotected? The minute it is, it will be restored to proper status. Not a threat, but a inevitability. It's one of the things I wanted to point out that you guys haven't understood - Tiberium is a major character in the C&amp;C franchise, and deserves an article written like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> - an article, I point out, that is written entirely in-universe. I posted this thing because I felt that any reasonable person can see that the article in question is being <b>damaged</b> by a single user, and that there's <i>already</i> considerable amount of people that disagree with his actions.

<p>It looks like Ingsoc has been convinced to AMIB's views, so it isn't a single-user dispute. Policy is greater than what the normal editors think: policy has been decided on by everybody, and everybody must follow it for all articles. The minority of those who disagree do not overrule the majority that formed the policy in the first place. And please, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> (or kyptonite, as brought up on the page) is not at issue: this is.

<p>I'm very disappointed that editors, when faced with the challenge laid down by one editor to cite secondary sources and demonstrate that the content of an article conforms to our content policies, instead of <i>looking for such sources and citing them</i>, as encyclopadists are supposed to do, wasted all of their effort for two weeks in edit warring, and trying to argue that content that requires readers to duplicate primary research at length, in order to check that content, isn't original research. I've edited the article whilst it is under protection to make a point. I've added some material to the article that is based upon secondary sources. <i>This material took me all of 10 minutes with Google Books to find.</i> I strongly suggest that <a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScumbag_07c4.html" title="User:Scumbag">Scumbag</a> and others learn from this. <i>This is what we want you to do. It's easy, it's entirely defensible against charges of unverifiability and original research, and it took approximately <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/6/9/9693e4b2ad9539c830c5609ecb692546.png" alt="\frac{1}{1000}" /> of the time of your foolish edit war and lengthy attempts to defend your performing primary research.</i> Now stop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tiberium&amp;diff=116199746&amp;oldid=116156005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tiberium&amp;diff=116199746&amp;oldid=116156005" rel="nofollow">this sort of silly behaviour</a> and go and do likewise!

<dd>Hey, anybody can edit: I just removed the protected template. As for my thoughts, the icon is quite small, a bit hard to see. Honestly...I don't see a need for a DYK icon. There isn't any standard for it; your article just happens to appear on the front page, as opposed to getting GA or an FA status. FA is exemplory, while GA is <i>somewhat</i> dubious (process it not as rigorous). Hbdragon88 23:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I've recently removed <a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMilaneus_a2a2.html" title="User talk:Milaneus">User_talk:Milaneus</a> from my watchlist. The reason is, he claimed (offline from wikipedia) that monitoring his talk page and contributions were an</p>
<blockquote>
<p><big>"invasion of privacy"</big></p>
</blockquote>
<p>, even if your contributions or talkpage can be checked by almost anyone with internet access. He also requested that other people with that page on their watchlist take it off as well. The reason that I put his page on my watchlist, is because I was notifying him of vandalism to my userspace, and it automaticly adds to my watchist. He also called reverting the blanking of his talkpage to be "annoying" (outside of wiki). The main reason why I occasionally check his contribs is because I wanted to see when he has vandalized my pages, and also if he has made constructive edits, and how often. I usually keep track of most vandals I encounter, especially if that user has vandalised a page I frequently monitor, such as my userspace, and if it's an edit I find highly disruptive. In this case however, I am going to make an exception per a request. another user, this time an anon, possibly the same person as that user, because of similar editing patterns, has also vandalized my userspace. I might also take that talkpage off my watchlist. Basicly, I added this section because he requested (outside of wiki) that everyone take his talkpage off your watchlist. Whether or not you do this is not up to me. Any comments/suggestions/etc?

<dd>The contribution record is there for a reason. Without breaching AGF, I think it is entirely OK to check the contribs of people whose editing pattern suggests that they may be vandals, POV-pushers, careless editors, or whatever. The logged changes someone makes here are not in any way 'private'. What counts as wikistalking is when someone turns up on pages that they have never before shown an interest in, just because an editor they dislike has edited them, with edits that look like they are just done to annoy the stalkee.

<p>This is going to be a long job. we have many thousands of links to amazon.com, a lot of whihc are either links to the Amazon product page, clearly inappropriate, or to Amazon customer reviews, which fail <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.

Maybe the VHS release date really <i>is'</i> terribly important, and we really <i>can't</i> include it without linking to the Amazon sales page because it really <i>is</i> the only source for that data and it really <i>must</i> be attributed (unlike most of the rest of the article).

<dd>In terms of ISBN and release date information, it's super-reliable for books, and even more reliable for music and movies. Often, for older things, it's the best available reference and is completely appropriate to use, like in JzG's <i>Screamers</i> example. "Links to avoid" isn't "Links never to use at any point whatsoever," it takes a wee bit of thought rather than a blind massive delinking. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Because I rarely see Amazon get anything wrong? I use it as a reference for basic information often, as it's easy to read, informative, and has traditionally given a good track record for accuracy. As for my tone, I'm no longer interested in catching flies, but simply having the proper thing occur. Considering the scare tactics involved in getting us to the point of nofollowing any links that don't make money for the Foundation and how we're "inundated with spam" to the point of making a oft-abused CSD out of it, I automatically blanche at even considering this sort of action without some more thought than "clearly inappropriate" when no such clarity exists. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Speaking from personal, professional, and Wikipedial experience, I'm not convinced that's true in the least.

<dd>Experience trying to replace invalid ISBNs suggests that *no* potential source of information should be ruled out, when trying to find correct book details or movie details. The submitter of this complaint, <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>, picked a case of the American VHS release date of the movie <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screamers_%281995_film%29.html" title="Screamers (1995 film)">Screamers (1995 film)</a>, that might appear trivial since who cares about the exact release date, but we might have to undo some fairly sacred policies in <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> if we want to place obstacles against using a correct source of information.

<dd>An {{<a href="../../../a/s/i/Template%7EASIN_d2a7.html" title="Template:ASIN">ASIN</a>}} template was created specifically to simplify making valid Amazon references in case this was the only way to provide online-checkable book details. This template is now in use for about fifty main-space articles, for example <a href="../../../a/s/i/ASIN_8db0.html" title="ASIN">ASIN</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00086U61Y" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00086U61Y" rel="nofollow">B00086U61Y</a>, now validly used (in my opinion) for a rare out-of-print book cited in our <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> article and published in 1932. Without this reference there would be no way to tell that the book even exists, or to verify the spelling of the title, the author, or the publisher. (ISBNs came into use about 1970, so it has no ISBN). Nothing is more frustrating than to find an entry in a reference list that you know is wrong and have *no* online source of information for fixing it. If Amazon is the only thing available, we should use it. This doesn't replace ISBN references, of which there are about 70,000 in WP, and there is almost never a valid reason to use an ASIN when an ISBN is available.

<dd>Although WP has 70,000 ISBNs it has only about 100 LCCNs, for whatever reason. Actually, your LCCN link (marked 'here' in your comment) doesn't work for me, because of the session timeout in the LOC computer system (just one of the problems in using that approach). If you don't think we knew about the Library of Congress, you're welcome to peruse the lengthy Talk page at <a href="../../../i/n/v/CT%7EINV_c67e.html" title="CT:INV">CT:INV</a>, and its archive. And, before you nuke Amazon, would you please be kind enough to go to all fifty current uses of {{<a href="../../../a/s/i/Template%7EASIN_d2a7.html" title="Template:ASIN">ASIN</a>}} and replace all those valid references, including many to films, with valid LCCN numbers. (The films will usually not be in LOC, and many foreign books will not). Then, will you also research the validly-issued LCCN numbers that for some reason are not recognized by its computer system. (Examples provided on request). In answer to your question, where did Amazon get their data from, I think they got it from the publishers. Publishers are not 100% reliable, neither is Amazon nor the Library of Congress. We need to use whatever information we can get, and fact-check it as thoroughly as possible. The Library of Congress is not a magic bullet. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

The burden is those providing the sources, not on those who are removing bad ones.

<dd>Could you please enumerate those reasons? I find it very useful when people leave an ASIN or link to amazon behind; it makes it much easier to fill in the rest of the citation data. Before you nuke any amazon link or ASIN, it would be more appropriate to go through and remove all references that do not list any catalog number (be that ISBN,OCLC/LCC or ASIN), as they are far more difficult to figure out. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 11:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The ISBN fixing project has only used ASINs as a last resort, reluctantly, and at least cites them properly (you would be suprised how many "ISBN B001100XX" we find). Certainly we could consider searching out all ASIN/Amazon references and ISBN/OCLC/LCC/BL-ing them wherever possible. Incidently one advantage of the ASIN template is that it makes uses of Amazon more controllable. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 09:43 <a href="../../../1/9/_/19_March_4041.html" title="19 March">19 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</p>

<dd>Oh god. Amazon ASINs as stable identifiers for rare books? This is just bordering on insane. Once Amazon (or their affiliate) sell that book, the Amazon listing is liable to vanish - I've seen it happen before - and there's absolutely no control over them, no indication they won't be reused. An Amazon ASIN is - simply put - as useful and as helpful as listing the accession number for a single specific public library with an online catalogue, except it (might) let you buy the book.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, catalogue numbers are helpful but by no means essential; you should take the ASIN, replace it with <i>the normal bibliographic data</i>, and leave it at that. There's no decent, usable, standard identifier codes for pre-1960s books, and we're just faffing pointlessly if we try to insist we use one of the several potential ones.</dd>

<p>Guy, a similar task has been undertaken by Rich/SmackBot with fixing ISBNs. The bot tagged all invalid ISBNs and people manually found the appropriate ISBN, OCLC, LOC or ASIN (in that order). Getting rid of all unnecessary amazon links sounds like another maintenance task that the same team would enjoy completing. There are a lot of special cases, and as these amazon links often contain a lot of the clues to identify the precise work that was referenced by the contributor, and manual processing is the best approach to ensure the citations end up accurate without putting noses out of joint -- this then demonstrates to other Wikipedians how to properly cite their sources. The team that worked on the invalid ISBNs and ISSNs started discussing what catalog schemes would be appropriate for videos, cds and dvds (see <a href="../../../i/n/v/CAT%7EINVALID_a700.html#Universal_IDs_for_DVDs.3F" title="CAT:INVALID">CAT:INVALID#Universal IDs for DVDs?</a>), however we didn't encounter those items often enough to take it further. I'm quite sure the same team would be happy to manually tackle each article if a bot can apply a tag to all articles that have a link to amazon. Many would be books, so having the same team work on them would be beneficial. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Librarians_c634.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Librarians">WikiProject Librarians</a> would no doubt be able to give us a hand working out what non-commercial resources we can use. The benefit of this approach is that once we are on top of the problem, there is a team ready to address any new occurrences that appear as a result of subsequent runs of the bot. And we can be sure that new links to amazon will continue to appear regularly. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 11:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The review doesn't mean much on its own anyway, but combined with two other sources that say a release date of July 1996, I'd say it's enough evidence to say the Amazon date isn't correct? <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 15:06, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could we please get a <i>written</i> policy drafted and approved on not allowing links to online sales pages (Amazon isn't the only one) if there isn't one already.

<dd>There's ALREADY a written policy, in that they fall squarely under <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">this heading</a>, specifically number 4, <i>Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use <a href="../../../i/s/b/Wikipedia%7EISBN_7825.html" title="Wikipedia:ISBN">the "ISBN" linking format</a>, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources.</i> Note that last clause.

<dd>Links to online sales pages as external links are in general contraindicated. <i>References</i> to commercial sites are not so contraindicated. If someone puts something into a Wikipedia article, I want them to say where they got it from. IMO, you should never remove a reference without either removing the information that reference supports or finding a better source. While Amazon isn't by any means a perfect reference, there are cases in which it is better than nothing. I'd rather at least be able to find out where information came from, and I think for uncontroversial information an Amazon sales page is better than nothing. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 01:52, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The policy appears to be clear- no external links to sales sites. The policy, however, doesn't say that an online retailer can't be used as a reference source. Thus, editors should be able to use commercial sites as sources, as long as they don't add an embedded external link to the site in question in the article. Delete away on those links and let people who object know about the policy. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 02:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With all respect, it's getting a bit literalistic saying that our anti-spamming policy means that we can't link to Amazon for uncontroversial information about a book. It's not as if people are unaware that Amazon exists. A purge of this kind would be disruptive unless some other source were found every single time, and I really think it would be a waste of energy better expended elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We give preference to non-commercial references. That's fine. If you want to replace a link to Amazon which is serving as a reference for some fact with an equally reliable non-commercial site citing the same info then by all means go ahead. Ditto things which are just 'external link' entries not backing up any facts cited in the article. However, deleting valid references without replacing them? No. If the information is widely available then cite it from another source. If you can't find another source, then leave the Amazon (or whatever) reference in place. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've started blocking these, so it should hopefully disable this person's ability to create accounts for a bit, but I'd like to know if this looks familiar to anyone. If not, try to keep a look out for it, because they obviously know what they are doing.</p>

<dd>Strange. Adding infoboxes in both pages remove the red links from the contributions, so that others don't immediately recognize it as a new account. As to why, I have no idea. Maybe a legitimate account would be used to revert those modifications (I think we have seen one where he vandalized with an account and reverted with another), it is some kind of "test" (some journalist or student researching our revertion speeds). I guess it may be useful to do a checkuser on them, in case this continues. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that is not a useful page -- I assume both of you are referring to the same page. I am puzzled why you picked that one; which one of the almost 300 links from Wikipedia led you there? However, there are several useful pages on that website; here's one -- www.touregypt.net/featurestories/ramesses2squeens.htm -- &amp; this is another -- touregypt.net/featurestories/ramesses2intro.htm -- a Wikipedia article had linked to. Both have only a small advertisement at the top of each. The links that were disabled were added by a number of different Wikipedians &amp; many have been around as long as 3 years -- so they've been frequently reviewed. But why are we talking about the content of a webpage here? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 06:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, Betacommand has shown a stunning lack of tact &amp; flexibility here even before I came into this, which is in marked contrast to the civil behavior of the others who support the blacklisting. None of them have resorted to obscenities or arrogance, &amp; if provoked ... simply <i>ignore</i> the person. I'm beginning to wonder if the problem here is mostly Beta. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see my post at meta, Forking discussions over four pages is not good, I tried to have the discussion at one place, meta. Llywrch proceeds to spread and fork the issue over many pages and tries to bypass the blacklisting of a site (yes I requested it be SBL'ed) instead of attempting to address issues questions were raised of where the request was made and not on the validity of our reasoning. I cannot add things to the SBL as I am not a meta admin. the attempts to fork the discussion and bypass an ongoing discussion frustrated me, as i have been unable to sit down and address the issues, due to being in meetings all weekend. please see my most recent post to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam" class="extiw" title="m:Spam">m:Spam</a> talk. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 05:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your response is disingenuous, Beta: there is no "forking discussions" here. I am responsible for starting only three related conversations: one on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia: Village pump (policy)</a> about the manner this website was placed on the spam blacklist; a second on meta arguing to remove the website from that list; &amp; this one, asking that some of my fellow Admins monitor those two conversations because tempers were growing heated. Using your reasoning, this conversation has been "forked" to two other venues: <a href="../../../k/y/r/User_talk%7EKyraVixen_ac0e.html" title="User talk:KyraVixen">KyraVixen's talk page</a>, and to the <a href="../../../s/p/a/MediaWiki_talk%7ESpam-whitelist_111e.html" title="MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist">MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist</a> here on en; I have not participated in either of those related conversations.</dd>

<dd>Again, I would like to observe that other participants opposing me in this discussion -- for example, KyraVixen &amp; Beetstra -- have been able to discuss this matter in a civil &amp; productive manner, unlike Betacommand. I honestly don't know what his problem is, but Betacommand's unhelpful attitude began before I raised my concerns, &amp; has been expressed to other Wikipedians. At this writing, he has continued to use abusive language towards other editors &amp; failed to apologize for his earlier mistakes. I'm close to the point of having no more good faith to extend to him, &amp; have begun to wonder if it would be appropriate for me to move this discussion to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let it be noted that I have made several attempts to discuss the issue especially on meta. I and other users have repeatedly pointed out that touregpyt is a poor site (limited text, high rates of advertising, and that it is primarily a site designed to sell stuff). there have been repeated attempts to point out better sources that are not primarily commercial. instead of addressing the issue in question llywrch makes statements that do not address the issues raised., instead the comments do very little to address the issue. When I called him out on that he basically asked for me to be blocked on meta so that he could get the site off the SBL. (Yes I did use some strong language but in cretin situations there is a need at no point have I broken policy remember wikipedia and meta are not censored thus "my language" did not break policy) I have pointed out and requested Multiple times that instead of fighting for a poor site to be removed from the SBL we work together and find better sources that incorporate the mission of wikipedia and the WikiMedia foundation Free non commercial content. Instead of taking my offer to help llywrch continues to push for links to this site. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 18:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It took me a while to respond to this because Betacommand's response has left me speechless by its cluelessness. Yes, you responded to arguments on meta about this out-of-process block. (Ugh -- I never thought I'd use that phrase.) Yes, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> censored; yes, you can use obscene words in <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">the proper context</a>.

<p>I just wanted to make an announcement here rather than posting only to involved users talk pages as this might be of interrest to uninvolved administrators and users as well.

He did not take notice of this but continued to edit with newly created accounts and as an IP. Since he had a dynamic IP, there was some in trouble preventing him from editing, and since his IP range was quite large, I hesitated to rangeblock.</p>
<p>After correspondence with <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">User:Rdsmith4</a> on IRC, we decided that a rangeblock was the only possible solution anyway, and I was adviced to send an email to the abuse department of the ISP, Telenor, as well. I told them the story and that I had rangeblocked 65 536 of their IPs (88.88.0.0/16) from editing the English Wikipedia for a week. I did not expect the quick answer I got from them. Less than two hours after I sent my email, they answered and would appreciate if I sent them logs of his edits, which I did. Today I got an email from them where they told me that they had closed the account of the user. The closing of the account was nothing that I ever suggested that they should do (I did not suggest anything actually, I just told the story), they did it on their own initiative.</p>
<p>I've unblocked the range again, and hopefully this will end the problems with the user, and we will be able to move on to contributing to Wikipedia rather than keeping SndrAndrss under control. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 13:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the issue is that they don't want to deal with the hassle of the article any more and have simply redirected it despite it being patently independently notable for a possible substantial encyclopedia article, that's probably not appropriate. If the issue is that the article, as a matter of encyclopedic importance, content consolidation, sourcing, etc. should be merged into the other article, then that's probably alright regardless of the AfD being a keep. In any case, if there is contentwise objection to the actual merge/redirect, then there should be discussion about it on the talk page. If the issue is that some AfD process is not being followed, at most what would need to be done to ameliorate that is to notify the AfD participants of the merge discussion. This is not exhaustive of all the possibilities here—these Eastern European conflicts are wild—but this should give some idea. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 04:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No one has proposed a merge. They have all agreed to delete the content of the article, by redirecting the article to an apolitical article on the city that is the focus of the ethnic tension.

<p>They just want to redirect the page to the article on the city, which will cover the subject apolitically? This is good, and requires no admin intervention.

<dd>I'm not an administrator, but I see no problem with how things have been resolved. It seems that the edit history of the original <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_of_Armenian_cultural_monuments_in_Nakhichevan_242e.html" title="Status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan">Status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan</a>, which was later called <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khachkar_destruction.html" title="Khachkar destruction">Khachkar destruction</a>, is still being preserved under the redirect called <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khachkar_destruction.html" title="Khachkar destruction">Khachkar destruction</a> that points to <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julfa%2C_Azerbaijan_%28city%29_04da.html" title="Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)">Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)</a>. It was an editorial decision to make that change, and there seems to be a consensus for it on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Talk%7EKhachkar_destruction_7607.html" title="Talk:Khachkar destruction">Talk:Khachkar destruction</a>. The editors can later choose, if they wish, to resurrect the temporarily obscured material and merge it somewhere reasonable. Since there was *no* AfD that closed with 'Delete' there should not be any issue about process being ignored. Of course, since there are some mutterings about a deletion review, there could be more chapters in this exciting saga..

<p>In the wake of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Brandt_%2813th_nomination%29_9a9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (13th nomination)">certain</a> <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Daniel_Brandt_6850.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Daniel Brandt">recent</a> <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Daniel_Brandt_deletion_wheel_war_bf03.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war">events</a>, it has become clear that this man named Daniel Brandt is trying to get his page deleted. But one can't help but ask the question, "Are we keeping this page just to piss him off, because he's an activist against our website which we put so much time and effort into?" I don't think this is true, but I think that this raises a more important issue. Wikipedians who have been even remotely involved with the DB fiasco last February know who he is at least, and most know quite a bit about him. But, does the general public know? Do they care?</p>
<p>I think that we need to keep in mind that we are creating this encyclopedia for the world. When it is all said and done, is the general public going to care about this person named Daniel Brandt and his vendetta against Wikipedia? I think that almost every single user on Wikipedia has a conflict of interest in this article. It is eventually going to shift to a pro-Wikipedia, pro-Internet point of view, because that is the view that virtually ALL editors at Wikipedia share. We don't have the right to judge this man's notability. You can't see a whole picture when you're inside the frame.</p>
<p>Almost every single one of us resents this guy for threatening to strike down the entity that we have put so much time and effort into. Maybe we ought to come up with a different idea for this one, instead of repeatedly nominating it for deletion, citing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Maybe we should just bite the bullet and take it down. Mr. Brandt doesn't want it there because he thinks that it misrepresents him. Some of us don't want it here anymore because it's a MAJOR pain in the ass to keep clean, and often spawns deep-but-pointless philosophical discussions. Maybe it would be best for all of us to just delete it and put this dark chapter in Wikipedia history behind us. This issue will not be solved by AfDs, where every editor is forced to take a stand on one side of the keep/delete line.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandt has trolled us into doing this, yes. But maybe, just maybe, Wikipedia might recognize that standing up to this troll has wasted much more time than if we just deleted the page in the first place at the very first AfD. Instead of wasting our time arguing over a barely-notable man, let's try to write on the more important topics on Wikipedia such as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">History</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a>, those pages that we have forgotten about in favor of pages about the latest episode of <i>Lost</i>.</p>
<p><b>TLDR version</b>: It's a pain in the ass, and isn't helping anybody on both sides of the battlefield. Let's delete it once and for all, and get to work on the <i>real</i> encyclopedia. Once again, if needed, please move this to the right place. Oh, and you don't like the idea, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">don't make it personal</a>. I'm being really bold putting my ideas out here, and I don't want to ruin my wiki-life because of it. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PTO</a> 04:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But that misses the point. Are we really keeping the article because it <i>should</i> be kept? Or are we just keeping it so that we can do the opposite of what he wants?

<dd>As regards that, the 13 AfD's where he was determined to be notable speak for themselves. (And unlike the GNAA, his article can be sourced.)

<dd>Honestly... as long as there is nothing libelous or <i>attacking</i> about the article, the subject's wishes... I don't think they should matter for the simple existence of an article. If a newspaper (say, the NY Times) were to publish a full biographical article on Brandt and leave it on their site forever and in print, would he fight them? Would the NYT back down? Why should we over something silly for any person who asks? We'd be flooded with people who for whatever reason don't want a page. Giving one that precedent would I imagine legally give it to them all. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 05:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're keeping it because it should be kept. He's clearly notable, IMO. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, and even paper encyclopedias don't limit themselves to things people are already likely to know about (except maybe in Orwell's 1984). <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Notability isn't a question, and we proved that 101% in the last (hopefully final) AfD. Also... on what grounds would we just arbitrarily delete an article? do we need <i>another</i> wheel war and arbcom mess? Further... <b><a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORTHEPEOPLE_82b5.html" title="WP:FORTHEPEOPLE">WP:FORTHEPEOPLE</a></b>: <i>Saying that we should "delete this article, to stave off future disruption," isn't valid--and it assumes supreme bad faith of your peers, because it assumes that a minority of your peers will practice disruption later on Wikipedia to get their way later. <b>If such a thing happens, it's a problem with those editors that don't conform to the community standards--not a problem with the article itself.</b></i></p>
<p>Last, if you honestly think no one cares about this guy, who has been constantly quoted in the media since the year 2000 or so (7+ years), why don't we delete stuff others don't care about like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld_f682.html" title="Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>?

<dd>I don't believe we delete on the possibility that some people <s>have</s> may have an inability to edit like adults later on given articles, either... and my point was that we shouldn't delete based on possible disruption from an article.

<dl>
<dd>I'm not asking for deletion because other crap exists. Or, because the guy has harassed us so much that we just should take it down. None of us can write a neutral article on him, because we've all got a negative viewpoint on him. All of us. We've wasted enough time on this sad article, with its record number of AfDs. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PTO</a> 12:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>M. Brandt has now been joined by <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Archimedes_Plutonium_%282nd%29_80c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Archimedes Plutonium (2nd)">AfD discussion</a>) who, editing as Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>) as well as several IP address accounts, also wishes the article on him to be deleted. One difficulty of this situation is that the most in-depth reliable independent source on the subject of M. Plutonium, a book by Eric Francis that devotes several pages to M. Plutonium and his interactions with others on Usenet, is about the murder of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_and_Susanne_Zantop_3db8.html" title="Half and Susanne Zantop">Half and Susanne Zantop</a>, for which M. Plutonium was one of several people briefly suspected and then eliminated from the inquiry. (The book documents how he was eliminated from the inquiry, but also provides extensive background information on him to explain who he is in the first place.) Another difficulty of the situation is that whilst it would be good to allow M. Plutonium to participate in the discussion, he has brought his Usenet behaviour here, including <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">legal threats</a> of libel claims against M. Francis. A third difficulty of the situation is that the only article that M. Plutonium will apparently accept is one that basically parrots his own uncorroborated <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a> and scientific theories verbatim.</p>

<dd>In <i>theory</i>, yes, it was fine, because Wikipedia isn't censored and users are allowed some leeway in what they do with their userpage.

<p>The history and talk page of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Douglas_f2a7.html" title="Scott Douglas">Scott Douglas</a> are rather hilarious, or maybe just absurd. There are biographies in there of two different Scotts Douglas. One is the pen name of Scott La Counte, a librarian who writes for <a href="../../../m/c/s/McSweeney%27s_bf50.html" title="McSweeney's">McSweeney's</a> website; his bio tends to spiral into the fanciful, following <a href="http://mcsweeneys.net/links/librarian/23wiki.html" class="external text" title="http://mcsweeneys.net/links/librarian/23wiki.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> of his about Wikipedia, inviting readers to "invent" a colorful life story for him.</p>
<p>The other Scott was the stage name of Scott Mathiesen (sp?) the lead singer of Christian rock band <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Heart_3f53.html" title="White Heart">White Heart</a> from 1984-1985, when he apparently went to jail, although I can't find a reliable source backing that up. Neither Scott seems notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the article has been everything from a blatant BLP violation, to a dab page, to a protected redirect (to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Heart_3f53.html" title="White Heart">White Heart</a>), to an elaborate hoax bio. It's been forked, merged, moved, protected, unprotected, deleted and recreated three times... I've never seen more good faith bouncing around of an article with zero encyclopedic content. I'm inclined to delete the current history and make another protected redirect (to White Heart or to McSweeney's?), but a few more people might want to watchlist this, as it seems to be a perennial problem.</p>

<p>I don't know what planet you're from, but adding a userbox saying you believe in a terrorist organization is not a felony here. Perhaps you're confusing with the other definition of support, as in providing financial and logistical backing, which WOULD be a felony, but a userbox is definitely not that. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 05:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) Those don't appear to be real userboxes actually, just him coding the stuff in himself. If he's also a POV editor then a good case can be made for removing activist content, but I don't think the userbox just by itself is too problematic. Whether it's illegal in the UK to support them monetarily is different than whether it's illegal to support them idealogically, and I'm not sure if we would care even if it was, considering our attitude towards China's block on us. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 05:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is an editing war on the ordering on <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_%28disambiguation%29_fc7a.html" title="University of Wisconsin (disambiguation)">University of Wisconsin (disambiguation)</a>. From 1848 to 1956, University of Wisconsin was an intitution that included the campus in Madison, 10 freshman-sophomore centers in other cities in Wisconsin and state-wide extenstions. (source: <a href="http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow">UW System the former University of Wisconsin part</a>). Most of the University of Wisconsin used in Wikipedia refer to the one during this time frame. It should be at the top of the list. The current UW-Madison is just a part of this institution and already has University of Wisconsin redirected to this article due to the biase among some editors and administrators. There is no reason to have it on the top in <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_%28disambiguation%29_fc7a.html" title="University of Wisconsin (disambiguation)">University of Wisconsin (disambiguation)</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmaxmarchhare_4525.html" title="User:Madmaxmarchhare">Madmaxmarchhare</a> has been very illogical in the discussion.

In fact, Miaers has engaged in personal attacks all day long (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Wisconsin_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=117107181" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Wisconsin_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=117107181" rel="nofollow">diff</a> or any of his recent edit-summaries on both this page and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniversity_of_Wisconsin_dde2.html" title="Talk:University of Wisconsin">Talk:University of Wisconsin</a>).

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is becoming a typical response pattern from Miaers. He argues, others counter argue. He doesn't get his way and everyone else is wrong. When he really doesn't get his way, he runs somewhere else, or uses new logic to try and get his way. This, and discussions closely related to it, have been on-going for several months, now. It's strange that he's even seemingly alienated just about everyone who's supported him in the past, as well. My purpose as of late has been to find his endgame. From what I can tell, the only "out" that he has is to have everything go his way, otherwise he'll continue to argue and argue until we've all given up (or have died of old age, perhaps). <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmaxmarchhare_4525.html" title="User:Madmaxmarchhare">Madmaxmarchhare</a> 00:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This indicates to me that his involvement here isn't going to be any more beneficial this time around, so I've blocked him for evading his original Nintendude block. I didn't request a Checkuser here because this is one of the strongest cases of <a href="../../../d/u/c/WP%7EDUCK_49d3.html" title="WP:DUCK">WP:DUCK</a> I've seen (I can provide further information via email if anyone is interested, I just don't want to go into it here because it involves the individual's real name). Anyway, I just wanted to mention the block here in case anyone disagrees and wants to argue that he should be unblocked.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I've reverted a few of these old infoboxes yes, but this is per the discussions made by a huge amount of editors.</dd>

<dd>These two users (who appear intertwined), keep changing six or so very specific articles so they not only use a superceded, poorly formatted infobox, out of line with the entirity of England's places articles, but also making content falsifications and breaching Wikipedia's style guides. Lewis has been invited to comment at template talk page but has thusfar declined. I've also posted to Captain Scarlet that I'm interested in working with him, perhaps to draw up a specific map for the region (I can provide a diff if requested), but this was dismissed. I really don't know what the problem is as the newer template is a wholly better (more compatible, flexible, functional) infobox that does nothing to breach the integrity of the article whatsover. It appears to be trolling for trolling's sake, and there are issues of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> for these articles too. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 18:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Since that time, he has been generally incivil with his original blocking, and repeatedly reposted a rant on his talk page, even after the block expired.

Oh, to be a Supreme Court Justice right now. As much as I might hate having to answer hard questions, I hate worse having to give hard cold answers. My soft sympathetic side, like that of others above, agrees with letting an nine-year-old learn-by-playing until he's able to contribute to the project. Aw gosh, isn't that cute. At the same time, I'm keenly aware that the moment an exemption for nine-year-olds becomes policy, we will suddenly learn that every poorly-behaving user is also nine years old. Among the many things Wikipedia is <b>not</b>, may I suggest we include <i>long-term</i> playground, day-care, or club-house? Everyone starts out new; we extend everyone a few (sometimes quite a few) chances to try things out, experiment, make mistakes, learn by doing. But, what, two years? Four?

<dd>We've asked him several times already and since then he's only racked up more unproductive user space edits but no encyclopedic contributions. Since I warned him to start being more productive on February 20, he's made over 150 edits, only 3 were not to the user space (2 were to the RFC on his user name, 1 was to join the Wikiproject on...Userspaces). He was also warned about 2 weeks ago by Cyde to be more productive. He was also informed of this discussion but has ignored it and continues to edit in his sandbox and other user spaces. So he knows what's expected of him, yet he still continues, so I think that another warning is pointless. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 04:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The conclusion we can draw is that there is no benefit to Wikipedia in banning him, but a possible benefit to letting him be and seeing if he finds something to contribute to at some point. Unless some positive result will come from banning him, this entire thread is just a waste of time.

<dd>On what premises do you draw that conclusion? There is a positive benefit to banning him: we're keeping to policy and not making exceptions for violators. How many warnings do you want to give him? He's had two warnings already to stop, and he knows about this discussion. From a public policy standpoint, there is a potentially high cost to wikipedia to allowing him to stay (dilution of standards) and a relatively low potential benefit with a low probability of benefit over cost. However in regards to banning him, there is a guaranteed benefit of relatively high benefit, at negligible cost with extremely low probability of cost greater than benefit. Thus, a rational leader would block him. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 17:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please refer to <a href="../../../p/a/d/User_talk%7EPadawer_a2cd.html" title="User talk:Padawer">User talk:Padawer</a>. Padawer, who is Q..'s father, has just learned of the block on his son, having apparently been AFK for a few days while we were trying to reach him. He is also, apparently, autoblocked at the moment. I have advised him that since his computer his shared with a 9-year-old minor, someone will e-mail him to get the information required to unblock Padawer, which should be done forthwith, as he's done nothing wrong. I'm useless dealing with autoblocks, so will someone please attend to that.</p>
<p>Once Padawer is able to participate in the discussion, we can figure out what to do next. Personally I suspect the point has been made and if both are unblocked, the two will resume contributing. I certainly see no harm in trying. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:15, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the action on this. However, there does seem to me to be "unfinished business". First of all, the user requested his page was deleted. That seemed to me to resolve one issue, and yet leave unresolved another. It seems that the user has now re-creatde his talk page. Consequently, I wonder if the user has apologised and/or made any promise not to repeat this harrassment? This was one of the issues that <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> mentioned. Without such an undertaking, the good faith of the user and his actions would seem to be still in a state of unresolved uncertainty. I do not say this in any attempt to unecessarily prolong the incident, but I do think until some kind of undertaking is given by this user, it will leave the situation unhelpfully unresolved. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 09:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oops. We're not normally supposed to delete user <i>talk</i> pages (userpages and user subpages are all right) except under special circumstances. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_delete_my_user_and_user_talk_pages.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_delete_my_user_and_user_talk_pages.3F" rel="nofollow">this guideline</a>. One of the reasons is that the user can take advantage of it to disappear a history of warnings, as has apparently happened here. Deskana, was there a special reason? If not, might I suggest, now that the user has returned, that it would be a good idea to recreate the history. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:45, 24 March 2007 (UTC).

<dd>But the main point of my additional comment remains unmentioned: that the user was allowed to return and was apparently unblocked after only a few hours without there being any requirement for undertaking not to repeat the harrassing behaviour nor any requirement for an apology, which <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> (who agreed with me) should be needed. Indeed <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> subsequently added a message to the talk page asking the user for this, but this would now be removed if the talk page is recreated. If so, the request needs to be added again. If not, the new content needs to be appended to the recreated page. The user concerned has returned at least once since asking for his account to be deleted, which had the effect of avoiding having to give any undertaking or apology, until I alerted <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a>. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 19:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was talking to the user via e-mail, attempting to facilitate the unblocking of his IP address, which was autoblocked. I realise now that this wasn't clear to anyone else, but the user did promise me that he'd never do anything like that again. I understand the posting of personal information is a serious "offense" (as it were), but since he's promised never to do it again, and the circumstances of the previous posting weren't extreme, I believe this user should be given a second chance. I understand he's apologised to you now? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana"><small>(talk)</small></a> 15:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Many thanks for sorting it out. Sorry for the misunderstanding, but of course I wasn't aware of your email communications with the user - my apologies. He has aopologized to all involved now, and has also given undertakings not to repeat the activity he did.

<p>Sorry this is long. I posted these originally at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_POLICIES_bb10.html" title="WP:RFC/POLICIES">WP:RFC/POLICIES</a> but I'm told that doing so rarely garners a response because that page is used mostly to "advertise" new proposed guidelines and stuff. I didn't get a response at <a href="../../../p/u/m/WP%7EPUMP_30d8.html" title="WP:PUMP">WP:PUMP</a> either. Things have changed since then, so I've intregrated some updates, and I've tried to link to as many #-spots in talk as seemed useful and relevant without making it look like an ArbCom case.</p>

At both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html#Protect" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">WP:RS talk</a> and in a related, larger thread at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Request_unprotection_of_page" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">WP:ATT talk</a> in which an admin says there is no consensus to impose these full-protects, various parties (self included) challege the blocks as unilateral, lacking consensus and against <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROT_e1a6.html" title="WP:PROT">policy</a> and process, and that disputes about the future of WP:ATT have nothing to do with whether the policies and guidelines that were melded to create WP:ATT, and which have been officially restored to active status, need to be protected from editing. WP:RFPP seem reluctant to get involved on this particular issue, though not some of the related ones below. The issues raised also extend to the protection of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. So, broader input is sought on whether any of these page protections should remain, and whether WP:RS in particular should be unprotected immediately. Admin Centrx (who declined to act against the protection for conflict of interest reasons, because he had just been editing one of the related pages) pointed out in user talk that the protection has gone on for quite some time. It was only "intended to last a day or two at most" according to its imposer. We are now on day three. As the protection wasn't ever anything but one person's preference to begin with (later backed by an unreasonably strident editor (cf. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html#PLEASE_-_NO_CHANGES_RIGHT_NOW" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources#PLEASE - NO CHANGES RIGHT NOW</a>), I ask that these protections be lifted immediately as radically unjustified, especially at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, though the rest of them as well. Whether intentional or not, the protections are serving only one side of the debate, and in the case of RS have thwarted the restoration of removed-without-consensus material from that policypage.</li>

Proponents of WP:ATT of course reject this idea, despite the fact that the first item in the poll is whether the merge has consensus at all, and a later one is whether to mark WP:ATT inactive (i.e. {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistorical_f63d.html" title="Template:Historical">Historical</a>}}.) After <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Request_unprotection_of_page" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">discussion (with no opposition that can explain itself)</a>, the template was added by an admin from <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> who is not a party to the WP:ATT disputes.

No bad faith alleged; I think that there's simply a can't-see-the-forest-for-the-trees problem going on in WP:ATT, and a certain amount of overcontrol (I do not allege <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, as I feel that would in fact be a bad faith claim), which is readily observable on the talk page there and in its edit history (and those of the related poll and community discussion pages, and related policies like <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, etc.) Update: Someone else has separately <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Merge_and_policy_tags" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">called for this tagging</a>.</li>

As with the other template reversion, the repeated deletion of this tag looks to be heading straight into South Central Corewarland. I ask that the page be watched and that reversion of this template (or of {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedpolicy_8817.html" title="Template:Disputedpolicy">Disputedpolicy</a>}} after it is restored) be undone swiftly if it recurs, with discussions engaged in to try to defuse the "revert everything at all costs to protect WP:ATT" attitude that seems to be prevailing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'm not alleging bad faith on anyone's part; I think that everyone involved at WP:ATT on all sides (and there are more than two) wants what is best for Wikipedia, but there is way too much editwarry over-control going on, and abuse of powerful remedies like page full-protection, and treatment of page protection as an admins-only editing haven for establishing a sweeping POV about whether WP:ATT is disputed at all and if so what the nature of the disputes are. I'm getting to where I almost no longer have an opinion on those latter matters because the <i>handling of the situation</i> is far more serious to me than what that handling is trying to "manage". Basically, two or three individuals are exerting an enormous amount of control over all of these pages; they have a significant investment of time and effort into WP:ATT, which I laud them for but which I feel has made them a tad too partisan when it comes to simple matters that have really rather neutral bases, such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROT_e1a6.html" title="WP:PROT">when and why to protect a page</a>, whether to make up inventive new reasons to explain full-prot status instead of using <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">the standard template</a> for this, and avoidance of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedpolicy_8817.html" title="Template:Disputedpolicy">a template</a> that <i>does nothing</i> but let other Wikipedians know that a dispute has arisen and that they might want to <i>participate in its resolution</i> (cf. complaints throughout the relevant talk pages by numerous editors that they felt "blindsided" by the WP:ATT merger in the first place.) The situation is causing secondary disruption as well; editors with legitimate points are not being addressed civilly at times, when their concerns are addressed at all, and are becoming less civil and more strident and argumentative themselves, as they see their issues (some of which I do not agree with myself, just to be clear) ignored and shunted off to archive pages before they are resolved, but meanwhile pretty much <i>ordered</i> not to move their own material from one page to another, among other control-and-spin issues that could be raised, but probably don't need to be at this point. PS: The blocks are also preventing the application of appropriate merge tags, an issue recentlly raised at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">WP:RS talk</a>. Someone else has <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Merge_and_policy_tags" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">raised this concern separately</a>.</p>

These are: a simple textual fix to RS that will make it agree with ATT again, which is something WP:ATT proponents want in the first place and have been insisting <i>is</i> the case but are simply incorrect on that matter because they won't just go <i>look</i>; and merge tags - the entire WP:ATT fiasco happening right now is largely because of the lack of merge tags the first time around.

<p>jossi is definitely revert-warring on the disputedpolicy/policy tag on WP:ATT, which I find really discouraging because it is this kind of intransigence that's led to the whole debate there right now.

<p>I apologize if that is the impression. There is no dispute. See Jimbo's last comment:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I very much support a straw poll. In the meantime, after an excellent discussion with SlimVirgin, we hammered out a compromise until we can have a fuller discussion. What the pages say now is that WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those. My big beef with this merger is that we often need to send people to a page like WP:NOR which explains in a rich and persuasive way what the policy is about and why it is a good idea. This involves sometimes saying things which overlap with parts of WP:V. (They are not the same idea!) The combined page provides a handy way to keep policy consistent and have a tight presentation of what policy actually is. The separate pages can be more detailed and understandable.--Jimbo Wales 21:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see that being a justification for the protection. The above would seem to be a satisfactory conclusion to the problem. I haven't been following along on the talk pages of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion</a> but there seems to be a lot of confusion about what the issues are, mixed with a healthy dose of "a) Why exactly are you pestering everyone on their watchlist about this? Spam is not a good thing. b) Who gives a shit? Policy around here tends to be full of nonsense anyway, we have WP:IAR, and people will continue to act exactly as they do already regardless of what is policy or where is written" and numerous queries of the general sort common to policy talk pages irrelevant to the merge, about "how does policy apply to this article". If no one is edit warring, problems are best solved by "the wiki process" of open editing. Certainly, after 3 days passions could not be so inflamed as to cause heated edit warring, if they were in the first place. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 19:59, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The pages began to descend into chaos, along with the mayhem and controversy on Talk:ATT, before I protected them. I firmly believe that unprotecting them at this time, when we are trying to achieve a modicum of stability to be able to cast votes in the straw poll requested by Jimbo, is wrong. The objects we are voting about should remain as stable as possible so we know what the vote is about. Unprotection now, with heated spirits all around, will lead to even more disruption and chaos than we already have with our core content policies, and will clearly impede the mandated voting process. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:21, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Kingboyk and I thought the time had come to prune the 'pedia of the sixty pages of acutely unfunny vandalism preserved under the general heading of BJAODN. Not remove BJAODN, a collection of genuinely if often unintentionally funny edits, but the 59 subsequent archives. The mechanism we employed was to MfD the current one, because it did not seem worthwhile tagging sixty articles if there was clear consensus. That didn't work: a lot of people think we want to delete all BJAODN (we don't, just prune it down to a rational size); some people want it kept outright as "harmless" or whatever, some say they won't advocate deletion of one, only if the whole lot is bundled. It's a mess. We'd like to know what, of anything, is the best way forward. We are both still of the opinion that keeping copies of many hundreds of decisively atrocious edits, the majority of which do not rise above the level of childish, is probably not worth the server resources committed to it.

<dd>We should just <b>BE BOLD</b> and boldly remove all the unfunny stuff that does not belong there. Perform a merge, clean out all the useless stuff, keep the genuinely funny (1 or 2 pages enough). Make a bold editorial decision. The problem with current BJAODN is that it is not edited in a Wiki manner: anyone can add anything, but then it stays, and no-one bothers to delete what does not belong. That's un-Wiki.

<p>BJAODN is part of a bigger problem that needs to be solved sooner rather than later. That is, most copy and paste merges around the project never include author information. Sure, this information can be found most of the time by doing lots of painful work by hand (checking individual diffs, contrib histories, undeletion logs). Sure, there is pretty much no chance of legal problems. But, it's a problem we should look at. Should we care that most merges are incredibly sloppy? Should we care that pages like BJAODN don't have the author information easily accessible? Should we care about hunting down the many "merge and deletes" that have been done in the past? Should we care about the lost edit history of all the articles edited prior to <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConversion_script_2b4d.html" title="User:Conversion script">User:Conversion script</a>?

<dd>The only reason to care is is we think that there is a moral or legal reason to be concerned over the original contributors' copy-left copyright requirement that their name continue to be associated with their specific contribution in question. So ok, guys speak up. How maay here intend to sue (or claim a moral whatever) if your contibutions to BJAODN are hidden behind page moves? Are you using your real name? Does that make a difference?

<dd>Ugh. I totally agree. I think the vehement bile towards RobertG on his talk page was and is wholly unwarranted. No matter what the outcome of the DRV, a suggestion that a single closure of a CfD nomination should be cause to find "no confindence" in an admin who has closed innumerable discussions is, I would think, ridiculous, to say the very least.

<dd>I'm also not sure why 'deleted' was chosen over 'stubbed' in this case, seeing as there was a reasonable amount of sourced, non-controversial, well-written material. If the Foundation is aware that they're being sued, perhaps we might let their counsel advise us on how to proceed?

<li>I just finished a conversation with Domas a guideline/rule of thumb dont deltete pages with more than 5,000 revisions. if a page has that many revs, as the developers to do it directly on the servers, otherwise we could risk crashing the servers. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 14:26, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's good to know. I'd hate to be responsible for a server crash. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 14:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are entirely missing the point. The concern is not the sandbox page itself, which is regularly raked and does not require attention, but the <i>sub-pages below it</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually I was once informed by a developer (and it makes perfect sense) that the number of incoming links to a page (i.e. the number of pages which must be re-cached to change the colore from blue to red when a page is deleted, and vice versa if/when it is restored) is a much more significant factor in self-inflicted <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial-of-service.html" title="Denial-of-service">denial-of-service</a> attacks, such as deletion of the sandbox (linked to from the talk page of virtually every IP address that has ever edited) or of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> (which I'd estimate is linked to from at least 40% of all articles). For more situational humor of this kind, see <a href="../../../7/3/1/Image%7E7312_deleted_edits.png.html" title="Image:7312 deleted edits.png">Image:7312 deleted edits.png</a>. Deleting the USA article (accidentially, due to two admins reversing a pagemove at the same time) caused prolonged failure, but the deletion of <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> (and selective restoration of —zOMG — 36,283 edits) caused no problem at all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 08:43, Mar. 27, 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>How does User:Lcnj have a block in 2006, when the account was created in 2007? The reason I ask is because I don't believe that the account was created in 2007. I believe this account has been around for a long time, but the user contributions have been blanked or lost somehow.

<dd>In fairness, these official photographs are considerably superior to most of the free use ones that hypothetically can be obtained, if a Wikipedian happens to be in the right place at the right time to take the right photo. Would it not make sense for someone to communicate with the Canadian House of Commons to obtain proper authorization to use their photos of MPs rather than hope that someone is in the position to obtain a photo? For that matter, it might make sense to make similar overtures to the legislative bodies of other countries/states/provinces etc. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 19:56, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Following the debacle when <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Thorpe_4ecd.html" title="Ian Thorpe">Ian Thorpe</a> was the featured article a couple days ago, when it was discovered the image was a copyvio, we ended up with no image on the main page for much of the day.

Obviously, this is suboptimal but it doesn't look like any <i>attempt</i> to serious vet the image for the main page is carried out in advance.</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_TFA_pics_42ed.html" title="User:Nilfanion/TFA pics">table in my userspace</a> analysing this months and was extremely disappointed with what I found. 10 of the 30 articles for this month have images selected with which I am not totally confident. I have been overly cautious with that figure, but speaking as an experienced Commons admin I'd say about 4 of those images should be deleted. I think this is an indicator that action is needed, this month is likely pretty typical (I've also posted to <a href="../../../t/f/a/WT%7ETFA_e795.html" title="WT:TFA">WT:TFA</a>, not sure where else to mention).
