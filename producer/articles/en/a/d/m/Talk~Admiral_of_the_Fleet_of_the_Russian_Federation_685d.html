<dd>This article is based on U.S. Army and Navy comparative ranks files which establishes that Russia has a five star naval rank which may be used during time of war. Also, since there is an insignia for the position (as is shown on the page), stands to reason there would be a 5 star naval rank.

<dd>I'm sorry, but I fail to understand how artist's drawing in a research work can be the evidence here. I can design an insignia for a Grand Fleet Admiral of the Russian Federation if you wish, something with a nice double big Nakhimov stars layout - would it make this rank into existance as well?

<dd>I only say it would make sense that a 5 star rank would be on the books in case of a war or national emergency. I'm not disputing that the Russian military has no such rank at present, but only that the info from the U.S. armed forces states that such a rank is plausable much like the U.S. five star versions. Of course, I won't deny that Russian data is more accurate that U.S. data. But is it really the case that Russia now <i>does not have</i> a five star Admiral rank? -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 23:30, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm actually leaning towards your sources. It just seems very strange no more 5 star naval rank. if the article does get deleted, one on the four star fleet admiral should be created. I ask for clarification on the burning question here: If Russia became involvoed in a major war would they create a five star rank? I think thats what the U.S Amry was getting at when they published the rank chart. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 23:47, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it does seem strange that supreme rank for both Army and Navy is Marshal. What more can I say? Seems like the naval rank was lost in the process of transition from the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Army_7542.html" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a> to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation_2205.html" title="Armed Forces of the Russian Federation">Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</a>. However, it would only made even more confusion if this rank existed. And no, the rank will not be automatically created at wartime, becase there's no provisions for this in any law. Nothing prevents it from being introduced in the future, even at wartime, but for now it simply just does not exist. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 10:07, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't trust collector sites because they can easily be fooled. I once had to dissappoint a retired Scotland police sergeant who was very proud of his very special "KGB badge", which turned out to be a road police badge instead. I believe the insignia pictured is either fake or maybe it's some preliminary design made for future reference but abandoned afterwards.</dd>

First, here <a href="http://www.tridentmilitary.com/Soviet.Uniforms.II.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tridentmilitary.com/Soviet.Uniforms.II.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tridentmilitary.com/Soviet.Uniforms.II.htm</a> they're making no distinction between Admiral of the Fleet (one big <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakhimov.html" title="Nakhimov">Nakhimov</a> star) and Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union (even bigger star with Soviet Coat of Arms). This can be attributed to the fact that many Admirals of the Fleet were promoted to Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union upon retirement, so they just didn't encounter this particular insignia yet. Second, Soviet-like one-star design for Admiral of the Fleet (as well as for General of the Army where it the star accompanied by yet another smaller star in wreath) was used until 1997, but then it was changed to four inline stars for both ranks, while they claim one-star design is the current one.

<dd>You have me convinced that there is no <i>active</i> rank as this in the Russian military. But, I truely wonder if there were a situation where Russia got involoved in a major conflict, and other nations started appointing 5 star admirals (as was the case in WWII), would there not be some provision where a Fleet Admiral of the Russian Federation could be appointed? The U.S. Army seems to think so, which is where the graphic above came about. I do not dispute <b>any</b> of the info above, it is quite informative. Perhaps, instead of deleting the article, merely modify to speak that this is a hypothetical rank that came about after the breakup of the USSR, it does not yet exist, but <i>could</i> exist if Russia ever got into a major war requiring 5 star appointments. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 13:48, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You don't give up, do you? ;) Again, this rank is not being inactive until wartime like <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Admiral_%28US%29_b12a.html" title="Fleet Admiral (US)">Fleet Admiral (US)</a>, it didn't "came out" of anywhere or was proposed by anyone, it just <b>does not exist</b>. And I really doubt that creating more ranks would be the top priority for Russian government in wage of major war.</dd>
<dd>Russian rank of Admiral of the Fleet can already be considered equivalent to OF-10 grade - not by the number of "stars" but by responsibility, because there's no OF-6 ("1-star") rank equivalent to Commodore/Rear Admiral (LH) in Russian Navy and similar positions would be occupied by Captains or, less common, Rear Admirals (see <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_officer_ranks.html" title="Naval officer ranks">Naval officer ranks</a>). There are very few nations that have OF-10 ranked officers on active duty anyway, besides some <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_%28Royal_Navy%29_1bff.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)">Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)</a>, so the balance is already there. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 12:48, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added the "disputed" tag to the article which is what I feel should have been done before this was nominated for VFD. The VFD is at a standstill with one keep vote, one delete, one abstain, and one merge. I also did some digging and found a hardcopy U.S. Navy message, issued from <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Naval_Personnel_752c.html" title="Bureau of Naval Personnel">Bureau of Naval Personnel</a> in 1996 which reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"That no five star admiral rank currently exists in the Russian Federation however provisions remain in place for the appointment of a Russian Fleet Admiral in the event of a major war, prolonged conflict, or national emergency."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The message isnt listed on the Bupers webpage due to its age (I looked) but I was able to find it in my admin files. It is interesting, it speaks of a five star rank but doesnt actually use the term Fleet Admiral of the Russian Federation. I wonder if thats how this got started with the Army publishing what they did. For the record, that PDF file is part of an overseas screening packet for personnel stationed at diplomatic postings in Russia. Its pretty offical so has some merit. It is of interest, though, that the Russian sources say no but the US sources say yes. I will bow to the Russian sources but still hold that this rank could possibly exist. VFD is not a good diea, but I see nothing wrong with the dispute tag. I strongly recommend keeping this article. There's just too much out there about it to summarily delete. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 13:47, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I ask again - what's the use of keeping references to a hypothetical rank that was (mistakenly) assumed to be inherited from <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_of_the_Soviet_Union_59fd.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union">Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union</a> and that <b>could possibly be created in case something major happens</b> at best, where <i>something major</i> is as likely as full-scale alien invasion? Yes the insignia is cool looking but it still makes little sense to me... --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 21:47, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since this has some basis in other sources like US Army documentation (which may in turn be purely speculative), why not just explain its uncertain nature more clearly, and let it stand? Otherwise, this could be rolled into <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Admiral_%28Russia%29_8fd6.html" title="Fleet Admiral (Russia)">Fleet Admiral (Russia)</a> (or is that <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_%28Russia%29_1c16.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet (Russia)">Admiral of the Fleet (Russia)</a>), and mentioned in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_of_the_Soviet_Union_59fd.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union">Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshal_of_the_Russian_Federation_a6ef.html" title="Marshal of the Russian Federation">Marshal of the Russian Federation</a>. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a> <small>2005-08-4 16:22 Z</small></i></p>

<p>First I want to explain that russian military has deck ranks (not navy ranks), which are used only by deck personnel of the navy and maritime units of the border guard. All other naval personnel, which includes naval infantry, naval medical service, coastal service and others use all-forces ranks (not exact translation of the term, but close one), which is universal for both the armed forces of the Russian Federation and other paramilitary services. So maybe for this reason Russia has no deck equivalent of rank of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshal_of_the_Russian_Federation_a6ef.html" title="Marshal of the Russian Federation">Marshal of the Russian Federation</a>, which is an all-forces rank (not an army rank), however it could have marshal insignia designed for naval uniform. --<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimaY2K_a524.html" title="User:DimaY2K">DimaY2K</a> 14:37, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This makes a perfect sense now. I'm sorry for the incorrect translation of "корабельные" as "maritime ranks", where "deck" would be more appropriate of course. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 19:41, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
