<p>I have undeleted it. The decision belongs with the TfD and nowhere else. unilaterally deleting something while votes are going on is an <b>outrageous</b> abuse of power. Unlike there are legal reasons why it must be deleted immediately or it is seriously deficient in a major way (eg, major error in formating, copyright issues, etc) a template should not deleted until a vote has been taken. It is disturbing that people would try to in effect highjack a vote by deleting a page in advance. It needs to be there for users to see it when voting. Deleting it before a vote has concluded is a gross abuse and little short of vandalism. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:46, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have had to undelete the page for a second time. This is absurd. What the hell has got into a handful of users??? It seems that we have an outbreak of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">popeitis</a>, with some users deciding that they, and not the community, can decide on the issue. Some people may believe that the pope is infallible. But few people that admins posess the same ability. Frankly if vandals behaved the way some have behaved in unilaterally deleting templates I'd have no hesitation in banning them. I'm surprised and disappointed that Tony and Zoe have stooped to such behaviour.

<p>Incredible. Sidaway came back after being unblocked by another user and did it <b>again</b>. I've blocked him again. Because I don't think the above block was an actual breach of 3RR (he had done 3RRs to an original move, not four) I've only made it a 24 hour block. As I did the block I'm not doing the undelete. Someone else if they wish can do that. After his antics tonight Sidaway has plummeted in my estimation. He grossly abused his position to highjack a vote. I have lost count of the number of what were IMHO stupid decisions on the TFD but highjacking a vote by preempting it like that is a big no-no. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:52, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>just let it sit through tfd. it's a userspace template, ffs, I agree these are getting out of hand, but so far nobody objected to users voicing their political leanings on their own userpages. take a step back, people, edit-warring admins is a sad sight, but why Tony would jeopardize his adminship over a userspace template saying "we don't like GWB" is beyond me. Everybody is still free to say "I don't like GWB" on their userpages, <i>manually</i>, so what's the point. The problem with these templates (as with the "Wikipedians who" categories) is that they are not cleanly separated from article namespace. That's a <i>generic</i> problem unrelated to the GWB case. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At last count, after several more iterations all 'round, TS unblocked, and template restored.

<p>No hassle. The blocks didn't have effect for more than a few minutes and I hope you've now all toddled off to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, the talk page of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and er, well. edits <i>here</i> earlier today, where you'll find that I was acting on a substantial consensus to delete attack pages. Now we're all in the loop we go through more iterations.</p>
<p>Currently there <i>is</i> a page at Template:User GWB but it doesn't attack Bush and it doesn't incite vandalism on our article about Bush. It only disparages vandalism of that article, which is what the original author claims it was intended to do all along. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:30, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"no hassle" to <i>you</i>, maybe, but another blow to the battered "admins should behave above par" principle. "I was acting on substantial consensus" is <i>never</i> an excuse for edit warring, let alone 3RRvio, since if you were, there would have been plenty of other people willing to do the job for you. (un)delete once, or twice at most, then step down and let others deal with it. I don't care about the stupid template, just show some <i>countenance</i> when using admin privileges. [btw, "attack pages" are usually against Wikipedians; it is news to me that GWB is a Wikipedian, and/or it is news to me that NPA extends to politicians or religious figureheads] <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:32, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not aware of ever having edit warred. Policy was apparently changed without discussion to make 3RR apply to administrator actions--not something I have a problem with, though I find it unnecessary given the quick resolution of such scuffles as we often have. Blocking was entirely appropriate, the situation was resolved amicably and no harm was done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the template, it really strikes me as disingenuous to say that it isn't a personal attack because the subject is not known to be an editor. Wikipedia shouldn't be in the business of facilitating attacks on <i>anybody</i>, ever. It's an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the template is deleted in the middle of a vote, not-admins cannot see it and have a harder time casting an informed vote. Repeatedly deleting this during the vote is rather discourteous, I must say. I personally don't like this userbox or many of the other non-language ones, but repeated out-of-process deletions do have a negative impact on community spirit, and it is the community that builds the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 15:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will soon provide a list of anon accounts which revert warred at several articles following Bonaparte with deceiving summaries like "rv test" or "phrase from the article". I remember Chinese, Taiwanese, Australian and US ip addresses. When <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikkalai_3580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikkalai">contribs</a>) was reverting them, the newbie admin <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ronline_9706.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ronline">contribs</a>) blocked Mikka and Mikka is still not editing because he seems like lost hope that WP may function.</p>
<p>The matter should be addressed quickly and decisively. If sockpuppet/IP farm used for revert-warring with the goal to provoke the opponents into 3 RR with a "friendly" or just clueless admin from a 3RR board placing a block is simply a fraud, using socks to derail an adminship nomination is a fellony, so to speak. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 01:41, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

If anything, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> should have been smart enough to not fall into the trap of doing four reverts in three hours; those were not vandalism he was reverting; it may have been propaganda/biased wording, but not vandalism.

It is good for you to say "thanks god he's gone" now, but where all you've been when I was single-handedly fighting him? I asked several Romanians to talk Bonaparte to senses.

<dd>I concur. I was myself blocked when fending off attacks by Bonaparte's socks, as he logged out to eschew violating 3RR. It was just impossible to persuade admins that my actions were not vandalism.

<dd>Thank you for inviting me to participate in this discussion. You stated above that you were unable "to persuade admins that [your] actions were not vandalism." On the contrary, no admin accused you of vandalism. You violated the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">three-revert rule</a>, regardless of other editors' actions. We now know that another user committed far worse policy violations, but that doesn't excuse your behavior. You had just reported a 3RR violation on the part of Anittas (blocked at exactly the same time as you), so you obviously were well aware of its existence. But again, had you contacted me via e-mail or your talk page, apologizing for your infraction and promising to edit responsibly, I would have unblocked you immediately. Instead, you evaded your block via an anonymous IP address (and disrupted a project page). Incidentally, you never answered my question regarding your claim that I am "not neutral." Were you implying that I'm biased against Russian people? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 18:24, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My favorite expression for this relationship is pet trolling, a neologism I coined in conjunction with a different fellow of another Eastern European wiki-community. If this term gains usage, there may appear an article under this pet troll so far red link. I repeatedly called on established Romanian editors to deal with this person who placed the shame on the entire community to no avail. I was surprized by lack of condemnation and tolerant attitude from <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a>. The fellow was called "just misguided" sometimes but not a signle time he was condemned by the community which should have been ashamed by such a representation. I don't want to overgeneralize here. Some Romanian editors did agree with me that the issue had to be addressed but not those who Bonaparte claims to be his role models.

<dd>I see little reason to unblock Bonaparte. While I haven't particuarly been in a dispute with him, I've been in a position to observe his editing at length, and he has never shown the slightest sign of understanding, let alone following, the NPOV policy. He's been a key part of the recent massive flareup on Moldovan topics, and had made very little, if any, beneficial edits. This sockpuppetry is a new low, though, and I think gives us plenty of justification to block him permanently. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 02:33, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The monster case against another obvious disruptor is going for months and we still do not have a formal ArbCom decision to undo the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AndriyK_Evidence_42ae.html#Move_fraud" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AndriyK/Evidence">bad faith redirects</a>, even though the ArbCom votes are <i>leaning</i> to undo them, judging by the votes already cast.</dd>

<dd>My candid reaction would be "good riddance" (in addition to all the above, his idea of "mediation" seems to be more in line with "content dictator"). To be scrupulously fair, though, I doubt he'd be banned <i>forever</i> by the arbcom, so a block of on the order of a month might be preferable.

<dd>As a mediator, he showed zero understanding of the term "mediation" and zero desire to learn. I was a little clearer in my criticism of him than perhaps was completely polite, I basically told him he was being a disruptive element and to stop - and why he voted <i>for</i> me on my Rfa is beyond me.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive64_c3c6.html" title="Edit section: SlimVirgin unblocking 'Fair Use' blocks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SlimVirgin unblocking 'Fair Use' blocks</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday, I noticed a blatant 'fair use' violation on <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESansvoix_3bd6.html" title="User:Sansvoix">User:Sansvoix</a>'s userpage. He had redirected his userpage to an earlier version (in the history) to circumvent the removal of a 'fair use' tagged image, and display it on his page. Looking at his talk page, I noticed a number of warnings and policy explanations (by Gmaxwell and others), and reference to the <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> policy. So I blocked him for 24 hours - with a note saying I would lift the block if he indicated an agreement to abide by policy. I was met only with his legal arguments on copyright, so the block remained.</p>
<p>Some hours later, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> undid the block, with the summary: <i>There is no basis in policy for this block</i>. She did not discuss this with me, although I was on-line, but did inform me by e-mail. She indicated her ignorance of the law and status of the image, but her view that <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a> had been 'bullying' her and <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESansvoix_3bd6.html" title="User:Sansvoix">User:Sansvoix</a>.</p>
<p>Not finding this acceptable, I reapplied the block. Explaining to Slim my reasons, my disappointment at her lack of discussion, and inviting her bring the matter here if she still disagreed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=34738502&amp;oldid=34685493" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=34738502&amp;oldid=34685493" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Instead of that, she undid the block again, and suggested that I was acting at Gmaxwell's behest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoc_glasgow&amp;diff=34761157&amp;oldid=34758296" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoc_glasgow&amp;diff=34761157&amp;oldid=34758296" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. (I have never in my wiki-life interacted with Gmaxwell AFAIK). She also suggested that the image in question might be pd, and at any rate the user seemed to believe it was.</p>
<p>This isn't primarily a moan at Slim (although her recent complaints about others undoing her blocks, see a bit rich. And she seems too personally involved with the parties involved to be acting as an admin on this issue - that's why I suggested that she brought it here.). My questions for fellow admins are. 1) Are copyright blocks policy? 2) Can images tagged as fair use be used if the user disputes the status? 3) Was I wrong to block or reblock this user?.</p>
<p>I realise we are developing rules on this as we go along - so I'm happy to be guided. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 16:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Policy is what we do. The policy that is written down often poorly represents actual policy. It's written as we go. The block sounds completely sensible to me, as copyright is a very important isseu. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 16:45, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2)Personally, (IANAL), but I figure that unless the image is clearly under a free license, editors can't decide to have it on their userpage. If there is no source on the image <i>proving</i> that it is free, especially in cases of PD assertion, then I'm inclined to insist on a source, tag as a {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_license_827d.html" title="Template:No license">no license</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/u/i/Template%7EPUI-disputed_3274.html" title="Template:PUI-disputed">PUI-disputed</a>}} in the meantime and remove from userspace in the interim.

<dd>I've been seeing Fair Use messages on SlimVirgin's talk page, as if she is involved in a dispute about use of "fair use" images on her User page.

<dd>The user was sufficiently warned; I don't see why the block shouldn't stand, at least until the user agrees not to keep reverting the page or placing other unfree images on it. <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> states "Fair use images should only be used in the article namespace. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. This is because it is the policy of the Wikimedia Foundation to allow an unfree image only if no free alternative exists and only if it significantly improves the article it is included on. All other uses, even if legal under the fair use clauses of copyright law, should be avoided to keep the use of unfree images to a minimum." As Splash notes, Jimbo has stated that we can and should block for this. If the user agrees not to place any more unfree images on his/her userpage, it can be lifted. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 16:59, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The offending image (<a href="../../../l/i/t/Image%7ELittleprince-businessman.jpg_2685.html" title="Image:Littleprince-businessman.jpg">Image:Littleprince-businessman.jpg</a>) is, in fact, considered to be in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> in Canada. (See <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_situations_by_country_2b3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright situations by country">Wikipedia:Copyright situations by country</a> for details.) It is <i>not</i>, however, considered PD in the United States. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34691164" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34691164" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the page with the offending image, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34692076" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34692076" rel="nofollow">here</a> it is without it.</p>
<p>In order for the block to be valid, we would have to assume two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>. . .that if a user places an image on his userpage that is PD in his own country, but copyrighted in the U.S., he can be blocked for this.
<dl>
<dd>That sounds a little fishy to me. I'm not sure I agree with this. Maybe, but I'm not yet convinced.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>. . .that there is a legal difference between showing a "fair use" image in an article, and showing a fair use image in a history page for an article.
<dl>
<dd>Legally, it would seem to me that this is invalid. For example, let's say I added a picture of a TV show character to my user page. This would probably not be a fair use of the image. If I then removed it, would the violation be removed? You can still see the page in the page history. If the copyright holder wanted to sue, I'm not sure it would make any difference whether the image was "removed" or not. Either way, Wikipedia is hosting a viewable violation. This is troubling, since a solution would require either a change in Wikipedia's fair use policy or a software modification, and I think this is an area that could be better debated elsewhere. So I'll skip this one.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>. . .that it is a blockable offense for me to link to a previous version of a page if that page contains a copyright violation.
<dl>
<dd>Again, this sounds fishy to me. By linking to the previous version of the page in question, above, am I violating policy? I don't see how it could be acceptable for Wikipedia to host the page history and allow people to see it, but unacceptable for someone to link to it.</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<p>In conclusion, Doc, I would say you <i>might</i> have been justified by re-instating the block. But given Slim's personal request, it would have been more <i>civil</i> of you to discuss it here first. (As an aside, Doc, it sounds like you're saying that your reversion of Sansvoix's page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34692076" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sansvoix&amp;oldid=34692076" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and blocking of him was unrelated to Gmaxwell's admonition<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASansvoix&amp;diff=34690311&amp;oldid=34674207" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASansvoix&amp;diff=34690311&amp;oldid=34674207" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> that "you may not use fair use images on your user page.

<p>As an addendum, the blocking policy quotes Jimbo as saying "such activities", but doesn't say what he was referring to. He was referring to the case of *drew copying text from IMDB into Wikipedia. That is a clear case: the text was obviously copyrighted; "fair use" text isn't allowed on Wikipedia; and the text would not have been appropriate <i>anywhere</i> on Wikipedia. In this case, none of the three apply. The image was not considered copyrighted in Canada, an obvious source of doubt; fair-use images are allowed in Wikipedia (so long as they are actually used fairly); and the image is used legally on the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Prince_3b04.html" title="Little Prince">Little Prince</a> page. For all these reasons, this is not a clear-cut case, and it is arguable whether Jimbo's admonition about "such activities" applies. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless you mean something obscure, "fair use" text is "allowed" on Wikipedia. We claim "fair use" whenever we quote copyrighted material, from books, song lyrics, etc. This just doesn't tend to get controversial until somebody reproduces an entire work, like the IMDB instance, which is the equivalent of reproducing an entire image. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:44, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've explained to Doc Glasgow why I lifted the block, once by e-mail and once on his user page. Gmaxwell has been (as I see it) bullying a number of users, myself included, about images on their user pages, including threatening to block them, though I can't find his name on the admin list. I don't want to get involved in the fair-use debate, because I know nothing about it, but whatever the rights and wrongs, editors shouldn't be bullied and harassed about images, but should be approached with civility. Gmaxwell was very rude to me, and Sansvoix spoke out on my behalf. Because of that, Gmaxwell turned his attention to Sansvoix and removed an image from his page too that Sansvoix believed was PD. Whatever the status of the image, removing it looked vindictive because the two of them were in dispute, and so Gmaxwell should have asked someone else to look at it. When Doc Glasgow removed another image, Sansvoix assumed he was acting on behalf of Gmaxwell, and Sansvoix responded by redirecting his user page to an earlier version with the image on it, for which he was blocked.</p>
<p>The whole situation is the result of a nasty dynamic started by Gmaxwell's (in my view) unnecessary aggression, and I ask that everyone involved try to resolve it without recourse to blocks. Sansvoix appears to have left because of it, though I hope he'll reconsider, I am close to leaving myself, and I know of a third editor who has been subjected to the same treatment by Gmaxwell, who I fear may consider going too.</p>
<p>This aggression over fair-use images has to stop, especially in cases where there is room for doubt and the editors are acting in good faith. Whatever Jimbo has said about images, I don't believe he would approve of the way this has been dealt with.

<dd>Well, if you think Gmaxwell is being incivil in his dealing with fair use images on userpages, that's one thing; take it up with him. But if a user absolutely refuses to remove fair use images from their userpages, they shouldn't be allowed to edit their userpages. This is a question both of legal culpability, and moral concerns associated with stealing other people's property.

<dd>I can certianly suggest cases where the use of such images might well be legal under US copyright law. Most of thes uses that people have made of such images on user pages probably do not so qualify, however. In any case, current foundation policy bars such use <b>even if legal</b>, which means that the queation of what the law permits is of only limnited relevance -- the first question is what our policy permits and what it should permit. Obviously we should not permit illegal actions, but we are not at all required to permit every action that is legal or that might arguably be legal. Vandalism, andf PoV editing is legal, but we forbid it. (By the way someone above said that there is no "fair use" text on wikipedia. That is simply incorrect. Every time that an article quotes a book in disccusing it, that quote is used under fair use. Much the same applies to most quotes from sources. There are probably hundreds of times as many instances of text being used under fair use as ther are of images. But since such fair use is obviously appropriate and is unlikely to lead to leagal action, no issue has been made of it.) <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:15, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to say I find the actions SlimVirgin has taken here <b>very</b> hypocritical given that I also unblocked a user twice, and she has accused me of "wheel warring" a number of times (for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33669145" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33669145" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Given that she's recently started a discussion on the administrators' noticeboard talk page about <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_5257.html#Undoing_other_admins.27_blocks" title="Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard">undoing other admins' blocks</a> without discussion, where she argued "<i>it's damaging if every block is likely to be undone</i>" and categorically stated "<i>my own policy if I disagree with a block is to try to persuade the blocking admin to undo it, but otherwise not to interfere</i>", it greatly surprised me to see she unblocked Sansvoix - not once but twice, fitting her own definition of wheel warring - without discussion. I argued on the discussion to assume good faith in contributors and to unblock if in doubt. To repeat SlimVirgin's comments back at her, in a beautifully ironic coincidence, I'm glad to see that SlimVirgin has seen the error of her ways.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 19:00, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The way I see it, blatant copyright infrinment (i.e copying a text verbatim and creating an article) is grounds for a block (after warning), however, fair use images seem a bit more dubious to me. Yes, it probably isn't fair use to use the image in the userspace, but IMO, that is up for debate. I think there needs to be a community wide vote on what specific rules we have on fair use images in the userspace and what type of punishments we can impose on those who violate them. Until that happens, I think all fair use releated blocks, including yours Doc, are wrong. -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregAsche_4f25.html" title="User:GregAsche">Greg Asche</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGregAsche_1ed6.html" title="User talk:GregAsche">(talk)</a> 02:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Turns out I have got some time today, and having done some more research into it, I agree that AfD is the way to go as the term is a neologism (and, incidentally, all four of the disambig page items were erroneous). -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 18:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, so what I'm beginning to understand that nobody actually <i>does</i> anything here. May I request an outlet in which people actually block disruptive users relatively quickly?

<dd>You mention to Jkelly "to stay out of it" if he isn't familliar with the topic, noting that it isn't "whether or not the source existed, it was regarding the credibility of it." But, like Jkelly, most admins are not familliar with the subject. Then you say "I'm beginning to understand that nobody actually <i>does</i> anything here". That does not strike you as somewhat contradictory? <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:09, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Basically there is no such place. If the matter is not worth those steps, and it is a content dispute rather than vandalism, there is nothing in the blocking policy that justifies a block, and no one is likely to impose one. Of course if you convince any particular admin that a block for "disruptive editing" is justified, there you are. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:50, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright. So there is no policy for blocking users who insert maliciously distortional information repeatedly short of arbitration, which would not be accepted because of the minor nature of the incident. <a href="../../../c/j/k/User%7ECJK_f43b.html" title="User:CJK">CJK</a> 23:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gang Stalking should *NEVER* have been considered for deletion. It is absolutely essential to Wikipedia to have something about that. The piddly little piece on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> for Wikistalking is thoroughly inadequate.</p>
<p>Sure, we can sit around here and debate policy, and say that "the people spoke" and that it was deleted with consensus, etc etc, but the reality is that it never should have been deleted in the first place. Just look at Wikipedia's pathetic articles on <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalking</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberbullying.html" title="Cyberbullying">cyberbullying</a> and how little attention that Wikipedia gives to this important subject. It is especially important in the context of an online community, which Wikipedia is.</p>
<p>What we should be doing is debating about what to include and so forth. It shouldn't ever have been deleted. It shouldn't have been nominated for deletion even. And it should be undeleted. This shouldn't even be a question.</p>
<p>We talk about putting process ahead of content, but this is a case where we've really totally blown it. We sit around deleting user boxes and banning users on a hunch and being totally untransparent with things like that, yet we sit around here worrying about whether or not an absolutely essential article about an incredibly relevant topic should have a part here.</p>
<p>If we are building an encyclopaedia, Gang Stalking belongs. If we are trying to be a community, Gang Stalking belongs. But if we are trying to be a place that is so full of rules that it misses the point, then delete it.</p>
<p>At a bare minimum put the darn thing on to Deletion Review already, and give it a chance, rather than this ridiculousness. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 03:43, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
