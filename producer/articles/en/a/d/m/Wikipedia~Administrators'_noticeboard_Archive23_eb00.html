<p>Agreed. Lets clear this intersection people, so that things can get back to normal. Really appreciate the assisstance.

<p>Martial Law, that "article" was dated December 17.

<p>Who accepts awards for all of the Wikipedians, and how do I present them&#160;? Wanted to present Wikipedia one earlier for assissting me in quashing one rumor.

<li>There was never any "rumor" that needed to be "quashed". I don't think you need to present Wikipedia with an award for quickly and correctly determining that Jimbo is, in fact, alive. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 03:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He seems to be angry and have added his view points rant style onto various discussion pages.

<p>Recently JesseW reverted my adding of no source to <a href="../../../j/a/i/Image%7EJainism_logo.png_2577.html" title="Image:Jainism logo.png">Image:Jainism logo.png</a>. Now, I am not exactly sure of his reasoning other than thinking that the interwiki was the source (it is in fact not, as they got it from EN) so I reverted. It has no source only an assertion of it being a logo. Reading over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JesseW" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JesseW" rel="nofollow">his contributions</a> I see that he has been doing it to a bunch of other seals/logos. I just want this clarified since another wheel war will not serve this place too well.

<dd>I am beginning to believe that it is soon going to be impossible to delete any list at all, however obviously unencyclopaedic. Look at list of SWIFT codes - there are over 17,000 potential entries to that list, of which just over 300 are listed - which is rather less than my quick count of the number that <i>changed</i> in the December update published on the BIC website. There is an authoritative online lookup tool linked in <a href="../../../s/w/i/SWIFT_code_ad77.html" title="SWIFT code">SWIFT code</a>, and people still said "keep, useful list" for this randomly selected list of under 2% of codes, with absolutely no guarantee of accuracy.

<dd>Well, in my view, the way it is set up now is that what the consensus (and rather if there is not a consensus to delete) of people deem <i>useful</i> stays. Note the emphasis on useful - as it may not be one's definition of encyclopedic - of course, everyone's definition of the word seems slightly different.

<p>As some of you may already know <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> appears to have quit Wikipedia, mostly related to some conflicts (most of which he seems not to want to characterize as conflicts) with several Romanian contributors. It is not clear yet whether his departure is permanent.</p>
<p>On his "way out the door" he deleted the entire history of his user page. For the moment, in this case, I think it is best left that way: from remarks he's made on his talk page, I think that leaving things lie for a while is the most likely course for him to possibly come back. However, this got me wondering: in general, is it acceptable for an admin to remove the history of their user page? I'm a little concerned about the precedent; especially if he does come back, I would hope that would be restored. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:41, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What Phil said. Admins can delete others' talk pages, but only on request, and only if they judge there's nothing potentially relevant/needed there.

<p>Moving a talk page can have almost the same effect as deleting it. Doing so turns the unarchived pagelink red again, effectively clears the apparent edit history, and makes the moved talk page hard to find unless it's clearly linked somewhere. Yet I believe that moving talk pages to archive them is an accepted practice. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 18:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but those are not steps that one would ordinarily engage in when placing a warning on a user talk page.

<p>User:Bumpusmills1 is a new user whom I have worked with in an attempt to teach him Wikipedia guidelines, manners, and so on. To his credit he is trying to learn. Unfortunately, he was a bit abrasive at first and stirred up some vandals and such, including anonymous editors User:68.45.146.191, User:199.216.98.66 and User:216.13.219.229 who placed User:Bumpusmills1's personal contact info on User:Bumpusmills1's user page and threatened him. (Examples of these threats are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABumpusmills1&amp;timestamp=20060103005949" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABumpusmills1&amp;timestamp=20060103005949" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABumpusmills1&amp;timestamp=20060103005123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABumpusmills1&amp;timestamp=20060103005123" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, although there are more examples in the history.) It appears these anonymous users are sock puppets.</p>
<p>To cut to the chase, User:Bumpusmills1 e-mailed me and asked me to remove this info b/c he fears for his safety and the safety of his family. As a temporary measure I deleted his user page then recreating it, thus making the history with the contact info only available to admins. I have also blocked thse anonymous users for one month because of this threat. Is there a way to remove the deleted history pages with User:Bumpusmills1's personal information on it so no one can view it? Also, can anyone help me figure out if these anonymous users are a Wikipedia editor (which is highly likely) and identify them?

<p>A 48-hour block was put in place last time, I believe this is a static IP and it's certainly got no other edit history, so what are the chances of a permanent block as damage-limitation? Last time the vandal carried of for a week or more, using various dynamic IPs as well, which I and others will have to watch for and revert, but this one at least should be fixable. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so, as that's no longer in your userspace. See how the link doesn't begin with <i>User</i>, instead beginning with <i>Category</i>?

The protection of BA does not stop him from starting an account and becoming a real Wikipedia editor. So in other words, we don't have to unprotect BA in order for him to get an account and edit Wikipedia as a real contributor. So this request is a naked attempt for him to get access to the article again.

The reason why no edits appear for the other two IPs is that all of their edits were deleted when Alabamaboy deleted Bumpusmills1's user page. Unfortunately, there's no way to know if GNAA Staos was using those IPs, although I doubt it as his IPs are on the US East Coast and the other two are both located in or around Vancouver, BC. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 01:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. The edits of the other ISPs were on Bumpusmill1's user page.

All of the ISPs, though, made the same vandalism and threat so they're likely one person. BTW, I deleted and recreated Bumpusmill1's user page at his request so regular users wouldn't have access to his personal contact info.

<dd>Note that deleting the edits removes the IP edit history (meaning we can't find the underlying IP from which a logged in editor made the edit). I don't know if the IPs are restored when the edits are undeleted; perhaps a developer can answer that.

<dd>Didn't know that. Thanks for the info. The user was frantic about removing his personal info and that was the only way to do it short of bring a developer into the game (which seemed unlikely). Just for future reference, should I have deleted the old page to remove the personal info? Seemed like there was no good choice.

<p>He's an admin so I don't want to tangle with him, but something should be done. If you study the reverts he made, they were clearly made against non-vandal edits. For this reason, Gamaliel should not be allowed to flaunt the 3RR simply because he's pushing his own preferred text instead.</p>

<p>After a quiet period, this extremely persistent vandal ("Remington and the Rattlesnakes", "Regara", Luxembourg, etc etc etc) has become active again and completely unmanageable.

Meanwhile, our fundraising proudly boasts that we are now a "top 30" website, but what use is this? If all this means is an ever-increasing server bill, then it's simply a liability. Apparently it doesn't translate into any kind of clout when it comes to dealing with ISPs and getting them to rein in their problem users. If frequent range blocks are the only answer, then so be it.</p>

<dd>That's an AOL IP address, it has nothing to do with the North Carolina vandal (this section). When a registered username is blocked, the underlying IP address is autoblocked. The blocking admin has no way of knowing what that IP address or ISP is, for privacy reasons... we have no way of knowing if a registered username like User:Calcfc77 is an AOL address or not, and it shouldn't make a difference anyway. Indefinite autoblocking of underlying AOL IP addresses is a misfeature of the Mediawiki software... you can try complaining to the developers, but there's nothing that admins can do about it (and there's no way for us to even know about it). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 17:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I am with AOL. I will have to accept that I will be blocked from time to time. Sorry for barging into the North Carolina thing, but there was no other way I could find you.

<dd>We need some way to recognize and mark "users in good standing" who would not be affected by blocks of underlying IPs (this would require a software change). However, this would need to be done manually, not automatically by mere passage of time... that would be a bit labor intensive to be sure, but everything else here is labor intensive (RC patrol, replying to people who get hit by collateral damage). Just like bureaucrats can set a flag to make a user an admin, admins should have the ability to set a flag to make a registered user a "user in good standing" who would not be affected by underlying IP autoblocks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Failing that, the Mediawiki software should internally recognize when an underlying IP address is an AOL address and adjust the autoblock length accordingly. Only the software can do that, admins can't and as mentioned earlier have no way of even knowing. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 17:53, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AOL's proxies are weird. They use different IP addresses when you are editing different pages.

<p>Locke, the PNG version looked better on them - when it was the transparent version. --Sunfazer 14:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It may be your web browser is the problem: I suspect Wikipedia is converting the SVG into a 24-bit transparent PNG. On Internet Explorer, 24-bit transparent PNG's aren't fully supported, and are usually drawn with a neutral background (instead of being blended correctly). I'd suggest getting Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer 7 when it's released (if it's released for pre-Vista users, anyways). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 14:38, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A good way to deal with it would be to add a new "background" parameter to the image transclusion syntax. If it's present, create a non-transparent image with that color as the background; if it's not present, create a transparent image as is currently done. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 21:10, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that is the case, then all of the templates that use the stophand need to be the same color, so nothing funky will happen when I upload the new copy.

<dd>If forced to guess I'd put his 'bad edit to good edit ratio' at about 1 bad to 3 good (out of 19,000+ edits). (Clarification added subsequently - 1 to 3 assuming that every revert and extra edit due to not using preview is counted as 'bad'). If that's 'far too high to help the project' then I think you need to indefinitely block about half the people who have ever contributed here.<br />

The difference is that with a ban, you may not use sockpuppets to evade it. With a block, you can just make a new account and edit from it, in a constructive manner.

<dd>I dislike the concept of indefinite bans for cases such as these, coming from admins outside the Arbitration Committee. I have seen myself some of Pigsonthewing's personal attacks - and he is quite unrepentant in making them, but he might have matured in 6 months; a year; 5 years. I would prefer, if we're going to block him, that we block him for 6 months, if he's still acting in the same fashion, just block him for another 6 months.

<dd>I agree with Talrias; POTW has probably earned a lengthy block, but what's wrong with 6 or 12 months?

<dd>And Pigsonthewing was one of the most constructive encyclopedia builders on this place until a group of admins and their friends decided to harass him and make a series of punitive (and often specious) blocks after he dared to complain about abuse of admin privileges. It is absolutely true that he is no longer acting as a productive user. It is equally true that this was brought about by admins thinking they can block people just because they were "sick of dealing with" them. Admins deciding that they can run roughshod over users they don't like in violation of policies on blocking, civility, and personal attacks turns good contributors into people who hate the entire project. So when you complain about Pigsonthewing not contributing - remember who it was that made him that way. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:18, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Someone obsessed with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bill_cabc.html" title="The Bill">The Bill</a></i> keeps adding misinformation to many articles, claiming various people to be actors from the series, frequently changing the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Quagmire_2062.html" title="Glenn Quagmire">Glenn Quagmire</a> entry too. I think the IPs begin 210.54, 210.55 and 203 in all cases - a range which is far too great to block. I've decided not to semi-protect <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Quagmire_2062.html" title="Glenn Quagmire">Glenn Quagmire</a> because when the edit happens on that article I know to go and revert most of the other edits that IP has made... and it's always an IP with no previous edits. The general pattern is for the same person to add two or three correct(?) entries (usually involving cricket) and then get on with the silliness. This has been going on for well over a month now. How can we stop it? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:00, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it's been going on since May <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Wingett&amp;oldid=14017735" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Wingett&amp;oldid=14017735" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> - though he's been much more insistent lately, to the best of my knowledge. It's also been discussed <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Anon_user_still_creating_new_pages" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">on the village pump</a>, and there's a <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_LTA_e6f4.html#Vegan_vandal" title="WP:VIP/LTA">section for him on the long-term alerts of the Vandalism in Progress page</a>. I've no idea what to do, to be honest; he's been told too many times that we don't like what he's doing, he's been reverted too many times to count, so you'd think that he would just give up. The best solution is to have a look at <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchangeslinked_User%7EStephen_Turner_CricketersTalk_9503.html" title="Special:Recentchangeslinked/User:Stephen Turner/CricketersTalk">Special:Recentchangeslinked/User:Stephen_Turner/CricketersTalk</a> or maybe the history of Quagmire, because his newest edits and hence new IP incarnation usually appear there. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 14:44, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt whether he can be stopped. He also makes talk pages with tiny stubs. Sometimes the IPs are used, again but it's a wide range. The cricket and rugby entries are usually correct and sometimes there are real additions and cleanups of pages as well. The cricket people have decided to let the stubs exists because he'll just recreate them anyhow and at least the basic info is correct.</dd>
<dd>As far as the vandalism goes, it is widespread. The Simpsons, The Bill and Andre 3000 and random vegan statements is the main vandalism, but there is more like very complex name exchanges, songs dedicated to people and mentioned on their grave, feet amputated to be in wheelchairs and much more weird entries often involving multiple people to make the comments consistent when you try to check it by following the wikilinks. Also entries like categorizing politicians as Roman Catholics are done in a random manner.</dd>
<dd>I checked most pages changed by him (at least the ones I could find), most had already been reverted, but some were left. As far as stopping him, it'll be very hard because it's 10 edits and 10 hours later he returns under a different IP. Semi-protect will not work, because the Recent links and pages like List of Vegans are the best way to check where he has been. I recommend tagging the IP talk page so we at least know that the contributions have been checked and reverted. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 00:23, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I came in, saw that <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> was indeed consistent with other, similar article titles covering similar subjects (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_vocabulary.html" title="Spanish vocabulary">Spanish vocabulary</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_vocabulary.html" title="Turkish vocabulary">Turkish vocabulary</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_vocabulary.html" title="Portuguese vocabulary">Portuguese vocabulary</a>), and incorrectly assumed that <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> had been the original title of the article and had been moved to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_lexis.html" title="Bulgarian lexis">Bulgarian lexis</a> by <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">User:VMORO</a>.</li>
<li>I protected <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> from further editing and nominated <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_lexis.html" title="Bulgarian lexis">Bulgarian lexis</a> for AFD (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bulgarian_lexis_aec8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bulgarian lexis">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bulgarian lexis</a>) as being an exact duplicate of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The long and short of it is: I fucked up. As near as I can determine, the page was moved by Peter Isotalo without prior discussion. While I agree that there's probably a strong argument for having the page at <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> vs. <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_lexis.html" title="Bulgarian lexis">Bulgarian lexis</a>, these arguments were not made prior to the move, and support for the move is obviously not universal.</p>
<p>Consequently, I will be unprotecting <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> immediately upon posting this notification, and notifying the involved parties of my actions.</p>
<p>This leaves the rather thorny problem of the AFD. I am going to close the AFD, with a pointer to this post in the closing notes. This is a somewhat non-standard approach to an AFD closure, so I wanted to make sure my reasons for so doing were outlined in full, lest there be any misunderstandings. Anyone who feels that I should not close the AFD discussion is cordially invited to re-open it.</p>
<p>All the best.<br />

<dd>I see. There is de-facto consensus and common sense argumentation in favor for "vocabulary", but since <i>one</i> user who regularly abuses other editors (particularly in edit summaries), ignores discussion and mocks any sources not approved by him personally questions it, we have to seek a new consensus. This is going to be quite the boon to Bulgarian-related articles.</dd>

<p>There are a couple of page moves for numismatic articles that were handled improperly, and we need an administrator to sort things out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulden_%28historical_denomination%29.html" title="Gulden (historical denomination)">Gulden (historical denomination)</a> was split to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_German_gulden_2e5d.html" title="South German gulden">South German gulden</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_gulden_234f.html" title="Austro-Hungarian gulden">Austro-Hungarian gulden</a> by cut-and-paste. The split was proper, but the manner was not. And once that's handled, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_gulden_234f.html" title="Austro-Hungarian gulden">Austro-Hungarian gulden</a> needs to be merged with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_florin.html" title="Austrian florin">Austrian florin</a> -- I'm not sure if admin help is needed for that part.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/u/Aruban_gulden.html" title="Aruban gulden">Aruban gulden</a> was moved properly to <a href="../../../a/r/u/Aruban_florin.html" title="Aruban florin">Aruban florin</a>, but its talk page was not moved (at least I'm guessing that's why the talk page for Aruban florin is talk:Aruban gulden).</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovak_crown.html" title="Czechoslovak crown">Czechoslovak crown</a> was moved to <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovak_koruna.html" title="Czechoslovak koruna">Czechoslovak koruna</a> by cut-and-paste, and I don't think anything's been done about it (there is history on both pages from before the move -- there has been active discussion at the Numismatics project about where pages belong, and some pages have been moved multiple times. We're currently discussing it (to death) and are not moving articles anymore until it's resolved, but we can still cleanup).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need more info, you can ask at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Numismatics_4608.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Numismatics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Numismatics</a>, or contact me and I'll be happy to help however I can. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMom2jandk_49c0.html" title="User:Mom2jandk">Ingrid</a> 02:50, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did the other easy one. <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovak_crown.html" title="Czechoslovak crown">Czechoslovak crown</a> has been history merged with <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovak_koruna.html" title="Czechoslovak koruna">Czechoslovak koruna</a>. As for South German and Austro-Hungarian gulden, I'm not sure what can be done there. The edit history is not cut-and-dried, and one of the two split pages would end up with the short end of the GFDL stick, edit-history wise. I'd just turn <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulden_%28historical_denomination%29.html" title="Gulden (historical denomination)">Gulden (historical denomination)</a> into a disambig page, which would be useful and would preserve contribution history. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a>|<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a></sub></font> 20:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I was told, you can code the banner out if you don't like it. Donations increased significantly with the addition of the sitenotice, so those of us who object should just CSS it out of the way. Just add this to your monobook.css:<br /></p>
<pre>
/* Remove Unneeded Notices */
#siteNotice { display: none; }

<p>Back when this started, I'd heard from this fellow via e-mail after I deleted the copyvio. He's apparently an employee of the company and is trying to do an article, but he's definitely not a native English speaker. I did a non-copyvio version of the article and explained what I was doing, but he couldn't seem to leave well enough alone. It's certainly a large enough corporation to warrant inclusion, but should a non-copyvio version be reposted and protected? It's a weird idea, I know. But, weird situations often call for weird solutions. If anyone has an idea or two, please drop me an e-mail. Later! - Lucky 6.9 05:14, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It depends what you mean by "role accounts" If you want to have one account for editing <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>-related articels, and another for making other kinds of edits, that is fine, provided that you don't chime in on discussuions to support yourself, vote more than once on polls, etc. Unless privicy is an issue, i would suggest a note on the user page of each account pointing to the other -- but no policy requires this that I know of. <b>Shared</b> accounts are not approved (that is, accounts used for editing by more than one person), and neither are accounts whose names imply a lelvel of authority that they don't have on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>The above named article contains the substantive article text, and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferguson_TE20_6d2b.html" title="Ferguson TE20">Ferguson TE20</a> where imho the article belongs is a one-edit redirect.

<p>I'm a frequent visitor to Wikipedia and have made little editorial corrections in many (probably most) articles I've visited. (I used to work in editing for a publisher and still do some freelance proofreading, and have lent a hand on a couple of pages of the Distributed Proofreading effort at the Online Books Page too, since I love them as much as I love Wikipedia.) My husband only recently nudged me that I should leave a titled summary when I make changes, but I'll admit that most of my contributions have been anonymous.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would love to correct the typos and other little inelegancies in the article on Samuel Alito. I'll admit my own POV - he scares me badly, seems a very smart ultraconservative, I do NOT want him confirmed despite his intellect and judicial experience because I believe in women's right to abortion (as well as the importance of an independent judiciary in checking unlimited power of the executive branch) - but really, I'm not out to do anything except make the article more readable. I have been following the confirmation hearings loosely on NPR, though, so if I see anything factually suspect regarding substance of the hearings I'll try to mention it somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>Well, I have somewhat hurriedly corrected obvious errors in several sections (the main bio and the Hearing section, 1/10, one other small one too?). I think that's all I have time to do today.

<p>These two users are engaging in a nuclear war, and I've blocked both of them for 24 hours.

<dd>My God... As a previous (failed) mediator of this dispute, I am certain they can carry on this war in any article. I would say use article banning liberally, especially for the nuclei of the dispute, but if they can't control themselves, block. Keep in mind that protection is a last resort of sorts for dispute resolution to work itself out. I'd say it should never be needed here, if they ever escalate to the point where you're considering it, they should simply be banned from the article per probation (this includes <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckytheCat</a>). <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:26, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nothing you can do. First, this was four months ago. Second, even if were today, if someone wants to do it, he'll do it. Sbz5809 20:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The standard approach in all organisations without exception that have public participation is for the location if possible of the person who made the threat to be established and the local police notified immediately. It is <i>never</i> the policy to ignore it. The comment that <i>even if were today, if someone wants to do it, he'll do it</i> shows no understanding whatsoever for the reason why such threats are made.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it shows precisely the opposite, as your next sentence acknowledges. Sbz5809 21:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>People who want to kill themselves usually don't announce the fact. People who announce their attention are usually desparately seeking help. If it is was just a prank post, to ignore it would be wreckless in the extreme. Furthermore if the person did kill themselves after making the threat, and nothing had been done, and the fact that the threat became public (eg, if the family found out and revealed it to the media) it would make news headlines (<b>WIKIPEDIA IGNORED SUICIDE THREAT CLAIMS FAMILY</b>&#160;; <b>WIKIPEDIA ALLOWED CONTRIBUTOR TO KILL THEMSELVES</b>&#160;; <b>SUICIDE VICTIM APPEAL NOT HEEDED BY WIKIPEDIA</b> or worst of all because of its double meaning <b>WIKIPEDIA USER KILLS THEMSELVES</b> etc) that would in themselves result in a flood of both joke and serious threats. All threats should be reported to someone who can seek to establish where the person is contributing from or to Jimbo and then they could quietly handle the issue with the local police if they can establish who sent the message. Under no circumstances can such a threat be ignored if freshly made. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I would have said it with fewer capital letters, I agree with Jtdirl, these things should be taken quite seriously. However, we probably don't have to worry too much about a 4 month old threat from someone who is still contributing (albeit temporarily blocked at the moment). Has anyone talked to him about it?

<p>I'm going to throw my two cents in and agree wth Jtdirl and Dragons flight; we should certainly take these threats seriously. Because of his schedule, bringing the issue to Jimbo is unlikely to get the swift response it requires; I feel sure he would want to take immediate action, but is simply unlikely to see anything in time. However, his talk page is monitored by many, many admins, so that might be a good place to report it after all. Here, of course, would be a good place as well, as would the talk page of any of our Board members or especially the ArbCom members. For those that are IRC users, bringing it up in #mediawiki will get a very quick response. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 21:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Last fall an editor talked about suicide and made broad hints that he was desperate, including a short but poignant biography on his user page. Other editors left notes on his talk page expressing their concern about him and their appreciation for his contributions (though he was relatively new). The editor made it through his dark spell and he has made many more contributions since then (which is why I haven't provided links or names). We certainly don't want to lose good (or even bad) editors that way. Wikipedia is not, primarily, a community; but it is one anyway. It is merely civil to tell someone who is considering harming himself to refrain from doing so. However intervening in another user's life, without being asked, may be taking on more responsibility than encyclopedia editors ought to have. I hope it all works out well. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 09:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Strictly speaking, commas in this sense are supposed to separate independent clauses. "will continue until &lt;this date&gt;" is a sentence fragment. The addition of a noun or noun phrase is necessary to make it an independent clause.

<dd>I know why he changed it, his own personal asthetic taste, there is a long standing problem with him and this template, he believes anyone should be able to change how it appears anytime they want without consensus, this is documented in the Main talk page. He is not the only one who is mistaken in this viewpoint of course, but since the page is now protected, and since Neutrality is an admin, it is a more serious problem with him in particular (see the template edit history for his previous revert history and lack of consensus building). I would be interested in knowing who placed protected status on the template to begin with, it had no reason to be protected, there was no vandalism problem and there were a whole bunch of us maintaining it.

<p>Got it. When I saw that the template had nothing on it to support its cause, I thought I had found some vandalisation. When the UFO incident was going on, Art Bell was taking calls from people who had seen these things, even as the incident was <i>still</i> unfolding. One caller said that Luke had launched <i>armed</i> planes at the UFOs, and one does'nt send $60 Million planes up after flares, another witness said it hovered over their vehicle. The incident continues to unfold, in spite of what the USAF has said. Something is going on there. Appreciate the assisstance. Go to the UFO Casebook website, and see the main "newspage". The latest is that someone got a pix of a flying cigar w/ a "light". Maybe this witness is a Wikipedian.

<p>Hi, I just had a conversation with someone (who said he was a law student in U.S.) in IRC who said that our article on <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a> had inaccurate legal information and a picture that was possibly illegal to distribute. The article suggested that cartoons depicting sexual abuse of children were legal and would likely remain legal in the US, however my IRC interlocutor linked me to several reputable publications writing on a recent child pornography trafficking conviction for transmission of cartoons over the internet. I have updated the article to reflect this information, but because the cartoon in the article does not seem to me to depict sexual abuse (though it may be intended to arouse pedophiles, I don't know) I have not removed the image. I would appreciate it if some of you (perhaps with a legal background) would have a look at the <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a> article. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 05:42, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update: interlocutor says that relevant statute criminalizes cartoon depiction of "sexually explicit conduct" with minors, rather than "sexual abuse", and that this is enumerated on page 75 of relevant statute, here <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/S151CONF.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/S151CONF.pdf" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Just thought I should throw this one to the crowd. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 05:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are going to be in for a battle if you want that image removed as several users appear to want it kept. I'll be honest I was slightly surprised by it too but there has been various edit wars over that and basically the majority of the talk page is discussion relating to that one image. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">WhiteNight</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 06:20, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's fine. As I say, I can't see how it could be viewed as constituting "sexually explicit conduct", so I think it's fine from a legal standpoint. But since someone off-wiki had warned me about it, and since he was right that we had incorrect legal info in the article, I just thought I should throw it out on the noticeboard. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 06:29, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pretty sure this part was already overturned at least once by the Supreme Court... do you people actually look to see what court document your reading and google it? The PROTECT Act "virtual child pornography" section was overturned by the Supreme Court as Unconstitutional in its previous rendition as the COPA "Child Online Protection Act. <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-795" class="external autonumber" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-795" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> I've no doubt this would also hold in court now. I suggest you approach the WikiProject Law about it. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 08:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alkivar, that's lovely, but yes I did read it and the PROTECT Act is entirely different from COPA and has not been overturned. Moreover, the case in question was decided on December 1, 2005, so clearly the provisions of PROTECT are still operative. This doesn't mean, though, that the picture in question is covered under the act.

<dd>Even if the picture is legal in some jurisdictions, we may still decide to delete it. All articles do not need to be illustrated. The last IfD, a month ago, did not have a strong consensus.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Hikari_Hayashibara_Manga.jpg|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Hikari_Hayashibara_Manga.jpg|1" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>]. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 09:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been noticing some tension over comments meant to be humorous and/or sarcastic. Written language is not very good at conveying the emotional intent behind these comments. It is just as likely to be misinterprted as being appreciated as intended. As a rule of thumb, it makes sense to use humor and sarcasm if you are really good at it, certain of your audience and are not in an emotionally charged situation. I often don't know how to interpret many of these comments. Often these remarks get interpreted literally and things get heated. So, I'm not saying that everyone shouldn't be humorous, but that it should be at the right time, in the right place, in the right situation and with caution. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 10:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
