<p>seriously, stop giving them so much attention, half this page is covered with AOL themed warnings, there are now daily wheel wars over range blocks, templates, categories, etc.. all devoted to what is probably one or two vandals.. in the same sense that you would never give a troll this much attention, you wouldn't want to do the same for a vandal. Hell, isn't that the reason Willy On Wheels was deleted? The problem is that prolific vandals become like folk heros around here, with daily tall tails, and entire articles devoted to them. When you get an attention seeking vandal, this is just counter productive--64.12.116.65 00:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict) I agree with the opinions of both anonymous up there and mboverload. The reason we get so many AOL DoS attacks is that all AOL users are frequent victims of collateral damage and thus recognize how easy it is to get all of AOL blocked. Then the DoS vandals read our posts here and go "Wow, that's easy!" It's much like how posting Charles Manson's face on the cover of Rolling Stone and making celebrities out of every serial killer and villain makes little kids wanna grow up to be murderers. Everyone wants their fame, and it's pretty damn easy to become infamous as a vandal. Thus, I see your point that we do seem to glorify vandals, but at the same time I see mboverload's point that we can't just do nothing. Unfortunately at the moment not much can be done--until the devs come up with some clever workarounds or AOL finally does something about this, our only real solution is blocking. It's an unfortunate truth that I hope will soon change, but I'm doing my best to just not let it get to me--truth is, it's not <i>that</i> big of a deal, and we will find a way to deal with it.

<dd>This particular vandal edits from IP's.Most of the collateral damage comes from vandals with accounts who are at AOL.The fact that this vandal remains only an IP is a good sign that he is intending the collateral damage.Now, our folks need to stop the vandal, but a range block of the ISP won't do much good.When you block an AOL IP, you're <i>behind the vandal</i> and therefore <i>on top of an innocent.</i>Blocking the whole range would be the solution, except that, if this is a -bot, and it seems to be, from its speed, the block of the whole range would only need to be a very short time -- probably&#160;:10 or even&#160;:05 would stop the bot, unless it has been programmed to not be bothered by the block page coming up.I'm glad to see AmiDaniel backing off from some of the more severe positions, above.If we can't stop the vandal with&#160;:10 or&#160;:15 blocks, then we sort of <i>have to</i> lay it off on RC Patrol, as bad as that is.Ironically, if the vandal succeeded, if he managed to make Wikipedia a place with "F4RT" scribbled on each page, it would be boring to him.He only wants to pee on a clean wall.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>if I was to write a vandalbot, I would make it reconnect everytime it encountered the block page, thus walking through my ISP's IP range as quickly as people can block it. This is pointless.

<dd>That would be <i>an</i> answer, but the down side is that it would stop our sock puppet spotting and the times when the autoblocker catches a blocked user who simply creates a new account -- not that that was ever particularly robust.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:17, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really must apologize for my unkind comments.I meant every word of it, but I really should have kept it to myself.Like Dr. Hannibal Lecter, I believe in the value of politeness and courtesy.Several factors came together to induce me to go off as I did:some wiki-stalking, nasty comments from certain users, an RfC initiated on me by a user who was deeply offended that I told him to "go away," frustration with POV pushers, and some serious side effects from some prescription medication.I actually had to go to the emergency room a couple of nights ago for treatment for side effects from the medication.The 72 hour block, unlike three months of keelhauling (Ha, ha, very droll) was quite appropriate.Guy Chapman is an absolute saint for checking on me and helping me out.That kind of behavior is all too rare around here.Did I ever mention that I was one of the most prolific and nasty flame artists on USENET about ten to twelve years ago?I guess I still have it in me.I still have some lingering problems and concerns with some users, and I wish I could get some help resolving those so that I'm not tempted to resort to verbal abuse.Have a great day, everyone! <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

Nothing wrong with confidence, but he crossed the line into brashness and all his edits since then have been of a pattern--he has an idea and our job is to help him implement it.

<dd>His posting style as a new editor isn't <i>that</i> weird. It seems that he was writing as if he was under the impression that wikipedia was a small, workaholic community that expected him to get a move on. Many new users act that way. I gather that you are under the impression that he thought he could bug everyone about his problems and be proud about it, but in reality most people are scared about being expelled from the community and they make these promises so as not to lose others' hopes in them. It isn't fair to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite a latebloomer</a> who needs help getting started.

<dd>Noone has attacked him for being new. Heck, I'm relatively new myself. People who have tried to offer him help are ignored or insulted. When people tried to help him with his format on talk pages, he responded that he could do whatever he wants. When people engage him in discussion about proposed edits he has stated that he "gives everyone two chances" to basically see his point of view. Failure to comply with his issues earns you his disrespect and he either ignores or berates you. When everyone disagrees with him, he begins his "endless reverting" as he puts it while declaring that the only way to stop him is to ban him. This isn't simple newcomer ignorance. This is flat out arrogance, and quite possibly some form of psychosis. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 13:21, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have had enough history with Wiki-Star to know that he's trouble. He takes command of the articles and adds an enormous amount of images (approximately 50) to each page. I previously cleaned up the Buu, Piccolo, Gotenks, Vegito, and Vegeta pages on a continuous basis, only to see him come back and revert, and promise to continue doing it with no other basis or consensus in mind except for the fact that he likes the characters. Considering the fact that even more important characters aren't even getting 7 or 8 pictures, it's only obvious that neither of the mentioned deserve 40 odd images on the page to illustrate their history. I am going to agree with everyone else who is on the lookout to find a way of stopping this Wiki-Star fellow. - <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarbon_0407.html" title="User:Zarbon">Zarbon</a></dd>

<dd>Making such strict rules is a rather bad idea in my opinion. Editors can unintentionally post or disclose personal information of others who don't want it disclosed. In many cases, it is not necessarily clear as to how much personal information someone wants on the encyclopedia. Some users have enough personal information on their user pages for anyone to find out exactly where they are in real life, others, like me, would be highly concerned if even my first name or IP address were posted. It is difficult for users to know what the wishes of other users are, and slips can certainly happen, especially with names. Threatening to do so is quite often done by people who should not be tolerated, but is also occasionally done by people who don't understand that it isn't acceptable. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 07:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, there should be a zero tolerance policy on the posting of personal information by other parties.Certainly one event should not lead to a permanent ban, but one 'accident' should have sufficient consequences to make it absolutely clear that a second 'accident' will not be tolerated and will have lasting consequences for the editor.

<dd>I don't like the use of the expression "zero tolerance" for this idea. That term is associated with fascist elements in my country. What I'm interested in here is a commitment to protect editors from harassment of a particularly vicious type: harassment by those who have developed an expertise in tracking down ordinary people to harass them and "expose" them. Harassment by those who use usernames, fields of interest, and passing comments to track down a person's location, employer, family, and other associates ... and then create personal, economic, and social crises for them. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 06:59, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Watercool created that fork by cut-and-paste today, being unhappy with a move done by Cfvh. I have warned Watercool, but Watercool reverted yet, returning the fork. Seems to me that the user is not exactly new (that's my impression, not a verified fact), but the account is new. Anyway, Watercool displays certain persistent, obstinate character, in other articles too. Seems to me Watercool is pushing some POV in several places. Isn't a block of some week that recommendable response to cool down obstinacy in an editor's missionary attitude?

It didn't stop at the neandethal article either - there was a long battle to keep an unencyclopedic "self-identification" article off WP which - coincidentally I'm sure - promoted the "aspie-quiz" quite heavily - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Asperger%27s_self-identification_4e77.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asperger's self-identification">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Asperger's_self-identification</a>. The user has a few good edits but there are so many ones involving spamming and dubious combative things. I'm sure this doesn't mean much to people but I just wanted to note the long war I was involved in and the amount of time it has taken reverting the spam, explaining WP policies over and over again (which he still doesn't seem to understand...) and various other things... that is all&#160;:). EXTREME THANKS to JzG for doing this, Curps for nominating the article for deletion (AGAIN) and the others involved - and (as a former admin myself) I would suggest blocking the user until he is willing to contribute and not promote original theories. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 20:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ryan, there is just one problem with your reasoning. You are the only one that that removed my links at <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_syndrome.html" title="Asperger's syndrome">Asperger's syndrome</a> AFAIK. Before you started this, they had been there over a year. So, who is pushing an agenda when to authors disagree on which links should be present? The one that inserts them or the one that deletes them? Also, from the history, I'm pretty sure we can easily find out that you have been the most persistent one. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:53, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"So, who is pushing an agenda when to authors disagree on which links should be present?

<p>Actually, I do not particularly like that location, as I prefer Boleslaus over Boleslav. However I feel it is no longer possible to leave it to the untenable polonized name, where it just is a victim of all sorts of disruption (and prolonged wars) to keep it there againt any sort of majority. I felt that putting it to a place supported by some English works of reference, but not my personal preference, I am not advancing my own preference. I gladly welcome a new poll to actually determine where it should be, provided it does not start in the polonized name, which just leads us all as victims of yet another situation where community rough consensus is undermined by determined minority. Perhaps, if almost everyone has a reason to have a better name, the poll would be fairer than it has this far been. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 23:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps his rhetoric was a strawman argument in poor taste, but I doubt it was intended as a serious death threat.

<dd>The kernel of this report--a perception of a serious threat--is apparently mainly due to Ibrahimfaisal's limited knowledge of English idiom.This is the second time I've noticed that he has presented a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument in the form of a conditional statement that may appear, to a native English speaker, to be a threat to perform the absurd act.It's an unfortunate but understandable misapprehension. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Regarding the mocking dismissals (see above) of my report regarding this threat against me (see above): It's nice that some of you find this so humorous. I myself though, do not. As for my feelings on this: I do believe that <a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">Faisal</a> did indeed threaten me and I ask that he apologize, for (as suggested above) careless use of language. As a non-Muslim, I feel very threatened when a self-professing Muslim (in this case <a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">Faisal</a>) "jokes" about chopping off my head - especially while discussing <b>[[Category:Modern victims of Islamic decapitation]]</b>. Personally, I feel that this "joke" was at minimum, in extremely bad taste and very hostile. What's next? Should I have to listen to "jokes" about gay-bashing because I am gay? Most of all, the snide suggestion that my report was "trolling" is extremely offensive to me. Those who mocked me here were all very rude. You have mistreated me and I think that I am owed an apology - especially from <a href="../../../i/b/r/User%7EIbrahimfaisal_46ee.html" title="User:Ibrahimfaisal">Faisal</a> for his so-called "joke" which I do not find in the least bit funny. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScented_Guano_1d2d.html" title="User:Scented Guano">Scented Guano</a> 00:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>For my part, what would you like me to do? Withdraw it? Delete it? I'd like to play by the rules here, although I'd be hard pressed to find evidence that JzG has been held to the same standard (multiple, irrefutable cases of edit warring and assuming bad faith, and from an admin).Am I really to be banned for such a small transgression when this <i>admin</i> has flaunted the rules repeatedly on these pages? <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 17:53, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Being banned reduces an editor's ability to carry weight in arguments. Conversely, strong arguments will attract plenty of new editors (including Admins). Admins are not accountable to each other, and generally look at things from independent points of view, within the standard published rules. And I'd be surprised if Admins wanted Yes men as Admins. That wouldn't get the encyclopaedia anywhere. Much better is to bring new people into the discussion who may find new ways to move things forward. There are many strong editors who are keeping an eye on this article - lethe, for example. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 18:04, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're preaching to the choir, Stephen. I've repeatedly tried to work with JzG, but he keeps accusing me of bad faith. Just a few hours ago, he accused me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=60384315&amp;oldid=60266858" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=60384315&amp;oldid=60266858" rel="nofollow">disrupting</a> to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, just because I asked for sources for several article contentions. Maybe I should have done what he's done repeatedly: remove the contentions without comment and edit-war when someone tries to re-insert. Then maybe I wouldn't be accused of disruption for (gasp!) asking for <i>sources!</i> <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 23:54, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand - the quote doesn't look that bad to me, in these discussions we've had far far worse. The problem is, we've had discussions that focus on subjective things like POV. Every article has a point of view, and its not an easy task to quantify its neutrality. JzG has insisted on a POV that many of us thinks is not neutral, and the "personal attacks" have been taken from both sides, with JzG implying that me an a couple other users are pushing advertisement, while we have accused JzG of pushing the idea that PRT is a wishy-washy conglomeration of badly thought out plans.</dd>

<dd>I guess I'll add my $0.02.First, I think this is a pretty weak example of a personal attack that would make another user a candidate for banning or even a stern talking to.I only have a few weeks of experience contributing to the PRT and UniModal articles, but so far it seems to me that JzG has strong opinions regarding PRT and it prevents him from being impartial.He seems to administer the pages in a dictatorial fashion as opposed to mediator.He seems to revert and delete with little or no explanation.I don't know why, but he seems to have POV goals with regards to PRT.Maybe he's really impartial and constructive in other areas, but in all things PRT, JzG will only accept verbiage that shrouds the articles in sceptism (ie: "unproven technology") and accepts certain unsupported assertions (ie: "100MPH") but not others (ie: "$1M/mile").In the discussions, he makes unsubstantiated assertions (ie: "majority view") to support his reverts and deletions.If the story deserves to be told, then admins should help find a way to clearly tell the story instead of trimming the story to the point of insignifigance.In short, JzG seems to reign over PRT and his opinionated administation technique creates an adversarial tone that is reflected in the sometimes taunting retorts by others.Stephen B Streater seems to be more neutral but I get the impression that even he doesn't want to cross JzG by contradicting or not supporting him.--<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 18:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>JzG has bent over backward to let the PRT promoters have their say. He is absolutely correct in saying PRT does not exist except as a concept. Professor of Transportation at Penn State Vucan Vuchic gave PRT only a few paragraphs in his book "Transportation for Livable Cities" (Rutgers 1999) [<a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/Pugripz/Vuchic.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/Pugripz/Vuchic.jpg" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>] Professor Vuchic calls PRT an "imaginary system". The Encyclopedia Britannica doesn't even have an article on PRT.Perhaps the real reason the PRT promoters are so eager to get rid of JzG hasmore to do with several upcoming elections of PRT-promoting politicians in Minnesota and a trial of a prominent PRT promoter in Minnesota Federal District Court at the end of July for extorting bribes.<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">Avidor</a> 19:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think there is much of an argument even from PRT promoters that PRT is more than a concept that has only rarely seen prototype development, but JzG has NOT gone to great lengths to let PRT promoters indulge themselves.I'm not calling JzG an outspoken critic of PRT.I'm saying that he's taking the position that in the absence of a fully functional PRT system, there mustn't be even a hint that any of the information contained in the article is more than the utopian fantasy of the designer.Whether or not PRT exists, is feasable, or how many words Britannica devotes to PRT has nothing to do with how the article is administered.Maybe if Britannica had millions of editors and unlimited space for every subject, they too would beef up their information on PRT.--<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 20:39, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Spam</i> is a valid candidate for speedy deletion.In case like this one, you could probably have gone from Prod to CSD.It all depends on how much text was there.However, when the creator of an article removes the prod tag....Well, it's why I'm not fond of the system.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:31, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay; I've always found that the use of the {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} template was considered a vandal report; I'll rethink the position. Meantime, CFIF, it's not that you reported or didn't report sockpuppetry so much as you <b>said</b> the other person <b>had</b> them rather than that you <b>suspected</b> so. Still, you're using this as a straw man; you're both edit-warring to your preferred version, your only communications are you saying the other's version "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:WHDH-TV&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60359513" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:WHDH-TV&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60359513" rel="nofollow">blows</a>" while his response is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:WSVN&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60362694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:WSVN&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60362694" rel="nofollow">I'll report CFIF to an administrator for vandalism</a>", leading you to beat him to it. The fact remains that neither of you is taking any steps, besides coming here to "report" someone, to resolve the dispute. At the very top of this page, it notes that this is not "the place to bring disputes over content, or reports of abusive behaviour — we aren't referees, and have limited authority to deal with abusive editors. We have a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution procedure</a> which we recommend you follow."

There is also quite a bit of incivility; Which could be solved just by following the dispute resolution process. (Although I fail to see how the virgin comment qualifies as a <i>personal attack</i>.)

<p>As most of us know, Wikipedia is becoming a favorite venue for various physics cranks to propound and promote their pseudo-scientific theories. For example, a well-known crackpot named Mark McCutcheon recently published a book called "The Final Theory" in which he claims that all of modern science is a fraud, and that gravity is actually due to the continual expansion of the Earth and all other matter. He then came to Wikipedia and created an article on his "Expansion Theory", heavily quoting his own book on the subject. After a protracted edit war, this individual's self-promotional original research was finally removed from Wikipedia. This is an illustration of how the Wikipedia policies are actually effective in the long run at weeding out self-promoting pseudo-science crackpots. There are many other examples of similar crank pseudo-science articles that have been weeded out. But the process is not pretty. It typically requires one or more individual(s) who are at least somewhat knowledgeable in the actual scientific field, and who are also familiar with the ways of science cranks, and who will persistently correct, challenge, and revert the seemingly endless pseudo-scientific drivel that a dedicated crackpot can generate.</p>
<p>Recently a particularly virulant case came up, involving what is called "Lesage Gravity". A group of well-known physics crackpots (including the likes of Tom "faces on Mars" van Flandern, Paul Stowe, Barry Mingst, and Matt Edwards, names familiar to readers of the sci.* newsgroups), put together a book called "Pushing Gravity", propounding the old and long-since-discredited idea that gravity is caused by an aetheral flux of invisible particles pushing in all directions. They then (like Mark McCutcheon before them) came to Wikipedia to promote their pseudo-science book, heavily quoting themselves, in an article that reads like a publicity release for their book. None of the collaborators on the book have ever been able to get their ideas published in reputable journals, so they had to resort to putting together their own book, and then promoting it on Wikipedia. Stowe, Mingst, and Edwards were soon joined by another well-known Usenet physics crank named Ed Schaefer, and the four of them have produced an article that is an embarrassment to Wikipedia. As in other such cases, this situation could have been dealt with by the usual Wikipedia processes...HOWEVER....</p>
<p>An unusual and somewhat unexpected thing has happenned. These four individuals have somehow gained the cooperative support of a Wikipedia administrator named CambridgeBayWeather. This administrator, for whatever reason, seems to do whatever Ed Schaefer and/or Paul Stowe tells him to do. If Ed or Paul say to lock the article, CBW locks the article. If Ed or Paul tell him to unlock the article, he unlocks the article. If they tell him to block a user, he blocks the user. As a result, the only individual who has been trying to restrain this cadre of physics crackpots (namely myself) has now been blocked (on the flimseyist pretext of a 3RR complaint that I've ever seen... check the record for yourself to see what I mean), so the article is now completely "owned and operated" by these self-promoting original researchers.</p>
<p>My reason for posting this message here is not to complain about the physics cranks. They will always be with us, and they simply do what is in their nature to do. I'm posting this message simply to point out the odd behavior of CambridgeBayWeather, the Wiki administrator who seems to be operating at the beck and call of these crackpots. I have no personal stake in whether Wikipedia succeeds or fails, so I'm just as happy to walk away, but if there's anyone out there who cares about the quality and integrity (and reputation) of Wikipedia science articles, I suggest you look into the behavior of CambridgeBayWeather, and find out what he thinks he's accomplishing by blocking individuals who are simply trying to uphold the Wikipedia policies and standards, and who are making a good faith effort to adhere to the rules while doing so.Fixwiki 00:08, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm surprised to see it characterized as a typical 3RR conflict. The administrator blocked me after the SECOND revert for a calender day, because this revert was only 22 hours (rather than 24 hours) after the first of two reverts on the previous calender day, making a total of four reverts with a single 24 hour period... even though I explicitly explained my intention to stay within the 3RR limit. I've personally witnessed "revert wars" where people have reverted articles dozens of times in as many minutes, but the administrators in those situations just counsuled patience, and indeed the situations resolved themselves before long. There was a time when blocking an editor was regarded as a serious an undesirable step, given the whole philosophy of Wikipedia, and it was reserved for egregious intentional violations of policy. In this case, ferreting out the fact that an inadvertent violation had even occurred took some careful scrutiny.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd also like to point out that I've been continually and repeatedly threatened by other editors, mainly Ed Schaefer, posting private messages to me, telling me things like "I hereby advise you to change your name, "Fixwiki", because I find it offensive, as if you are claiming that you are going to "fix" Wikipedia"; If you go on being offensive in this manner, I will have you banned from Wikipedia". I simply ignore his messages, which seems to enrage him to send me even more outrageous messages, but I frankly didn't think anything of it... UNTIL... he actually campaigned to get the administrator CambridgeBayWeather to have me blocked, by alerting him to the horrifying "infraction" I described previously (reverting at 22 instead of 24 hours). At that time I asked CBW where I could complain about this, and he directed me here, so I posted the message above. Then when I just logged back on, I have another private message from Mr. Schaefer, informing me that he has noted my message here, and if I keep up this unacceptable behavior, he will have me banned permanently. And he seems to have the endorsement or at least the support of CambridgeBayWeather in his campaign against me.</dd>

<dd>Is this really just a "content issue"?It really seems to me there is a serious problem here, one that has little or nothing to do with content. I think the crux of the problem is the Wikipedia policy, formulated by Jim Wales, against "physics cranks" and "original research". I have invoked this policy in the explanations of my edits, and this has made me the target of personal attacks from physics cranks, perhaps not surprisingly. My message here is not that I need or seek any kind of protection against the attacks of physics cranks; those attacks go with the territory. My message is that I don't think Wikipedia administrators should let themselves be manipulated into carrying out the threats of physics cranks. Is this too much to ask? By the way, any one of my messages may be the last, because I'm sure when Mr Schaefer sees this, he will launch some charge at me before CambridgeBayWeather, who will probably block me permanently.

<dd>I've tried to explain to Fixwiki that 3RR is not a calendar day but a 24 hour period.

<dd>As our policy says, the 3RR is an electric fence and not an entitlement.Even if one strives to stay within the letter of the 3RR – which I hasten to say, Fixwiki apparently failed to do – an editor who perpetually stays just within the border of the 3RR is still engaged in edit warring, and is still likely to find himself blocked. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:04, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand completely that the 3RR rule applies to any consecutive 24 hour period, not to calender days. I also fully acknowledge that I reverted the disputed article four times within one 24 hour period. I explained this in the previous messages above. My point is that blocking someone on the second day of reverting a disputed article, when he reverted the article only 3 times on one calender day and only twice on the next, for a total of FIVE reverts in TWO days, is a rather zealous application of the 3RR rule. Also, I think a review of your talk page shows that this action of yours, as with your previous actions related to this disputed article, were taken in direct response to instructions that you received from Ed Schaefer. It's as if you have appointed Ed as a deputy administrator, and frankly I think this is highly unwise and inappropriate, because he is one of the "physics cranks" (to use the term from the Wikipedia policy statement) who is promoting the violation of Wikipedia policies against (1) self-promotion, and (2) original research in science articles.</dd>

<dd>Ed has stated explicitly that he does not feel bound by those policies and does not intend to adhere to them, and of course the same applies to his accomplices Paul Stowe, Matt Edwards, and Barry Mingst. If you are so vigilant to take pre-emptive action against ME based on a message in which I indicated that I would ADHERE to the 3RR policy (albeit with a mis-interpretation of the 24 hour versus calender day), why do these blatent statements of Ed Schaefer voicing his intention to VIOLATE two of the most important Wiki policies not prompt you to take action against HIM? (By the way, that's a rhetorical question... I have never sought to have anyone blocked, silenced, or censored, and I will not start now.)</dd>

<dd>As an adminnistrator, I would think you would also take into account the fact that each of my five reverts over two days, separated by about 8 hours, was answered by an anti-revert, usually within MINUTES, and with no justification, from either Ed Schaefer or his accomplice Paul Stowe. This is another reason that, in the past, Wikipedia administrators have tended to take a more circumspect view, and not just decide to BLOCK one particular editor, and certainly not after five reverts in two days. Wikipedia contains the ability to revert articles for a reason, and it is quite understandable that, especially in the case of disputed articles written by a group of self-promoting "original researchers", that there will be multiple reverts at some stage of the process. As I said, dealing with physics cranks is not a pretty process. I really think Wikipedia has the resources to do it successfully, BUT ONLY if the administrators refrain from actively supporting the cranks by blocking and banning individuals who try to uphold the Wiki anti-physics-crank policies.

<dd>Yeah, 3RR and everything. But regarding the factual issues Fixwiki is complete correct. It's tedious and unrewarding (except sometimes by legal and other threats) to keep the self-promoting cranks within control. I can help out FixWiki by doing some of the reverts, but what is achieved by this? It looks at best ironic when these conflicts are met with the standard formal answerslike "discuss on talk page". Heck, there's nothing to discuss with Tom van Flandern, you either are an encylcopedia or you let TvF contribute. Sorry for this rant, by these problems always leave me severely depressed. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 22:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pjacobi - I have put a fair amount of work into trying to obtain an article that is fair to the subject of <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation_9f6c.html" title="Le Sage's theory of gravitation">Le Sage's theory of gravitation</a> and is NPOV towards it.I have gotten in the way of the pro Le Sage gravitation editors just as much as I hae gotten in the way of Fixwiki.In fact, if you look at the discussion for the article in question, you will find that I have reached out to Fixwiki over and over again, and been rebuffed because I am a known "crackpot".Also, you will find that in general the other editors have been quite polite in their dealings with each other, while Fixwiki and his various aliases (yes, aliases and not sock puppets) have regularly been hostile towards the rest of us.</dd>
<dd>Fixwiki claims that we reverted his revents without justification.I admit that none was given at the time, but also refer you to <a href="../../../l/e/_/Talk%7ELe_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation_9a8a.html#Removing_the_protection" title="Talk:Le Sage's theory of gravitation">Talk:Le_Sage's_theory_of_gravitation#Removing_the_protection</a>.At this point, the editors of that page put together a consensus view of what to do with the page in the wake of an edit war that got in protected.Fixwiki had plenty of time in which to weigh in on that discussion, and chose not to do so.Instead, he waited until he was sure that the protection was off, and then reverted to his version from the previous edit war.If you look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Le_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Le_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the article's edit history</a>, you will see that Fixwiki was asked to discuss changes first.His respose in his next revert was to say that he had previously pointed out the "errors" and implied that they needed no further discussion.And so it went.</dd>
<dd>IMO, Fixwiki is acting like a crank, and is no more deserving of resepct than User:Le Sagian who is Fiwiki's pro-Le Sage alter ego on that page.BTW - Le Sagian is now working primarily through the talk page these days as I have requested that he do, and so he is not an issue at this time. So let's just say that people should be very careful about what they are doing before they side with Fixwiki here.I do not mind a mainstream sanity check on that article (and given the current pool of editors for that page such a check really is needed), but IMO Fixwiki is and has been as POV and disrputive as many anti-mainstream editors are. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I defer this to your judgement EMS, you've invested a hefty dose of time into the article, and you aren't a crackpot for sure, I only hope you don't suffer from the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm_syndrome.html" title="Stockholm syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>. Perhaps FixWiki must be grouped to the Anti-Troll-Trolls (who lose sober judegement when trying to defend Wikipedia's integrety).

<dd>Thanks much.I assure you that the issue for me is Fixwiki's behavior, not his intent.He definitely is something of an anti-Troll-Troll (although "troll" is not term I would use in this case).At the least, he is highly biased against Le Sage gravitation to the point that his edits are unnecessarily dispariging of it.I thank you for saying the I am not a crackpot, but Fixwiki will contest that and with a valid reason:I have (and still am) trying to promote a theory of my own devising which modifies <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>.However, unlike others with such ideas who come here I have chosen not try to present that work in the article space in accord with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 14:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I attempted to file an RfD only to discover that one was filed within the last six months. It was suggested to me by <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">User:Circeus</a> that I bring the issue up here. My awareness of this user came about due to his comments at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_community.html" title="Bear community">Bear community</a> on the talk page, wherein he has suggested that this very valid and historically important subcommunity of the gay community was a vanity entry. He then made attacks on any users who disagreed with him. I broached the subject on his talk page in what I felt was a very civil manner, and he proceeded to belittle the entire Bear Community movement - including their flag, the very symbol of the movement - on my talk page. When it became apparent to him that I was not going to let this behaviour pass unnoticed, he began a lengthy diatribe on my talk page. It seems overwhelmingly clear that this user has not learned any lessons from past reprimands, and continues to show a flagrant disregard for others on Wikipedia. It is time, I think, for someone to step in and set things right once and for all. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 06:04, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me just clarify what this user has done, and how serious it is: he has gone into an article - <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_community.html" title="Bear community">Bear community</a> - and asserted, based solely on his personal distaste for the subject matter, that it is a vanity entry and invalid. He has shown a complete lack of respect for a community of people that numbers in the hundreds of thousands, globally. And he continues to do so in his extensive uncivil comments. I may be expressing a major POV on the matter, but how are we supposed to judge someone's intent if not by his actions? What this user says is simple "sarcasm" is, to me, a gross trivialization of a group of people's existance. What he said amounts to me going to an article on Puerto Rico and saying "Oh, well I'm just going to call my living room a country and make up a flag for it, so it's just like Puerto Rico!" And he continues to belittle and attack others! I don't understand how this individual is NOT in extreme violation of WP:CIVIL, and I just don't understand how the admins have allowed it to continue! Please! HELP ME understand! I know this may come off as insincere, but I really am at a loss to comprehend. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 06:45, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I peacefully left the discussion page in question weeks, if not months ago without any lasting influence effecting the article. I then received the aforementioned comments on my talk page. My response was sarcastic, but no personal attacks were launched, even after a retaliatory ANI was started against me. I would like this situation to end. I obviously have no interest in the Bear Community page, and I have no interest in talk page discussions with Pacian. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 06:48, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, Haizum, but you suggested that an encyclopedia entry about a 25-year-old sub-community of the gay community was a vanity entry, clearly without educating yourself on the matter. That is the sheer definition of ignorance. You have an extensive history of people complaining about the way you talk to them - that indicates that SOME PEOPLE clearly feel you are treating them badly. And even if these incidents you cite here WERE attacks on you - which they so clearly were not, when viewed in context of the paragraph you took them from - it doesn't justify you attacking back. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 06:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only thing I implied is that the user Scewfot has obviously been prompted to make his vandalistic edits based on my recent edits. I do find it quite a coincidence that a brand new user registered, came to Wikipedia, and managed to stumble solely on this particular confict, and vandalize pages only relating to it and nothing else.

<dd>pacian, I'd like to comment on your behavior here. I have found Haizum to dislay an history of confrontational editing and uncivil comments. I told that when coming here, you should make a clear case and present. You have come and, for lack of a a better term, <i>rambled</i>. This does not make our job any easier. I looked into this because I wanted to be helpful after nullifying your reactivation of and old RFC, but it is not the job of admins to examine in details the contribution history when a user accuses another. You have failed to present proofs, and this is probably the reason you have been mostly ignored. However, I think this (and probably the Hadith killings case, although you are not involved in the latter) case might benefit from <a href="../../../m/c/_/WP%7EMC_8667.html" title="WP:MC">mediation</a>. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 12:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>E.G.:Unfortunately, saying, "I have found Haizum to dislay an history of confrontational editing" would qualify as a lie <b>if</b> an individual actually glanced at my edit history. For the most part, my edits have been <b>small corrections and tags</b>, the rest is <b>talk/discussion page</b> related. Also unfortunate is the fact that I run a 50% chance of being blocked simply for pointing out how someone else is misrepresenting me/the issue/the POV/etc, which usually falls under the WP:CIV Iron Umbrella. Of course the initial confrontational act of saying "I have found Haizum to dislay an history of confrontational editing" gets a complete pass. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> 16:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The dispute on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">Collapse of the World Trade Center</a> and the talk page there which led to MONGO's block of Pokipsy76, ostensibly for "vandalism", has continued to degenerate into increasing incivility and personal attacks by all sides... followed by MONGO blocking SkeenaR and CB Brooklyn for those personal attacks. Both users have objected to this given MONGO's involvement in the dispute and one attempted to bring those objections here with IP edits while blocked. MONGO has reverted those edits and the situation continues to deteriorate.</p>

It is my opinion that the user needs to be asked, by multiple users, to stop edit warring, as I have repeatedly attempted to clarify the 3RR to him, to no avail.

<li>I shall contribute to defence against this German nationalism in any other means possible. Deletion of information about Wehrmacht war crimes or persecution of Poles in Prussia shows how biased Wikipedia has become by being dominated by members of some national groups do to their numerical advantage.</li>

There is definitely a need for greater deliberation and less hostility (more light, less heat) in this situation so perhaps it will do some good. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:30, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>MONGO and Pokipsy76 were arguing offensively with one another on Greg's talk page.We do NOT encourage people to engage in flame wars on the talk page of a third party.My block was intended as a "tap on the shoulder", to get his attention and underscore the message that flamewarring on third party talk pages is not acceptable.MONGO's reaction to it tells me that he is in dire need of an attitude adjustment, however, and I think he should consider either (a) a wikibreak or (b) resigning his adminship. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 22:05, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that's not the point - after all Pokipsy76's only edit there was <i>before</i> Gmaxwell asked you both to stop, and he was 'blocked' too. It's just generally 'poor form' to import an argument onto someone else's talk page. Not a 'blockable offense' under any policy, but then '15 minutes' isn't what I'd call a 'real' block either. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:14, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm at stress level zero. Kelly Martin had zero basis for a block, her commentary above was rude to an extreme. I am not blind to this. I was trying to inform Gmaxwell, that I believe thatthere was no content dispute, he responded and I responded back and to a comment made by a another and I didn't see that Gmaxwell had asked that we not start a forest fire on his page. Both the third party and myself were blocked by Martin. I don't care if it was for 15 minutes or fifteen seconds...you want to talk about abuse of sysop tools...that is a prime example. A polite request is the normal procedure I am confident.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:54, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You might want to remain a little more civil. Implying that Kelly Martin was not a "proper" editor because she had not brought an article to featured status was unnecessary, uncalled-for and uncivil. As for the topic at hand, I endorse the blocks, and Kelly Martin has my full support. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna648_4a6e.html" title="User:Werdna648">Werdna</a> <a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna648_bc69.html" title="User talk:Werdna648">(talk)</a> 13:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't endorse them. It's not appropriate to block for whatever length of time without a warning, unless you're blocking something like a bot zooming through the encyclopedia pulverizing it. There are only two choices with a 15-minute block: either it's designed to mortify and embarrass, which is not what we should be about, or it's not designed as a meaningful gesture at all, in which case don't do it either.MONGO is not a child to be "love-tapped". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:36, 26 June 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I don't endorse the block either. We can say it's not a big deal, as it was only fifteen minutes, but I imagine that having it there permanently on one's block log causes more mortification than the very temporary inconvenience of not being able to edit. The block was counter-productive because there's now <i>more</i> ill feeling than there was before. Mongo's posts did not amount to violations of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, and there was no reason to block, <i>especially</i> without warning. Unless we see our role on Wikipedia as punishing people for violations of good manners, we should try to avoid demeaning good-faith editors by handing out unexpected blocks. An editor should never be blocked for something that isn't against policy, and that he didn't know could lead to a block. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The goal we all share is to de-escalate this so we can get back to doing useful work. I'm sure Kelly Martin intended the block to do that. Even though it was done in a good-faith, it didn't have that desired result. Well, we've all made well-intended mistakes. What we don't need is to start blocking each other out of process for making out-of-process blocks. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:10, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure where I should take a possibly long-term luke-warm dispute like this, so I'm pleading my case here. We need some help de-biasing this article. It has been the subject of a few recent revert wars, one of which I was involved in. There are some rather blasphemous examples of Jesus in this article, and a group of editors believe that this information should be left out until more positive examples can be found that balance out the controversial info. Does the NPOV policy extend to balancing facts? As I interpret it, it does not, it only calls for a neutral <i>presentation</i> of the facts, but perhaps I'm wrong. I've tried to establish a discussion on the talkpage in order to recieve some input from both sides, unfortunately, the editors who want to leave out controversial information are mostly AOL IPs that don't communicate. Someone please help me, I don't want another edit war to flare up a few days from now, which could possibly land me a 3RR block. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> 23:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Unfortunately, blocking Wiki for *seventy-two* hours doesn't do a lick of good, so I'm sure he can do a day standing on his head.

<li>The amazing thing to me about this fight with Wiki-Star—and please, make no mistake, I think he's an idiot of the first order and a destructive presence at Wikipedia—is that you guys have been content to just argue and argue and argue and argue and revert and revert and revert and revert at for months now. Aren't you tired of it? We have other <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> methods, you know, from mediation to RfCs right up to arbitration—why not try some? It feels like the current strategy is to let him keep being an ass, tattle here and hope someone blocks him for a long time, which, given his personality, will probably work but isn't really the Wikipedia way, I don't think. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 04:38, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that... Listen, you can try to be "nice" to him all you want, you can try to communicate and discuss the problem with him in a civil and respectful manner a dozen times, you can try to come up with different ways to handle this situation a million times, you can ban him for 24, 48, 72 hours, hell even a week only to see him return and act in the same disrespectful, ignorant, uncivil, hostile, manner that he has grown accustomed to. Not once has he listened to the voice of reason, do you actually think he is going to listen to an admin, much less a mediator? The fact of the matter is this plain and simple. Wiki-star has been, is, and always be Wiki-star, and unless the proper measures are taken, then he will continue to roam Wikipedia doing the same thing he has done since the very second he typed in his name and password for the first time. -<a href="../../../3/b/u/User%7E3bulletproof16.html" title="User:3bulletproof16">3bulletproof16</a> 04:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who said anything about being "nice"? You want "the proper measures" taken (i.e., you want him banned), arbitration is a better route to go than just complaining on AN/I and hoping you find a sympathetic admin. But there's a process to go through before you get to ArbCom. I'm suggesting that you start that process. If you are right about Wiki-Star—and I have no doubt you are—he will continue to shoot himself in the foot, but you'll have a firmer foundation for your complaints. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 05:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Dude, I'm not even a <i>party</i> to most of it; to be truthful, this is my first time filing a compaint versus the guy &amp; I'm just sick of hearing about it. But knowing what I do of the user, harmony is kiboshed five minutes in, regardless of the undertaking or best intentions. People have discussed, <i>discussed</i>, <i><b>discussed</b></i> resolution over the hill and around the mulberry bush and through the bend and back again - they...will... not... play. Arbitration is a wash, given his personality. Consensus is a failure, as his definition of the word is the conformity and embracement of his own ideas. It's ultimately an exercise in futility, as time would be better spent head-butting dead pixels out of one's monitor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The editors of the article have reached consensus, - multiple times actually, not to put too fine a point on it - of which Wiki-star has utterly ignored. Do you <i>honestly</i> think that negotiation, mediation, and arbitration under <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> will make *any* difference when all else has failed and Wiki marches to his own drummer regardless? After all that's transpired, the benefit of the doubt doesn't swing in his favor in matters where *his* article is concerned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And about that - it's not even about some inane animated character, something I've seen other editors take a bit of flak about. It's all in the attitude, and Wiki-star has it in spades (brace for verbage three steps beyond <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>) - a masters in dickery with a minor in disruptive behavior &amp; being outright crass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>How can you say that arbitration would not matter given that many disruptive users have been banned from the articles they were disrupting via ArbCom decisions? Please take 20 minutes to browse the ArbCom decisions archive to see for yourself. As Rodii has said, go through the process. It does work. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 05:43, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry; it's just that it's so *frustrating* to have gone through all this for so long without resolution, even if it <i>is</i> a tad hasty to give up before all avenues have been reached.

He has a certain fascination with Shirer's book, prompting him to add large quotes from it in multiple articles. He does not seem to understand that we strives towards neutrality here, and that we cannot have copyrighted material here (a few sentences could be fair use; he was posting multiple paragraphs).
