It for the same reason we shouldn't block ourselves or protect our own pages. There was apparently an arbitration case against Arminius, which is why Wolfman wanted the history kept. I have no reason to get into a history war with an admin I know nothing about; the only reason I'm involved is because I watch VfU. If he had done as I asked, I would support the deletion of his talk page, but his actions make me wary, and I wonder if it would be best if the page history was kept.

<dd>If there is indeed an arbitration case ongoing against Arminius as suggested above, his talk page should be retained for administrative purposes. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:22, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The arbitration case was closed <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Arminius_c602.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Arminius">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Arminius</a> with the comment "as long as Arminius realizes that future misconduct would be dealt with far more severely (as a second offense, so to speak)". An important part of the evidence in that case refered to discussions on the talk page. While the case is closed, there is no good reason to delete the evidentiary history. I seriously doubt any non-admin would be allowed to do so. There is even less reason to allow an admin to delete such history since the case concerned abuse of admin privileges. Note that it's the deletion of <i>history</i> that I object to, not the deletion of page content. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 01:15, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, technically a pre-emptive objection is not itself enough to prevent deletion of a user page requested by the user. That would allow any grudge holder to effectively permanently deny another user a common right simply by objecting and never rescinding the objection. Any decision of that nature should be made by community consensus. Normally (barring evidence of policy violations) a user page may be deleted and the objection handled <i>after</i>, along the lines of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_undeletion_17bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion">Objection</a>, automatic undeletion, VfD. Wolfman is correct, though, in pointing out that this talk page contains evidence of policy violations. That in itself is a show-stopper. If this were a regular user, I would advocate deleting the history (available for undeletion if another case is brought before the next database purge) since the evidence relates to a closed case and since the user's conduct during the case was exemplary. I cannot so advocate in this case, however, since the history involves alleged abuse of admin privileges. If no cases are brought against him within six months of the close of the last one, I would advocate allowing the deletion of the history. For the moment, since deletion, objection, and undeletion have taken place, the next step is VfD. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 07:19, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I appreciate (I guess) Wolfman's continued passion for vengence because I blocked him for one of his offenses. The arbcom case was dropped because ultimately it was not seen as worthy by review not only by the arbcom but by both signatories to the original case, based on my conduct after. Also its important to note the only real issue was my conduct with Chameleon. Eitherway, the history of statements is documented in the archive, despite the evidence not being relevant, as the case was dropped. Perhaps people should focus on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Important to note that the talk page is not really <i>deleted</i> as such as the history can be reivewed or restored by admins..obviously. This whole little episode is pretty silly, no evidence is lost and this is often done by admins. Not only that, the arbcom case was dropped this is merely an effort to exert control over my talk page by a user with issues. Perhaps this could be relevant had I actually faced censure or been involved in a current dispute in which the extensive history of my talk page was relevant..maybe. I deleted the talk page and started over as I was playing with my own page format (something just about ever user does particularly admins) not to "hide" a well documented non-event.</p>
<p>Wolfman, I assure you, anything that is done on wikipedia is documented somewhere (in this case a few places) so if want to continue your witchhunt or misdirect your own personal issues with yourself towards me, you will have ease in gathering meaningless evidence.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't much give a crap at this point about whether the page is deleted or not but I would like it to be or at least to the point orginally before undeleted for my conveinence. I'm not going to be on the wiki much do to more important obligations in my real life, I think the well meaning admins who unfortunetly got dragged into this rather odd episode would better spend their time editing or patroling wikipedia productively as it seems to be their custom, and Wolfman better to edit wikipedia or even better <b>Get a Life</b>.&#160;;) <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArminius_74cf.html" title="User:Arminius">Arm</a> 12:24, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>of course, WP needs its addicts. But an admin cannot go around violating the 3RR, much less ignore being blocked (I suppose it's technically feasible to make blocks of admins effective. It would just be sad to admit such an implementation is even necessary). You would think a 5000 page watchlist should leave no time for edit wars... I'm not saying "de-admin Everyking", mind you, I have not looked at the details. But <i>in case</i> he insists the rules don't apply to him, well, he can also tend his watchlist without admin powers. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 08:23, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>His statement: "the project can't afford to have me blocked for so long." is rather worrying. I have opposed the RFC on Everyking, feeling that the problem was one that could be solved by normal editing (that is proving true on Autobiography, the Ashlee Simpson album). But this incident gives me concern that he feels enabled to make unilateral decisions because of his perception that his continued functioning as an editor is a paramount consideration for the welfare of the Wikipedia project. No one editor is that essential. He's apparently on his way to becoming a rogue administrator. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:13, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Tony. I'm only familiar with the Ashlee Simpsons dispute in passing, not involved, but in my opinion it pales next to Everyking's behavior re the block. A rogue admin would be a serious threat to WP's integrity.

<dd>well, if an admin went on a vandal spree, he could be emergency-de-adminned by a bureaucrat. Did ek actually say "the project can't afford to have me blocked for so long." (diff?), or is this a paraphrase? Obviously, nobody is that essential to the project. Some people are more important to it than others, of course, but as long as the foundation persists, and remains in possession of servers and bandwith, WP will continue to prosper. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:50, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Thanks. So it appears that he was specifically referring to a 24-hour block for 3RR violation, the possibility of which had been raised owing to his propensity for near-3RR editing. I believe that it was later that he boasted about his ability to perform four reverts in twenty-four hours and one minute with impunity (this kind of margin-testing is a practice that I think is so wildly provocative as to merit a blocking in itself; then again I think the 3RR is far too lenient in the first place.) --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:46, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think someone on the mailing list pointed out that all or most of the entries in the edit list attributed to Everyking since he was blocked are due to his use of the admin rollback feature (which is not blocked). It was also stated that his use of the feature seemed to be sensible. In the light of this, I withdraw my speculation that he may be turning rogue and apologise to Everyking. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:58, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have unblocked Everyking. His original 24 hrs block is up as of now. He did <i>not</i> revert <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a> a 5th time as was stated in the second block comment. It seems the issue of using rollback on unrelated articles while blocked needs a policy clarification. I'm quite of the mind that this is actually a good way for an admin to atone for whatever it was that got him/her blocked in the first place - as long, of course, as it is only used to rollback simple vandalism and not anything even remotely related to the blocking issue (or that requires talk page edits). But others are of the opinion that no edits should be allowed - whether using rollback or otherwise - so this needs discussing -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 01:16, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know where the best place to discuss it would be, but I, for one, believe admins who are blocked should have the same edit rights as normal users who are blocked, i.e. none, not even rolling back edits. I understand the reasons that admins retain the ability to block and unblock (see <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>), but I do not agree that they should be given special editing privileges.

<p>I didn't violate the 3RR, except according to an extremely liberal interpretation of the 3RR that counts as a revert any change to the text that matches an old version and not a newer version. So basically: other user deletes half the article. I restore that half. That goes on three times. Then, since I'm mindful of the rule, I just restore part of one paragraph, a small portion of my preferred version. And Rick blocks me. And then, since I'm blocked, the only way I can continue to contribute for 24 hours is to do RC patrol for vandalism using rollback. And Rick, apparently, has a problem with that. Well, I don't know what to say. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:31, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not an 'extremely liberal interpretation', that's an entirely valid interpretation - people gaming the 3RR have been (quite justifiably IMO) nailed on that one plenty before.

<dd>Well, it's not a revert. It's a partial restoration of content. We should probably add something saying that the 3RR is not limited to just reverts; an admin can decide pretty much anything is a revert, depending on his or her interpretation. And I think Rick ought to apologize to me for extending my block while accusing me of reverting a fifth time when I hadn't even touched the article since his initial block. It almost appears he's throwing accusations around just to make me look bad. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:34, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with David on this. "Other user deletes half the article. I restore that half" is unequivocally a description of one instance of a revert.

<dd>ek, you seem to have a rather private interpretation of '3RR' and 'vandalism'. Vandals usually don't argue their edits on talk pages. And 'partial restorations' count as reverts, too, you may want to re-read the policy. Now, I'm not saying you acted in bad faith. You need accept that the same rules apply to you as to everybody else, especially as an admin, even if you don't like it when somebody cuts some of your text from an article. Also, a block is a block. If it had been <i>clearly</i> an inappropriate block, somebody would have unblocked you. You are free to start a complaint against Rick, but as an admin, you need to have the good grace to bear a block without exploiting you privileges. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:53, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>Tony, I assumed that when he mentioned vandals he could only mean the vandals I rolled back, because I had not called anyone else a vandal. Is that not obvious? And the vandals did not discuss; they blanked pages and added profanity. It all seems very simple to me. Presumably Dbachmann was confused and thought I had used rollback against my opponents in the dispute, and he was thinking I was saying that I was calling my opponents vandals, and was saying that vandals don't discuss—because you all have been discussing. I pointed out that the vandals had not been discussing and pointed out what they had been doing; I was pointing out the difference between those I rolled back and those I reverted ordinarily prior to being blocked. It seems you are always ready to assume bad faith with me, even when it takes incomprehensible logic to do so.

<dd>When Everyking begins his defense of his rollbacks, he segues into non-Ashlee Simpson articles, but earlier in the thread, silsor shows that the vandalism rollbacks were not the cause of the block, while the Ashlee Simpson reverts were. This subject is very complex, and it's probably best that everybody specify which actions they're referring to.

Not using rollback, though, just normal reverts. Then, once I was blocked, the only way I could think of to still contribute was to do RC patrol against vandalism, and I rolled back a lot of it. Page blanking and profanity and such. Then Rick came here and complained about that, although I'm not sure why. So I was defending my use of rollbacks against vandalism while under Rick's block. Although frankly I can't understand why I need to defend that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it seems in fact to be the case that admins were deliberatly granted access to the rollback feature even when blocked. But, you know, it seems to defeat the point of a block for violation of the 3RR, somehow, if the subject of the block is allowed to continue ... reverting stuff. That said, as long as ek kept away from reverting the disputed article during his block, we may argue that he did honour the block. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:24, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>It's not that admins were not granted access after being blocked. Blocking came after admins and blocking was deliberately limited in effects. A block is not, and is not intended to be, a temporary desysopping. Remember that admins are supposed to be addressing conduct only. If a block is effective in ending a revert war, that's all that's required. Though why a block was used instead of page protection, when only one page appears to have been involved, puzzles me, since it seems excessive for the purpose. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 23:59, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Again the sneaky personal attack. Are you really saying that, in the case of a 3RR violation, the page should automatically be protected instead of the person who violated the rule being blocked? Are you saying that the block was not justified, that even though Everyking HAD violated the rule, it doesn't matter? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:09, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What sneaky personal attack? You chose one option, a 3RR block, when another option, page protection, was available, for an edit which has resulted in various people disagreeing over whether it was actually contrary to the 3RR. Whether your view that it was in fact a violation of the 3RR was accurate is something for the community to sort out. Yes, you are able to block after three reverts but that does not mean that you are required to do so - you're supposed to choose the most suitable tool. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 00:45, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Once again, I was very careful not to break the 3RR and I do not believe that I did. Restoring 10% or 20% of my preferred version just cannot qualify as a revert.

<dd>Translation: You were very careful to game the system. The point of the 3RR is not to allow three reverts every 24 hours, it's to let admins deal with edit wars. And no, in the case I believe we're talking about, you didn't restore "10% or 20%", you restored 100% over the course of three edits, of approximately 10%, 30%, and 60%. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 00:42, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as someone whose interaction with this article has been limited to passively reading it (&amp; shaking my head over the content of the Talk pages), in the state you work to keep it I find the article hard to read. Data needs to be pruned from this article to make it accessible to the casual readers -- like me. You can argue all you want about how every detail needs to be kept in these articles to make them worthy of <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, but you've included more material about Ashley Simpson than I would want to know even about the bands I am devoted to. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:19, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is a reason we have summary style, you know. It's not good, as I see it, to "prune" notable, relevant information. Any subject could perhaps be described in two sentences, but that doesn't mean one would want to describe it in two sentences only, if it's worth a few volumes. Such a description would be woefully inadequate and would leave the reader disappointed and force him or her to look elsewhere for his or her information. There was an intro for the simple basics. Then there were sections for details. And then there were subarticles for more details. Just a standard system. I really quite strongly disagree with the idea that some of the content is nonnotable. People have been accusing me of adding trivia, but the fact is that I've consciously avoided that. There is a level at which something can be <i>comprehensive</i> without going into trivial detail, and that's what I was aiming for. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:20, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're missing an important point here. There is a consensus among current participants in the dispute that the old versions were too large, with too much detail, yes. But was there a consensus to remove 80-90% of the content? I think not. People just wanted it to be a bit trimmed, and some people wanted certain areas to actually be expanded. But unfortunately the dispute has led to the intervention of some editors who are far more deletionist than any of the initial participants, and these are the people who have been reducing the articles to stubs. I regret that I was not more open to cutting a bad deal early in the game, when the articles might have been worsened but only to a moderate degree. Instead I kept fighting and got the radicals drawn in, and now the articles appear to be doomed. So what I'm getting at is that you're not seeing the notion of consensus here for what it really is. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:25, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a content dispute. No problem, we have lots of those. The point of <i>this</i> discussion was ek's behaviour <i>during</i> his block. It seems now that it is legitimate for an admin to do vandalism rollbacks during his being blocked for 3RR violation, <i>as long as they are unrelated to the dispute which led to his being blocked</i>.

<p>Rick, I don't think you should try blocking an admin. Also, you have a habit of rubbing people the wrong way. To be fair, I also have that habit - but the difference is a back off, apologize, and try to undo the damage each time I mess up. Please follow my example!</p>
<p>Everyking, if you feel <i><b>as an admin</b></i> the need to revert the same edit more than three times, maybe you should enlist the help of another admin or two: take turns doing the revert, so you won't be violating the rule.</p>
<p>To all: our rules are not meant to favor trolls or others who seek to flout our policies. Sometimes bold action is required. But let's try to stick together and help each other, okay? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--user:Ed Poor</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 18:26, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admins are not exempt from the rules. Everyking violated the 3R rule, and was rightly blocked for doing so. Also, I suspect you may want to read a little more of the backstory of this issue (Everyking's RFC would be a good place to start), the problem is that there aren't any other editors (let alone other admins) who agree. Sticking together here just because he's an admin is equal to cabalism, and luckily this isn't happening. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 18:31, 2005 Jan 20 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't revert more than three times; I did partially restore some deleted content, but this was not <i>evasion</i> as it is being described as much as "feeling out" what would be acceptable to the other parties involved, in addition to not wanting the article to be devoid of detail.

<p>All, please note that a block is <b>only</b> and deliberately a block on the successful use of the edit this page feature. It is not a ban from all use of the site - it's simply one tool to try to end a possible edit war. If you want to get a 24 hour removal of admin capabilities, that's a different thing and deliberately outside the capabilities admins have. Abuse might be something like using a rollback to continue whaver prompted the block in the first place, or blocking the other participant(s) in that dispute, which could be a quick route to having the sysop capability temporarily removed as well. Remember we're about "stop the problematic behavior", not "punish this person". "Punish" is something no admin is authorised to do - if you find yourself thinking that way about a situation, it's time to let another admin deal with ending the conduct. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 23:26, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

I am very aware of how very badly backlogged CfD is, and to clear it will be a great deal of work (as a result of what in retrospect seems like an implementation shortcut whose savings have been outweighed by the costs - i.e. the design choice to put category membership in article pages, rather than in the category page itself). I get really frustrated when I see the tools that we have for helping with the vast amount of work required here being rendered inoperative for what seem to me to be to be un-reasonable causes - among them what I perceive to be uneven application of rules about bots (being hyper-cautious in some instances, but not in others). There is a huge amount of drudgework there - please take that into account whwn looking at these. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:26, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It had VFD consensus to delete, and is thus a speedy candidate. However, attempting to delete it produces an internal error. Perhaps it should remain listed here as "pending deletion" as soon as the bug is fixed. [[User:Rdsmith4|User:Rdsmith4/sig]] 01:15, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a bug. It's a glitch&#160;:-) Old revisions (I think all those prior to December 2004) have been compressed in the database to save space. As a side effect, this makes deletion of revisions before Dec 2004—and hence articles created before that—impossible for the time being. A future software release will contain the fix that allows deletion of compressed revisions, and then such articles <i>can</i> be deleted. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 07:44, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I have some questions relating to administrator powers and the interaction between those powers and user pages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is your user page protected?</li>
<li>How long has it been protected?</li>
<li>Is this privilege extended to others?</li>
<li>Did you protect it yourself or ask someone else to?</li>
<li>Is there some time limit on how long a user page can be protected?</li>
<li>Is there a policy that governs user pages, I've noticed some people edit others and others protest that and defend their right to say what they want on their page, are there rules about this? If there is no policy, does it constitute vandalism to edit another's user page?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response,</p>

<p>I would appreciate a response to the above, I don't propose to edit the page at all. I noticed it was protected and am entitled to ask, as above, why it is protected, whether it is a privilege only available to yourself, whether it is within Wikipedia guidelines for it to be protected, whether you protected it or procured its protection, what time limit if any exists on its protection. I would appreciate a response, and not a personal attack along the lines that I am planning to edit the page. I pledge not to do so under any circumstances and accordingly invite your response to the questions asked. Clearly it is a sensitive matter, and perhaps warrants wider discussion, although the reason I asked you directly was that there may have already been such a discussion prior to my arrival. If you could answer the questions or just point me to when it was discussed that would be splendiferous.&#160;:-)</p>

<dd>I can't see a problem with a user page being protected. Mine gets vandalised occasionally. If it happens too often, I might protect mine too. Why are you so concerned Ollieplatt, since you don't intend to edit it? What business could it possibly be of yours?-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 08:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which brings up an interesting point - what do we do with people who routinely violate the 3RR? Clearly the maximum penalty laid out in <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> (24 hours) doesn't deter some people, and arbitration is a lot of work.

<dd>they break it routinely, you block them routinely. Not much different from random anon vandalism. The 3RR keeps the edit histories relatively clean and slows down edit wars, it doesn't aspire to solving anything else. I am afraid rfc+arbcom is the only way to go. But I agree we'll need some sort of "court martial" arbitration dealing with routine cases, to save time and energy. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:30, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>This now seems - through group effort - to have been cleaned up completely. Block him early when he comes back. Blocks are easier to undo than page moves.

<dd>There's a current discussion on the mailing list about the spirit vs. the letter of the law on the 3 RR policy, and consensus there seems to be that 4 reverts in less than 25 hours, or even maybe more, is grounds for blocking. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:14, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd argue that consensus is still a little nebulous -- I don't know that it can be stated as boldly as Rick just did (though I agree with the statement he makes, and I think he's right that at least the voices on the mailing list are moving towards that consensus). What I think is clear is that the community consensus (with an important but small minority opposed) is that reverts are a really sucky way of interacting here and we're irritated enough by them that we don't want the 3RR to be interpreted as "keep pushing 3 reverts a day, every day, until you get your way". So users who watch the clock and start punching in reverts once the 24 hours is up are irritating most of the community, and if they do this with any frequency, I'd say the community would probably not complain if (after careful and clear repeated warnings about exactly what the consequences were) that kind of users got put in the timeout corner for a day. I know if I had reverted three times, and then waited until 24:30 after my first revert to revert again (thinking how cleverly I'd gamed the system), it wouldn't shock me (though I might whine a bit) to be blocked as violating Wikiquette and general good faith. But that's just me. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:27, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite, I think - we seem to have rough admin consensus, not policy, that it's gaming the system.

<p>It is quite obvious to me that you know very little about what happened but nonetheless chose to take matters into your own hands. Not a very commendable act for a sysop, but then you are so new--to Wikipedia and to sysophood--that I can hardly expect you to know your ass from your elbow. So, here it is. I did not block in a content dispute in which I was involved. I blocked because <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> was deleting important information--breaking news, as a matter of fact, about a revolution in Central America, given by a trusted user before he left the capital with his wife. He could not find any information about it on Google, so he decided to erase it. Johnleemk then came to the mistaken conclusion that this was "original research," not actually knowing what the parameters of original research are, or what that rule was intended for. As for blocking without a warning, yes, I did that. This was a clear case of vandalism to content that was unique to Wikipedia and important. I have no compunctions about doing that, I have done so for the past three years, and will continue to do so if I feel someone is vandalizing important content. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 20:08, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the issue was more complex than I thought.

<dd>you cannot go around blocking people for edits you don't like, additions or removals. I sense a tendency of admins becoming more trigger-happy, recently... Danny should re-read policy, and especially what is considered vandalism on WP. I warning would have been the very least.

<dd>Wikipedia is not a primary source, and neither is a "trusted user" of Wikipedia. This block was without grounds, and outside of policy.

<p>I would like to add my side of the story. I believe that this whole situation was due to several misunderstandings.</p>
<p>For my part, I should have made a greater effort to understand what Belizian was posting. I do now understand that he was posting a legitimate breaking news story. However, this was very difficult to see from the original summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_events&amp;oldid=9509593" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_events&amp;oldid=9509593" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> which was extremely long for a Current Events summary and had numerous spelling errors. The story didn't get any hits on Google news and the source provided by Belizian was a week old. Also, this source didn't appear to be especially reputable upon initial inspection as many of the headlines ended in exclamation points (ex: "Castrate, cut penis off, hang, whip, torture rapists and child molesters!"). All in all, it did not seem to belong on the Current Events page. I removed the summary, only to see Belizian repost it. In an attempt to avoid a revert war, I wrote a message on Belizian's talk page <a href="../../../b/e/l/User_talk%7EBelizian_c28c.html" title="User talk:Belizian">User Talk: Belizian</a> explaining why I believed his story didn't belong on Current Events. I removed the story again and was blocked shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>For Danny's part, I believe he could have spent more time examining the situation instead of blocking as his first (and only) action. I never received a warning or an explanation of what I had done wrong, either before or after I was blocked. When I noticed that I had been blocked, I emailed Danny to ask why I had been blocked. I asked him to look at the diffs and requested that I be unblocked. Within a minute or two, Danny replied with one word: "No". There were no explanations or answers to my questions. I emailed Danny again, asking him to expand on his "No", but never received a reply. I then emailed several other admins asked them to review the matter.</p>
<p>For Belizian's part, I think he could have done a better job explaining that he was reporting first-hand information. This is unusual on the Current Events page since the vast majority of stories are from media sources. A short note on the talk page could have prevented many, if not all, of these problems.</p>
<p>I'm really not very happy with the way this situation was handled or with Danny's attitude towards the admin (<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">User:fvw</a>) who finally saw the absurdity and unblocked me. I'm going to take a Wikibreak but I will likely return sometime in the future.

<dd>WP is not bloody CNN, we do not <i>need</i> 'breaking news' before any other site has it. If we allow 'first hand accounts', we are open to all sorts of hoaxes. Even if this was a 'trusted user', there is <i>no</i> reason for a sysop, especially an experienced one, to block someone for a good faith edit instead of reverting, expalaining and/or warning. PS, I realize Belizian is a good contributor. But Carrp <i>did</i> put a polite explanation of his removal on his talk page. He could easily have reverted and explained. I do not see any reason for a block here for miles around. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:30, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I find it funny to read the bloody google argument. Since when has google become <b>god</b> for verifying information? Danny is a respected user and so is Belizian. Danny had reason to block as vandalism was in progress. He should have done it for a shorter period like 2 or 3 hours maybe. User Carpp was deleting information plain and simple. And at those kind of moments the following goes: <i>wikipedia is intended to build an accurate and up-to-date encyclopedia. it is not an exercise in democracy</i>. With the emphasis on up to date. Current events might have been the wrong place, but since nobody had started a Revolution in Belize in 2005 article yet it was the only place to put it for now. I know most wikipedians do not consider a revolution in Belize worthy enough as they are to American/Euro centric in their thinking. There are no Europeans/Americans wounded or dying so nobody writes about it. Wikipedia is a project to accumalate <b>ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE</b> and not to accumalate <b>ALL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WESTERN COUNTRIES AND OH YES WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT IN A BIT ON THE REST OF THE WORLD AS WELL</b>. Although the block was to long, I still support Danny for doing that. I would have probably done the same. Vandalism is vandalism. And to the people yelling that Danny should have read the rules: <b>he wrote half of them, just look at the history</b> <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 12:46, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I explained on Belizian's talk pages that I did not believe this belonged on the Current Events page. I never would have removed information from an article such as Revolution in Belize in 2005.</dd>
<dd>As for Google being 'god', I certainly don't believe that. However, when Google has <b>zero</b> mentions of a news story, a user should be mention why this story merits being posted on Current Events. As I mentioned above, a simple note from Belizian on the Current Events talk page could have avoided a lot of problems. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 13:20, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>agree with Filiocht. How is having (co-)written the rules a reason bend them? Admins are <i>janitors</i>, and are not to abuse their powers in content disputes. They should also have the nerve to discuss first and revert (or block) later. Google is a source of sources, nothing else. If google doesn't know your source (e.g. printed material), just cite it, but cite your sources you must. This <i>may</i> have been a content dispute, but we don't know, because Danny didn't bother to ask. Maybe Carrp would just have said "fine, put it back", case solved. It certainly wasn't vandalism. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:32, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<b>Filiocht</b> it isn't a red herring. Wikipedia does have a bias on articles with regards to areas outside of the western intrest. I am struggling with it daily on nl: wikipedia for over a year, so are other Dutch users in other parts of the world editing on nl:. Here on English wikipedia someone asked me just today should we really mention all the stations on the Bangkok metro? What a stupid question offcourse we need to. All the stations of NY are mentioned are they superior to the Bangkok ones???

<b>Carpp</b> reread it and you will understand that there is no room for original research. An event that has happened and that might not be worldnews because Belize barely makes a dent in international politics but still has happened so is a fact belongs here. In these kind of cases it is called faith. Some wikipedia editors warrant faith because of the way they edit. This guy will not make it up thats for sure. I once wrote an article about a famous sporter in Thailand whom doesn't have any google links. Yet the sporter exists and is famous in Thailand so warrants entry here. One of the reasons I hate editing on the English wikipedia is because most people find policies more important than what wikipedia is. A gathering lace for all human knowledge.

<p>I guess it is time for me to add my two cents here. Let me be straightforward. I do not regret making the block. Valuable information was being added to Wikipedia--information that no one else was reporting at the time--and it came from a reliable source--Belizean, who lives in the country and was witnessing the events unfold and feeding reports from the local radio. In the context of Current Events, that is certainly noteworthy. The material was consistently removed, and I continue to regard that as vandalism, though I understand how Carrp did not see it as such. Regardless, this is what current events is for. I might suggest people refer to the history of the page when the space shuttle exploded. We had it on current events before it even hit the news stations because, and I recall this very well, someone heard the explosion from their home. I did suggest to Belizean that he <i>also report</i> on what happened on Wikinews, but that project is still in its earliest stages and does not have the authority (yet) of Wikipedia. Quite frankly, Current Events is where I generally go to for news on the web. It is up-to-date, taking in information from so many different sources, and trustworthy. I do, however, regret that I blocked Carrp for 24 hours, when an hour block would have sufficed in that instance. That is why I did not reinstate the block when it was lifted. Of course, the information was removed again shortly after as "not notable." I think that is what Waerth refers to as a Western bias, and that is something that we should certainly try to avoid. As for "What Wikipedia is not," in fact we are aiming to be a repository of all human knowledge, both past and current. Jimbo has said that constantly, and I personally have used those exact words when I accepted the Golden Nica Award on behalf of Wikipedia. That information should be encyclopedic (hence, no FAQs, etc.) and it should be NPOV (hence, no advertising). It should, however, be as current as possible. In fact, that is the beauty of this project. It is constantly updating itself with the latest information available (Tsunami information and the exploration of Titan come to mind). So, as for that statement in "What Wikipedia Is Not," it should probably be removed, and I will advocate that. As for warnings, there is an inherent problem in Wikipedia right now. Back in the good old days, everyone knew everybody else. We knew who the trusted users were, and we knew whose information was trustworthy. Similarly, we knew who was just gaming the system. In fact, one highly respected user would go over all the Recent Changes daily, welcome all the new users, and still have time to make a prodigious amount of edits (he is still in the top 10, btw). That has changed. The tightly knit village has rapidly expanded into a city, where even some of the best users are relatively anonymous. While it undoubtedly has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. Whereas sysops once knew each other (and this was long before IRC), today they don't. This sparks distrust, even among the sysop community, and a reliance on rules that were put in place under certain circumstances, which may well have changed considerably as a result of our remarkable growth. Nevertheless, I still believe that the most effective rule of all is <i>common sense</i>. Common sense derives from experience (with other users, with the project as a whole, and with life in general), as well as circumstances. Right now, more than ever, this is important, as the <i>rules</i> were added sporadically and randomly, and may often conflict with other rules. In fact, anyone can edit the rules, and this has been seen to happen. Therefore, until these rules are codified and set in stone, I will continue to act out of common sense, first and foremost. I apologize to Carrp for any inconvenience that this may have caused him, and assure him that this was not a personal invective against him, but rather an effort to maintain the reliabilty and up-to-date nature of our information. I also believe that Wikipedia is a general knowledge base. It must continue to provide all of teh most up-to-date knowledge available. After all, that is what an encyclopedia is--and that is what I will continue to promote in all of my Wikipedia-related activities. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 14:04, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that's a judicious assessment, and certainly fair enough. I agree that wikinews is a very good source, and, had I been aware of it, I would have voted to keep the Belizian's report, too.

<dd>I am completely floored that removal of information which could not be verified, <i>after making a good-faith effort to verify it, and being unable to do so</i>, can <b>possibly</b> be labelled as "vandalism". (Which is not to say I'm 100% cool with removing it - for one, as I said above, I think we're being a little too strict about sourcing, and for another, Google is the wrong place to go to try and find something like this, as they update rather slowly - you'd need to go directly to the BBC or CNN and use their on-site search.) But calling it "vandalism", let alone blocking someone for it? That's utterly unreasonable. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:21, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this is a sock puppet issue, then I don't think that there's any way for admins to know for sure, it could just be another user reverting, or it could be Irate. I think developers can find evidence to see if two users are sockpuppets, so I recommend that you contact them, Vacuum. I, for one, am not going to block somebody on speculation that they violated the 3rr if I don't really have much evidence besides the fact that they reverted the same thing. The template is up for deletion. <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">Clitoris</a> is a perfect place to have that template, but I agree that it isn't necessary. If you want to get rid of it, the best way is to vote at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html#.5B.5Btemplate:Enduring_single-issue_dispute.5D.5D" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion</a>, not to keep on reverting.

<dd>Yes, the inability of the sysops to be able to see whether the IP address is that of the suspected offender is a real problem. It is therefore quite possible for a user to revert three times while logged-in, then three times while not logged-in and then three times for each sockpuppet. It is ridiculous.

<dd>He just did it again, so I tried my hand at it, but it was not clear to me whether I avoided the dread double revert or not. Unfortunately, this also appears to be a way to trick persons into an inadvertent triple revert violation. I know one of my reverts was while this page was a different page, but the history shows it as if it were to the original page. I wonder if moves should be restricted to those trusted with admin powers.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:46, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears that <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZain_engineer_cf12.html" title="User:Zain engineer">User:Zain engineer</a> may have violated the 3RR:</p>
<p><b>21:52, 22 Jan 2005</b> Zain engineer (Rev. Its quite funny that when there is 'concensus' and 'reverts' at the same time. i am some what at Eid holidays but when i saw this funny thing i felt I should contribute)<br />
<b>23:10, 22 Jan 2005</b> Zain engineer (Rev Your Edit comment clearly suggested that u accept there is no concensus. So any edit which was done by using 'concensus' argument was invalid. So this is better working until we find concensus)<br />
<b>23:56, 22 Jan 2005</b> Zain engineer (So if it is all about title then why moved? First justify the move by wikipedia policy)<br />
<b>00:54, 23 Jan 2005</b> Zain engineer (that was not NPOV. That was removed due to 'irrelevance to title' so if title is changed it bcomes NPOV! I didn't revert I edited and mentioned this issue in article! we should solve this move issue)</p>
<p>However, with all the page moving and reverts, I believe the last one was intended to be a revert but didn't end up changing anything due to a move. At a minimum, if Zain isn't already in violation, he's used up his 3 reverts until 21:53, 23 Jan 2005. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 01:05, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>At 22:50 Zain again moved the article to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_violence_against_Palestinian_children_0288.html" title="Israeli violence against Palestinian children">Israeli violence against Palestinian children</a>. To be more accurate he created a new article since he knew <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_and_minors_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_5e00.html" title="Children and minors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Children and minors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> was protected.

<dd>Thing is that method is incorrect. For example what if I think 'holocaust' is POV Title as it ignores the deaths of Germans in world war. What if some body moves it to a move 'NPOV' Title.

<dd>A VfD was done, and it was agreed the contents should be moved, or title changed. A second vote was taken on the Talk: page itself, and of the dozen people voting, it was nearly unanimous that the article should be moved/title changed. The small minority thought it should be deleted altogether. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 23:25, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well those votes on talk page don't count at all in the policy so me along with many other simply ignored the vote.

That vote was useless. it was not according to any wikipedia policy. And Funnies thing is that you connected it with vfd. So if it was bcoz of vfd why it wasn't moved immediately after vfd???? Why it took so long?</dd>

<dd>If I understand you correctly, the page was not immediately moved because VfD (currently) offers only a recommendation to move the page. Further changes to the article are to be decided on the talk page as needed, just like any other article. Do note that WP:RM says that it's only used when the talk page produces no consensus. As it happens, the vote was nearly unanimous with the only dissent expressed that it should be deleted altogether or simply turned into a redirect. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 09:59, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
