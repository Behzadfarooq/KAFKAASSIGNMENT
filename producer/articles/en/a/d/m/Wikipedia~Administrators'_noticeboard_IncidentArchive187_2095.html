<p>Sorry to bother you, I would like to report a User (davidrusher) making threats against me on the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Talk%7EMen%27s_Rights_0e21.html" title="Talk:Men's Rights">Men's rights talk page</a>: <i>since it is obvious that we have at least one feminist (Cailil) who is misusing Wiki standards to force a feminist world perspective on the MRM, and where he is attempting to prevent a real definition of the movement on Wiki by attempting to "single me out" and somehow being unqualified to present a credible overview of the movement, I will do an article about this over the weekend, and publish it on at least a dozen major websites.</i> and <i>Apparently at least one of the folks editing this section need an education from MRM's. This is our section, and no feminists will be allowed to mess it up. I request that Cailil's editing privileges be revoked. He has proven himself to be a feminist censor, not a balanced editor.</i>. I'm really not sure what to do. I apologise if this is the wrong to place to post this.

<dd>If not threatening, it certainly smacks of a <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">article ownership</a> attitude.</dd>
<dd>As we've seen with other groups such as the Scientologists, some folks seem to think that they "own" articles that are about them or their political or other group ... and that they should get to control what is included in them. This is against Wikipedia rules, and other editors should make a point of stepping in to resist article ownership.</dd>
<dd>In this case, it would be useful if Wikipedians who do not think of themselves as either "feminists" or "men's rights advocates" would step in and take a look. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 01:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree -- it's been quite some time, and the user made what looks to be some good edits before their block. Checking their talk history (deleted or otherwise) and looking for links to their user/talk pages hasn't dug up any terrible history of abuse. I see no problem with an AGF-unblock. Let it be clear that further problems would lead to another block, but I generally trust them to know where the line is. *nod* Seems genuine.

<p>Dear Wiki Administrators, user <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETengri_d8c6.html" title="User:Tengri">Tengri</a> has been blocked by admin <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> indefinitely being accused as a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">myself</a>. The blocking was made at the accusation of user <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> who made a request at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser</a> accusing 6 different users of being sockpuppets of <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a>. It's clear from the discussion at <a href="../../../a/z/e/Talk%7EAzerbaijan_c54f.html" title="Talk:Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan Talk</a> page from several users that <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> is involved in constant POV and arbitrarily removes scholarly references from the Wiki pages, often unilaterally making decisions and even insisting what should and should not be shown without any consensus. This results in blocking of several pages at Wiki. My repeated requests to admin <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> have not been properly addressed, neither could he legibly prove me his claim that <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETengri_d8c6.html" title="User:Tengri">Tengri</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> is the same person, only because we are friends and used the same IP a week ago.

<p>Both racially and being mocked.</p>
<p>This member <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECali567_0aba.html" title="User:Cali567">User:Cali567</a> had already been given warnings of not to attack others, but he has continued to vanadlise my talk page in Seong0980. I have reached out in my talk page and suggested he could be a nice person, and I apologised if I made any incorrect suspicions, but he keeps on calling me crap, amongst other racial puns. This is getting really annoying, and he doesn't seem to care if he gets IP blocked unitl it has happened to him. Please help.</p>
<p>From the discussion board in another area, he said: "Now a little tattle-tail is going and trying to get administrators on his side...I'm NOT SORRY FOR SAYING THAT and I'm NOT sorry for adding that he may be of Asian descent!." (in the Talk - 1st World&#160;: cocpy and paste to locate) I am thinking, is Wikipedia anti-Korean, thus he was not given a punishment? I am still deeply insulted that he is still making smart remarks.

I consider this is quite a reasonable request under the circumstances. His response on <a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html#Proposed_Wiki_Project" title="User talk:Ddstretch">my own talk page</a> has merely been to ask me to "Chill Out About It", with a further comment, but no apology. I would be happy if I could get a view from any admin people about whether his actions were wrong, whether my response was unreasonable, and what should happen now, if anything.

<p>My feeling is that he wasn't being deliberately dishonest in adding the names, but (as his previous behaviour has shown) he has very poor judgement, especially in his interactions with other editors.

<dd>Ok. I am happy to go with the view that it should be dropped. I am sad he did not seem able to apologise, as I did state that I would be happy to support the project so long as he did apologise for his actions.

<p>I've been noticing a few users having this section in their userpages. A recent discussion is taking place at <a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhalidkhoso_5470.html#Countries_you_don.27t_like" title="User talk:Khalidkhoso">User talk:Khalidkhoso#Countries you don't like</a> where <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">User:Aminz</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">User:Proabivouac</a> are asking that user to consider removing that from his userpage. Other users who are also concerned by this are <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html#Countries_that_I_consider_threats_to_World_Peace_and_Humanity" title="User:Szhaider">User:Szhaider#Countries that I consider threats to World Peace and Humanity</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExpatkiwi_7ee2.html#Countries_and_Groups_I_don.27t_like" title="User:Expatkiwi">User:Expatkiwi#Countries and Groups I don't like</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">User:Shamir1</a>. Maybe there are other userpages out there.</p>
<p>I personally consider these userpages' contents as inflammatory and unnecessary and believe these sections should be removed because they are discouraging to other contributors and distract from our task of creating an encyclopaedia. We already have a policy which prevents users to have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/Wikipedia:Username#Inappropriate_usernames" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/Wikipedia:Username#Inappropriate_usernames" rel="nofollow">inflammatory username</a> but i am wondering if this case is covered by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a blog, webspace provider, or social networking site</a>.</p>

<dd>I get the feeling that this is a newcomer who doesn't quite understand how things are discussed and decided as a community as a whole on Wikipedia. Also, I get the feeling English is not this user's first language - complicating things. Regarding the priority template, a newcomer might ask, "Where did these ratings come from?" Because Wikipedia isn't a database interface unless you are a developer, they could might as well be thinking that any arbitrary user could change these ratings to what they wanted. <span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt;"><a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">x42bn6</span></a> <a href="../../../x/4/2/User_talk%7EX42bn6_bd12.html" title="User talk:X42bn6">Talk</a></span> 17:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the prompt comment. The user also has an account on Japanese Wikipedia and I think Japanese is the user's first language. However, the user seems to be troublesome even on it because of the user's uncomprehension of Wikipedia and a sort of obstinacy. In my feeling, the user could wear out the community of English Wikipedia more easily and I'm afraid some kind of cooperation between English and Japanese Wikipedia communities would be efficient. --<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcavator_8611.html" title="User:Excavator">Excavator</a> 18:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC) <small>change <i>work out</i> to <i>wear out</i> --<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcavator_8611.html" title="User:Excavator">Excavator</a> 15:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

This sort of behaviour seems to be his response to disagreement with other editors; it <i>might</i> be innocent in intent, though he can't be unaware of the problems attached to it, as his earlier accuser made them clear, and Mathmo demonstrated his knowledge of the letter of the law in response. I've left a warning, but other admins might keep an eye open for this sort of thing from him in future. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but just as a follow up: forget about the wikistalking for the moment; one of the changes that he's insisting on is the insertion of a link to a pornographic website (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teenybopper&amp;diff=104064810&amp;oldid=103815214" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teenybopper&amp;diff=104064810&amp;oldid=103815214" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>). I'd removed this from the references section before he'd arrived, but he's now inserting it into the text. It's unnecessary, and there's no indication that it doesn't lead to a document giving an account of the porn-related usage of "teenybopper". What's the policy on such links? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Note from Jimbo:</b> Wow, this is just wildly inappropriate. I spoke to Mr. Pierce by telephone several days ago and the issue was completely resolved back then. I think Zoe's pursuit of this in this way is wildly inappropriate and should cease immediately, and that she should apologize to him for it. I very much do not approve of this kind of random hostility from Wikipedia editors.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 09:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For my part, I think this issue to have been entirely overblown, and I surely can't understand editors' being so irked by a relatively innocuous incitement to vandalism, but I don't think Jimbo's upbraiding of Zoe to be particularly constructive. Zoe appears to have made her role as a "private citizen" (as against an official representative of the Foundation) exceedingly clear in her correspondences (I may have misstated the case a bit; see <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> infra), and there appears here to be no prospective disruption of the project (I suppose one might suggest that were Pierce, for instance, to be fired, bad press for the project might entail, but that's seems rather unlikely), such that, whilst off-Wiki actions that harm the project or imperil editing might be dealt with on-Wiki, there appears to be no need for on-Wiki action or comment here (the issue probably ought not to have been at AN/I at all). I may be altogether puzzled over this stir, and Jimbo might think Zoe's actions to be immoral (I personally have no moral objection), but it is not appropriate for one editor to evaluate the propriety or morality of another editor's actions, especially those that take place off-Wiki and only tangentially affect the project. Jimbo's comment comes very close to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">referencing an editor rather than her conduct</a> and, even as I might agree with his description of this situation, I can't help but understand it has high-handed. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:22, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"I spoke to Mr. Pierce by telephone several days ago and the issue was completely resolved back then." Well that's nice. He or Jimbo should have told Zoe that. It isn't like Mr. Pierce didn't know Zoe was writing to him. No offense, but that lack of communication here from the WMF end is a much bigger problem than Zoe's conduct. If she'd been informed, I doubt she would of continued to pursue this. Someone needs to apologize to her for not letting her know what was going on. Nor was the hostility "random" (AGF Jimbo?). Vandalism is not a "random" subject around here. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:31, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With respect Jimbo, it is worth remembering that Zoe did what she did out of concern for the integrity of Wikipedia, and to protect the encyclopedia. Her actions, if over-zealous, were done in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> and it would do well for us all to remember that we are all valued contributors until it is proven we are destructive influences.

<p>I don't think anyone assumes bad faith here, but Zoe's emails were overly aggressive nonetheless. Things like "Please respond to me, or I may find it necessary to take this information to the press" are simply unacceptable, IMHO. We are supposed to be polite, nice and friendly. And those comments in this thread that compare vandalism on Wikipedia with vandalism in the real world (Y'know, that's where it takes a little bit more than one click to repair the damage that was done) are just mind-blowing. While Jimbo's words could've been a bit more diplomatic, I'm glad he did comment in this thread. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 21:12, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Joe says above that Zoe made her role as a 'private citizen' clear in her messages; actually I think it was quite the opposite from her first letter. I would never think to sign a message "Wikipedia system administrator" (<i>system</i> administrator?) and, even if we in the Wikipedia world know that 'admin' doesn't imply action associated with the Foundation, there's no reason to suppose that Mr. Pierce would have known that. That said, pschemp is right that if the situation had already been resolved, a note to that effect in the original thread would likely have preempted all of this. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 22:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I based that comment on a review of only some of the correspondence, and in my cursory review I somehow missed "Wikipedia system administrator". Though I don't know that one would have inferred from Zoe's note that she was writing in some official capacity, I readily concede that my initial characterization was not quite accurate. To the extent that Jimbo's comments were restricted to Zoe's ostensibly acting as a Foundation representative, they were probably, as Conti observes, not inappropriate (at least in substance if not in tone); I do continue to think, though, that his comments were unnecessarily broad in scope. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

While I'm glad that it's resolved and we can all move on, I think it's important to note that there can be no doubt at all that Zoe's intentions were to protect the integrity of the encyclopaedia, and that she would have dropped the matter immediately if <i><b>either</b></i> Jimbo had stated that the matter had been resolved <i><b>or</b></i> Mr Pierce had agreed not to do it again. I haven't involved myself with this topic so far, but I read various comments about trying to ruin a man and deprive him of his livelihood, etc., and it was obvious that Zoe was looking for a simple assurance that he didn't intend to give this assignment to any future students, and that he was refusing to give this assurance. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 22:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She would have dropped it if Jimbo has stated it had been resolved? What about all the editors and admin who said "hold on a minute this is wrong" - right until the end, Zoe did not acknowledge any concern - she carried on in an entirely high-handed manner. She did not try to get any concensus about WHOM to e-mail or WHAT to email - she just want off as a loose cannon. ---- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFredrick_day_29b1.html" title="User talk:Fredrick day">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fredrick_day_a010.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fredrick day">contribs</a>) 00:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I think that if Jimbo had made it clear here that he'd taken care of it, Zoe (whose efforts in this matter I thoroughly applaud) wouldn't have felt compelled to pursue it. "Random hostility" isn't a good description of her actions at all. Her actions were neither random (Pierce fired the first salvo here) nor hostile (she made a good-faith effort to resolve it directly with Pierce in a way that protected Wikipedia from future attacks). Asking her to stop is completely within Jimbo's rights, but let's not pillory her for actions that a lot of experienced users and admins supported. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 00:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Folks, I think the main point here is that some things just do not rightly fall under the purvey of editors and admins. What should have happened once the Pierce incident was discovered was to report it to Brad and Jimbo. There is a time to "know your role" and not overreach it. There is a time to work through and under authority. This was one of them.

<dd>I agree. Particularly the learning bit. Please let's not forget this incident when something similar happens again in the future.

<dd>What an odd statement. We are talking about a guy who has been hounded for several days, has been accused- <i>totally</i> without any justification whatsoever- of committing a <i>crime</i>, and seems ultimately to have (bizarrely) been threatened with having the G-Men sicced on him! All this for setting a well-intentioned, albeit perhaps a little clumsy, class assignment with a very important and worthwhile aim (and, let us hope, effect). I am fed up with seeing this guy unfairly maligned when he has done absolutely nothing wrong. It strikes me that it is not he that has acted childishly in this scenario.

<dd>I don't see what the big deal is here. Seems to me like a fairly useful and sensible exercise, providing- as he states in the quote above- he undertook to revert all the instances of vandalism himself if it wasn't otherwise done. I also have seen plenty of instances where Wikipedia is used as a citation in student work, or where Wikipedia-derived information is included uncited. It's completely unacceptable, as I think everyone here realises. There are other ways to make this point, but this is a reasonable one in my view (provided no lasting damage is done). Contacting university authorities (who presumably will take no action anyway- what exactly is he supposed to have done wrong, or even contrary to academic regulations?) or the press (who surely are also unlikely to be interested in this non-story) is way, way over the top. Let's keep a sense of perspective. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 23:32, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Per the first section on this matter, the prof had not reverted all the vandalism. Anyway, the issue for us should be that of all the things that can be done on Wikipedia, the students were effectively encouraged to stay away from it except for vandalism. Personally, I think that’s a bad perspective and it is good to protest against it being taught. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 23:41, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow - this is getting totally out of line - so blocks are preventive not punitive but hey by the way, we reserve the right to fuck you over in real life (punitive). He did wrong, he said he was sorry, I would guess he's told the students to stop doing this. Don't you think he gets it? that it was wrong. Isn't that where the community normally stops? the user admits he did wrong and stops his actions (in this case encouraging others to do such edits to wikipedia). At that point, we normally allow registered users to carry on their business - but since we have his name and address, we are going to drive the point home?

<dd>Zoe can probably clarify this, but my impression was he only apologised for the vandalism that he hadn’t reverted himself and that he did not think he did anything wrong in general.

<dd>Yeah, I don't think that getting him into trouble punatively is really an answer, but that he and/or his university to make a statement that it's not cool to vandalize Wikipedia as a class assignment (and they won't do it again) might be a more worthwhile and positive focus. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 23:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've read this entire thread and the earlier one and nowhere do I see that this professor has apologized. From Zoe's description, his response to feedback was to defend the vandalism. I'm not sure how many e-mails Zoe has traded (three tries seems like an appropriate number), but if he proves to be that resistant to input I see nothing wrong with contacting the university's student newspaper. It seems the instructor's aim was to raise awareness about Wikipedia's level of reliability. A good investigative article could do that on a university-wide level as well as explore some relevant questions about academic ethics. Despite what some respondants have posted, this would be preventative rather than punitive: unless some meaningful consequence arises he may repeat the assignment next semester or recommend it to his colleagues. If an individual vandalizes Wikipedia privately then of course we handle it privately, yet he has made an academic assignment of vandalizing Wikipedia - and from the threads I read he did not even undo all the damage that assignment had caused. That <i>teaches</i> his students to violate site policies. Some student journalists could impart a better corrective lesson. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 00:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And if you aren't the professor: I must say, I would be appalled if a professor at my university gave me the assignment to vandalize out of some vindictive annoyance at Wikipedia (and, such professors do exist: they hate seeing it cited in papers, and hate it being plagiarized in papers even more). And, upon being contacted, if he refused to stop, I see no problem whatsoever with contacting the school paper. In other words, if you don't think what you did was wrong, then it won't be a problem if everyone knows about it, right? 128.118.106.28 00:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He did not encourage vandalism out of vindictive annoyance. He did it to demonstrate to his students how unreliable Wikipedia is as a source. If a student found a piece of paper in the street with "the Moon is made of cheese" written on it, surely you would accept that it is not wise to cite that as a source in their next planetary science essay. Wikipedia is a cut above that, but the same principle applies. No student should ever cite Wikipedia in any of their work nor rely upon it any way, unless the topic at hand is Wikipedia itself or something closely related. Teachers who hate seeing it cited in papers and hate seeing it plagiarised are simply doing their job effectively. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I agree the professor in question should make clear he won't do this again, I don't think having Wikipedia editors aggressively demanding a grovelling apology is the right way to go. Any demands should come from our version of 'official'. ie. the WMF office. I personally would be offended if one of the millions of Wikipedia editors took it on themselves to write to me in a situation like this. Apologies if Zoe was acting in some official capacity, but I haven't seen any indication of this so far. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

That's all. Perhaps, Zoe could send another email to him before going to the newspaper, though, relating this. 128.118.106.28 00:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some quick googling reveals that Tim Pierce holds the rank of instructor, and his highest degree is an M.A. This guy isn't a professor<s>, he's a graduate student, with probably less than two years of teaching experience</s>. I think siccing the press on him is a bit heavy-handed, and very likely could have negative effects on his career. He doesn't have the protection of tenure<s>, or even of being a hired employee--he's still a student</s>. Even if Zoe's intent isn't punitive, this situation may very easily result in a punitive effect upon Mr. Pierce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this seems like a disproportionate response to someone's first offense. I don't think it's normal to contact people's real-life employers for on-wiki offenses; it certainly doesn't seem to me like it should be done unless there's an ongoing pattern of abuse. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I don't think that latter part is so cut and dry in this case. Not only are we talking about an employer, but also a body whose members were instructed and proceeded to perform vandalism. If it were just Mr. Pierce himself performing vandalism, I would be in complete agreement. That being said, I think that quickly seeking a promise that he's not going to do this again is probably the best solution to sate all parties involved. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 00:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether Pierce is a prof or a grad student isn't really that relevant. The relevant issue is whether Wikipedia benefits by responding in this fashion. I'm not sure if it does. If we were dealing with large scale or organized vandalism it might make sense. The only argument that might support continued pursuit is that we have had so many of these sorts of instances that it might make sense to make an example of one to deter future problems. However, given that all of these idiots seem to be unaware of almost any previous attempts to do what they've done (and some seem to think of themselves as frightfully clever) I doubt any teacher or prof will be aware of this event occuring even if we get this guy humiliated/sacked/disciplined/reprimanded/whatevered. All of that said, a promise that he isn't going to do this again is highly reasonable to work for, and going to the student paper if necessary to get that sort of statement out of him strikes me as fine. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do think it's somewhat important to note that Pierce isn't a professor, simply because the employment status of adjunct faculty is often tenuous--their contracts are often year to year, or even semester to semester. Adjuncts who find their way into the news--even the campus paper--for anything "controversial" often find that their contracts aren't renewed. It's more difficult for professors to lose their jobs. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 01:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has anyone attempted to contact Henningsen? Seems Henningsen's in a supervisory position, relative to Pierce. I'd suggest that you escalte SLOWLY and judiciously, hitting each step. Direct supervisor, department, dean, and so on. The more steps you take, the better the odds you'll find a sympathetic ear, or hit the 'bull**** ceiling', that is, the point where someone's got too much to do to put up with too much hassle, and calls Pierce on the carpet. As other editors have said, 'Wikipedia ruins Journalism Professor's Career' is how this will play out in the media. 'Internet Nerds versus Student Nerds'. That's the angle that will be portrayed, <i>if</i> anyone in the media bothers to care at all on the slowest news day around. If a button click can undo it, no one will see it a horrible vandalism. I suggest bringing this to Henningsen. He was an attorney, per that page. I suspect he understands that incitement and conspiracy to vandalize are more serious than the idle hands of teens at home. That this was done under the auspices of NIU, and more specifically, where he should've caught the problem, are far more important. Try him before running to the biggest names at NIU. Just one editor's view. (Disclaimer - I am not an Admin.

<li>I provided that info to Pierce, his dept chair and assistant chair and Prof Bryan when I contacted them.</li>
<li>I made no assumption of the accuracy of the first report and asked them not to, either; I asked them to investigate and stated that I took the claimed incident as a serious abuse by someone. I was rather explicit in saying that I didn't know whether Pierce had done it and that they should not act until they were able to determine what happened. I also apologized in advance if turned out that this was a <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_job.html" title="Joe job">Joe job</a> framing Pierce.</li>

<dd>You're right, this is not a game. I don't take WP as a game, and the professors involved didn't take the incident as a game.

I consider that the virtual nature of this box, wherein you do good work, has led you to lose perspective. This noticeboard must never be allowed to become a platform for organizing real-world harassment, however justified you think it may be.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Is this a joke? I have seen people hand out revolting death threats on this encyclopaedia (including to me in the past) and escape with a slapped wrist. This guy sets a class assignment which may or may not have been misjudged (I personally still think it wasn't an unreasonable idea), with a good-faith intent (to demonstrate to his students the perfectly reasonable point that Wikipedia is not a reliable source for their assignments) and with, as it seems to me, zero lasting damage- and some people here appear keen to get him the sack! WTF?!!?? I'd like someone to point out to me <i>exactly</i> what academic regulations, or US laws, this chap has broken. If - as I strongly suspect- he hasn't broken or infringed any, what is the purpose of continuing this harassment? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 09:30, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Academic regulations vary from institution to institution, though having worked in several myself, I do feel confident in saying that someone in a position of authority over students would never be permitted to encourage or require them to commit vandalism or other socially disruptive behaviour as part of a research experiment or a course assignment. Such a violation would be all the more severe if it weren't a single student who was incited to vandalize but rather an entire class—and keep in mind that first-year undegraduate classes, as the one in question presumably is, can have hundreds of students. (This is also the reason that many people here see this incident as worse than isolated legal or death threats from individuals. We are talking about an authority who has allegedly <i>ordered</i> a large number of people—possibly hundreds—to disrupt Wikipedia in contravention of its stated purpose and usage policies. I doubt that even the infamous GNAA vandal group had such human resources to draw upon, and it certainly didn't have the coercive authority to get them to do its bidding.)</dd>
<dd>With respect to your assertion that we are "harassing" the instructor, I don't see that anyone has. Certain editors have contacted those responsible for ensuring the instructor's compliance to academic codes, asking them to <i>investigate</i> the matter. That is, to find out if the version of events we have been presented with is accurate, and if so, to determine whether they constitute a violation of their academic code. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 10:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have also worked in numerous academic institutions. This isn't academic misconduct by any measure that I have ever come across. As I note below, there is no comparison between actual, real-world vandalism and this kind of incident. Disrupting Wikipedia is not a crime, and I would not personally characterise it as necessarily socially disruptive, especially in this case where the intent was obviously good-faith. Unless he has a personal account, in which case he should probably receive an appropriate ban, this chap is not subject to Wikipedia's usage policies. With the best will in the world, anybody that sees this incident as worse than a death threat (= a highly illegal act, at least in the jurisdiction where I live, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years' in gaol) is an idiot. There is a real need to place this incident into perspective, I think. Your language- " coercive authority" " do its bidding" is faintly ridiculous. We are talking about a class assignment (I can't see how it could possibly have been an assessed class assignment either, so I presume it was basically presented to the students as a more-or-less optional exemplar exercise). One can only hope that his department will pretty much laugh off such a spurious complaint after a cursory examination. I might personally suggest alternative means to make his substantive point, but I would also pat him on the back for making it. If those students have come away from this with the lesson ingrained in them that Wiki is not a reliable source, and hopefully more generally an idea of the kinds of sources that they can or can't rely upon when forming opinions, then they will have learned pretty much the most important lesson that organised education can provide. If you are a decent tutor, then I suggest you ought to think the same thing. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 11:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having chased someone for academic misconduct before, I suspect that he's unlikely to be sacked for this, unless he's already on the nose anyway.</dd>
<dd>But imagine if a visual arts lecturer had forced his kids to spray paint railway trains, then what would your reaction be? If the claims made are true, then this isn't a person I'd want teaching any child of mine. If he accepts that he made a mistake and agrees not to do it again, then I'd be happy to see things left where they are. But if he plans to do it again, well, what would you recommend?

<dl>
<dd>The difference between "vandalising" Wikipedia (can we even say it's vandlaism when the intent is good faith?) and spray painting a train is two-fold: 1) One cannot erase any damage made to a train by the simple expedient of <i>pressing a couple of buttons</i>; 2) Vandalising a train is emphatically <i>against the law</i>. Any academic who encouraged his students to break a just law would no-doubt be fired PDQ. There is absolutely no comparison between your analogies whatsoever. Once again, I'd like to hear someone explicitly state what academic regulations he's broken, and therefore exactly how this is "academic misconduct". Whether he is likely to get the bullet or not, it is completely unreasonable to harass this guy in this way. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 10:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are you sure that all the damage has been undone? Even if every edit has been undone, which I think is unlikely, what if some of the students decided that they enjoyed vandalising? Not all damage that happens here can be undone by pushing buttons on a computer. And I'm still waiting to hear if he's going to do it again.</dd>
<dd>Here's a different <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a> for you. What if he told his students to go into the university library and replace some of the books there with fakes that look real but aren't. Some of them are complete nonsense. Some of them are believable, but still wrong. And no-one has any way of knowing if all of these fake books have been detected and removed. And he intends to do it again. What then? If you don't like the idea of reporting him to his boss, what do you suggest instead? Ignoring him and letting him do it twice a year for as long as he's teaching? You don't like our proposal, but do you have a better one? Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 11:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure that all the damage has been undone, but I am sure that all the damage <i>can</i> easily be undone and more importantly, if you look above you will see that Pierce himself undertook to undo any vandalism himself <i>before</i> he set the exercise. If some of the students decide that they want to vandalise Wikipedia for the sake of wanton destruction then they are exercising their own free will- he has not encouraged them to wantonly vandalise for amusement, but rather to reinforce a key educational principle. Some editors note above that they have in the past made "vandal" edits to Wikipedia in order to demonstrate the limitations of the medium, and then reverted themselves. This is the same, except on a larger scale. As for your other metaphor- that is a far more sensible one, but again you miss the key point which is that Pierce has kept track of all his students' edits and has undertaken to revert them himself if they or another party do not do so. If the library exercise you mention was a temporary one, with careful track kept of where the fake material was placed, to be collected later, then I wouldn't have any problem with it whatsoever. To be quite honest, my action in this case would be to email Pierce, set out your case, and suggest an alternative, less controversial means to make the same point (i.e. limited, supervised reverts). If he doesn't accept your case and wants to do it his way, then so be it, it's not for us to interfere with how he teaches his students. If the Wikipdia community decides it doesn't want him to do it, then that's fine too- block the relevent IPs. He is not burning down the Library of Alexandria- he is making a very valid point, namely that Wikipedia is not to be trusted. That's just good teaching. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 11:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I find this completely outrageous, not on Mr. Pierce's part, but on ours. Get a grip, Zoe. I agree with 99% of what you do, but this is simply <i>wrong.</i> We are volunteers here, and we're threatening Mr. Pierce's career. As several people have observed, we show infinitely more kindness to outright trolls and serial vandals. All we've proven is that it's a fool who involves themselves in Wikipedia <i>in any way</i> using their real world identity. Most of the time, it's untracable, so our frustration builds. Now we have a target, so we fire away? Identifying himself was his real mistake, wasn't it? The correct solution is to identify the problem, rv the vandalism and walk away. Going after real world individuals is sometimes justifiable if they're similarly harassing other editors, but <i>articles</i> we can and should fix. The lack of empathy here I'd find morally disgusting if I didn't chalk it up clueless immaturity. We're going to have some fellow cursing Wikipedia for his lack of a job and a future while we're wanking over edit counts and AfD's. Who knows what will come of that? If we continue to give people very good reasons to hate Wikipedia, it will sooner or later come back to us one way or another. I think losing one's job qualifies as a <i>very good reason.</i></dd>
<dd>I motion to 1) end this discussion forthwith, and to cease attacking and remove mention of Mr. Pierce from this site 2) temporarily block (preventatively, not punatively) any editors, admins or others, involved in harassing him 3) leave any further decisions to the office or to Mr. Wales.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 11:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second Proabivouac's and others' concerns here. Leave the guy alone, please. We normally treat "legal threats" and threats of real-world contacting of employers and the like as bannable offenses, no matter how valid a complaint the person who does the threatening thinks they have. We shouldn't be indulging in such behaviour ourselves now. Contacting the school to get the person damaged in his professional life and career is an absolute no-no.

<dd>With all due respect, "the Halo," neither you nor anyone else has the moral right to attack real people (excepting tyrants and the like) from behind your pseud: it's an abuse of the anonymity we're graciously allowed on this forum. A block is well warranted not just on moral but on practical grounds: by negatively intervening in someone's career, we leave the foundation open to further action. If <i>God forbid</i> we actually succeed, we have one very angry individual on our hands whom we can't simply wish away on this virtual noticeboard. It's vital that this kind of thing be run by the office. We can't have smart but clueless kids playing games with people's lives.

<dd>With all due respect to you too, I seriously doubt that the objective of getting in touch with the university that Mr. Pierce works for was to get him fired. It was to stop a tutor and all his students from vandalising with out having to block the entire university. It is important to assume good faith on the part of the editors who contacted the university, who I think believed they were acting for the good of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Thε Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b><font color="gold">Θ</font></b></a></sup> 12:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes. He is surely not going to get fired, and one may hope that that was not the intent of anyone contacting the university.... But clearly, contacting the university President (I'm not sure who that is, but I imagine it's something akin to a chancellor, vice chancellor, provost etc) to officially complain about one of their lecturer's actions could obviously potentially harm Pierce's career and get him into trouble. As stated ad nauseum, far, far, far worse offences (sometimes actual criminal acts) on Wikipedia are brushed aside with comparitively little action. I agree- with few exceptions, what's on wiki should stay on-wiki, and to harass someone in their real life because of (good faith!!) actions taken on here is absolutely bang out of order. I do hope as an aside that someone has pointed the university authorities to this noticeboard so that they can see for themselves the diversity of opinion to be found here and the context of the complaint. Let this be a sobering lesson to everyone- never, EVER use your real name or allow your personal details to be seen here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 13:09, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;:: <i>It is important to assume good faith on the part of the editors who contacted the university, who I think believed they were acting for the good of the encyclopedia.</i> - I am assuming good faith of the editors but the sheer lack of consideration of the possible impact demonstrates that a) all and any such actions should be discussed very very deeply before implementation of said actions, that b) (and don't take this as a knock, it's not intended to) many of our editors and administrators while excellent here are quite young and without being rude, quite naive about the real-world ramifications (because of a lack of practical experience) of contacting a real world organisation in such a manner. It's fine saying "hey he's not going to be sacked!" and more than likely he's not - BUT we exist in a world where mis-use of email is used as a rod to beat staff with. While HE might not get sacked, that's not to say someone else would not be in a similar situation. I agree with others, it's one thing to contact an individual but contacting someone's employers (let alone multiple departments in the same organisation!) should be a WP:OFFICE action. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 14:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. That would the correct way of dealing with this matter, albeit an extreme solution. If someone infringes Wikipedia's rules, then the solution should be found on Wikipedia. You are talking about making someone accountable <i>in real life</i> for something that occurs on-Wiki. That is in my view only ever a last ditch solution when said person has broken <b>the law</b>, not a comparitively unimportant community-defined Wikipedia rule. As correctly stated elsewhere, pretty much anything that spills over into the real world should be left to a WP:OFFICE action, and is not the domain of individual editors. By the same token, I'm sure you thought you were doing the right thing, and I'm sure you acted in good faith, albeit precipitously. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 16:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow. Just wow. What a stunning, draconian display of presumed power carried from cyberspace to the real world. There are people who <i>have</i> to work for a living to feed their families, pay their mortgages, go to the doctor or the dentist, and most of these people have to, in some way, interact with cyberspace at some point in time. Very few people in this world have the luxury of not working. As a student I learned something important from a professor's inapprorpriate attempt at a Wikipedia assignment, and so did the professor.

<dd>Speaking for myself, this academic's conduct sickens me. The wanton destruction of knowledge - free knowledge, yet - violates just about every single academic principle I can think of. If humanity has got to the stage where we will happily destroy knowledge in some petty game of "my source is better than yours", then it is time to start despairing. The Wikipedians who have to waste their volunteer time in reverts and blocks have every right to be cheesed off and to pursue the matter further.

Wow guys.... what are you all thinking? This is completely overblown here. Pierce might have been a bit out of line, but he was illustrating a valid point: we should not be used for academic papers. He showed that to his students. Doing is better then learning. Look at this like the reporters who snuck knives and such past TSA to show how poorly they perform,ed. It may have been somewhat out of line, but beutifully made the point to many people. Zoe, chill out a bit. You're normally on the ball, so I trust you.

<dd>Mr. Pierce’s point was not a valid one. Here’s what you do, if you’re reading. Stand in front of the class. Speak clearly: “Any papers using Wikipedia as a primary source will be handed back to you unmarked. We do not use wikipedia as a primary source because it isn’t trust worthy at the level I want you writing. Anyone can put anything on there, regardless of whether it is true or not, so don’t use it.” You know, that will be enough. It is what I was told, and, surprise surprise, I didn’t use wikipedia as a primary source. Mr. Pierce, if I remember correctly, is teaching at a university. These people aren’t stupid. If you tell them not to do something, they won’t do it, and if they do, make them change it. Mr. Pierce could have stopped all this a long time ago, and the thing that I’m really worried about is the fact that because of one mans bad idea we may (though probably won’t) have to ban an entire university. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Thε Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b><font color="gold">Θ</font></b></a></sup> 23:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why isn't it a crime? Because we allow - no, encourage - people to edit. Think about it like this: markets encourage people to shop. Why isn't buying all the cereal in the aisle a crime, then?

<dd>Thsi would be more like taking all the free samples, or throwing the brownies all over the store. Actually, it would be more like getting a hundred people to knock over everything in the shelves of the whole store for a couple weeks and maybe replace some foods with diarrhetics. Stores encourage people to come in and buy goods, or even to just look at them, but that does not mean that anyone is free to come in the store and do whatever they want. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 18:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One thing I don't understand. Mr Pierce's defenders seem to be saying "what he did was no big deal, therefore we shouldn't complain, because he will get sacked." If it's no big deal, he won't get sacked whatever we do. So why so worried? Personally, I'm not even after an apology, just a commitment that it won't happen again.

<dd>I think the idea is more that if you turn up here as a real person and annoy the wrong Wikipedia editors and don't agree with what they (correctly) say the site is about and how it works, and you disrupt the site in the process (by giving a public lecture, say - imagine Jimbo giving a lecture and telling people to try editing Wikipedia - <i>"add anything you like - it doesn't matter, it will be reverted within seconds if it is wrong"</i>), then some Wikipedia editors may aggressively engage you in discussion by sending you e-mails, and sending other people e-mails, until you back down and admit you were wrong and won't do it again. I'm concerned that this has been more about getting the instructor to admit that he was wrong, rather than helping him understand how Wikipedia works, and trying to convert him, rather than alienate him. Being diplomatic, in other words, rather than argumentative. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems clear to me that the appropriate initial contact with Mr. Pierce would have pointed out these policies, described how we deal with vandalism in practice, and suggested an alternative means of making the same point (e.g., having the students edit a sandbox) without disrupting others' efforts. Taking the time to thoroughly explain to him why we have a problem with his assignment and ways he could work with us, would likely have produced much more satisfactory results; as it is, we got a bunch of needlessly bombastic emails to university officials and a needlessly long thread in which people compare scribbling on a website to breaking a store window. This could have been an opportunity to educate an obviously ill-informed academic about how Wikipedia works, and instead we probably just alienated him (and his colleagues) further. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thanks to Zoe and Georgewilliamherbert for posting the correspondence they sent and received. It is rather instructive to see the different approaches they took. Zoe engaged in aggressive questioning of the instructor in question, while George wrote calmly and at length to possibly the people responsible for the instructor's conduct, taking the time to explain himself. It was also interesting to note that Zoe signed as 'Wikipedia system administrator' (which could give the appearance of speaking for Wikipedia), while George (more correctly, in my opinion) said <i>"I am not speaking for Wikipedia in any official capacity (I have no organizational official standing) other than as a user and editor."</i></p>
<p>I also thought Zoe's threat to go to the press (the university's ethics office was restrained enough to only call it a veiled threat) was intended by Zoe to provoke a response, and I find that very worrying. This could easily have escalated the situation when there was absolutely no need to adopt that attitude.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from this? Would Zoe and George do things differently, or even do nothing, if this happened again? I'd really hope that some people would do things differently next time.

<p>Again, wow. NIU and Mr. Pierce were straight-forward, and Wikipedia accused them of a federal crime. I thought that someone had recently quoted that administrators aren't godheads or something, according to Jimbo Wales. Criminal accusation are usually handled through the DA's office, not by one individual throwing an accusation at another or at an institution. Crimes should be reported to the proper law enforcement officials, not used as threats against someone. And since when is this not an apology, "So, in the sense that I've caused a lot of work on people's part in what's going on, I'm sorry for that?" He apologized, admitted it was a poorly thought out exercise, after explaining that he had weighed potential consequences, that he had tried just instructing his students not to use Wikipedia, and he's being battered down with the threat of criminal actions. I've seen too much of Wikipedia administrators who can't simply back down from something. When someone is being reasonable, after doing something unreasonable, you latch onto their current sense of reason, you don't keep attacking them. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 04:22, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This should have been handled by Brad Patrick to begin with. Or at least from the point where the University's legal department got involved. This could have backfired horribly had the teacher been fired and then sued Wikipedia for defamation causing him to get fired. 1 million dollars from the last fundraiser may sound like a lot but when you get into things like this we could have gotten into serious economic/legal trouble here. A site/department block sounds like a good idea. That is perfectly within our discretion (no need for legal help to do that) and would solve the problem. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(IANALBIPOOT) I cannot imagine any cause of action—certainly not <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">defamation</a>—that Pierce, were he to be fired over this, could essay against the Foundation generally or against any editor who contacted the university specifically (other causes of action, relative, for instance, to a characterization publicly of his conduct as somehow criminal, might be more tenable, but such causes would not be relative to his termination). I, to be sure, would not be inclined to contact the university about conduct to which I have no grave objection, but there is, IMHO, almost surely no legal liability for an individual who should undertake to make such contact; I have always understood, indeed, the practice of contacting an employer of someone with whom one has a quarrel to disseminate true information apropos of the former in order that he/she might be fired to be relatively common, but I gather from this discussion that there are those who think such practice to be immoral. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:33, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Joe, I posted that message minutes before Jimbo posted his message. I had no idea, as did no one else apparently, that the foundation had already been involved. had Zoe been told this by Jimbo I believe she would have let Jimbo take care of this. I don't doubt that she really wanted to do Wikipedia a big favor by going through all this trouble. I just happen to believe that such matters are better handled by the foundation. Jimbo should have posted here when he settled the matter. I think we should just move on and let Jimbo know that sometimes things happen on ANI that might make it beneficial for Wikipedia and the foundation in general to pay closer attention to this board and post here <i>before</i> so-called <i>wildly inappropriate</i> things take place. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 22:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also certain obvious errors and interwiki's require almost no english to correct.

<dd>That's unacceptable behavior by Ludvikus. I've left him a firm warning that repeating this will result in a block. My opinion is this one example on its own doesn't warrant a block, but any further repetition of this sort of behavior should garner a block.

<p>A user <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> appears to be a fashion photographer. Recently he had uploaded numerous photos he attributes to himself, and offers under creative commons licensing. I removed some self-promotional wording from his user page. He appears to have replaced valid photographs in numerous articles with his own photographs. My personal judgement (just my opinion) is that in most cases he added his own lower quality, less precise image to replace a better image. I see this as an extension of his self-promotion attempt.</p>
<p>I expect that he will be upset at having some of those images reverted. First, <i>I want to be sure that my opinion that self-promotion on your own user page (offering free use of your images) is really not appropriate</i>, and that others agree that large scale replacement of other images with his own images is not appropriate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm only asking for other editors opinions here, not trying to demonize anyone. Of course he has made other valuable contributions, but I am only asking about borderline self-promotion! <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He does seem to have added some images of buildings where there were no images before. But his habit of removing someone elses image, or moving the lede image down into the article and placing his image in lede seems self-promotional. This is reinforced (for me) in that the previous image seems of better quality(IMO).</p>

I make no habit of replacing people's photographs, and I've added HUNDREDS of high-quality photographs where non previously existed. If the article is small and I have a better one, then I replace it; however, my habit is to move the existing one to a less prominent spot, such as on the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_Center_92b1.html" title="Rockefeller Center">Rockefeller Center</a> page. But this editor has followed NO guidelines in reverting my edits nor in listing my images for deletion. My images give quite a bit of value to the pages. I've added hundreds of photographs to the site without self-promotion. First, I'm a law student, not a fashion photographer, or any sort of photographer. Second, I don't self-promote, since I earn no money from photography nor do I put my User name anywhere on the page. Third, moving a lead photograph when it is of poor-quality, or when there is a better photograph available, is not against any policy on this site - where are you coming from on this?

<p>One of my hobbies is going around taking photographs of famous buildings, people and places around New York City. I do a lot of interesting stuff. This editor's actions above has a dampening affect on contributions. Much of what he has reverted or flagged for deletion has no business having done so. A perfectly great example of sequins I put on the <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequin.html" title="Sequin">Sequin</a> page has been flagged for deletion? I replaced a 96KB photograph of a sequined ass with a full-sequined dress at 863KB - is this really a proper use of this editor's time? At one moment the editor complains I'm putting up too-poor-of-quality photographs; then the editor complains when I put better quality photographs up. Compare the former photograph with the one I put up.<br />
<br /></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My apologies. Obviously we have different opinions which I am sure we can work out on the talk page of a given article. In this case another opinion might be that a very good closeup of sequins on the <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequin.html" title="Sequin">sequin</a> article was removed and replaced with a very <i>large</i> image that showed less detail of sequins, and more detail of unrelated things. The database now has an 863KB image instead of one one-tenth that size that illustrated the topic of the article better.</dd>
<dd>Regarding self promotion, that can be done in a variety of ways. You deserve attribution for the image, and that should be part of the image attributes in the database. Attaching your name to the name of the image is not how we normally do that. By itself it is minor, with the other aspects I complained about, it seems like self-promotion to me. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, actually I did. I just had not finished that process before you reverted my valid ifd. But, that is besides the point. Do you have a problem with people discussing the value of that particular image? My objection was that at least one of the models seems underaged, but there is no indication that you have the models consent for the photograph, or their ages. It's insertion into the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast.html" title="Breast">breast</a> article without discussing with other editors (when image content is an open and active discussion on the article) is what brought my attention to the self promotion. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not suggesting that there is something terribly wrong with this editor. I have suggested that the high quality images of buildings he has provided is excellent, and appreciated. What I was asking is if the self-promotion, and apparent replacement of good quality images with his own (without discussion) was appropriate. It may be your, or others opinion that removing a fair-use high quality image with a low-quality poor image is okay. That is a matter of opinion.</dd>
<dd>A consistent pattern of replacing a lede image with ones own image (whether is happens to be fair use or not) without discussion, and titling the image itself with the photographers name as part of the image, and putting on the top of ones user page "SPRUCE UP YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER, MAGAZINE/ZINE, POWERPOINT, BLOG, ADVERTISING OR COMPANY NEWSLETTER WITH MY IMAGES, FREE FOR ALL!" seems to me like self promotion to me. The fact that it is not yet profitable does not make it less self-promotion. I merely asked if this type of borderline, subtle, entrenchment strategy marketing (giving free images in order to get noticed and build a market) was appropriate, or at least what others opinions about this was. The fact that this editor has offered other contributions (of value) is a completely unrelated topic. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a></dd>

<dd>I'm happy to discuss things further on his talk page. Personally, it seems like we have many things in common. The last thing I want to do is alienate someone who has so much to offer to Wikipedia. My personal opinion is that the photographs of buildings that he has done are superb. Unfortunately my opinion is that the photogrpahs of people does not meet that standard. Regardless of my singular opinion of the artwork, the addition of images where none existed before is very valuable. The replacement of other peoples images with ones own image, or the movement of an outstanding lede image out of lede, and insertion of ones own image is not appropriate. This should both should always be avoided because of the appearance of vanity, self promotion and conflict of interest. Also, attaching his name to the title of the image seems self-promotional as well. Attribution is important, but that is not our established method for doing that.</dd>

The last thing that I would suggest is that this editor is only doing negative contributions. Many of them are quite obviously positive. My objection (and I've tried to state it politely -- to not offend, if that has not come across) is to the self-promotion. I hope that he will continue to provide free use images of buildings and architecture (obviously his area of talent and expertise) all he wants. I brought the discussion here primarily because I did want clarification regarding borderline self-promotion, not to argue, deconstruct his work or offend. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 15:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

But I also noticed the dearth of images on here. It's a really fun hobby. I had kind of hoped that people in their own locations (LA, San Fran, Miami, etc.) would do the same, and get photos on the pages. That's why I'll spend hours just doing photographs of subway stations - so that those pages have images. Not because I'm a subway enthusiast. My intentions are purely good.

<dd>Atom, the way you went about this is offensive because you replaced a high-quality image I put up on the <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequin.html" title="Sequin">Sequin</a> page with a very low quality image of an ass. I replaced a grainey, poorly lit photograph of the Prometheus statue on the lead of the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_Center_92b1.html" title="Rockefeller Center">Rockefeller Center</a> page with one that is of the entire Rockefeller Center plaza (very high quality pixels). What seems to have happened here is you saw the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Subkoff_1192.html" title="Tara Subkoff">Tara Subkoff</a> Imitation of Christ models bare-chested and that got your ire--why? YOu removed this photograph from <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_objectification.html" title="Sexual objectification">sexual objectification</a> (which the show was clearly playing with) and from every other page, and then use the reason that it's not included in any articles as a reason to delete it. THis isn't the way to productively edit, and you can really dampen people's enhusiasm for contributing. And I've contributed a lot. And if you need clarification, this is not the forum to do it. You should contact the editor first and let them explain themselves; then you should research Wikipedia policy for yourself, or consul with other editors. You went way over the line here. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 15:58, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, as I have said before several places. The replacement of the detailed (but small file size)image of sequin with a huge image that showed <i>less detail</i> about sequins, and more <i>unrelated</i> detail is what seemed innapropriate to me. No discussion on the talk page, just an assumption that your image was better. When you replaced the good image, that's where it should have been discussed. My return to the previous image was fixing the problem. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, it would have been nice if someone had merely answered my question regarding self-promotion, rather than trying to characterize it as some kind of personal attack.

<dd>If you had read my comments above, you will realize that I asked for guidance here before discussing it with the user, because I was unsure if the boerderline promotion was too much, or not. I removed his self-promotion, which is in accordance with Wikipedia policies. And, no I was no upset with anything, I was asking a question about whether his subtle approach to self promotion was over the line or not. I only came upon his user page after he put one of his images in an article. I have previously never met the fellow, and as you can see by my comments above I have no animosity at all about him. Asking other people their opinions about whether his self-promotion was within wikipedia acceptablility, or not, is fair game. Certainly since I had doubts, asking here first was more appropriate than chastizing him for self-promotion when I was uncertain if it was borderline over or under the line. Since that time, others have asked him to tone down his self-promotion also, and it seems that it should not be a problem. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 21:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I think you miss my point. Asking for input is good. Removing content from another user's userpage and then coming here to have your decision validated, having at no point spoken with said user, is not so good. Coming here first and asking "Would removing this be justified?", or bringing up your concerns on David's talk page and asking him to remove or rephrase that wording from his page would have been a more appropriate approach. Also, while you say you have no animosity toward David, your approach reads to me as rather hostile -- in just your reply above, we start with "borderline promotion," proceed to "self-promotion" without the qualifier, then to an assertion the user was violating policy, and finally to "subtle ... self promotion," which might be taken to imply that he is intentionally subverting that policy. This is possibly not what you meant, but taken together with your numerous postings above, can you see why you might be (incorrectly) seen as upset? Wouldn't you agree that speaking to the editor in question (preferably) or to other uninvolved editors <i>before</i> making such changes to a userpage might be a better approach? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As you know, removing promotion is within Wikipedia policy. See <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> for more detail. I did not ask here for validation of my change to his user page, as the legitimacy of that has not been argued by anyone. I asked if the set of several minor things seemed to be self-promotion to others. I didn't accuse him of violating policy -- clearly his statement <i>is</i> promotional. Few people would disagree with that. "Self promotion" is a more precise description. I was asking if that borderline self promotion was excessive enough with the other elements to violate policy. To answer your last question, certainly after this fiasco, in retrospect, doing anything before posting something here would be preferable in the future. I had the mistaken impression I would benefit from other peoples wise advice by asking here. In the end, I did benefit as a few people were kind enough to address my question, but at the expense of a great deal of grief. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 18:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're not receiving the kind of response you'd expected because the issue isn't nearly as clear as you believe. It's true that <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> says "You are welcome to include a link to your personal home page, although you should not surround it with any promotional language." But it also says things like "Another common use is to let people know about your activities on Wikipedia" and "You might want to add quotations that you like, or a picture, or some of your favorite Wikipedia articles or images" and "In general it is considered polite to avoid substantially editing another's user page without their permission." Is the statement you quote self-promotional text that should be removed, or is it just an enthusiastic pointer to the images this user has contributed? Clearly you think it's the former, but the latter interpretation is not unreasonable. It's certainly not your typical case of advertising copy and spam links. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:30, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this is appropriate for admin invervention, but I at least wanted to mention it. An article titled The Midnight Rider is up for an Afd. The discussion is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Midnight_Rider" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Midnight_Rider" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I noticed some odd votes to keep, and wondered so. So I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.ronfez.net/messageboard/viewmessages.cfm/Forum/46/Topic/56187/page/Save_the_Midnight_Rider__.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ronfez.net/messageboard/viewmessages.cfm/Forum/46/Topic/56187/page/Save_the_Midnight_Rider__.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> message board, which is from the group that created the article, asking users to "vote" to keep the article. Clearly several of the "keep" posts are from this thread. I read through the Wikipedia policy on [[Wikipedia:Canvassing|Canvassing] but wasn't sure what action I should take. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_notification_9562.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey notification">Survey Notifcation</a> seemed more relevant, but it's inactive, so I wasn't sure if I should follow those guidelines.

<dd>I've placed the standard disclaimer at the top of the article; it normally helps to cut down on meatpuppet traffic. (Note that not all the people coming in from outside will necessarily be meatpuppets; some may have valid opinions, but it's important that they state them rather than just saying 'keep'.) --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 16:41, 29 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)
