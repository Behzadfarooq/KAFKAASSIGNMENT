<p>Am I allowed to remove anon comments form my RFC?</p>
<p>This user is the same one who keep insisting I am Rex/Merecat. He always traces back to Kornet (Korea Net) and has been following me around and refuses to register an account.</p>

<p>These are obvious all sockpuppets of someone involved with RFCU. If you look at their edits they are based against me and all from Korea Net. As you can see by their contrib lists all of thier edits are primarily focused on me</p>

<p>These accounts are obvious sockpuppets and I would like to know if I can remove them from my RFC, or if am admin can. I would like to also add that the user certifying my RFC had shown no proof of dispute resolution, nor of their participation in the dispute being discussed, both against the rules of certifying an RFC.

<dd>I hate to point out the obvious, but Rex, long before he was nearly this infamous, initially decided to wikistalk himself with a whole host of forced proxies, in fact he pretty much went around targeting only accounts that he had created, since this was back in the infancy of checkuser, I don't think he realized until it was too late that the accounts he created could actually be traced back to their IPs, at time. Once discovered he promised to play nice, and it never really came up for a while. For the record he's been known to play both sides to a political debate, and operated a number of strawmen for a while, even kept debating himself for a while, never did find out what that was all about.. either way, don't make the mistake of assuming this is political, it's just that political articles are easier to troll I'd assume--<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.65.html" title="User:205.188.116.65">205.188.116.65</a> 11:19, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Err, wrong addressment.&#160;;-) Anyhow, it was blocked as a "compromised IP" before - the templates are now merged so it isn't more of an "open proxy" thing than the fact it's a severely compromised IP. Unblock it if you want: I have no objections. I only put indefinite because other administrators were objecting to my short time period for unblocking and I saw no reason to keep up the charade of blocking for one year as because as soon as that year expired it would all begin anyway. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 03:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I'm not humane, but I'd note that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> have been rejected by the community, who ostensibly believe that we ought to edit dispassionately and disinterestedly vis-à-vis the external consequences of our editing, whilst <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> continue to command the support of the community. To my mind, <i>basic human kindness</i> is a wholly unencyclopedic motivation and does not militate against our having an article about a subject whose notability is avolitional and who expresses a desire that we not have an article. To be sure, this situation rather well parallels that of Brian Peppers, and so it's eminently possible that, upon the subject's again contacting the Foundation, the page will be <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">OFFICEd</a>. In the meanwhile, though, IMHO, we ought not to care what the subject thinks of our article apropos, principally, of his radio program (except, of course, if he reasonably takes issue with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> of the article; no such objection is essayed here). As the debates over Wikiethics and <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> have borne out, there is no consensus for the view that we ought, like journalists, to comport our editing with a <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism_ethics_and_standards.html#Harm_limitation_principle" title="Journalism ethics and standards">harm limitation principle</a>, viz., that we ought to take particular care in editing articles of which the subjects are living persons, in order that our editing shouldn't have untoward results. I readily concede that the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> situation isn't a perfect analogue, inasmuch as his notability entails (arguably) directly from his actions, whilst George's entails only indirectly, but the sundry AfDs surrounding Brandt should make clear that we don't delete articles simply because the subject requests deletion. Now, I'm not at all confident that George is notable, and I'm inclined to think I'd support <i>deletion</i> at AfD, but a deletion decision should be taken only in view of encyclopedic concerns. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These users seem to have something against me.</p>
<p>Iodyne...</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinks fair use policy is some sort of joke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=58081212&amp;oldid=57946324" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=58081212&amp;oldid=57946324" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>;</li>
<li>Attacked me by placing a picture of me on his friend's page with a demeaning caption <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57970836&amp;oldid=57942647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57970836&amp;oldid=57942647" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
<li>Places fair use images on his friends page after my explanation they're not allowed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57970836&amp;oldid=57942647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57970836&amp;oldid=57942647" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li>Just added a picture of me to Clever Curmudgeon's talk page with the caption "The dark side of the force is the path to many abilities which some consider to be... unnatural". User does not take me seriously at all. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=58084184&amp;oldid=58084029" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=58084184&amp;oldid=58084029" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Clever curmudgeon...</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverts my removal of a fair use image off his userpage despite a good explanation why it's not allowed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57942364&amp;oldid=57756221" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Clever_curmudgeon&amp;diff=57942364&amp;oldid=57756221" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>

This has been removed several times by different editors, on the grounds that many people have visited the campus and the visit of one person, who has not to anyone's knowledge done anything illegal while he was there, is not relevant to Wikipedia.

<p>There's a full scale edit and revert war broken out on this article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn</a></p>
<p>This edit war has spilled over from the Rosicrucian order of A+O, onto the main article now and has been reverted back on forth now incessantly. An administrator had already banned new users from editing the article, as there were a suspicion of myself using sock puppets, which I vehemently disapprove of. I have never used sock puppets and I am will to send my IP address to any Wikipedia Admin, so that they can see that the new users that edited the article were not operative from my IP address.</p>
<p>It is user JMAX, 999, Zos, and synergeticmaggot, that are reverting the article back to their own biased political agenda, and it is these users that are working as a team to avoid the three revert ruling</p>
<p>An administrator blocked new users from editing the article last night, however, its not new users that is the problem, its the aforementioned established users that are perpetuating this edit/revert war by trying to promote their own political agenda.</p>
<p>More footnotes and citations were added last night to the article but JMAX reverted the article back 4 times to his version that promotes his biased political agenda, in current trademark litigation.</p>
<p>This page needs to be fully blocked, immediately, so that we can sort this out, otherwise this edit war is only going to get worse, and the reverting will continue. The only way the edit/revert war will cease over this, is if the page is fully locked and then users JMAX555, 999, Zos and synergetic maggot that edit and revert the article back in sequences to avoid the three revert ruling can stop. This is the only way a compromise will happen.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned users are conspirators in this edit/revert war and have a strategy to keep reverting and editing the main article as, they tried to do with the Rosicrucian Order of A+O page that had to be fully locked a couple of days ago. So the problem isn’t new users editing the page, its established users editing and reverting the page back to their own biased political agenda. These aforementioned users are also working, as a team to keep reverting these articles back and are exploiting the fact that some users are new to wikipedia, like myself.</p>
<p>I have made a request over at the page protection page, however the edit/revert war was just beginning to start; now it’s in full swing. Please protect this page with immediate effect so that we can stop this edit and revert war, and sort this out properly. Otherwise today this edit/revert war will continue to escalate and get ugly.</p>

<p>Here’s the appeal I made about this page, however, at the time the edit/revert war had just begun, but now it’s in full swing and there have been many more revisions since then.</p>
<p><b>Full Immediate protection needed:</b></p>
<p>A full scale editing war has broken out on this article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_tradition#The_Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_.28Inc..29</a></p>
<p>They’re reverting the article incessantly, and arguing over whose order is at top of the links section, furthermore, there is also an editing war being perpetuated rampantly about a non- traditional Golden Dawn order being included in the links section. The article is being edited and reverted now, every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Help! Can someone please lock this article to stop this vandalism, so that the other editors and myself can work this out. Please lock this article to stop these new, unscrupulous users frivolously editing the links in this article. Please lock the article immediately, so that myself and the established editors on the Golden Dawn article can stop this rampant editing war.</p>
<p>User 999, Zos, JMAX555 and senergeticmaggot are making false claims that I am using a so-called sock puppet, I vehemently disapprove of this, and I can state categorically that I am not using a sock-puppet. I am willing to send my IP address into a Wikipedia admin so that they can verify that these other new users, that are frequently editing the page are not operative via my IP address.</p>
<p>User 999 is creating schism and false intrigues against me they should he should rightfully receive a warning or a 24 hour block ,so that myself and other established editors of the Golden Dawn article can put a stop to this edit war. Please lock this page immediately to stop further abuse and editing wars.</p>
<p>A moderator has already blocked new users to the article; however, this is not the problem. It is not new users that are causing the disruptions, it is established users: 999, Zos, synergetic maggot and JMAX555. The article needs to be immediately fully protected as the aforementioned users are on one side of a current trademark litigation case and I am on the other. Their trying to get me blocked to that they can vandalise the article to their own biased political agenda. The aforementioned users have in fact had me innocently blocked a few days ago and then vandalised the article to You need to intervene more seriously and put a permanent block on the article, as these problems won’t go away until you take action against the aforementioned users.</p>
<p>These aforementioned users have instigated a full-scale edit war and the problem isn’t due to vandalism by new users. Take a look at the Rosicrucian Order of A+O page that was locked due to these aforementioned users creating an edit war, and now this has spilled over on the main Golden Dawn article.</p>
<p>These users are conspirators and are attempting to get me blocked so that they can go unchecked in an edit war to change the article in a defamatory tone, in an attempt to promote their political agenda over the other orders entries.</p>
<p>Here’s the link to show the aforementioned users last editing war that has now spilled over onto the main Golden Dawn article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_%28Rosicrucian_Order_of_A%2BO%29</a></p>

<p><b>Comment:</b> This user has repeatedly accused numerous other individuals who disagree with him of "pushing a political agenda"- rather bad faith in my opinion. Furthermore, at the same instance that he tried unsucessfuly to report a different user of a 3RR, he actually violated the rule himself. Strangely enough, within the last ten minutes I've mysteriously been attacked by an "anon" IP 205.188.116.200 on my userpage, which makes me strongly suspicious that it is this individual acting out of spite. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 13:21, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone with admin powers please look at this user and see whether an indefinite block was really appropriate?

<p>RE, Pages: 1.Golden Dawn Tradition 2.Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Rosicrucian Order of A+O) 3.Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn 4. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.</p>
<p>The background of the ongoing conflict on these pages is an ongoing legal dispute between esoteric orders 2 and 4 above over trademarks. Members of 4 are trying to control everything on Wikipedia over the Golden Dawn and they have mobilized the membership of their orders to act in unison in guerilla edit warfare promoting their extremely POV biased versions.</p>
<p>MORE IMPORTANTLY ON PAGE 4 (The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc) ABOVE THEY CONTINUOUSLY PUBLISH A LINK TO A FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN FOR A SO CALLED "GOLDEN DAWN LEGAL FUND" TO RAISE MONEY FOR THEIR LEGAL EFFORTS AGAINST 2. Here is the link they keep publishing discuised as a citation:</p>

<p>What we have here, Sith Lord, is a legal conflict between two esoteric orders, almost like a religious conflict. Both sides are trying to present their side of the story. Instead of collaborating to find consensus, the Inc. side are bringing in their whole order to bully their truth through. The other side is waking up and coming to do something about it, but we are much newer there than they are.</p>
<p>If this is to be resolved there must be some kind of arbitration. We could use their tactics as well and probably will if we cant get them to seriously attempt to gain consensus instead of just reverting anything other than their point of view and pointing fingers at Fiat Lux. He is not alone and many others will be here shortly to balance the equasion.</p>
<p>This is not a solution, however. One page has already been locked down completely. Please assist in making both sides find consensus on Wikipedia instead of senslessly conflicting across five distinct pages. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanoni666_cca2.html" title="User:Zanoni666">Zanoni666</a> 15:02, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That is not quite true, Tom. The Hermetic Order or the Golden Dawn is historically important. To a lesser degree, of course, it is encyclopedic in the same manner as is Freemasonry. You did the right thing in telling both sides to reach consenses on the page for the Hermetic Order of the Godlen Dawn (Rosicrucian Order of A+O). The problem is that there are 6-7 separate pages that are involved, and when you locked down one, the conflict just spread to others. When we appealed for halp again, Deskana did not really grasp the nature of the problem, but only noticed that the members of one side are new here and mistook the problem for one of vandalism, whereas the true problem is the same previous conflict that just moved from one page to the next when you locked the first one down.</p>
<p>Are ther not some arbitaration procedures or some such that could help to solve this. It is certainly not a solution for both orders to bring more and more members here to try and push their agenda, which the Inc. side, with at least 6 members are already doing at this juncture, and the other side will invvitably do as well if we do not find a better option. I truly think that we can still work this out, with a llittle help from admin, of course, so that things get better instead of worse.--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanoni666_cca2.html" title="User:Zanoni666">Zanoni666</a> 15:15, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Typical 999 misrepresentations. He knows full well that JMax555 is a member of the Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn, which is licensed by HOGD, Inc. The head of his order is on the board of HOGD, Inc. Also, I believe that 999, Zos, Eheih, and SynergeticMaggot are all members of one or the other orders lisensed by HOGD, Inc and are concealing the bias of their affilliation as is JMax555.

<dd>Actually there at least 6 or 7 factions. the HOGD, Inc. recently lisenced God and his brother to use the HOGD trademark. Actually, to about 6 other orders including the Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn to which JMax555 belongs and is one of the leaders. This has lead to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the outer order of the Rosicrucian Order of A+O being defamed and libeled on forums operated by the lot of them, including one owned and operated by JMax555, who together with his cohorts are now trying to use Wikipedia as a soapbox as well.

<dd>Also, there should not be a disambig. Technically, <i>Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</i> refers to an historic organization which no longer exists. There are half-a -dozen or so revival organization and they are all listed under the heading <i>Contemporary Golden Dawn Orders</i> in the main article. The intent was that nothing about the modern orders would be in the main articles, and that the subarticles would simply use each order's web page and other supporting documentation to describe themselves. Except that the A+O wants to replace HOGD, Inc.'s description taken from their own website with one that would be harmful, possibly to be used in the court case. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 20:14, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet another misrepresentation. Notice tha JMax555 below intentionally neglects to clarify this as he is attempting to cinceal his biased POV. It is true that no one here has admitted being a member of HGOD, Inc. Joseph Max, however, JMax555, is the leader of the OSOGD, licenced by the HOGD, Inc.

The HOGD Inc. has a legal fundraising page on their own website, but it is certainly not in the WP article. We've tried moving all the factions to their own pages, but the HOGD/A+O faction keeps editing the main article and putting in a lot of self-promoting information about themselves, culled directly from their own website, which has no verifiable sources outside of their own website; it amounts to original research done by their own faction. And User 999 and User Zos are NOT my "sock puppets", and as I've said several times in Talk.

<p>Thank you for the information about mediation. I have passed it along to Frater Fiat Lux who is more Wikipedia savy than I am. He has promised to follow up on it. Hopefully mediation will help to clean up this mess. Certainly it is better than the filing of endless frivolous adminstrative complaints, such as the one lodged against me today by User 999 from the other faction. (See below: Privacy violation by User:Zanoni666.) I just want to make sure you guys are aware of the tactics that they are using. They have done the same against Frater Fiat Lux on numerous occasions. Unfortunately, they gained some credence against Frater Fiat Lux because he violated 3RR twice trying to stand up to their gate/gang editing tactics. I have violated nothing, yet they keep calling me a 'sock,' (untrue) filing frivolous complaints against me, etc. Why? Simply because I refuse to be steamrolled into allowing the HOGD, Inc supporters to ram through their biased POV. Therefore they are trying more and more agressive techniques like the filing of frivolous compaint after admin complaint. Hopefully the mediation will begin soon and these fellows will stop filling this board with such nonsnese.--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanoni666_cca2.html" title="User:Zanoni666">Zanoni666</a> 19:41, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Administrators -</p>
<p>The message pasted below concerns me. I did not request a password change, but recognize the IP address as belonging to a member of a small group that repeatedly harasses my employer, DePaul University, through e-mail.</p>
<p>This group has built quite a controversy section for DePaul on our Wikipedia entry. I have recently begun editing the site to present DePaul's perspective on their charges.</p>
<p>I am concerned that a member of this group is now trying to hijack my Wikipedia account to either make false edits to DePaul's site or to cause trouble under my name on other sites, which would lead to me being banned. Are there any Wikipedia policies that cover this situation?</p>

Someone (probably you, from IP address 69.116.141.82) requested that we send you a new Wikipedia login password for en.wikipedia.org. The password for user "Kgallagh" is now "[password]". You should log in and change your password now.</p>
<p>If someone else made this request or if you have remembered your password and you no longer wish to change it, you may ignore this message and continue using your old password.</p>

<li>Ignore it. Anyone can click on "I forgot my password" and it sends an e-mail to the address of record. It may even happen many times a day. It's a minor form of harassment. "They" don't have either your new or old password. Best thing to do is ignore them all and continue to use your old password. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no uncivil behaviour going on here. What is really happenning is a conflict between two sides of a legal trademark dispute disagreeing over content in a page (well, actually 7 pages concerning the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and its modern derivitives). I have alreadyidentified my POV bias. The other side, including JMax555, 999, Eheih, SynergisticMaggot continue to attempt to conceal and deny theirs yet pushing a POV agenda which clearly "outs" themselves. The identification of JMax555 was necessary to set the record staight due to the attempted deception on the other side concealing their POV bias and actively denying any relationship to HOGD, Inc.. User 999 is still attempting to conceal his POV bias. JMax also suggested that the article should be delated to end the bickering. Once a survey PROPOSED BY THE OTHER SIDE began, the initial suggestion by JMax555 was appartently deleted for posturing as though our side are exclusively in favor of it. Admittedly, this is a mess. However, it is not uncivil despite the unethical tactics being used by certain users. This complaint by User 999 is yet another backhanded attempt to ram through their biased POV and eliminate any opposing voices. These unfair tactics have already led to one page being fully protected and one other partially protected. The conflict involves 7 npages at this time, which is ridiculous. It would be much better in there were more good faith and willingness to compromise instead of filing frivolous administrative complaints such as this one lodged by user 999.--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanoni666_cca2.html" title="User:Zanoni666">Zanoni666</a> 19:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin. Yesterday <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">User:Sceptre</a> reverted an edit to the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> article by User:Wikinorthernireland: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58058444" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58058444" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58058444</a>. The summary given was just the default, and largely meaningless <i>"Reverted edits by Wikinorthernireland (talk) to last version by Calum Hutchinson"</i>. However the edit was clearly not simple vandalism - it was content complete with references.</p>
<p>I've asked on the admin's talk page for a reason, without reply: <a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESceptre_51b5.html#Scotland_revert" title="User talk:Sceptre">User talk:Sceptre#Scotland revert</a>.</p>
<p>I've not hunted through other edits, but I beleive this to be a misuse of the automated revert functionality / rollback button - which should only ever really be used against obvious vandalism - if you're not sure, don't touch it... <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html#Administrator_feature" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert#Administrator feature</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Rollbacks should be used with caution and restraint, in part because they leave no explanation for the revert in the edit summary. Reverting a good-faith edit may send the message that "I think your edit was no better than vandalism and doesn't deserve even the courtesy of an explanatory edit summary." It is a slap in the face to a good-faith editor. If you use the rollback feature for anything other than vandalism or for reverting yourself, be sure to leave an explanation on the article talk page, or on the talk page of the user whose edit(s) you reverted.</i></dd>

<dd>Looking through the user's logs myself, I discovered that all of the images are reposted when they were deleted prior. I labeled all of them with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}}. The way he avoided this was through minor renamings of the files he uploaded (such as with a hyphen in the beginning, or a number, or other things). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know I rely don't think that's the apropriate way to deal with them. They where deleted the first time around for lacking copyright info, fair enough. But then saying "this has been deleted before so get rid of it" when the re-upload with proper copyright info seems to be sending all kinds of wrong messages. Also while it is a lot of pictures of the same character note that they are beeing used in a section explicitly describing the chraracter's various outfits in different epsiodes and while there are a lot of images there are only one or two used in any one article. That's arguagely a valid fair use. It would proably be better to merge the various episode articles or something and cut some unnessesary images and mark them as orphans, but IMHO there is not rely anyting here that warrant any major speedy admin intervention. Yes the images are fairly high resolutio, but they are clearly inferiour quality since it's photos of a screen and we have {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusereduce_1d39.html" title="Template:Fairusereduce">fairusereduce</a>}} for dealing with high-res images. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 05:56, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My history has a user that I have no connection with personally attacking me and you facilitating it. I have posted diffs with Admins stating the tags are justified. I don't know why they don't restore the tags. Nlu, you should not remove the tags unless you can come up with some basis for removing them. This is just like your other administrative action against me that you conveniently ignore all evidence contrary to what you want to do.

The Ungovernable Force, semantics games are very fun, I agree, but whether or not you feel "Death to tyrants" accompanying a picture of the current president <i>should be</i> considered a threat, the fact remains that it is. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, to Cyde, threats against the president are treated differently from those against other individuals (to-wit, they are prosecuted under a statute that applies only to threats against the president and are prosecuted in federal court). Second, I'm not at all certain that the image and concomitant text constitute a threat; indeed, I agree with UGF's analysis. It ought to be said that the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Service_f791.html" title="Secret Service">Secret Service</a> frequently (and, IMHO, overzealously), investigate comments of this nature, even as they readily concede that much of the speech they investigate is protected or otherwise not criminal (they investigate primarily in order to discern whether an actual threat underlies hyperbolic speech). Third, it's unlikely that the Foundation's hosting a user page to which the putative threat is appended is legally impermissible; in any event, I can't foresee any civil or criminal action that could be essayed (although, of course, there are issues of public perceptions of WP to consider). Beyond all that, though, and even as I'm inclined to agree with TGF's sentiment (though for very different reasons), it is plain that the image, etc., as against many <i>divisive</i> userboxes, does not create an atmosphere in which users may collaborate, if only because many editors (though not I) will have difficulty working with an editor who expresses that he/she would be pleased were an individual to die. It is not the divisive content of the message (i.e., the political aspect) that impairs the communing of editors here, I think, but, instead, the character of the image and text. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:37, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joe is correct in that one cannot joke about killing the president (or this Prednisent). Conspiracy to treason is a very low bar in US law. You can joke about killing me, or wish me dead, and you won't go to prison. The same cannot be said of the prednisent. Beyond that, the page is yet another example of the one thing I find disturbing about the boxen: the more of these doodads we have, the closer we get to being a free web host and replacement for Angelfire. Finally, the servers and the project are <i>private property,</i> and there is no right to expression.

<dd>So it is! Anywho, the person was just blocked indefinitely for trolling, and although it does seem like a sock, I'm not sure who. Anyway, that means I can respond to this now without checking my watchlist every 10 seconds. First off, it's a guideline, not a policy, so I'm not bound to it (though if everyone here agrees that I should change it, I wouldn't want to cause <i>too much</i> drama). Anyway, many users have opinions expressed on their userpages, not just me. Besides most of the content on the page is dedicated to clearly wiki-related things (eg, wikipolitics, my outlook on worldviews and truth and how it affects editing here on wikipedia, pages I've edited, pages I've created, editing interests and wikiprojects). The guideline says that "the Wikipedia community is generally tolerant and offers fairly wide latitude in applying these guidelines to regular participants", and I think I qualify as a regular participant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 00:02, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem I'd say is the sheer volume of polemical statements. Not the fact that you give your opinion, but the way you express it. For instance:
<ul>
<li>This user is opposed to the American Police State and the rampant supression of dissent.</li>
<li>This user believes the death penalty should never be used except on some politicians and CEOs.</li>
<li>This user opposes gun control for civilians but supports gun control for the military and police forces.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There are a great many opinions expressed in this very polemical tone of voice. You're basically using your user page as a noticeboard for political slogans. I don't think that is a defensible use of the user page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, let's see what others think. Like I said, the majority of the page is clearly related to wikipedia. And if you look at the begining of that section I say "If you consider my userboxes divisive or offensive, ask me to explain them, I'll be happy to expand on my ideas, and have done so with users in the past. Chances are we can all learn a lot from each other and where other people are coming from in life". I can't help it if some people consider it "polemical", but I have made a clear attempt to reach out to such people, but whether they choose to listen is up to them. Any opinion that someone expresses can be considered polemical. If people can't learn to edit with someone they don't agree with, they shouldn't be here anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 00:23, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a>, hi. I agree that the majority of your user page is about Wikipedia. The portions of it that I would ask you to consider changing are limited to a few of your userboxes. I would certainly include the first two examples Tony cited above, especially the second one. While I suppose any idea <i>can</i> be taken as polemical, it's hardly a stretch with a call for the death of other people, whether or not they're named. If that's not polemical, then what is? I couldn't really oppose the deletion of that box from your page, but I would be disappointed with the admin who deleted it, for passing up the chance at a mutually beneficial conversation untainted by a heavy handed assertion of the power differential.</dd>
<dd>I would request that you consider the perspective from which Jimbo was speaking when he said "Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project. They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian." Please think about what it would mean to be in the shoes of someone thinking that way. Remember that Jimbo, and those of us who are supporting his idea here, really believe in and care about Wikipedia, and have some real specific knowledge about the social dynamics that emerge in a Wiki structure. It's not random, it's not motivated by a desire to control others, it's not about freedom of speech. Another thing it's not is intuitive; unless you're already thinking this way, a paradigm shift is required. It's worth it though, because we're actually saying something real and meaningful. There's a better way to approach a Wiki than by proclaiming those deeply held political beliefs of yours that way. I don't suggest you hide those beliefs, or compromise them in any way. I do suggest you think of this project in a different way, and try to understand why, even though I have strongly held political beliefs, I don't advertise them on my user page. It's a conscious decision, made because I think Wikipedia is a very important project, which works best when more of us get into the spirit of it, and the spirit of it involves me getting outside of our own particular world views, and trying to see from all perspectives, so as to better understand <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, which are the magic ingredients that make this whole thing run. If my political beliefs were presented in a remotely in-your-face way on my userpage, they would strike me as very out of place, just like keeping my tennis shoes in the food cupboard, or car parts in the bathroom with the toothpaste. The fact that I don't keep my car parts on the bathroom sink isn't because I'm trying to hide them, or because some fascist is oppressing my freedom to store car parts where I want to - it's just that isn't where they go.</dd>

<dd>The way I see it (and perhaps I'm being far to utopian) is that people need to be able to deal with people regardless of their politics. I have worked well with users who have had vastly different views than mine, and with the exception of neo-nazis and a few others of their ilk, I'm very open to discussion on differing ideas. I would hope other people would be too. But since I don't feel like getting into a big stink about all this, and because my own idea is perhaps far to unrealistic (it often seems to be in real life, and based on some of the vandalism on my userpage and snide comments on my talk page from anons/new users the last two days, perhaps here as well) I have tried to tone some of it down. Despite this, I have said many times and continue to say, that people who can't handle differing ideas really shouldn't be here anyways, and probably should stay in whatever political ghetto they come from, since they clearly do not have enough social skills to interact with a broader society. I think this segment of my manifesto sums it up well:
<blockquote>
<p>We must respect each other's differences in opinion and should work to create a truly pluralistic on-line society. This includes open discussion of opinions, which cannot be accomplished by banning "divisive" opinions from userpages. Most people are able to respect the differences of others, and the few who are not will still have to answer to the rest of the community for any disruptions they may cause.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Trying to hide ideas because they might be unpopular makes the community nothing but a group of faceless robots with little individual character. I think the question becomes, "which is more valuable: free expression of ideas or selfless devotion to uniformity?" Anyway, I'm done ranting, so unless anyone else has something to say, I will consider this matter closed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I get the impression from your reply that you didn't read what I wrote, since you seem to replying, not to it, but to some strawman argument in which someone argues against free expression. Since I'm not against that, I'm sort of puzzled by your answer. Note especially that I said "I don't suggest you hide those beliefs".

<dd>I was responding largely to this sentence: "I do suggest you think of this project in a different way, and try to understand why, even though I have strongly held political beliefs, I don't advertise them on my user page". I did read what you said, and I was trying to think of a better way of phrasing my post, but was getting tired and had written too much. It was more the attitude of some editors. I realize you are not trying to force me to do anything, and I also understand your intentions are good. I'm just trying to show why I believe a better way to approach wikipedia, and the world in general is with your ideas on the table, open for discussion. Of course, to put your ideas out there, you should be (and I think I am) open-minded and ready to seriously examine other ideas as well. I'm just saying we have different outlooks, and yours seems to include the idea of hiding your ideas to create a false unity between editors, whereas I feel we have strength in our diversity. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 22:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for telling me in some more detail what you think I'm saying; slowly we learn to understand one another. You suggest that my outlook includes the idea of hiding our views in order to create a false sense of unity - that's a misunderstanding. I didn't say that, I wouldn't say it, and I don't believe it. I agree that we have strength in diversity, and that we should celebrate that. Apparently, I'm quite bad at communicating the view I'm actually trying to get across, but I'll try again.</dd>
<dd>Do you have different roles in your life? Sometimes, perhaps you're a student, or an employee, or a sibling, or a parent, or a sports fan, or a volunteer, or an actor, or a gamer, or... lots of things you might be. Do you talk about each of those roles, when you're in the other ones? I mean, isn't it conceivable that someone takes on different roles, and doesn't really find occasion to talk about one when they're in another, at least in some cases? If you don't happen to mention your sports allegiances when performing your role as a volunteer, does that mean you're hiding them, or denying them? Couldn't it just mean that they're out of context? What if you had a vision of your role as a Wikipedian, that just made it so that you didn't feel your political views were the number one thing to talk about. If they come up, you have no need to hide them - if you ask me about politics, I'll talk your ear off about what I believe and why - but what if working on Wikipedia is a role in which other things are just more important? What if you came to Wikipedia to exercise your ability to get outside of yourself and try your best to see things from multiple perspectives. What if you got really excited about how best to achieve NPOV and AGF, and found those much more important to talk about on your user page than the fact that you're an anarchist? Is that conceivable?</dd>
<dd>I don't want anyone to hide anything. I think it would be awesome if people said "hey, Wikipedia is something pretty amazing, where I go and experience the transcendence of participating in something larger than myself; sometimes I even edit articles to incorporate POVs that I don't normally tolerate, but here, I get to partake in universality, if I try very hard." It's actually a beautiful thing. It makes those boxes <i>feel small</i>. When I'm at Wikipedia, dissolving dichotomies is much more appealing than reinforcing them. How else are you going to edit a controversial article with POV warriors from each side? Not by digging in with one side or the other, that's for sure. Don't hide your POVs, just show that you're far larger than they are.</dd>
<dd>Please let me know if I've managed to come across as saying anything different than what you heard before. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I think I have a better understanding of what you're saying. At the same time, the only roles where I don't incorporate politics/philosophy are roles I really don't want to be in (my job for instance, or being with conservative family members I would rather avoid). The thing is, I view my number one role in life (after being a human) as being an anarchist--everything I do stems from it (except for times in which I'm forced into something that I have little choice in for the time being). So perhaps that is the real underlying issue. At the same time, I have not let that get in the way of my editing. I even got one of the most prominent living American anarchists pissed off at me a few days ago for adding criticism to the article on his webpage, even though I support his website (before finding wikipedia, it was the page I spent most of my time on). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 03:16, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are the evidence of your own homosexual, homoerotic tendency toward males. Since you are the "top editor" of the article, thus "owning" it, it is obvious to me from a lengthy trend in the bias of the article toward male genitals, that your underlying ulterior motive is to increase the number of penises present on wikipedia not for information, merely for your own personal amusement. Obviously this has also struck a chord with other editors of the article. I believe with statistical analysis tools not yet invented for Wiki's history features, we could determine how many times you have edited the article, versuses the other samplings, and would be able to make a judgement about that based on the fact that I am guessing (with some accuracy) that you are the "owner" or "hijacker" of the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Dangerously_3f51.html" title="User:Johnny Dangerously">Johnny Dangerously</a> 01:56, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I must point out that I have not been making personal attacks, or been incivil in particular. I was trying to introduce <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Dangerously_3f51.html" title="User:Johnny Dangerously">User:Johnny Dangerously</a> to the article series, and the caveats of editing anything whatsoever in them. Being able to communicate this effectively, and if possible, with a somewhat lighthearted, humorous spin, is more important than people who object to profanity. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored regarding profanity. Additionally: I have only been blocked once, so far, for incivility. And the last time I checked, having been blocked in the past does not mean one can get blocked for absolutely no valid reason, whenever an administrator feels like it.

<dd>I have to stand up for Dabljuh this once. His comment was outrageous and certainly not in good taste, but I don't believe he deserves a 72-hour block for it. I don't dispute that he's made personal attacks in the past, or that his remarks are colored by a certain... how shall I say it... assumption of bad faith on the part of other editors. But the specific comment in question is more of a joke in bad taste. I don't detect in it any attempt to be deliberately mean to a specific editor. He seems to be focused on lampooning the most extreme viewpoints in the debate. To be honest, I find Dabljuh's tasteless jokes less disruptive than Johnny Dangerously's constant mainspace content blankings against consensus and slurs against Jakew.

<dd>That is why it was called disputed and there are many edit war on it.

<dd>A couple of things. First, why did the original account not get blocked? I'm probably missing something there, but I figured I'd ask. Secondly, Chakabuh showed up in #wikipedia and tried to gather more support there, and when he didn't find it, resorted to namecalling and on his way out the door mentioned that he was <a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">User:AI</a>.

<dd>To Titoxd: You're right. When a named account is an AOL vandal, there's nothing one can do but block. I understand that the collateral damage in that case will be unavoidable. I was just asking that people not do something like block the entire ISP to stop an IP DOS attack or to block for only&#160;:15.

<dd>Because the ArbCom is interested in 'making sure the trains run on time', as it were.

<dd>That, in a nutshell, is the problem—the editors most involved in the issue all think that what <i>the other guy</i> is doing is vandalism.

<dd>Okay, that's an admirable stance. Given that, by nature, personalization on Wiki is kept to a minimum, however, it's absolutely understandable that users would find it a violation when that "personality"—especially when it complies with policy—is altered, without prior notice, query or comment. While it may not violate the <b>letter</b> of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, I remain convinced that it violates the <b>spirit</b> thereof. <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">RadioKirk</span></a></tt> <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 9px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a></tt> 06:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So long as content has been preserved, and everything remained working as well as it did before (arguably, better), than 'violating the spirit of of WP:VAND' sounds like it's stretching the point.

<dd><i>Precisely</i>. Signatures are not comments and vice-versa. A comment tells you the opinion of the person writing it. A signature tells you who wrote the comment. That's all there is to it. Whether or not you have a point, purposely conflating two things isn't helping. A comment is just as useful as long as we can tell who wrote it. A de-formatised signature might be slightly less helpful (as typified by when links to user talk pages are removed), but often it usually we are better off with de-formatised sigs. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With all respect, signatures <b>are</b> comments; "this is how I want to be seen" is every bit a part of the editor (though it should be a very tiny part) as the words (s)he types.

There needs to be some seperation here: Most people <i>did</i> say that sigs were too long, and that shortening them was no big deal. But Tony's block (having followed the conversation) is actually for disruption. It's possible (and often happens!) to be blocked for doing something that's not "wrong" in a disruptive manner.

<dd>Tony, if enough people feel slighted, whether or not they <i>should</i> feel slighted, then you are being disruptive. You cannot dismiss the concerns of those who feel slighted as "rubbish" or "frivolous" without appearing to display contempt and disdain for those individuals. Contempt and disdain create an atmosphere that contributors do not like. This is why <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> is so important. We want it to be pleasantly civil here. In fact, we insist. Your apparent disdain for others is unpleasant and uncivil. Your public spirit and initiative are commendable, but you're naïve to think you can dismiss any complaints you judge to be frivolous, without incurring negative effects on the community around you. Too much heat, Tony. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:35, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, we can all work on our civility. I have acknowledged this and, although I find absolutely no merit in what I view as territorial claims to real estate on Wikipedia discussion pages, I acknowledge that there do actually exist a small number people who take them seriously. However I think you're conflating civility and agreement. One can show respect for a minority position without being unduly influenced by it. We do not, for instance, permit personal attacks, although in straw polls a sizeable minority of editors oppose the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">No personal attacks</a> policy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:05, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

To change it is impolite at best and a <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html#Customizing_your_signature" title="WP:SIG">violation</a> at worst. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">RadioKirk</a> 04:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Contrary to common belief, WP does not treat everyone equally. Old and experienced editors' input count for more than something someone who just arrived yesterday says. A more appropriate comparison would be to people equal to Tony's age/standing on Wikipedia, and I daresay these people would not have been blocked. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:57, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know it doesn't; I'm saying it <b>should</b>. Tony has "power", and he knows it, giving the outward appearance of someone for whom the project takes a back seat to the imposition of his will, anywhere, any time, any page (see above where he forcibly changed my compliant sig here, on the bloody noticeboard!), with the ability to spout (spin?) policy to back himself up. If he actually believes as he appears, he is nothing short of a cancer, growing from within to choke off the beneficial "organs". If he <b>doesn't</b>, he needs to reevaluate what he's doing here and why—and <b>now</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">RadioKirk</a> 17:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then (as I suggested below), bring it to the attention of the arbitration committee. As far as I'm concerned, Tony's actions, while certainly debatable, are not unacceptable, especially for longtime editors. I do not favour the idea of treating editors in an egalitarian manner for the same reason that an encyclopaedia publisher tolerates some mistakes from a longtime editor, but may fire a new employee who makes the same mistakes. We're not here to be fair; we're here to write an encyclopaedia. Having said that, I think that only a decision from the arbcom can finally end this (and even then, things will flare now and then). Piecemeal actions like blocking Tony or randomly altering editors' sigs will only continue to escalate the situation. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:59, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict) So... you are saying that longtime editors can get away with incivility and other behaviour that would get a more recent user blocked? And you think this is a good thing? For months now I've been pointing out what seemed to me an increasing gap between the standards of behaviour admins, particularly certain admins, are held to vs those ordinary users are expected to comply with. Now you seem to suggest that this is intentional. Who knew? Horrifically bad idea in my opinion. There is always a danger of bad behaviour by people in authority. Make it acceptable and it becomes a certainty. Forget about the fact that it is inherently unjust, and thus breeds resentment, it also inevitably leads to increasingly disruptive behaviour and ongoing conflict. You say 'we are here to write an encyclopedia'... consider that allowing the 'senior editors' to bully and harass the actual writers any time they feel like it isn't a good way to go about it. You can be certain that the management at Brittanica doesn't go around to peoples' cubes and toss their family photos and personal effects in the trash with a cry of "unencylopedic!"... nor would they keep their jobs if they did. The longer we tolerate this kind of nonsense the worse it will be for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 18:25, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, because: 1. Tony has a history of being right; 2. Tony has a history of contributing to the encyclopaedia; 3. We know Tony is acting in good faith. When a newbie does something that Tony does, it's an indicator of something systemically wrong with that newbie, because you need to have a track record before you can go around criticising this and that, and simply being outrageously bold. It's pretty much the same with any real organisation or company; people who can do the work, have a history of being right, and clearly aren't acting in bad faithwill be cut more slack. They are subject to the same policies, but not necessarily the same social conventions. The admin vs ordinary user dichotomy is imaginary, simply because most experienced users are also admins, and vice-versa. (Also, I've noticed some "ordinary users" getting off with alleged incivility similar to Tony's.) I'm quite sure that a number of non-admins (e.g. Kim Bruning) who have been around for a while would be cut a similar amount of slack if they did what Tony did. Hell, if Tony quit, I'm sure he'd be treated pretty much the same.</dd>
<dd>The analogy you draw is inaccurate. For one, the picture frame and paper the family photo was printed on is made by the company, and the picture was taken using a company camera. For another, those personal effects are in the editor's cubicle by virtue of having been placed in a common space designated for work use. (This is a very crude analogy, but more accurate than yours.) The cubicles then become so cluttered with these personal effects that prospective employees apply simply to be given such leeway instead of doing any actual work. Can you see why the management (again, crude analogy, but the best one I can think of) would be annoyed and want to crack down? It's not the total obliteration of individuality that people like Tony want. They just want to ensure that people understand that the encyclopaedia comes first, and not colourful signatures on memos which let everyone else on staff know how much of an individual you are. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could not disagree more strongly. Being 'right' and acting in 'good faith' should not excuse generating unnecessary conflict. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a>. When someone deliberately takes a confrontational and disruptive stance rather than politely discussing the issue in an effort to get agreement <b>that</b> is more harmful to "building an encyclopedia" than just about anything they could be standing against. <b>Certainly</b> more harmful than bloody <i>signatures</i>. Saying, 'oh it is ok for him to cause all that disruption rather than discussing it politely with the users because he is a good contributor' amounts to rewriting 'pillar #4' to say 'be polite and work together... unless you have sufficient support from the PTB to get away with not doing so'... and that is horribly bad policy. On the rest... yes, all analogies are inaccurate... your implication that people come to Wikipedia for the sole purpose of creating fancy signatures and never ever contributing anything positive to the encyclopedia certainly being no less so than mine. Yes, there are some people who set up userpages and put boxes on them and then are never heard from again, but that has <i>always</i> been the case and really has <b>nothing</b> to do with the boxes - since they started doing it long before the boxes even existed. Nor has the 'crusade' been against those users... those with userpage edits and no others have been left largely untouched - at most perhaps losing a box that happened to be one of those deleted. The primary 'targets' are not these non-contributors you suggest, but rather active constructive editors of the encyclopedia. The 'crusaders' always say, "we are here to build an encyclopedia!"... but never explain exactly how ignoring the 'not a battleground' principle over something as <i>inconsequential</i> as signatures is supposed to accomplish that. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a section of Tony's talk page which (among others) I and Mongo had comments on, which Tony removed and did not "refactor", simply took it away. It was not personal attacks, and specifically included references to the discussion on Wikien-L in which a number of people have complained about Tony's current behavior. I was seeking to remind him that there is widespread opposition to Tony being contentious enough that people complain so loudly. Regardless of the silly signature refactoring issue, there <i>is</i> a clear policy and admin activity question posed by Tony's activities which continue to garner extremely upset refactorees. Regardless of whether those are silly signatures, the discussion regarding whether Tony's activities, in causing this much strife, are bad for WP on the whole <i>is</i> a legitimate discussion. Tony deleting that section off his talk page is not refactoring/summarization, and is not deleting vandalism. This is not appropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On refactoring of signatures, I think George is completely misunderatanding why signatures are refactored in the first place. As far as I'm aware that is <i>no</i> signature that cannot be refactored. My own relatively small signature, for instance, produced by Mediawiki's interface, can be refactored by deleting everything between the pipe character and the first right bracket (as I've done here). The complainers' problem is that they falsely believe themselves to have grounds for complaint. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:59, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: Shell_Kinney's "disturbing" comments, since when do we post block notifications here asking permission for blocks? The accepted standard is to block and then notify.

<dd>Yes, they are. I would find no super-char sigs on various backloged pages a great improvement. I am having difficulties navigating through those pages, and it is wasting my time because it <i>should</i> take me a few seconds to remove a protection notice from WP:PP.

<dd>Just took a gander; at 1024x768, it's easy enough to go to the first line that doesn't start with <i>color=</i> (grin).

<dd>Again, should I take it as a no? (you don't note any of the pages you un/protect on WP:PP?) I'm a non-native English speaker, so maybe I'm not your average admin. The fact is that these super-char sigs complicates things for no good reason.

<dd>On second thought, I want to clarify that I didn't mean for that first sentence to come across as overly critical, or acerbic in any way. And in case there's no followup, I'll explain that from my standpoint, if you haven't been using WP:PP to note un/protects, it's no big deal (I simply ctrl.F'd the history three-500s and didn't see your name, is why I asked), but please start using it more regularly from now on. This is unrelated to any of this, and in the scope of this, just a minor point I wanted to bring to your attention.

<dd>I do not edit that page, at this point, but I'll keep it on my list—meantime, I did run through the edit window to see if anything seemed unusually challenging or difficult, and it wasn't—at least, not for me. As I've mentioned before, though, I can see how this could present a challenge; but, again, this points to a need to deal with policy as a policy, not as a personal preference.

<dd>Who told you that? That's a total mischaracterisation of clerks' role in arbitration (unless Tony has some extracurricular activities I'm unaware of). When clerks write anything in the workshop, they do it in their capacity as normal editors. The arbitrators act independently in deciding what to include in their final decision, and at no step in the process of deliberation are clerks involved. We don't even have read access to the arbitrators' mailing list. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you look at Arbitration Committee announcements (of which I make quite a lot) they always contain a link to the Arbitration Committee's final decision in the case, and from that you can follow the paper trail to see which arbitrators took part and how they voted.

<dd>I welcome the report here, as I would like to have a wider input on this topic. The extensive edit war stretching various pages related to the term apartheid has resulted in a series of AfD's, a protecting of three pages (<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa_3d19.html" title="Apartheid outside of South Africa">Apartheid outside of South Africa</a>) and much soapboxing. The word <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> itself is just a redirect to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a>. After I protected <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Israeli apartheid (epithet)</a> as a result of edit and move warring, I have gotten involved as an informal mediator as there was a request for changes to that page at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=57262499&amp;oldid=57253828" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=57262499&amp;oldid=57253828" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. After everybody had given their input, it was clear that there is a consensus to change the first sentence (all but one editor), and that there was a solid majority to change the page away from <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Israeli apartheid (epithet)</a> to either <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a>. A small majority was in favour of moving it to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, and this is in line with existing policies and guidelines such as <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p>The page move was done under the veil of following consensus. In reality there was a majority of users against the move. One could argue that the move follows WP:DAB and WP:NPOV but it certainly is not definitive.

<dd>First, my count at the first of those pages indicated 7 or 8 against the unqualified title "Israeli apartheid" and 5 in favor. Second, with all respect, I believe the fact that the "poll" or "vote" or whatever, was taken in three different places, invalidates the result. Those who expressed their opinion in one place did not necessarily know there were discussions going on elsewhere and did not have the benefit of those discussions. Third, you set up a "vote" in a particular location and if someone wanted to comment, they probably should have commented there. So I don't see a valid majority here. And I'd also point out that this underlines, in perhaps a somewhat comical fashion, the pitfalls of the fragmentation of discussions that has taken place. I see that you tried to "centralize" the discussion in a particular place, but there is no guarantee that everyone who is interested in the subject will go to that location. I am quickly coming to the conclusion that the whole effort is pointless. I am beginning to think that every article that has anything to do with the Israeli-Arab conflict should have a label that says something like "Wikipedia has determined that the group editing process is unable to produce a consensus article on this subject." At least, that is <b>my</b> determination, but it seems pretty clear. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 01:17, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That entire afd was extremely suspect, nearly all of the "keep" votes were submitted by editors who have no history of editing either that article or even the wider subject area, also somewhat strangly, almost none of the editors have touched the article since.

<dd>Moshe, the fact is the only person found to be vote-stacking during the AFD in question was Zeq who was spamming people encouraging them to vote to delete the article and was banned for 72 hours as a result. Is it your argument that the number of "Delete" votes is exaggerated? If not, why not given that the only evidence of vote stacking is related to Zeq's attempt to get the article deleted? I sent you one email while I was banned for 24 hours for 3RR and that email had nothing to do with the AFD and I emailed a few ArbComm members about Zeq's conduct. Sending editors emails about matters other than the AFD is a) not "spamming" b) not evidence of anything to do with the AFD. The last time you raised this insinuation I asked you to email the AFD participants yourself and ask them - have you done this? If not, why not? It's easy to make insinuations when you are unwilling to actually inquire about the facts for fear of being proven wrong. Your insinuations are baseless and are borderline violations of "No personal attacks".Homey 16:27, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moshe, here are some facts:</p>
<p>1) Zeq was found to be vote-stacking by contacting editors and encouraging them to vote "delete"</p>
<p>2) a number of the people who voted "delete" have not touched the article, before or since.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that, given 1) and 2) the number of "delete" votes is suspiciously high and that the outcome of the AFD should be declared to be a consensus for "keep" rather than "no consensus"? Homey 16:33, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kim, I am bewildered that you moved this page. In a contentious discussion covering many pages, it seems to me that the central and most contentious issues are whether this page should exist and, and if yes then how to name it. If people cannot agree on a title when the article is unprotected, changing it while the article is protected seems very inappropriate. Now that people have told you that there is no consensus, I cannot understand why you haven't yet moved it back.</dd>

<p>I've just noticed an unblock with the unblock text "AOL proxy; it is against guideline and policy to tell people to "complain to their ISP.", which is in response to a block "repeated vandalism from this AOL IP range, sorry, complain to <a href="mailto:abuse@aol.com" class="external text" title="mailto:abuse@aol.com" rel="nofollow">your ISP</a>)". The block was rather broad ranged (a /24) and for 3 hours which seems a little excessive for the collateral damage for AOL, but the aside the idea that it is against policy or guidelines to get users to raise issue with their ISP seems to be a nonsense. The <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">block message</a> actually suggests those impacted by the block can contact there ISP.

<p>It was me who did the unblock and the nastygram. A primer for those who haven't heard this before: AOL proxies roll, and the user doesn't know which or when the IP rolls. It occurs, with AOL itself, with <i>every page load.</i> Thus, if you see 24.XXX.XXX.XX vandalizing, and you block it, <i>that troll will never see the block.</i> He or she will go on to a new IP involuntarily. Instead, some innocent person will roll into that IP and find himself blocked. I don't use AOL. Instead, because it's $10/month instead of $25, I use Netscape ISP. Netscape is owned by AOL, and so I get routed through the AOL pool. This means that I can write a full article, have references and everything, and then click to "save" and see that I'm blocked because someone decided he'd had enough of AOL and blocked <i>the whole damn ISP and its hundreds of users.</i> Great. I fully sympathize with the frustration of trying to combat AOL vandals. If you have an IP that resolves to AOL, block it for :15. That's about the longest that an AOL user will be at a particular IP. If you catch him just right, you'll mess up the vandal without slapping the innocent. For my part, I'll try to be more polite in my unblock messages if people are more polite and less contemptuous in their blocks of <i>a whole ISP.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:25, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that if your ISP does something unusual that makes it harder for the rest of the Internet to stop abuse from that ISP ... then you should <i>expect</i> to be blocked randomly once in a while. I'm not saying that the random blocking is good or that you deserved it for using an AOL-owned ISP. But as a technically aware Internet user, you should be cognizant of the fact that your ISP putting you on a random proxy makes it much harder for sites such as Wikipedia to block abusers on your ISP without blocking you too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your ISP is making it effectively impossible to block <i>some but not all</i> of its users. It is doing so by creating a proxy setup that is <i>entirely idiosyncratic</i> -- to my knowledge, very few (if any) other Internet sites do what AOL is doing. I see that you recognize that some of your fellow AOL-proxy users <i>do</i> abuse Wikipedia, and as a Wikipedian I assume you want to <i>stop</i> that abuse. But please understand that AOL is willfully making the job of Wikipedia administrators -- and other Internet abuse fighters -- <i>needlessly difficult.</i> Please lay the blame for that difficulty at AOL's feet and not those of Wikipedia admins. (And no, I'm not an admin.) --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 04:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can say that it's idiosyncracy, if you wish, and I <i>am</i> a Wikipedia admin (which is why I could unblock), but it <b>is</b>, as I've said, our guideline/policy not to block an ISP, to block AOL only for :15 at a time. Yes, AOL does something funky to its users and its clients, but AOL is far, far, far too large to say, "Tough! You Losers need to lump it." This is not an ongoing debate, but established. We all agree that what AOL does makes things virtually impossible, and some of the AOL vandals seem to know it and exploit it, but there's nothing we can do about it as things stand now. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When Geogre says "there's nothing we can do about it", it sounds to me as if he is saying, "We can't block AOL, so we have to let vandals vandalize, at least once every 15 minutes." I disagree. If a persistent vandal is operating from AOL, and AOL makes it effectively impossible to target a block narrowly at that vandal alone, then blocking AOL entirely, for as long as is necessary, is certainly an option.</p>
<p>The party that needs to change their ways in order to solve this problem isn't Wikipedia; it's AOL. It would be entirely reasonable to present a special page to users blocked under this circumstance, something that said, perhaps: <i>"We're sorry, but your ISP's proxy setup is preventing us from distinguishing you from some jerk who's trying to replace all the adjectives on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<dd>Blocking AOL for more than :15 is against our guidelines. If you want to deny Wikipedia the edits of the five or six administrators who use AOL proxies, plus the 15-30 regular editors who do, simply because you don't like AOL, then you may not have the correct disposition for holding the block button. Yes, we do have to put up with the vandalism. No, we can't block an entire ISP...<b>ANY ISP</b>...because a vandal is operating from it. Blocking an entire ISP is done only after serious discussion and proof that, like Sodom and Gamorrah, not a single just man is left there. But, because you don't like AOL's business practices, you think that it should be an exception? That we wouldn't block SBC because it has vandals, but we will block AOL because you can't nail down the specific vandal? All I can say is that I profoundly disagree and suggest that you re-think your position. We <i>can</i> wheel war, of course, but there's absolutely no profit in that for anybody. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(edit conflict) Oh, sorry. Yeah, I deleted them. It appeared from two of the edit summaries that they were brothers who were taking turns smack-talking in Wikipedia edit summaries.

<p>Links provided by the article's creator, User:ForeverYoung2, indicates that "Dew" is 13 years old, or at least was 13 in 2005. See the links at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Casey_and_dew_38ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Casey and dew">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Casey and dew</a>. According the nashvillescene link, Casey is an adult, "living" with Dew. This seems like we want to question having an article about the "adventures" of a pederast and the 13-year-old boy he is having sex with. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, and as I'll note at the AfD, the only relevant question is whether the pair (or the Internet site on which they describe/depict their <i>adventures</i>) are notable; even as I'm not offended by much of anything, there are surely articles here, as we've well discussed, the subjects of which many readers find distasteful. To be sure, an article about an individual who has sex with a 13-year-old boy (see, for example, the numerous teachers at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStatutory_rapists_a8ee.html" title="Category:Statutory rapists">Category:Statutory rapists</a>) is different from an article about the exploits themselves, but if the exploits, as disseminated on the Internet, are notable (per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, for example), the article ought to stay. In any case, since there is no legal issue and since I don't imagine that anyone will invoke <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> with respect to the article, I don't know that there's any issue here that requires admin intervention, although I imagine that Zoe probably brought the AfD to AN/I in order that respected editors might weigh in on a quasi-contentious issue, and that's probably fine. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:47, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I presume Zoe's reason for raising it here is that there have been a number of cases recently where users were using Wikipedia talk pages to arrange assignations with minors. My presumption is she's asking whether this article raises similar issues. My advice would be: run it by Wikimedia's lawyers, just to be on the safe side. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 20:55, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I'm wondering whether an article <i>about</i> the exploits of a grown man and his teenaged lover are something we want to retain. <i>As well</i> as whether it meets notability concerns. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and I suppose I'm suggesting that the former concern isn't one I share (or that I think to be encyclopedic); it should be said, though, that, even with the inability of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to command a consensus, there does seem to be a trend (see, e.g., in various discussions apropos of <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>) toward users' opposing our having articles such as this on grounds other than <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, and so I think, even as the question is easy for me to answer, it's one that the community likely wants asked. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, Kim, User 999 has been playing games. We have gathered concrete evidence of his active recruitment of other users for revert war activity. Somehow today, he managed to convince an adminsitrator that Opuat is a sock of Frater Fiat Lux, getting both users improperly blocked. How can this be straightened out? How can I find out which Administrator did this? A cimple examination of each users IP adress should straighten this out. Opuat is an editor who lives and edits from Germany whereas Frater Fiat Lux is in the UK. And NO, User 999, your games are NOT funny. Should not User 999 perhaps be blocked for violation of Wikipedia's rule on disruptive behavior?--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanoni666_cca2.html" title="User:Zanoni666">Zanoni666</a> 01:53, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>They appear to follow the editing patterns of the North Carolina vandal, by tring to create a fake town called Zandi's Bay, North Carolina and make it a county seat as opposed to some rather large city. I got that article up for deletion, and all their screwy edits I or someone else reverted. Fake statistics, manipulation of North carolina articles.

<p>The fact that so many people spend so much time creating an entire persona around their patterns of vandalism tends to make me believe that they are probably doing it because we spend so much time openly talking about them and giving them names like the "North Carolina Vandal", a result of this is we end up massaging their egos. I understand the importance of synchronizing the efforts to revert their abuse, but I still think a lot of the worst vandals wouldn't be spending so much of their lives screwing up wikipedia if we tried to treat them like any normal attention seeking wierdos in the real word, either ignore them (or pretend to) or ridicule them.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 05:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. We've practically built shrines to some of the more notorious ones (i.e., Willy, Wiki is Communism, etc.).

<dd>Worthy sentiment, but I don't think it'll catch on. "North Carolina Vandal" is easier to remember. And the 'shrines' do serve a purpose - perhaps when we start giving them special pictures, like Willy's car, that's going a bit overboard, but when someone new to Wikipedia asks "hey, why was this guy blocked indefinitely? All he did was move a few pages, maybe he's just experimenting" or "why was <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_Lightbringer_f7b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Lightbringer">this guy</a> blocked indefinitely, POV isn't grounds for an indefinite block?", we should be able to point them to a centralised history. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
