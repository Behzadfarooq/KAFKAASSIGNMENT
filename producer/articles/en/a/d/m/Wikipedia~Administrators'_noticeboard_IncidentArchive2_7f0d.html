I'm not sure that the clause on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> really was debated.

This is afterall, the reason we have an RFC process for usernames.

<dd>As it is mine to point out that it may be better discretion to review the policy pages.

<dd>I concur. on-the-spot blocking is for users who disrupt Wikipedia.

<p>Well, the policy involved, from <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>, is "No deliberately confusing usernames: usernames designed to cause confusion with other contributors, famous figures (living or recently deceased), or features of the software." Yet Netoholic says this policy was not really debated, and thus not enforceable policy except through a cumbersome RFC procedure. So the interesting question is: how would any administrator know what to do? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:23, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>according to what I know, on one hand we have <i>rfc-able</i> policies, like npov, civility, <i>usernames</i> etc., which <i>eventually</i> (arbcom) may lead to blocks. on the other hand, we have offences that are blockable on the spot: vandalism, 3RR, disruption. You cannot block someone because you don't like his/her username any more than you can block someone for a pov edit. This is no endorsement of <i>this</i> username, of course. I do believe s/he will be forced to pick a new name pretty quickly, if someone lists the case on rfc. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:42, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Well, the section <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Usernames" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy#Usernames</a> was cited. It seems to contemplate, but not require a RfC (the discussion could take place on the User talk page of the user). At <a href="../../../p/r/e/User_talk%7EPresident_George_W._Bush_62cf.html" title="User talk:President George W. Bush">User_talk:President_George_W._Bush</a> there is some discussion but no response by the user. This discussion here would serve, I suppose, if the name itself had been the subject of discussion, but we talked about procedure. I guess the short answer is that User:Libertas, who brought this matter to our attention, should have started a RfC rather than coming here or, having brought up the matter here, advised to do a RfC. So would User Libertas or any other interested party please do an RfC? If no one else is available, you may notify me following completion of the RfC and we will go from there. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 12:10, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize, I was once again lecturing without proper knowledge of blocking policy. It appears that you <i>may</i> indeed block offensive usernames without much decorum. However, I suppose this is intended for crudely obscene, racist, anti-semitic, or similar, slurs. GWB's name may be regarded as an obscenity in itself by some people, but it is not a clear case, and it does not disrupt WP. Note that Libertas also objected to <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">User:Che y Marijuana</a>'s name, which I find neither confusing nor inflammatory, and both can easily spend a day or two in the rfc loop. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:24, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>VV has been emailing around.

<dd>If that's what it's over, I still don't get it. VV hadn't touched this article since October 24, 2004. I happen to think his edit is crap, especially some of what he deleted, but plenty of people make a bad edit, that is certainly not the point. It is not, as far as I can tell, a reversion of the article to an earlier state; I'm guessing that it is a reversion of certain paragraphs; I don't have the patience to sort it out: it's a much-edited article, and not one I've worked on. I'm not a <i>connosieur</i> of the issue of what counts as a "reversion", and I haven't been following this arbitration, so I'm not jumping in. Does <i>someone</i> want to take an independent look and see if VV may be right here?

<dd>I agree that it's not clear to me that it's a "revert", i.e. a technical violation of the order. I <i>do</i> think it is, at some level, a violation of the <i>spirit</i> of the order, and I wish the working of the order had been a little clearer (e.g "<i>all</i> edits <b>must</b> be discussed on the talk: page first"). I advised VV as follows:
<dl>
<dd><i>Probably the right move is to do it one paragraph at a time (things go down easier in small bites&#160;:-), by</i> first <i>posting your proposed new version for each para on the talk page, and once people have commented and gotten it to a state where people are OK with it, then swapping it into the article.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>We'll see if they follow that suggestion. It would certainly qualify as a "safe harbour", I think! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:06, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Further communication from VV, which seems entirely reasonable:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I saw the discussion on WP:AN. Thanks for taking a look. I absolutely did not revert, and as I explained to others the overwriting of some of those paragraphs was a mistake which I corrected in my second edit.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>If nothing else, could you at least undo that stupid IP autoblock? It's not like I'm trying to edit anonymously, and it will affect others on the same local net.</dd>

<p>Just a quick note to all Admins that all four of the users in this case have returned as of today—Kevin Baas returned awhile ago, Shorne has stated that he will never come back, and Gzornenplatz and VeryVerily came back today/yesterday. According of the terms of the unanimous Arbitration decision, Gzornenplatz and VeryVerily may not revert a page more than once per day, nor may they revert a page without discussing it on the relevant talk page. If any of the users do so, they may be blocked by any admin for 24 hours. I have already had to block one user for 24 hours for immediately returning to past articles of contention, reviving past edit wars. Please keep an eye on the situation.

<dd>The block done today was based on a flawed evaluation of the situation. VV made two edits today, well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=9195638&amp;oldid=9193126" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=9195638&amp;oldid=9193126" rel="nofollow">one edit</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=9196563" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=9196563" rel="nofollow">one revert</a> back to that version. Neutrality (though not having explained either to VV or on this page), has suggested on IRC that the first edit today was itself a revert from back on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=6845833&amp;oldid=6845038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collectivisation_in_the_USSR&amp;diff=6845833&amp;oldid=6845038" rel="nofollow">October 25th</a>. In actuality, the Oct. 25 edit modified the paragraph in question, while today's removed it entirely. This is not "reverting to a previous version". Neutrality also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VeryVerily&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VeryVerily&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">made no effort</a> to either warn or explain this block to VeryVerily.

<dd>You are absolutely correct. Neutrality says he "had to block" a user (me), when in fact he chose to make a very questionable blocking decision based on an unexpected interpretation of "revert". And why would I not "return" to my area of interest? And if "reviving past edit wars" is what he calls me fixing an article which had been mangled in my absence, well, nothing wrong with that. What a phony. Thanks Netoholic for pointing this out (and warmest regards).

<dd>"Reverting to a previous version of an article" is a very small subset of "reverting changes to an article". Undoing any kind of change is a revert. If somebody deletes a sentence, and you put it back, then that's a revert, regardless of what other changes were made by the same person who originally deleted the sentence, regardless of what other changes are also made by you when you put the sentence back, and regardless of what other changes are made by other people during the intervening time period.

<dd>which, given the content of several of the paras (which support VV's side, e.g. the Maksudov numbers and the Kruschev quote), seemed plausible to me. Yes, yes, I know, they should have been <i>exremely</i> careful in editing this article, etc. Still, just wanted to put that on the record.

<p>This is an inappropriate block not based on a common sense interpretation of the Arbom ruling. Furthermore, Gz was blocked by an admin with whom he was involved in a revert war on a silly technicality. Gz has already explained his reasoning in favor of scrapping Cantus' clumsy country infobox templates; it would just be redundant for him to post the same comments over and over again in over 200 country article talk pages...

Gzornenplatz is a sockpuppet for <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a>, who was permanently banned from contributing to Wikipedia.

<dd>172 is right here, although not about the boxes, which are much better than the vile tables in article source. And indeed sysops have the right and the obligation to enforce ArbCom rulings. But, although he's being unreasonable and the whole stupid edit war is cluttering my watchlist, this ban and especially its justification is going too far. The ruling says "wait for 24 hours", which he did and "discuss on the relevant talk page", which he apparently didn't. So all you can do is ban him for up to 24 hours (where does it say you can add ban periods per edit?).</dd>
<dd>As per other issues, I'm sure that if the ArbCom meant "discuss on the edited page's talk page" and "wait for substantially more than 24", they would have said so. If you think that the ruling is unclear, I suggest you ask the ArbCom to ammend it. If you want to enforce rules, you must stick to them 100% even if you think they're stupid and even if they are stupid. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 08:51, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, if he's reverted 2/3/4 times on dozens of pages, only a 24 hour block is justified? No, the ruling says if he should revert (a singular action), he gets up to 24 hours. This is intentionally restrictive, to prevent the edit warring that he is being punished for. That may seem restrictive or harsh to you or me, but it is the ruling. If anyone from ArbCom wants to clarify that enforcement for multiple violations is supposed to be applied concurrently, then they can speak up. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 09:04, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)

<dd>If you were meant to be allowed to block him for months at a time, why would ArbCom reserve the right to such severe punishment for itself in Article 8? Clearly, once you can show that Gz has repeatedly breached the terms of the ruling, ArbCom will ban him for the remainder of the 3 months.

<dd>Netoholic, I suggest you're overinterpreting the ruling. Blocks of this sort are <i>very</i> rarely applied consecutively rather than concurrently. For Cantus' gross and knowing violation of his revert parole, he got a week - because the ruling said "up to a week". Never mind it was actually 20 edits, it was treated as one gross violation (which is why I blocked him for an entire week). Your howling for blood and attempting to justify such with wikilawyering strikes me as unbecoming at the very least. 56 days really isn't justifiable from the ruling IMO (as an admin, not an arbitrator, as that ruling was made before I was on the arbcom) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 11:30, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Both Cantus and I were under a one-revert-per-24-hours ruling. Cantus clearly violated this on 20 different articles, and was correctly blocked for a week. Yet he did not accept this, and came up with one sockpuppet after another, and so his block was correctly extended. I, on the other hand, did not violate the rules at all. To reiterate the point Zocky made, the arbcom didn't say I can not revert at all. It said I can not revert an article more than once in a 24-hour period. That clearly means I <b>can</b> revert twice if there's 24 hours and one minute in between. If the arbcom didn't want me to do that, it would have set the limit higher and said, for example, I can revert only once in 48 hours or whatever. So let's not come up with this nonsense about "violating the spirit of the rule". The limit has to be somewhere, and if you're within it it's ok, and if you're not it's not, no matter how small the difference may be. Otherwise it's as if you were saying if, say, the voting age is 18, and someone votes when he's just 18 and a day, that he's "gaming the system". That's obviously nonsense. I didn't revert any article twice within 24 hours, so I was completely within the rules on this point.</li>
<li>The other claim is that I didn't discuss the reverts. Even Silsor, who himself blocked me in a similar case, said then: "I am not saying you need to repeat the same point on 28 talk pages." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_page_protection" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_page_protection" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> So I don't need to repeat the same point on the 200 or so talk pages involved in this case either. That would be absurd anyway, and I don't really know if anyone other than Netoholic would seriously make this case. The arbcom ruling means only that I have to discuss reverts with the other side on whatever appropriate page. This I have always done anyway, and did in this case too, on various talk pages, including my own. The case is simple enough anyway, with the issue having previously been discussed on the Village Pump, where various people have already expressed my views so that I didn't have to add another "ditto" there. The simple fact is there is no consensus for changing the long-established practice of having the infoboxes directly in the article, and not in templates, which are not supposed to hold any encyclopedic information at all.</li>
<li>PZFUN should be desysopped for abusing his adminship to win an edit war. The nonsense about him having not been involved until Netoholic notified him is bizarre obfuscation. So what if Netoholic notified him - <i>then</i> PZFUN became involved, took sides in the edit war by reverting my edits which were in no way vandalism or otherwise automatically revertable, and then later he blocked me and continued to revert all of my previous edits to those articles, thus further proving his partiality in the dispute. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 13:34, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed, that's just you. Request whatever you want, but for now the <i>existing</i> arbcom ruling is exactly as I described and I didn't violate it. If you think all reverts are a bad thing, then why don't you propose this is as a general rule? I'd be fine with that, as long as it applies to everyone, and is enforced equally. That you want to force me to automatically have to yield in every dispute proves nothing but your partisanship here. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 15:12, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for providing a little amusement to my morning. If you offered me $1,000,000 to name <b>one</b> article you were involved in an edit war on (without looking, of course&#160;:-), I couldn't do it. So much for "partisanship".</dd>
<dd>As for reverts, yeah, I have no sympathy <i>at all</i> for persistent repeat offendors. Sure, everyone does it a bit when they get wound up, but that's different from making a career of it. As far as I'm concerned, people who cannot grow up and get past reverting just don't belong here. People who cannot work <b>co-operatively</b> to create content get in our way, they don't help. We just don't need them.</dd>
<dd>As for fairness, this is not a government legal system, where everyone is forced into it whether they like it or not. You don't have to be here. The whole point of this project is to create an open, first-rate encyclopaedia, and I think we need to examine all policy in light of that goal. (See preceeding point for an example of this analysis at work.) So if our processes aren't maximally fair, bending over backwards (at a high cost in time and energy to the <i>volunteers</i> who <b>are</b> Wikipedia) to reach the ultimate perfection, TOUGH. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:52, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: <i>As for fairness, this is not a government legal system, where everyone is forced into it whether they like it or not.</i> True. On the same token, fair-minded admins, such as Danny, Mav (who is rejecting that bogus new arbitration request against Gz), and myself, have just as much of a right to resist this brand of vigilantism. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 21:53, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just out of curiousity, at what point does disagreement with your views turn into being an un-"fair-minded admin"? Perhaps you didn't mean it the way it came out sounding, but the wording you picked is, ah, interesting.</dd>
<dd>Also, I had no comment about the handling of this particular incident and 56-day ban, etc (I never even went to look at the article history). My comments were purely in reaction to the (paraphrasing) comment "I can revert as much as I like as long as I stay one micron outside the rules" comment, and follow-ups thereto. So I'll assume that your comment above, about "this kind of vigilantism", applies to the 56-day ban, etc. If not, and there was something in my comments you meant to disagree with, please indicate where you think my thinking was faulty. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 23:14, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Amazing. And yet you claim to know that I'm "making a career of" reverting. You know, it's interesting how you say "<i>We</i> just don't need them" and "<i>You</i> don't have to be here".

<dd>The point here is indeed to create a first-rate encyclopedia - and sometimes, that requires reverting bad edits. You, on the other hand, seem to think a first-rate encyclopedia comes from "peace and quiet" (which would mean giving in to any POV pusher, lest you have to REVERT!). You don't seem to realize that it takes two sides to "work cooperatively". I work perfectly cooperatively with other people who work cooperatively. I can't work cooperatively with POV pushers or people who want to force their style preferences without discussion (as in this case). I might mention that the arbcom ruling called for working towards "mutually acceptable compromises". You know what "mutually" means? It has to be acceptable to both sides. Now sometimes that's just not possible, as two sides have strictly irreconcilable views. That's what naturally causes edit wars. It's a systemic problem. I can hardly be blamed for the lack of a system of content arbitration. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 16:39, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gzornenplatz, you make some excellent points about "compromise" and "discussion", points that I don't disagree with.

<p>For Gzornenplatz: Look, even if you are 100% right and the other side is just being stupidly stubborn, that doesn't give <i>you</i> the right to be stupidly stubborn. Leave country infoboxes in whatever state they are and go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Countries_4ea1.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Countries">Wikiproject Countries</a> and discuss it there. How they look in the source has no bearing on how the article looks, so the whole thing is of secondary importance, and <b>definitely not urgent</b>. Even if somebody is just bold or even stubborn and goes and changes the infoboxes, no purpose is served by you going and reverting them before a consensus on how to handle the things is reached. To put it shortly, the actions of others are no excuse for actions of yours. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 08:26, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is there <i><b>any</b></i> discussion about this? If Gzornenplatz is Wik, he should not be editing here, period. Wik made MAJOR vandalism to Wikipedia which required frantic work by many, many sysops to revert. This ... person should have <i><b>no</b></i> rights here, and should be gone permanently. If someone would give us a yea or nay on this assertion, then that's good enough for me, and he should be banned under this name permanently, as well. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:34, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cantus &amp; Gzornenplatz have both been really annoying on this, back and forth over an issue of content structure, fighting it out as an edit war instead of starting a good discussion someplace and trying to get a broader consensus, but I'd suggest we unblock both <i>if they will pledge to leave all of these articles in whichever state they happen to be in right now</i> and work instead on putting together a poll on policy, then abiding by it. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:06, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>YES! There is no need for change without discussion - but that's what Cantus, PZFUN, and some others are trying to do! I'm merely reverting to the format that has been undisputed for months if not years.

<p>I would be reluctant to have Cantus unblocked at this stage - his week block for gross violation of his revert parole has a few days to go, and he promptly tried to get around it with sockpuppets, at least one of which appears to have been prepared beforehand.

<p>I regret not having unblocked</p>
<p>Mav pointed out in his rejection of the request to have Gzornenplatz arbitrated that using a template for one and only one article is a misuse of the template system and should be removed. Gzornenplatz is just one of several people removing these templates from articles. He is not acting any differently from everybody who is involved in this conflict, especially the admin who was actually the one breaking policy on two accounts-- addding these stupid templates and abusing his adminship by blocking a user with whom he is in a conflict. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 18:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

Technically, the edit still contains a revert, but Talk page shows it to be a <i>consensus</i> version between the parties involved to that moment. At this moment, Viriditas stepped in and claims 3RR was broken. It would seem that this would constitute a <i>new</i> dispute.

<dd>No, I don't see that at all. OneGuy claimed his third revert wasn't a revert before he reverted for a fourth time. Also, Humus never explicitly invited him to revert in any case -- that comment was made after the third revert. It's not that big of a deal, but OneGuy insists its not a revert, and that's what bothers me. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 11:52, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I did not claim Humus reverted the 3RR. I understand OneGuy is aware of the 3RR and argues he did not break it. He would clearly have broken it, were it not for the exchange on the Talk page where Humus, as far as I understand (correct me) <i>invited him</i> to 'revert' as part of a compromise solution. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:37, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I apologize. You did not claim Humus broke the 3RR, but you said he made four reverts in 27 hours. I just took a look at the edit history and I don't see those edits as reverts -- they appear to be just edits. Also, Humus did not make an explicit invitation for OneGuy to revert, in fact just the opposite. In the article edit summary, Humus wrote: <i>Both of us have reverted 3 times in 24hr. Anymore reverts and either of us will be reported.</i> Later, he wrote: <i>I'm offering a compromise: I'll leave B'Tselem alone, you please leave alone the doctors' responses</i>. At no time did Humus invite him to revert. Like I said above, this is not a big deal, but I am concerned about OneGuy's understanding about the 3RR. And, I see no entrapment of any kind.--<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 12:19, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems I have misunderstood. OneGuy seems to argue his 4th revert was mixed with other content addition, not that he was invited to revert. This will obviously not protect him from breaking the 3RR, and it may be I misjudged the affair.

<dd>It's not a big deal to me. Even though I don't agree with OneGuy, I'm not particularly interested in seeing him blocked for violating the policy. Perhaps he merely misunderstood the comments made by Humus, and if so, he should be given the benefit of the doubt as David Gerard implies. Although I never saw the situation as "entrapment", I'm willing to consider that alternate POV. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 12:40, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you say it's not a big deal? You came here and pointed out that he had reverted four times. Presumably you are looking for action to be taken. I agree with Dbachmann. The end product of this rule looks very much like we still have revert wars, but now they are a <i>tool</i> of POV pushers that they use to silence minorities. It takes two (sides) to tango. Perhaps both could be encouraged to discuss it, not revert it?<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 09:14, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the 3RR was never touted as a tool to end disputes. Nor were short 24h blocks. The aim is to facilitate the move from senseless rolling-back to actual discussion. This has been acheived, in this case, and there is now a poll on the article's talk page. Minorities will not be silenced by the 3RR. Dr Zen, I do not think you have understood why Wikipedia exists. The rules are not a big deal, as long as it works.

<dd>I too am unsatisfied with the 3RR, because I too feel that POV-pushers are not really harnessed by it. Alas, I don't (at this moment) have any good ideas on how to fix it. Not too surprising, really - if there was an easy solution, we'd have found it by now. Do you have any suggestions?</dd>
<dd>I mean, if we try and better define what counts as unreasonable behaviour (q.v. the current discussion about 'what's a revert'), that's almost bound to make the rules more complex, which just increases the scope for revert-warriors to "game it one way or another".</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, if we give admins more discretion, so they can step in when they 'clearly' see the intent to revert-war, that's bound to lead to different admins treating vaguely similar situations somwhat differently, and then we get into unfairness issues.</dd>
<dd>Getting rid of the 3RR is no solution either, because then (much as you might wish otherwise), people will <i>not</i> eventually sit down and try and come to a compromise: it just turns into a contest of 'who has the most stamina'. People will just revert endlessly until one side gives up; and if neither will, it's just an endless revert war.</dd>
<dd>It might take really radical measures to significantly improve the situation on what we have now, e.g. being <i>much</i> more willing to hand down really long bans (e.g. year or even more) to edit-warriors (to give them time to mature some). And then you get people coming back under new identities, and the fix to that is even more painful (require real-world ID's). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:16, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the 3RR to be a mess at the moment and share the concern that it is a tool to exclude minority POVs on some articles. I have suggested (elsewhere on this page, I think) that when a breach of the rule takes place, the page concerned be protected for, say, 24 hours to allow a cooling off. If the rule is then broken again, a block may be in order, but the person in breach should be given a further 24 hours to explain their actions. This may seem cumbersome, but it is a way to stop people who feel under siege from groups of like-minded users to at least say what they want and why. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 13:26, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This one is getting ugly and personal so I could probably use some advice or a pair of fresh eyes here. It started as a civil dispute about whether or not some information should be included until someone claiming to be the real Joe Scarborough showed up and started slinging mud. (I say claiming because "Joe" misspelled his own name in his user name.) It didn't help matters that at the same time I discovered that some of the article was plagiarized and so I'm now accused of trying to cover up certain facts by deleting the copyvio material - despite the fact that I replaced much of the same info with a fresh rewrite of those paragraphs. I think the assistance of a neutral admin or two would help clear this up, or at least depersonalize the dispute. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:55, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cantus, first <i>you</i> will obey your block , then we can reconsider RickK's indefinite block on your account. We will not respond to your proposition above, in which you are implicitly making a threat to continue logging on with one new anonymous proxy after another. You had no business posting comments on this page to begin with because you are a indefinitely blocked user, and this only puts you in a deeper hole. Your promises are meaningless, as you have exhausted absolutely all of your credibility by now. So, we will need to see a sign of good faith based on actions. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 05:36, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I'm all for giving people another chance <i>if</i> they are serious about changing their behaviour. Well, Cantus, nobody said <i>fuck you</i> but I think you will have to be prepared to stomach some name-calling after all this. But the namecalling will cease once you have proven your goodwill. If Cantus has learned to behave like a decent editor from this, the effort will not have been all in vain. So I for one am all for unblocking him on parole, of course with the understood implication that he will be slapped with an indefinite block at the first sign of aggressive reverting. Really, people, look at this case. This will go down in WP history as the lamest 'socks of mass reversion' war ever. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:00, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>We must see evidence first that he'll stop coming back with sockpuppets and anon IP proxies before we even can consider unblocking his account. We can't be naïve. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:05, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We can't assume goodwill, though, since clearly Cantus has shown none until now. I think a significant period of time in which Cantus displays willingness to abide by entirely reasonable blocking, and in which he does not create any more sockpuppets or use anon IPs to edit, is required before an indefinite block could be re-considered. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 17:20, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shuttle Buran images are from the former Soviet Union, obviously official photographs, the question of intellectual property was in large unregulated in SU. The whole issue of copyright in today’s Russia is still in a mess, there you have streets filled with CD’s DVD’s, books are published and translated without any fees. Just who owns those photos is really debatable since the legal infrastructure is lacking. Same can be said of the WW2 photos, German propaganda ministry had hundreds of photographers taking pictures on all fronts, publishing them in a variety of magazines and even on postcards and calendars without providing the photographer. Of course, situation was different for someone like Heinrich Hoffman and even Hitler who got massive royalties for use of their “material” and in Hitler’s case, even his likeness was deemed as his “copyright”. As far as I know most of the Hoffman material is now in PD since he was tried as a war profiteer and his assets i believ siezed. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 00:00, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>GeneralPatton, it is very simple: we like to know as much as possible about the sources of all images, <i>not only</i> for licencing reasons, but also for reasons of encyclopedicity. An image without a reference to a source is unencyclopedic, and should be removed on this ground, never mind the copyright laws. So please at least state where you found the image, if you don't have any additional information. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 19:32, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

As to the grounds, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Disruption" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Disruption</a> says <i>disruption is to be objectively defined by specific policies</i>, so I looked for applicable policy on these pictures, but all I could find was in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">Wikipedia:Profanity</a>, where it says <i>do not upload any images that could be considered illegal either for you to upload, or for Wikipedia to store, or for Wikipedia readers to download</i>, which I think sort of covers it. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:24, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, I guess that'd be it. However, he <i>is</i> aware of his actions being disruptive, has been warned before, and still keeps doing it. I think a block significantly longer than the usual 24-hour vandal "tsk-tsk" block is in order — the next time he uploads such an image or vandalizes again. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 13:31, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but if he hasn't been blocked before, I think it's reasonable to make the first one short. (I generally go for 12 hours for non-vandalism "warning" blocks, and his images individually would only be odd, it's only en masse that they are unpalatable, so he's somewhat in a grey zone.) If he continues after <i>that</i>, then go for a week or so. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:45, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The number is a factor, true, but so is
<ul>
<li>his insisting on placing these images in articles where they are not relevant,</li>
<li>his choice of file names , especially the one mentioned above, which I zapped,</li>
<li>his repeatedly using that filename (twice, so far),</li>
<li>the nature of at least some of these images (did you see Image:Angiedp 006.jpg, which has been deleted after having gone through <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>? This <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita.html" title="Lolita">Lolita</a>-style image definitely was not from a family album!),</li>
<li>his ignoring warnings (well, he said something about a "misunderstanding" to <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a>, but I don't believe it),</li>
<li>the fact that these images show minors who cannot legally give consent to their images being published,</li>

<dd>the policy does not have a hole. warn him that his uploads are considered disruptive, and block if he proceeds. We don't even have to invoke pedophilia here.

<dd>I think this block is inappropriate. His last edit is from four minutes <i>before</i> I warned him. After that, he pledged understanding on my talk page. How does that reflect on our system, if one admin warns you, and then another blocks you (for a 6 months), <i>anyway</i>? The images were not clearly pedophile, they would be appropriate in any family album. It's the pattern that struck us as pedophile, as discussed above. In any case, Neutrality had no call to block him for half a year: disruption blocks should be one day, and then up to one week. I don't like this user's behaviour any better than anyone else here, but <i>we should stick to protocol regardless</i>. Will people agree with me, therefore, if I unblock him? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 16:26, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Ah. I was under the impression that he had previously received a number of fairly tough warnings about this kind of content, and had continued to upload them anyway. However, looking at <a href="../../../s/u/d/User_talk%7ESud-Pol_f66a.html" title="User talk:Sud-Pol">his talk page</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sud-Pol_291c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sud-Pol">his contributions</a>, I see that his warning (from Lupo, at 13:29, 3 Jan 2005) was fairly mild, and that since then he's only uploaded one image (at 06:19, 9 Jan 2005) - at least, only one that still shows in the history. So, OK, give him a really explicit warning, and hold the block until he violates that. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 00:16, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He was first warned by <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> on January 2nd after the defacements noted by <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a>. He was then warned by <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> on the 3rd; with <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dbachmann</a>'s and <a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">Fvw</a>'s warning on the 12th, that brings the total to <i><b>five</b></i> unheeded warnings. As for policies, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> used to (until November 24) explicitly state that "Sysops may also permanently block user accounts that do essentially nothing but vandalism." (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Blocking_policy&amp;oldid=7825044#Vandalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Blocking_policy&amp;oldid=7825044#Vandalism" rel="nofollow">Nov 9 copy of Wikipedia:Blocking policy#vandalism</a>.) The wording is now much less clear; it seems to indicate that a username must be blocked initially for 24 hours, and then a <i>maximum</i> of one month following a repeat offence. Presumably some sort of "higher ruling" would then be required for a permanent block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, this is not what is done in practice: If a username is known for nothing but vandalism (granted, this depends on whether you think his pictures of toddlers in diapers are vandalism [which I do, given the context], or his Hans Van Der Hoek hoax is vandalism), the username is unceremoniously blocked <i>indefinitely</i>. There's no need for RfCs or the ArbCom in these cases, if you ask me; we shouldn't waste more time than necessary dealing with such obvious disruptors. -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 03:57, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>well, the block is fine with me, I suppose. I was concerned that my warning may appear disingenious, because it was not 'unheeded'. We'll probably not find out now whether user was serious about stopping the diapers.

<dl>
<dd>A series of incidents have occured recently with the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Soviet_War_6e8b.html" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a> article. First, on 20:52, 12 Jan 2005 CET User:172 rewrote the lead, significantly changing the meaning of the article (see below for my summary explanation how the 172's changes twist the article meaning, for details and likely further discussion see <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolish-Soviet_War_9155.html#NPOV_dispute" title="Talk:Polish-Soviet War">Talk:Polish-Soviet_War#NPOV_dispute</a>). I (incidentally, having written most of the article myself) reverted some of those changes (and went for dinner&#160;:&gt;). In the space of next 2h 172 did 3 rv, helped by Gzornenplatz (wasn't he supposed to keep away from any articles about Poland?) and anon user 131.247.153.22, each with 1 revert, against my mentioned partial change and rv in the favour of my version by Emax (3) and Space Cadet (1). On 00:33, 13 Jan 2005 User:Everyking put the article on protection (in the anon/172 version) without any explanation for his actions. Since then several minor changes (grammar, etc. I have no objections to them) were done by 172 an User:Fred Bauder. For the moment, I am awaiting user 172 replies on the article talk pages. Since admin (accusing Poles of <i>nationalism and mythological hero-worship</i> at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolish-Soviet_War_9155.html#Polish_nationalist_POV" title="Talk:Polish-Soviet War">Talk:Polish-Soviet_War#Polish_nationalist_POV</a>) is involved, I'd like to ask for some kind of observation and perhaps arbitration so the side represented atm by me (and assuming from comments and rv Emax and Space Cadet) can get a fair hearing. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> 00:56, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>About 172's changes I disagree with: 1) 172 is removing any mention that the Bolshevik offensive (<a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Vistula_f5b1.html" title="Target Vistula">Target Vistula</a>) started in December 1918 well before any organised Polish push to the West 2) 172 is removing any mentions that that Bolsheviks' main goal was to spread the communist revolution West and link up with communist sympathisers in the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Revolution_636a.html" title="German Revolution">German Revolution</a> 3) 172 is adding sentences that grossly overstate the extent of Allied help to Poland, calling the 600 French (only) military advisors <i>high-powered Allied intervention</i> and suggesting that they were responsible for <i>a dramatic reversal of military fortunes</i> 4) 172 is rephrasing the part about the <a href="../../../m/i/e/Miedzymorze.html" title="Miedzymorze">Miedzymorze</a> confederation to look like Poland was intent on occupying Ukraine (when in fact Poland was helping the independece movement of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic_ea30.html" title="Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukrainian People's Republic</a>) and thus provoked the Bolshevik self-defensive counter-offensive. In summary, the changes are comparable to saying that the IIWW was provoked by UK and France who helped Poland invade Germany. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> 00:56, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is just an attempt to silence me because I have raised a neutrality dispute, which every user has the right to do on any article. Twice I was reverted without explanation by one editor, who marked his edits as minor. The other time I was reverted with the edit summary reading "revert vandalism." At no time did they bother to leave up the POV heading. Those two editors have since said nothing of substance on talk... There is no such thing as the 'accepted version.' Both versions are disputed... One could call placing this little one-sided account here where it does not belong trolling. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 15:30, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, dear 172, this was not an attempt to silence you. This was an attempt to tone you down, which is a completely different matter. You reworded the article completely without any explanation on the talk page, without any consultation with those of us who have been working on it for some 3 months now and with the only comment being "NPOV", "POV" and "toning down Polish nationalist POV". So, whoever opposes your vision of history must of course be a nationalist, right? Then you started a revert war, and when reverted, instead of asking on the talk page what's wrong with your version or trying to find some compromise, you simply asked your friends to "take a look at the article" prepared by "Polish nationalists". This is not what we expected of you.</dd>
<dd>To make it easily readable: I have nothing against you, your rights to edit the article or your vision of reality. However, I strongly oppose the way you edited the article and the fact that you started insulting others before you ever posted on the talk page of the respective article. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 19:22, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You better provide some diffs and links of where I called you a German nationalist. You merely were in an unholy alliance with German nationalists on the Polish city-name issue, pushing the same version based on quite different motives (here's a telling diff where Emax betrays his real preference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pila&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=6500816" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pila&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=6500816" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). That you, Emax, and Space Cadet are Polish nationalists is more than obvious from your entire edit history.

<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NetBot_dbed.html" title="Special:Contributions/NetBot">NetBot</a> was blocked today by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>.

<dd>See that's the problem... there is a lot of talk about the <i>procedure</i>, yet noone is looking at the request on it's face to just say "Yeah, having an extra hand to help with the mountain of tedious work is a good thing". The only disapprovals have been to <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html#Circular_argument" title="Begging the question">re-hash the argument</a> about whether it does or does not yet have approval.

<p>Before anybody looks any further into this I suggest looking at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#NetBot" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots#NetBot</a> where this is discussed. From what I can tell of that I am not convinced that the bot should be unblocked. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:31, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This discussion confuses me. Netoholic (with whom I have no argument) suggests that an admin keep an eye on his bot's contributions. The purpose of bot approval is to avoid having to watch all bots' contributions at all times, which is an enormous waste of effort. I don't see how this policy could be misunderstood.

<dd>My suggestion to review the contributions is to assure everyone that this bot account is performing a <i>very</i> useful service, without causing harm to articles and without being a server hog. Those are the criteria on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a>. There are also two de facto "levels" of approval - one that says a bot may perform its work, and another, to allow the bot to run flagged so that its edits are not shown in Recentchanges. I would be happy with either level of "approval", and if admins or anyone else here needs to check the contributions, I invite them to at any time. Barring any objections to the stated purpose, though, I ask that the account be unblocked so I can continue assisting in these much-needed areas. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:50, 2005 Jan 14 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support that people do not reject this bot on technicalities, but look into its merits and demerits, and when rejecting it, give their reasons, and suggestions for improvement (sort of like on FAC).

<dd>That bot does a really useful job. I think I saw an admin ask Netoholic for him to modify it to help with some grunt work a while ago.

<p>Reading this whole thing has left me feeling like I've stepped into Alice's Looking Glass. When I took at look at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> on 7 January, it was up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9181040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9181040" rel="nofollow">well over 200KB</a> long. After a fair amount of work (I spent a good part of two days on it), it was down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9248203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9248203" rel="nofollow">about 170KB</a>. Unfortunately, all the easy entries had been done. Basically all of the remaining ones need have have category entries in article deleted and/or changed, and doing that by hand is really painful. I did some (e.g. <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernment_of_North_Carolina_faec.html" title="Category:Government of North Carolina">Category:Government of North Carolina</a>) by hand, and it was a real drag (literally - with the Wikipedia being so slow).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now <i>both</i> bots that were lending a hand with doing the grunt-work are now offline - the Pearle bot because it was doing things inefficiently, and this one because people don't want Netoholic running a bot.</p>
<p>(Complaints of the form "he removed references to template {x} before there was consensus to get rid of it" are not really germane - that's not a problem with the <i>correct operation of the bot</i>, since it's an issue that would have happened anyway had he been doing the work by hand. Ironically, one of the ones people were complaining about he <i>did</i> do by hand.)</p>
<p>How about one of the objectors to Netoholic running this bot instead runs a bot themselves to do <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> stuff, then?

<p>This category was listed on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">Categories for deletion</a>. However, I don't know any process to reverse the votes or change it from not being deleted. There is only one problem attempting to empty the category... the suggested move to Category:Computer and video games by company is an incorrect suggestion, and whether or not placing these articles <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComputer_and_video_games_1070.html" title="Category:Computer and video games">Category:Computer and video games</a> would be considered as disruptive. A few of the articles reference to companies which are now defunct. Although they can be placed into categories that appropriately fit their company, I am uncertain whether that should be the clear solution in this case. Some of the game articles listed in the category have existing companies which have categories, but a lot of them don't seem to. Would it be just best to remove the category from the articles if they already have categories? -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:29, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have looked at the articles in this category several times over the past two days and at a crossroads as to how to deal with it. A lot of the games seemed to be developed by one company and distributed by another. I really don't think we need to be adding a whole bunch of new subcats to Category:Computer and video games by company just for relatively minor companies. I'd prefer to just remove the category from all the articles and be done with it. Most of the games are categorized upside down and inside out it seems enough already. Categorization overkill seems to be rampant in some areas. Categorization is great but only to a certain point. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 23:57, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I opposed deleting this category for all of the above reasons. I did NOT propose making <i>new</i> categories in Category:Computer and video games by company, but to move articles into <i>sub</i>categories of that category where appropriate and remove them from Category:Proprietary games. Actually, I found that with many articles, this had already been done, leaving <i>proprietary</i> largely redundant. While doing this, I found that many companies have <i>software by X</i> categories, but the company's article is not linked to it! This is a mess. (but I digress) I have removed the proprietary tag from all articles that already have a name-brand or series related category. The rest (~30) need to be examined by a gaming expert and adjusted as appropriate. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 06:02, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I figure if I'm restoring a paragraph or a sentence here or there, that's probably a good way to figure out what the other person is willing to accept. If he or she makes a massive edit, and I revert it fully, then we're not really sure where we stand on the individual details. But if I restore one sentence, and the other person leaves it alone, well, maybe that means the other person is willing to accept it. And also, a lot of these restorations of content included revisions that were attempts to abbreviate the content a bit as attempts at compromise. I would love to engage in a point by point discussion about these things, but unfortunately there has not been very much of that happening. To characterize my partial restorations of content as a violation of the 3RR is a total misinterpretation of the rule, in my opinion. If what I was doing is forbidden by the 3RR, then it seems to me people would have no incentive to make edits geared towards finding an acceptable compromise, since they'd just be "reverting" anyway. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:06, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not that I'm intimately involved in this, but, just to point something out, that's what Talk pages are for. <a href="../../../p/i/e/Talk%7EPieces_of_Me_dde5.html" title="Talk:Pieces of Me">Talk:Pieces of Me</a> has a whopping total of one entry, and that's a link to the article's VfD debate. Without Talk pages, there would be similar seesaw editing occuring on any number of contentious articles. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 08:30, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, but this is a dispute that's carried over from other articles; basically, some people believe I've added <i>too much</i> information to the articles and are deleting a lot of it. I don't absolutely object to deletion of some things, but I do object to the kind of massive deletions being attempted by Carnildo. The talk page is right there for him if he wants to explain why he removed something and try to defend it without just revert warring. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:45, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note Everyking is already the subject of an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Everyking_980b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Everyking">RfC with massive support</a> relating almost entirely merely to his exploits on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28album%29.html" title="Autobiography (album)">Autobiography (album)</a> (where he at one point committed <b>five</b> reverts within <b>two</b> hours). I don't believe the 3RR covers partial reverts, but Everyking has definitely been constantly violating the <b>spirit</b> of the 3 revert rule on disputed articles related to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>. That alone is cause enough to worry. I submit no opinion as to this particular dispute, but just letting everyone know Everyking has a history of massive reverting and/or sneaking around the 3RR where Ashlee Simpson is involved. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:35, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
