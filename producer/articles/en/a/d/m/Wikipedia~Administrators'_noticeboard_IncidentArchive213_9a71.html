Ivan had second account which he created in order to nominate Bosniak-related pictures for deletion providing false information about the authors. He is an ethnic Croat, so he created the second account presenting himself to be an ethnic Bosniak who doesn't speak Bosnian, because he is from Australia. According to his user page (original user page) he hates Bosniaks, and makes funny of them. So his "ethnic Bosniak" account was blocked and he was warned. I noticed similar behaviour on Bosniak-related topics:</p>

<p>Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> and his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> in his original user page.</p>
<p>Here are some examples about his Bosniak-image obsession, when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(It should be noted that he first nominated those pictures for deletion)</p>
<p>And here is an example how he put false information when he was not logged in, about the Bosniak-related picture in order to nominate it for deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here is an example when he promoted his ideas using his second blocked account, <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERts_freak_5f1e.html" title="User:Rts freak">Rts_freak</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The worst thing is that he wrote lies about other users who donated pictures to Wikipedia. He said:</p>
<p><i>This image was unlikely to have been taken by <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a>. He has a history of providing dubious sources, and lying about source info. Impropper licence. Since the image is probably unfree, it is also missing a fair use rationale.</i></p>
<p>Now, I want to show you few edits, just about Bosniaks and Bosnian language, he really hates them, when he was not logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello people. Can I please get someone to help me with <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a>? Myself and this user have had disputes in the past, and both of us have been blocked as a result of personal attacks against each other. Our last dispute was a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274183" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274183" rel="nofollow">this edit summary</a>. I then calmly started a discussion with the user about why they would falsely accuse me like that, but he just turned hostile straight away. The user then started provoking me some more, and that's when we started an exchange of personal attacks. I was blocked for 72 hrs for personal attacks, and he was blocked for 2 weeks, as he is a repeat offender. After his block expired, things cooled down, and I haven't heard anything from him so far. But, not ten minutes ago, Emir Arven has restarted with his provocative and offensive edits/behaviour (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:58.165.126.167&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:58.165.126.167&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551051" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551196" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551196" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551775" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113551775" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I am asking if an administrator (or maybe more) could step in, and tell the user to stop falsely accusing, stop provoking, and maybe tell him to read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. I would also like all the personal attacks this user has made against me on his talk page and elsewhere be removed, in accordance with Wikipedia policy. Please help, because when I'm in situations like these, I can't help but retaliate, and that would just result in bad results for me. Anyway, help! <font style="background:none" size="3">—<a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvan_Kricancic_d72f.html" title="User:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkblue" face="Vivaldi">King</font></a><a href="../../../i/v/a/User_talk%7EIvan_Kricancic_1dc4.html" title="User talk:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkred" face="Times New Roman"><b>Ivan</b></font></a></font> 11:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to say this is totally false.

<p><b>Here is conclusion about that</b></p>
<p>Case proven. Besides common interests, origins, and residences, they both edit the exact same deletion disputes minutes after each other, with the same opinions, and even same misspellings (it's). If they aren't the same person, they are brothers editing from the same computer.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have found new evidence that he still continues his sockpuppet behaviour, so I told him that I would report him if he continued:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He told me once: <i>Whenever I see an edit made by a fanatical Bosniak user, I will be sure to include your user name in the edit summary.</i>, and immidiately he went to <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Genocide_3fe2.html" title="Srebrenica Genocide">Srebrenica Genocide</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alija_Izetbegovi%C4%87_86c8.html" title="Alija Izetbegović">Alija Izetbegović</a> articles to provoke. He didn't read the articles, but he reverted it immediately in order to provoke. I asked him about IP address and he didn't answer me. But continued to provoke. Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> and his edit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a>.

<dd>There he goes again - twisting people's words and taking it out of context to try to turn the argument in his favor. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107281793" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107281793" rel="nofollow">The edit where I said the above</a> can clearly be seen as a response to him not aplogising, provoking me some more, and if I acted on my words, it would have been me doing to him, what he has done to me. As for teh IP address, <b>I was the one who even gave him the WHOIS link above</b> - he did not start with a question about the IP - I started that discussion with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107284086" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107284086" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, where I sarcastically tell him that the anon could not be me, as I live hundreds of kilometers away from where it's IP is lcoated.

Emir has only come to the English Wikipedia to provoke, attack and spread his POV - that's what I hate about certain non native English speakers who edit en.wikipedia; a lot of them only come here to spread propaganda and lies. <font style="background:none" size="3">—<a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvan_Kricancic_d72f.html" title="User:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkblue" face="Vivaldi">King</font></a><a href="../../../i/v/a/User_talk%7EIvan_Kricancic_1dc4.html" title="User talk:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkred" face="Times New Roman"><b>Ivan</b></font></a></font> 06:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now I must say, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Ivan_Kricancic_7dc6.html" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Ivan Kricancic">creating sockpuppet pages</a> with <b>absolutely no proof or evidence</b> is in very bad taste.

This whole thing started because of a provocation by Emir, and now Emir just will not stop with the attacks, lies and falsifications. I am <i>yet again</i> asking that a good admin step in, and remove all the personal attacks/falsifications/provocations directed against me by <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">User:Emir Arven</a>. He cannot hide under the guise of doing good for Wikipedia with personal attacks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bosniak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bosniak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274996" rel="nofollow">this</a> - which translated means</p>

<p><i>I want to warn you, that user Ivan Kricancic, look at his user page,in his mad fanatism goes from one picture related to Bosnia to another, and suggests their deletion. Often he does that unsigned: 58.165.115.192. I know it is hard to deal with assholes, but the moron is sick and in this manner he had deleted a lot of articles about Srebrenica also.</i></p>
<p>This is insulting and provocative beyond belief - yet this, and many more attacks like it, have not been removed, and he has not yet been warned or punished for posting the above message numerous times.</p>
<p>Also, notice his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" rel="nofollow">block log</a>.</p>

<p><b>Seven</b> blocks for heavy edit warring, many personal attacks, and rampant incivility.</p>

<p>Now consider his editing patterns, his mannerisms and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" rel="nofollow">his block log</a>, then take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ivan_Kricancic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ivan_Kricancic" rel="nofollow">my block log</a>.

And my other block was as a result of me making personal attacks against <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> after he provoked, harassed and attacked me. Now make a judgment over which editor is more trustworthy. I will ask again, please delete/remove his personal attacks/provocations/insults, warn the user not to do it, and possibly block him - in my opinion (judging by the numerous blocks, edit wars, slander, personal attacks, insults, provocations, and racism from this user) an indefinite block would suffice, but one of you admins may be more tolerant than I am, so a one or two month block would do if an indef is not made. Please read this, and do something about this vandalistic troll.

Let me remind you what you wrote in your second blocked user page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rts_freak&amp;oldid=95928604" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rts_freak&amp;oldid=95928604" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

But, being born and raised in Australia, I suffer from "the curse of the English speakers", that is, It's really hard to learn another language even if you reall want to.</i>. And according to your "interests" and "thoughts" in your original user page it is obvious that you, as a Croat, hate Bosniaks.

<p>Emir, grow up. Please learn how to speak English properly or restrict your activities to the Bosnian Wikipedia. Your childish games, personal attacks, rampant incivility, and blatant lies have no place on the English Wikipedia. We both know that you falsely accused me just for the sake of harassing me.

<p>Let me repeat the summary of this whole situation: Ivan's second account <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERts_freak_5f1e.html" title="User:Rts freak">Rts_freak</a> was blocked indefinitely and he was strongly warned by <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a>. You can see that here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" rel="nofollow">Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet</a>. Ivan had second account which he created in order to nominate Bosniak-related pictures for deletion providing false information about the authors. He is an ethnic Croat, so he created the second account presenting himself to be an ethnic Bosniak who doesn't speak Bosnian, because he is from Australia. According to his user page (original user page) he hates Bosniaks, and makes funny of them. So his "ethnic Bosniak" account was blocked and he was warned. I noticed similar behaviour from the above IP addresses on Bosniak-related topics. Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> and his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> in his original user page.</p>
<p>About his Bosniak-image obsession, here are some examples when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(It should be noted that he first nominated those pictures for deletion)</p>
<p>And here is an example how he put false information when he was not logged in, about the Bosniak-related picture in order to nominate it for deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here is an example when he promoted his ideas using his second blocked account, <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERts_freak_5f1e.html" title="User:Rts freak">Rts_freak</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The worst thing is that he wrote lies about other users who donated pictures to Wikipedia. He said:</p>
<p><i>This image was unlikely to have been taken by <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a>. He has a history of providing dubious sources, and lying about source info. Impropper licence. Since the image is probably unfree, it is also missing a fair use rationale.</i></p>
<p>Now, I want to show you few edits, just about Bosniaks and Bosnian language, he really hates them, when he was not logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many examples, but the best thing is to look again the evidence here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" rel="nofollow">Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet</a> when Ivan was blocked earlier.</p>

<p>I came across an entry on a babel userbox that I'm a bit curious about. Which states: <i>This user does not wish to speak or hear dumbass, but is resigned to the necessity of at least understanding it in an environment of massive collaboration.</i>. To me it seems a bit off to be be referring to all your fellow community members as potential dumbasses. It seems to have been put in the template with this code: <b>:UBX/du-1</b> but I have no idea where to find that. Can anyone offer some insight?--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:53, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

In all reality though, I don't even see effectively saying "I don't like dealing with dumbasses" as terribly uncivil. Who <i>does</i> like to do that?

The incident that led to this block can be seen on <a href="../../../g/i/l/Talk%7EGillian_McKeith_efca.html" title="Talk:Gillian McKeith">Talk:Gillian McKeith</a>. I am not very happy about what happened here. I don't believe I did anything wrong apart from breaching 3RR and even here I was trying to correct broken links and got caught in edit conflicts. I certainly resent the accusation of "acting dumb" and I also take issue against the claim that the material that I was restoring (I was not the original contributor of this material) constitutes original research. I also believe that Slim Virgin's bullet point explaination of the so called "original research" (posted after I was blocked) is flawed. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 09:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to be clarified regarding the current status of <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_sanction_Log_74ce.html#Gene_Nygaard_is_banned_from_non_consensual_article_moves_until_further_notice" title="Wikipedia:Community sanction/Log">community probation</a>. Quoting Gene himself about it, "the page (...) has a big notice a the top: This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained primarily for historical interest". Does the fact that the community sanction page is now tagged as inactive mean that the probations contained therein are void? Gene's probation clearly states that "Gene Nygaard is banned from non consensual article moves until further notice". If the ban is still active, then Gene has been constantly disrespecting it, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Gene+Nygaard&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Gene+Nygaard&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">his move log</a>. Namely, Gene's been moving articles with the well-known purpose of wiping diacritics off their names. Recent examples of this are <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanda_G%C3%A1g_b3a8.html" title="Wanda Gág">Wanda Gág</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanda_Gag_cc84.html" title="Wanda Gag">Wanda Gag</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wanda_Gag&amp;diff=113354283&amp;oldid=100802251" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wanda_Gag&amp;diff=113354283&amp;oldid=100802251" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/g/Eggert_J%C3%B3nsson_1ec6.html" title="Eggert Jónsson">Eggert Jónsson</a> to <a href="../../../e/g/g/Eggert_Jonsson_5c1b.html" title="Eggert Jonsson">Eggert Jonsson</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eggert_J%C3%B3nsson&amp;diff=112831721&amp;oldid=112759712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eggert_J%C3%B3nsson&amp;diff=112831721&amp;oldid=112759712" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87_1d08.html" title="Zoran Petrović">Zoran Petrović</a> to <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87&amp;diff=108852090&amp;oldid=108850522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87&amp;diff=108852090&amp;oldid=108850522" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, among others.

I reminded Gene of his probation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGene_Nygaard&amp;diff=113855966&amp;oldid=113721592" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGene_Nygaard&amp;diff=113855966&amp;oldid=113721592" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, but unsurprisingly Gene replied with his typical strategy of launching random accusations.

<dd>Reliable records of his Hungarian name are irrelevant, and you know it. There was oodles of evidence that "Arpad Elo" was the name always used in his publications, and always used in reference to the <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">Elo rating system</a> in chess for which he is famous (except for places corrupted by Wikipedia). That rating system is the reason he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article in the first place. Note that even the rabid diacritics fanatics like Husond have never tried to move that to Élő rating system; in fact, even they realize that there is absolutely no need for even a redirect from that, because it is <b>never</b> used, just as Arpad Elo never used any other spelling for the last 80 years of his life. That is one of tens or hundreds of cases where bad moves have been reversed. Our article is at <a href="../../../h/o/_/Ho_Chi_Minh_43ed.html" title="Ho Chi Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a> and not at at <a href="../../../h/%E1%BB%93/_/H%E1%BB%93_Ch%C3%AD_Minh_340b.html" title="Hồ Chí Minh">Hồ Chí Minh</a> (which is of course a redirect). You are just a sore loser, Husond, because you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Amer_Delic&amp;diff=109960613&amp;oldid=109245170" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Amer_Delic&amp;diff=109960613&amp;oldid=109245170" rel="nofollow">argued unsuccessfully</a> for retaining improper names in cases such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amer_Delic_9209.html" title="Amer Delic">Amer Delic</a> and others.</dd>

<dd>And then you have the gall to come here and try to pull the wool over the eyes of the people here, trying to falsely imply that when a name is or was sometimes written with diacritics that the version with diacritics is always the proper one to use, and that if it is written with a varying number of letters with diacritics, the version with the most diacritics is the proper one. Why in the world are you so hell-bound on eliminating the use of the English language on the English Wikipedia in any case? Why you consistently claim that there is some error in using the English alphabet when writing in English? We may choose to use diacritics in many of the names here on Wikipedia, but we do not do so because it is incorrect not to do so in English. Rather, we are choosing among legitimate alternatives.</dd>

Husond puts his blinders on when it comes to abuses of admin powers as well as the violations of the rule against personal attacks by his fellow admin who has helped out with many of these undiscussed, unreferenced and improper moves, but for some reason has a vendetta against me. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think maybe you both should step away from the issue (and each other), as all of this is turning into a bit of a war. I'm sure the diacritics will work themselves out without the two of you for a short time until you can both cool off.</dd>

<dd>That said, I do find that moving a page over another Admin's block as <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">User:Jonathunder</a> did, or in spite of a community probation against such activity, as <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">User:Gene Nygaard</a> did, is not a particularly productive way to ensure that we all have the best Wikipedia we can.

<dl>
<dd>If, as Husond claims, he was merely reverting on the basis that I had violated the earlier discussion (which I totally dispute), then what in the hell cause does he, or you, have to complain about an independent determination to move it on the basis fo the facts of the case, whether it is by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">User:Jonathunder</a> or any other editor whatsoever? If <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">User:Husond</a> wasn't making a determination to revert on the basis of the facts of the case, then it remains an open field.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, if instead Husond was indeed basing his move on the facts of the case, then in light of the fact that it had already been pointed out that the previous move was <b>unreferenced, undiscussed, and controversial</b>, then it was incumbent upon <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">User:Husond</a> to engage in that discussion, to cite his reasons and see if anyone else agreed or disagreed, before making the move. <b>Husond did not do so.</b> He can't have it both ways. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 22:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been an ongoing discussion for over a week about whether it is correct to call Sparta a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> in the introduction to the article <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>. Essentially the argument against is that the introduction links to the article <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> which identifies a country with the ability to "project power on a worldwide scale", which I believe is not correct when applied to Sparta. The argument for is that there are cited references that mention that Sparta was a superpower.</p>
<p>As a compromise I offered that the text calling Sparta a superpower be moved down to within the article where there would be other text detailing Sparta's victories and defeats, for example see this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=113841121&amp;oldid=113797011" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=113841121&amp;oldid=113797011" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.</p>
<p>Those favoring retention of the word superpower are Greek (ethinicity or residents) <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">User:Domitius</a>, and <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">User:NikoSilver</a>, and possibly Greek editor <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">User:Miskin</a>. Editor Miskin does not have information on personal page, but the vast majority of his last 5,000 edits involve Greece. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=5000&amp;target=Miskin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=5000&amp;target=Miskin" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></p>
<p>Those who believe it is inappropriate to call Sparta a superpower include <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">User:Dejvid</a> (native language English), <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGardener_of_Geda_b832.html" title="User:Gardener of Geda">User:Gardener_of_Geda</a> (Scot), <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrshad123_d492.html" title="User:Mehrshad123">User:Mehrshad123</a> (likely Iranian), <a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwospoonfuls_7e0d.html" title="User:Twospoonfuls">User:Twospoonfuls</a> (speaks English and Russian), <a href="../../../h/o/d/User%7EHodgetts_619c.html" title="User:Hodgetts">User:Hodgetts</a> (unknown nationality/ethnicity), <a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">User:A.Garnet</a> (likely Turkish) and me <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENayan_Nev_d8e0.html" title="User:Nayan Nev">User:Nayan_Nev</a> (from India).</p>
<p>The entire discussion can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Here is a time sequence of the posts I regard as important.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">User:Yannismarou</a>, who is Greek, joined this discussion about 24 hours back with a post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=113887762&amp;oldid=113883601" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=113887762&amp;oldid=113883601" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> replying to a post by me asking for a RfC or consensus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113842152" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113842152" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. His very first post was critical of me, saying "I think that your interpretation of "consensus" is a bit strange" and "I think that you are the one who should provide consensus supporting your view, and not the editors who defend the current and established version of the lead".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I asked if the latter was Wiki policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=113900176&amp;oldid=113888236" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=113900176&amp;oldid=113888236" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> I did not receive a reply from Yannismarou.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Later he launched a personal attack upon me with innuendoes about my lack of politeness and honesty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114068143&amp;oldid=114067898" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114068143&amp;oldid=114067898" rel="nofollow">[44]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NikoSilver proposed a text which would retain the word <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> in the introduction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114086144&amp;oldid=114085986" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114086144&amp;oldid=114085986" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yannismarou approved of NikoSilver's suggestion, calling it "Nico's great proposal" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114087354&amp;oldid=114087180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114087354&amp;oldid=114087180" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I objected to this suggestion as it did not address the basic point of the debate (describing Sparta as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114087604" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114087604" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yannismarou then claimed that I did not understand "superpower" was not much different from "hegemon" and that I was the only one objecting to NikoSilver's suggestion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114088438" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114088438" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. This is simply misleading as between NikoSilver's suggestion at 16:56 and Yannismarou's post at 17:12 there had elapsed about a quarter of an hour. During this short interval of time others editors objecting to the word <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> had not posted, but that does not mean they had changed their minds. I explained as much by this post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114089936" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114089936" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At which point Yannismarou accused me of being disruptive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114091467" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114091467" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My next two posts said I would accept the text proposed by A. Garnet as a compromise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114091747" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114091747" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114092881" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114092881" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After that Yannismarou blocked me for violating WP:POINT! Essentially the last two posts I could post said I was ready to accept text suggested by another person (A.Garnet) as a compromise, and this according to Yannismarou constituted grounds for blocking me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After blocking me Yannismarou began a section titled "Closing the Discussion" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114094632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114094632" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>. So he was silencing my disagreement with him by blocking me, and then moving on to "closing the discussion."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Saying that the word "superpower" had been correctly used (essentially the basic point of the unsettled debate) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114105972" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114105972" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> Yannismarou unprotected the article and inserted the text suggested by NikoSilver <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=114109876&amp;oldid=114102810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=114109876&amp;oldid=114102810" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>.</dd>

<dd>When my block expired I challenged the correctness of Yannismarou's block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114107265" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114107265" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> (at 18:45) upon which he reverted the article back to its previous version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114102810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114102810" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> (at 18:52).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Essentially Yannismarou took one side of the debate, accused me of being disruptive when I said I did not agree with the version he approved, blocked me, unprotected the article, changed the article to the version he approved, then self-reverted the article after being challenged by me when the block had expired.</p>
<p>I believe the evidence clearly shows my posts did not violate WP:POINT and Yannismarou abused his Admin privileges by blocking me for disagreeing with him on the appropriateness of using the word <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> to describe Sparta.</p>

<dd>Checking Nayan Nev's edit history, it seems that (s)he edited the main article <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> only moderately (plus a bit of reverting vandalism), always including detailed edit comments. I did not see any 3RR violation. Most related contributions were on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Talk%7ESparta_ee06.html" title="Talk:Sparta">Talk:Sparta</a>, trying to resolve the dispute through discussion, where I did not see any inappropriate language. In light of this, it seems the block through Yannismarou was in rush, as I did not see a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation as indicated in the block log, definitely not an <i>egregious disruption</i>.

<dd>It's perhaps worth pointing out that Admin <i>Yannismarou</i> later "regretted" blocking <i>Nayan Nev</i>, though he also said he had "no alternative". I, myself, took no part in the actual article reversions, but my opinion (as an interested observer of the goings-on) is that <i>NN</i> has been quite seriously harassed and bullied by other editors simply because he dared to suggest that any reference to a Greek city-state being a "superpower" was inappropriate. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGardener_of_Geda_b832.html" title="User:Gardener of Geda"><b><font color="red">Gardener</font> <font color="purple">of</font> <font color="blue">Geda</font></b></a> | <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGardener_of_Geda_6b6c.html" title="User talk:Gardener of Geda">Message Me....</a> 00:37, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an outside observer and non-admin, I think this block was extremely inappropriate. Yannismarou was clearly involved in a content dispute with NN, and he blocked him for violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Looking at the talk page, there was no disruption from NN who was calmly and rationally presenting his side of the debate. In fact his last edit before being blocked was to agree with another editor on the other side of the conflict. It looks like Yannismarou doesn't understand the blocking policy or <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 01:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Totally inappropriate use of admin tools by Yannismarou.

<p>This appears to be a textbook case of blocking to gain advantage in a content dispute. There was no violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as claimed, as far as I can tell, nor <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> or <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. All of that said, there's no reason right now to apply MORE admin power to this situation. Yannismarou, please be aware that you have a lot of people looking over your shoulder right now. Everyone else there: civil discussion on the talk page does not require that you all agree on something. Nor does consensus - one person or a small group can't keep there from being a consensus of a majority of others. But you are expected to tolerate civil and polite disagreement and advocacy from those with other content opinions. Failure to do so is violation of AGF. Serious violations of AGF are blockable. NN does not get a free pass to winning the content dispute for having been improperly blocked, either. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yanni's a friend of mine, so I may be a bit biased here, but I'd ask that people take a look at as much of that talk page as they can find time for before handing down judgement like this. While I agree that the block was probably hasty, I don't think it was intended to gain advantage in a content dispute. Rather, I think it was a case of frustration with a discussion in which NN had yet to bring a single source to the table, arguing instead from his (often seriously inaccurate) understanding of the period over an inordinately long discussion (it took me over half an hour to read through it just now). Looking at that talk page as a student of the period, NN's posts are essentially hollow argumentation, and his persistence in rehashing the issue had reached the point that he was getting on people's cases when they tried to take the discussion in a somewhat more interesting and fruitful direction. Although a block from Yannismarou was probably not appropriate in the circumstances, I can't really blame him for trying to restore usability to a talk page that was being appropriated in this way. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 08:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had no contact with Yanni before, but I would also like to hear his comments first before condemning his actions. Admins are also humans, and as such make failures on occasions. A call for desysopping is IMHO not yet appropriate unless there are multiple similar abuses. From my point of view, if Yanni understands&amp;regrets his mistakes, possibly with an apology to NN, a stern warning would suffice. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 10:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you read once again carefully the course of the discussion you will see that more than once, NN interrupted an ongoing discussion with other users in order to promote his point. I warned him once, and I told him that blocking is not my first option here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114091527&amp;oldid=114091281" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114091527&amp;oldid=114091281" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. Before my comment there you can see what this user was kept doing all the time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114091527&amp;oldid=114091281" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&amp;diff=114091527&amp;oldid=114091281" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. A discussion was on with A.Garnet about a part of the lead in discussion, and NN not caring at all started a new section in order to promote his point! Nobody else was there for him!! Nobody else's intervention mattered!!! Only him and the promotion of his own opinion. Before my blocking, NN did exactly the same thing: disruption of an ongoing discussion, interruption of its course (because he did not like it) and starting of a new section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta#Garnet.27s_Proposal_for_Compromise" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta#Garnet.27s_Proposal_for_Compromise" rel="nofollow">here</a> with the imposition of his own positions. He did not care that the above discussion was still ongoing! No!! This did not matter for him!!! And why all that? Because he <i>had to</i> promote his point.<br /></dd>
<dd>If you think that my blocking was improper, I respect your opinion, and I can live with it. But I stand firm that I did the right thing at this particular moment. At least, during NN's blocking we had a proper discussion without the unconstructive participation of a user who disrespected all his co-editors there by interrupting their ongoing discussions in the most impolite and contemptuous way. After all, my blocking of NN was not punitive, it lasted just one hour, and its own purpose was to serve the efforts for the reaching of consensus. I'm sorry consensus was not reached, but thanks to my decision we came too close to an agreement. NN's activity was definitely disruptive and falls under the scope of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>

If you believe that my decision was so wrong that it deserves such a response by Wikipedia's competent organs, then do what is best for Wikipedia. Personally, I do not intend to apologize to a user who disrupted in the worst and most contemtuous way an ongoing discussion in Sparta's article for the finding of a solution just in order to promote his point and who repeatedly acted against consensus in another article (<a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>); a consensus which in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> is his banner.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 10:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

What tipped the bucket, IMO, is that he persistently misinterpreted/ignored the position of others (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>), by "playing fool". His main "dispute" (if we can call that such a lame issue of wording) was that the word "superpower" should either be replaced or limited to within the boundaries of Ancient Greece. When a compromise proposal was made that addressed his concern by replacing plain "superpower" with "superpower of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greek world</a>", he pretended repeatedly that he does not understand the difference (that he himself had requested). He constantly misinterpreted other peoples comments and equated the two. Note that the word "superpower" for Sparta is <a href="../../../s/p/a/Talk%7ESparta_ee06.html#Supersources" title="Talk:Sparta">sourced to exhaustion</a>. I am sorry to see that he keeps twisting and equating the two wordings also here, continuing to "play fool". To add, Yanni is one of the most worthy contributors with multiple featured contributions, and one of the calmest people I've seen around in disputes. I endorse this block, and there is much more than plain "content dispute" in it. Note how many times he posted and reposted the same "playing fool" request, even after he was asked with the politest way to stop, so that we could resolve another more serious issue and come back to it lated. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">Niko</a><a href="../../../n/%21/_/User_talk%7EN%21_85c3.html" title="User talk:N!">Silver</a> 11:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me just add that when Miskin rejected a proposal of him, NN started a new section (the tactics he loves, and which along with his other actions constitute indeed a clear violation of WP:POINT), arguing that Miskin accepted his proposal, and pretending that he did not understand what Miskin said! Me and Miskin repeatedly tried to explain him that he interpreted the answer in question in the wrong way, but he insisted! In this way he once again attempted to mislead all the other users and tried to promote his own point.

<dd>On this i agree with Georgewilliamherbert. While an editor may be difficult to discuss with on the talk page (and I am not saying NN is or is not), this alone is no grounds for blocking. Disrupting the articles may be blockable, but (re)starting discussions is clearly not. You definitely need to re-read on the respective policies! -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 11:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if disrupting an ongoing discussion (not just restarting a discussion, but disrupting the course of an ongoing discussion which is not over), misinterpreting other people's words, being impolite and direspectful towards other users (by not letting them finish their ongoing discussion), and in this way appropriating a talk page does not deserve an effort to restore the usability of the talk page by 1 hour's block, mmm ... then yes I may have to re-read the respective policies.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 11:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never seen anyone called for disruption, much less blocked, for anything as weak as the level of debate I see on the talk page now. I think you both need to re-read the policies. Niko, edit conflicts are edit conflicts, not user abuse issues. The edits I see, all of you could have just ignored them, and gone on with consensus, and nothing they were doing would have actually gotten in the way. There's a world of difference between "he won't shut up" and "he's actively disrupting other attempts to talk". He didn't delete other people's comments that I see, insult anyone gravely, etc. If other stuff met the disruption category... I don't see it yet, but maybe its there.

<dd>I was involved in this dispute. I suggested a few compromises which avoided the term superpower but made reference to Sparta's pre-eminent position in Ancient Greece. NN had accepted two of my compromises. I do not believe NN's block was warranted or helpful. I made no comment on this during the discussion because I thought perhaps NN had a history as disruptive user (people were citing <a href="../../../n/o/f/WP%7ENOFEEDING_69da.html" title="WP:NOFEEDING">WP:NOFEEDING</a>), but this does not seem to be the case. It seems he was blocked because a number of Greek editors saw his opposing view as an annoyance, but what makes it worse is that NN actually agreed to both of my compromises, whilst they were rejected by the other disputants. Furthermore, I was definintely not pleased with Yannis using his admin powers to implement Niko's version while we were in the midst of a debate, though he recognised this and reverted himself later. But the point is his admin powers were not used constructively (or fairly) in this dispute. Sorry Yannis, you are a level headed and capable editor, but this is precisely why I was the only person to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Yannismarou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101908472" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Yannismarou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101908472" rel="nofollow">opposed</a> your adminship, knowing your tendency to fall on the side of Greek editors all too often. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 12:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever your opinion about the blocking may be (and I respect it just like all the opinions here), it is unfair to say that I "fall to the side of Greek editors". During yesterday's discussion I disagreed with Miskin on the part of the lead telling that "Sparta overpowered Persia". I also tried to place the use of the word "superpower" within the right context. Your proposal would be acceptable by me, but as you saw other users did not accept it. At the same time the term "military superpower of the ancient Greek World" was acceptable by the above users and me as well, but it was rejected by you and NN. I don't think this is exactly the case of "falling on the side of Greek editors".--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:12, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>About my implementation of Nicos' proposal: at this moment I thought that a better wording (even without consensus) clarifying the Sparta-Persia balance of power and the meaning of "superpower" (not world but limited hellenic dimensions in this case) was much much better than the previous inaccurate edit under protection. After I edited it, I realised that NN and other users who insist on the removal of "superpower" will keep insisting on the (trivia for me) issue of "superpower", and will not accept my edit accusing me again for abuse of adm power. That is why, I decided to revert to the protected text, and not to be accused of violating any policies. Yes, it terms of policy my editing was wrong; but in terms of encyclopedic accuracy it was towards the correct direction. So, the final solution (revert to the protected text) is in accord with WP policies but it is against historical and scientific accuracy and content quality! This is the problem here!! We keep the bad protected text, because even a better text version is attacked and consensus is not reached.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am seeing the same thing from Yannismarou here that I saw in the Sparta talk page, that is disagreement with him being labeled as disruption. He now says that starting a new section (to offer compromises) is disruptive, though he himself started new sections (like "Nico's great proposal" or "Concluding the discussion"). Basically he took upon himself to find a "consensus" with NikoSilver and objected to me offering an opinion during the process. This is simply censorship.</p>
<p>Looking at Yannismarou's logs, I see that he has only blocked two other registered users (and many anonymous users). The first one is a obvious block for vandalism, the next one is more relevant to this case. The editor User:Laertes_d was blocked by Yannismarou on 10:22, 3 February 2007. I do not condone Laertes_d's behavior, especially his posts <i>after</i> being blocked. The block no doubt infuriated him. The similarity to the existing situation is that this user too had been involved in a content dispute with Yannismarou. Referenced text in the article by Laertes_d had been removed by Yannismarou <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&amp;diff=105117063&amp;oldid=105116999%20this%20reversion" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&amp;diff=105117063&amp;oldid=105116999%20this%20reversion" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> with a generic explanation of "revert all POV". When <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">User:Richardshusr</a> questioned Yannismarou why he had removed referenced text <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105158714" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105158714" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> he received no reply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARichardshusr&amp;diff=114245239&amp;oldid=114244455" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARichardshusr&amp;diff=114245239&amp;oldid=114244455" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. All this was prior to Laertes_d being blocked, so Yannismarou was fully immersed in a content dispute before he blocked Laertes_d. Once again I do not condone the abrasive behavior by Laertes_d, but there was some of that on both sides, but only one got blocked.</p>
<p>Georgewilliamherbert pointed me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK#When_blocking_may_not_be_used" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK#When_blocking_may_not_be_used" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK#When_blocking_may_not_be_used</a> where it says "Blocking to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited. Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute. If in doubt, report the problem to other admins to act on." It is instructive to note that Yannismarou disregarded the directive to report any problem he saw to other admins. This happened in 2 of 3 situations he has ever blocked a registered user.</p>
<p>So where does all this leave us? For the integrity of Wikipedia processes I think this should be resolved now rather than later. Yannismarou maintains that he did no wrong and that "NN's activity was definitely disruptive and falls under the scope of WP:POINT." even after neutral admins Chris and Georgewilliamherbert and neutral editor <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">User:AniMate</a> have told him otherwise. He says "I do not intend to apologize" and goes on to label me "a user who disrupted in the worst and most contemtuous way an ongoing discussion".</p>
<p>We have come a long way, so to leave this hanging is simply encouragement for similar behavior in the future. Here are some options:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) Yannismarou apologizes and agrees to in the future not use admin powers in Greek related articles.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OR</p>
<dl>
<dd>2) As Yannismarou says he is an administrator open to recall, he acts upon it. As his admin actions have already been criticized by two neutral admins, I believe there is sufficient grounds for this.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OR</p>
<dl>
<dd>3) Other Wiki processes are followed.</dd>

<dd>I'm really surprised by NN's comments above, and especially by his inaccurate and false comments. The twisting of incidents which occured in the past is really impressive. More impressive and indicative of his behavior is the fact that NN declares that he "condones" the actions of a user blocked by me in the past <i>after</i> the blocking. He obviously does not condone the insults of this repeatedly blocked user that led to my blocking. I call for all the involved in the discussion users to check the history of this block and the diffs I provided in the userpage of the blocked user, in order to realise if the block was justified or not. The only thing I can do is to express my sorrow for the above comments by NN. His edit warring in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and his last comments here make me worry about the way this user edits in Wikipedia, and make me wonder if the goals he declares (NPOV) for his interventions are the real ones.

<dd>Fortunately everything said in the past can be easily located. As for the two new allegations by Yannismarou, I do not see how saying "I do not condone Laertes_d's behavior, especially his posts <i>after</i> being blocked" equals condoning his behavior in any way. My point was not about the comparative behavior of the two parties, but Yannismarou's ignoring the Wiki directive to have a different admin block Laertes_d. As for my "edit warring" on the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> page, I made one edit, was reverted saying there had been a vote, reverted back requesting the details of the vote, and then stopped editing on receiving the requested information. Essentially ONE edit and ONE revert, that's all I did. Judge for yourself if that qualifies as "edit-warring". <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENayan_Nev_d8e0.html" title="User:Nayan Nev">NN</a> 14:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see this discussion goes down a long way, and this is obviously not helpful for anybody here. I'll take into consideration a comment from Chris in NN's userpage {"Hopefully all the abusive aspects of this incident are now all past and we can all get back to making an encyclopedia"), and I'll apologize for NN's blockage. I recognize it was hasty, but at the moment I thought it served the restoring of the talk page usability. It seems that my decision did not help the final outcome of the discussion there, and the building of a consensus. Following these events, I'll also stay away from the Sparta's page, and I'll hope, at the same time, that an agreed solution will be reached there. This is going to be the best for quality and accuracy, which are the only reasons I took the unpleasant and (as regarded by the majority of editors here, whose opinion I take into serious consideration) wrong decision to block NN.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 14:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite it's been said, Nayan Nev has been an extremely disruptive editor. He has been extensively edit-warring on the limit of 3RR<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=112569953&amp;oldid=112568605" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=112569953&amp;oldid=112568605" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> and has invited Iranian users to edit-war on his POV. He has removed referenced information and has explicitely denied to abide by <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> principles. He continues to randomly invite Iranian editors from Iran-related articles, who are apparently even more disruptive than him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yannismarou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114238818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yannismarou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114238818" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMiskin&amp;diff=114266661&amp;oldid=114245986" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMiskin&amp;diff=114266661&amp;oldid=114245986" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. Some have POV-pusher and vandal past (see <a href="../../../i/m/m/User_talk%7EImmortals_ff2b.html" title="User talk:Immortals">User_Talk:Immortals</a>) and are basically invited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;curid=42968&amp;diff=114206960&amp;oldid=114180478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&amp;curid=42968&amp;diff=114206960&amp;oldid=114180478" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> to edit war - following Nayan's reminder on 3RR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&amp;diff=113955623&amp;oldid=113948645" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&amp;diff=113955623&amp;oldid=113948645" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>. Yannismarou actually tried to speak in Nayan's stead in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution. Nayan kept attacking editors, starting new sections and trolling in a way I've never seen before, and all this during the others were trying to reach a consensus. Which forced me quit the conversation and Yannismarou put on him a one-hour block, only <b>after explicit warning</b>. The debate was basically started due to Nayan's incapability of respecting the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> policy and make edits our counter-edits that are based on credible sources. The article was basically locked as a result of Nayan's organised edit-warring<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=113955077&amp;oldid=113954170" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&amp;diff=113955077&amp;oldid=113954170" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&amp;diff=113955623&amp;oldid=113948645" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&amp;diff=113955623&amp;oldid=113948645" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yannis, just a few words from someone who highly respects your contributions to Wikipedia and supported your RFA. I'm not going to plow through all the diffs or history, but this reads like the kind of situation that gives rise for concern. As an admin, it is up to you to rise above it and set the example. It is in no one's interest for this situation to escalate or fester. My recommendation would be to apologize, and agree to call in another, less-involved admin if future disputes arise on Greek articles. If there is in fact a problem with NN's contributions, that will eventually come to light. I don't support a recall or sysop or ArbCom actions, because I believe you can/will respond reasonably. I recently strongly-opposed another RfA candidate because I firmly believed he may use the tools to influence debate on certain country topics; this is not the kind of discussion that warms people's hearts. Try to end this quickly, and learn from it. All the best, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 17:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The debate is a question of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and not wikipedians' POV. The opposing side doesn't respect <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Also very few of the people mentioned above have <i>ever</i> participated in the actual editing of the article. They all appeared after Nayan's disruptive activity. None of them have presented counter-sources on the question at hand. In my opinion (POV alert) there are only very few of those editors who can be considered as non-partisans, the rest have found themselves there as a result of wp:vendettas and wp:stalking. As shown in the diffs below, Mehrshad was invited by Nayan_Nev to openly start an edit-war, so was User:Immortans and who knows how many others. A. Garnet has never shown interest in the particular article, nor in any related article, nor has he ever proved himself knowledgeable on the topic. He appeared soon after he had a conflict with Domitius in a different article, <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypriot_Civil_War_f841.html" title="Cypriot Civil War">Cypriot Civil War</a> I think, where he received a block. And now, there you see him, pretending to be a completely neutral participant. This demonstrates how exploitable dispute-resultion method and wp:policy are. Nobody really respects the policies, not even old users, and unreferened POV is powerful enough to cause all this. Half of the people participating in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Talk%7ESparta_ee06.html" title="Talk:Sparta">Talk:Sparta</a> have gotten there either by rv-war invitation or by stalking another users' contribution lists. None of them has _ever_ contributed in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>, nor any related article - yet their unsourced opinion counts as much as real contributors' referenced opinion, and is causing all this trouble. This is a just _laughable_ - it reveals how easily a malicious editor can exploit all Policies and still be taken seriously, without offerring any contributions to wikipedia whatsoever. In the apogee of irony - he may even receive an apology! <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In the interest of not escalating the situation, again, if there is a problem with NN's or anyone else's contributions, that will eventually come to light. NPOV is hardly enforced on Wikipedia (Wiki's largest problem IMNSHO), but it's in no one's interest for an involved admin to be blocking; an uninvolved admin should do that. Two wrongs (pervasive POV on Wiki, and involved admins blocking) don't make a right. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 18:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It took me only the time to go back to the original article and delete that content, to see that the new article had been tagged for speedy deletion with reason "content COPIED from another article". Since I believed that reason was not correct, I put in a hangon on the article and started writing the explanation on the Talk page. When I saved the explanation, the article had already been deleted. From creation to explanation, the whole process took less than half an hour.</p>
<p>I don't want to discuss the merits or demerits of the deleted article and of the killed contents, but I'm very, very annoyed at some overzealous admin who couldn't wait another minute to see my explanation and who thus made me waste my (voluntary and good-faith) time.</p>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, editors are supposed to allow time for article expansion before tagging it. Unfortunately, that is ignored a significant amount of the time and considering the backlog <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> normally has, it's usually not an option for the admin deleting it to check to ensure that enough time had been allowed. Responsibility rests with the tagger, in my opinion. I'm <b>not at all</b> a fan of an admin deleting a clearly good-faith article that is speedy-tagged with a {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} without giving enough time for a discussion on the talk page (in this case, less than 3 minutes from {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} to deletion by <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a>).

<dd>I disagree that responsibility rests with the tagger. I believe responsibility rests with the writer, to take the time outside of main name space to create something that will stand up to scrutiny from the get-go. Good faith or no, a half-baked article is still only half-baked, nd there are few guarantees the article will be improved after it hits namespace. If people don't want their articles deleted, it is up to them to put something credible in place in the first place. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 07:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the problem is people want to tag now, rather than having to put "go back and check article X" on their calendar. A solution may be to use {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDelayed_14ca.html" title="Template:Delayed">delayed</a>}} (which I created recently). For example, <code>{{delayed|2007-03-16|2={{db-talk}}}}</code> can be used on a talk page so that {db-talk} will appear on 2007-03-16. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-03-11 02:10Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd>Oooh, very intriguing template right there. My concern at first blush, of course, is adding it and then not checking the article again, so that if, for example, the article is significantly expanded, it would still end up being tagged. Obviously in this case one would hope that the admin wouldn't delete, but I've certainly seen <i>lots</i> of speedy deletions that have gone pretty clearly against policy. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 02:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point.

<dd>I offer you this challenge: spend one evening on New Pages Patrol. My experience is that ten to fifteen percent of articles submitted are of such poor quality or are so frivolous (Damon Edwards is a l33t n00b and chicks dig him; The Wanking Shaggers are an up-and coming band...; Hamilton Heights School is a school in Prince Edward Island) that any reasonable editor would move to speedy-delete them. I read all articles on New Pages, and appreciate the fine quality of articles I often see. But I have no hesitation at all about nominating articles for speedy deletion that have nothing to contribute in terms of noteworthiness or serious intent. Please do not forget that I nominate them, but it takes a second editor to delete them. Please also do not forget that Wikipedia recieves literally thousands of articles an hour, and if there were no watchers at the gates, Wikipedia would quickly reach 15 million articles, most of them not suitable to line a bird cage. In the case of <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_love_you.html" title="I love you">I love you</a>, the article was in fact copied. I don't care that the author claims he wrote the original piece, fact is, the breakout poage was an exact duplicate of what already existed in a very short article, and no breakout was necessary. Claims that it needs "assistance to grow" are frivolous - it is the main article that needs time to improve, not some clip-out copy. As far as <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_entry_schools.html" title="Selective entry schools">Selective entry schools</a> goes, I tagged it as a speedy because it was about two sentences long and contained nothing to assert notability. Criticising me for ignoring a {{hangon}} is kind of odd, because only the deleting editor would have seen that, and that was not me. Bottom line: if authors do not want their pages deleted, they need to put in the time outside main articlespace to create an article that will withstand initial scrutiny before submitting it. I do not believe this is too much to ask. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 07:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yep. The best way to not get your article speedied is to not create speediable articles. Not even if you really are going to add more stuff, Real Soon Now, you promise!

<dd>Exactly. New page patrollers are not mind readers and cannot assess the intention of the author. I've been around here long enough to see very feeble pages linger long after (I assume) the author has lost all interest in Wikipedia. It takes no more time to create a good article in userspace than it does in main namespace, and odds are the rresults if done so will stand much better in a speedy review. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 07:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respond to your sarcasm by saying "not very often". I occasionally run across speedy delete nominations which are improperly tagged, but it's usually the category of tag that's incorrect, not the speedy nomination itself. Once in a while, articles for speedy should better have been prodded (I'm guilty of that myself on occasion) but for the most part, I think new pages patrollers do a good job at an onerous task. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Gwen Gale 09:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</i></a> Are editors who are <i>strong supportors</i> of Essjay are allowed to edit the Essjay controversy article? Currently the quotes are gone from the Wales response and Essjay's response and there is an abnormally huge Reactions section. I could fix the clutter and improve the article. First, the quotes should be put back in the article. Second, the reactions section should be divided into two sections because it is undue weight to have such a long section. Third, someone recently changed a sentence that is now factually false in the Essjay letter's section. Fourth, a link to the offical "My response" of Essjay is of historical significance that belongs in the article. Fifth, many editors already wanted the images to stay in the article. Sixth, this is becoming a story within a story. Some editors want to delete the article. Since deletion is not possible. Then, they want to make the article cluttered, unreadable, and short as possible. Removing the images and the internal link is just some examples to shorten the article. The huge reactions section is just one example of clutter and improper structuring. I do not know what is the next step is this kind of environment. Currently they are trying to suppress pictures of <i>screenshots and images</i> of Essjay's for no valid reason. A few minor cosmetic changes, organization, and direction will dramatically improve the article and flow of reading. It is amazing to try to edit in an environment which a group of editors have made their support for someone who is now retired.</p>
<p>I do not know how to reason with a group of ediotrs in this kind of climate. Assistance and oversight is needed.

Remembering what I'd seen here about the acceptability of applying a block in such cases (that is, blatant personal attacks, even though one is involved in dispute with the culprit), I blocked him for three hours. I think that the behaviour probably warranted a longer block, but I was hesitant because of my involvement (and at the time of the block I'd only seen the edit summary).

<dd>Always better to ask for someone else to review and block if necessary; blocking someone you're engaged in a content dispute with, even if you don't gain advantage from that, is always bad. It looks bad, at least, and there's always the question of whether your judgement was clear when you did it.</dd>
<dd>In this specific instance, I would agree that a block was warranted. John Kenney knows better. John, you gotta go walk away from the keyboard and take a break when you find yourself typing things like that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 11:32, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, block justified, but I think we're all moving in the direction that it's better to get someone else to have a look if attacks are made on yourself. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 13:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. That had been my understanding, but I'd somehow got the idea that earlier discussions here indicated a shift in that position; I must have been wrong. I'll act accordingly in future (which, incidentally, isn't good news for those being blocked, as the blocks will probably be longer). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 14:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I made the mistake of posting the link to an article which I had written (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Baia_4875.html" title="Battle of Baia">Battle of Baia</a>) in a Hungarian forum in order to get some imput from their members.

<dd>I'm not sure how we were supposed to know about it. Anyway, I've just made some small stylistic edits on the article and will watch out for it over the next few days. However, it's nearly bedtime for me, so maybe some other admins can take a look.

<dd>Well, the thing is that he's not here to dispute the content. The guy knows what had happened, but does this just to annoy me. If it were a dispute, we could've talked it through, examined the sources and perhaps compromised on the content. Also, it's Moldavia, not Republic of Moldova.

<p>I notice that there are still a disturbing number of rather harmless usernameblocks that are being issued with <i>account creation blocked</i> checked off.

To cite my <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive152_9f92.html#Disruption_block_review" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive152">first report to ANI</a> from late last year, "[SndrAndrss] has a history of not wanting to answer messages left as the user's talk page (or he is just not understanding that messages there are directed to him), even though this has been pointed out to him on several occations (see his <a href="../../../s/n/d/User_talk%7ESndrAndrss_61ab.html" title="User talk:SndrAndrss">talk page</a>)."</p>
<p>This has lead to several conflicts, mainly on a wide variety of templates where he has added parameters or changed the looks of the template without any consensus whatsoever, or has made incomprehensible edits (such as changing svg images to png, or removing borders around flags). After trying to initiate a discussion with him (either on the talk page of the template or on his user page), nothing happens, and a week later or so, he makes the same edit over again. A few examples of this behaviour:</p>

<p>As noted in my first incident report, I blocked him 48 hours for disruption on 6 December last year, and everyone that reviewed it agreed that it was justified. I had of course hoped that the short block would be a wake-up call for SndrAndrss to start communicating, but was I wrong. Only five days later, <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">User:Morwen</a> blocked him for a week for the same disrupting behaviour, and reported it <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive155_a8ab.html#SndrAndrss_again" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive155">on ANI</a>. Of course, a longer block didn't help either.</p>
<p>And as soon as he returned from the block, he had the same behaviour as before, and I blocked him for another week on 19 December. This time something actually happened. <a href="../../../s/n/d/User_talk%7ESndrAndrss_61ab.html#Unblocking" title="User talk:SndrAndrss">He promised to start communicating</a>, and I assumed good faith, and unblocked him. Of course nothing happened. He made som half-hearted attempts at communicating at various talk pages, but never answered any replies he got.</p>
<p>I wasn't very active in January, so I didn't keep an eye on him during that time, but when I returned, there were no signs of improvement. He was as disrupting as before, combining a few good edits with the undiscussed template edits or page moves. So, I blocked him for two weeks on 18 February this year. This time, it was discovered that he created new accounts to evade the block. In the middle of all this, he asked to be unblocked, a request that was of course declined.</p>
<p>Since the first of his sockpuppet accounts were blocked, he started editing anonymously which was confirmed in a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_SndrAndrss_5425.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/SndrAndrss">request for checkuser</a>. All discovered accounts and IPs were blocked, but new ones keep showing up. They can be quite easily detected though, either as a variation on the form SndrAndrss##, or as IPs in the 88.88.xxx.xxx range. They are found by checking the waterholes, he almost exclusively edits articles related to football, the Olympics, skiing and rally. Sockpuppets and IPs include:</p>

<p>His latest two week block has been restarted twice now as he has kept trying to evade it. I've run out of options now because I am not in the mood to play this game forever. Communication with SndrAndrss has failed, blocking him has failed, and I sincerely doubt that an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">RFAR</a> will do any good since he would probably not discuss or read anything there. What to do next? Since I've not seen a single user that thinks I've gone on too hard, more like the opposite, I find it unthinkable to just let him go and revert whatever he does that is not good. And indefblocking him would just lead to more sockpuppet accounts and a just as hard time finding and blocking them.</p>

<dd>It's certainly useful that he numbers his sockpuppets, which makes it trivial to confirm that he keeps evading his blocks. Persistently disruptive users such as he who show no inclination to communicate or cooperate with the community should simply be indefblocked, and their socks blocked and reverted on sight - which should be possible here given the vandal's narrow range of interests. He'll eventually go away. Accordingly, I'd support a community ban at this point. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It doesn't seem that he is willing to communicate with others. He simply doesn't care of rules, warnings, blocks. Sockpuppetry is prohibited? Doesn't matter, he registers accounts with obvious connections to his main one. I support community ban against him, and recommend temporary semiprotection for his favorite pages. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 21:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No Gene Nygård (:P just had to do that), Darwinek is not a big supporter of SndrAndrss. In fact, it was Darwinek who notified me of SndrAndrss latest sockpuppet, which was what made me write the above post. And your problem with SndrAndrss or Darwinek, or both, has nothing to do with this discussion, as Grandmasterka says.

<p>(<i>Quote</i>) I'm not sure which dream world you live in, but its pointless to talk with you, as it always was. Believe what you please and do what you please. Demean me and Wikipedia on your private web forum - I don't care. I'm only here for knowledge, nothing else. P.S. - the controversy about Muhammad and pedophilia is a <b>legitimate historical debate - criticizing Muhammad is free speech</b>. But Baka's comments were meant as an insult to you, no doubt - I would have blocked him if I had seen that comment but I had not until much later. I don't know why the arbitrators didn't propose a decision against him - that's their business. Don't reply to refute this statement, as I already know that you don't respect me at all.

<p>Just a quick heads up about this user. I was shocked a few days ago when a mild joke I made provoked a furious response from this person (including reporting me here for "personal attacks"), so I took a look at his/her past history. Apparently this person has a history of picking fights on wikipedia:</p>

<p>This user has become quite a problem for several other editors on the board for Shelby Young. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shelby_Young" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shelby_Young" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shelby_Young</a> He has now flat out called me a racist, TWICE. The issue stems from him PRETENDING to be Greek. You'll note on Ms. Young's talk page, him posting in very plain English, harrassing Ms. Young, then reverting to "comical" broken English, which I find to be racist, seeing as how my father is a German immigrant. The user Leebo has been kept abreast of this, but I've had enough. I'm looking for admin intervention here. This user is wikistalking/wikiharrassing a teenager as well as wikiharrassing me. He contributes nothing of value to Wikipedia. If an admin takes action in this matter, would it be feasible to have someone watch Ms. Young's pages as well as those of Hailey Anne Nelson, specifically for baseless attacks from users coming from the North Carolina area?

<dd>To clarify, the main concern is that this user is edit warring with the real Shelby Young on the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelby_Young_3697.html" title="Shelby Young">Shelby Young</a> page.

<p>Actually, you make you first post my user page, not my discussion page and i try change it to my discussion page and you get bent. Anyone see you first post my page should be block you, you have told other people in talk page how you think I am stalker, con artist, you think me a bad editor and you say "How is someone who is greek know so much about Shelby Young."</p>
<p>Not think the internet all america okay?</p>
<p>Any my edit anyone here can see, they can follow all my thing wikipedia and see you follow right behind me.</p>
<p>You make fun because I am greek, I read only what you write, how can you say pretend greek?</p>

<p>"I think you should get off the sock puppet account. It's not listed on imdb.com, hell even the guy who brings david letterman is listed on imdb.com. Enough said. Fan sights don't count here. Shelby Young's own agent said she didn't do the voice, so why come here and use her name as your account just to bolster your own claim."</p>

<p>A few days ago, I sought to open an RfC on <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> after attempts to come to an understanding failed. I was concerned finding a single neutral editor for a "third opinion" option and opted instead for the RfC to get as many different opinions as possible. I consulted with another editor about how to get one started having little experience myself. The editor I went to also had little experience too, so they in turn went to <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> who didn't seem to believe that two editors had made good faith attempts to address <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> on his talk page. As it turned out, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> felt the other editor's attempts were insufficient while I had not. Since I was making the RfC in good faith, I assumed the worst that could happen is that it would be rejected. It was not rejected, and the RfC was active as several editors had posted and others had planned to. I don't want to give the impression that I'm unwilling to accept that the RfC was incorrect. The problem I have is that either out of loyalty or perhaps a bruised ego, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> acted unilaterally to delete an RfC he disagreed with at the request of the subject of said RfC.

<p>If I understand the situation correctly, when soliciting advice from an administrator one is required to take the advice in question whether it pertains to a POV issue or a procedural one? Procedure requires two editors make a good faith attempt at resolving the issue on the users talk page. If I posted the RfC by myself, I'd understand why disregarding the procedure would get it removed. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> obviously felt that Smeelgova's attempts to address <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> were not in good faith. I believe <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> said something like Smeelgova's attempts were nothing more than scolding and dropping warning tags. I have noticed most editors give feedback that way, the subject of the RfC <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> appears to give feedback in this way. I have difficulty understanding why Smeelgova's behavior is considered an example of bad faith when it is so common. (Seriously, the first time I tried to create a username here I got an inappropriate warning and block without the admin telling me what aspect of the proposed username was inappropriate. Another time <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> accused me of violating <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASSING_427e.html" title="WP:CANVASSING">WP:CANVASSING</a> by only referencing the tag. I've even caught myself doing it, despite my efforts not to.)</p>
<p>Even if I assume that I erred by submitting the RfC, the way it was removed seems unusual. Why would <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> ask a non-involved editor to delete the RfC on this noticeboard, and then delete it herself when none would? If she had just deleted it, I guess it'd be easier to understand. By asking someone else to do it it seemed like she wanted to avoid a COI. Respectfully, <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> I do have a firm "grip". As I understand it, places like this are the exact place to address concerns about personalities, whereas on the article pages it might be inappropriate. Am I mistaken on that too? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a></p>

<li>I expressed concern to <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> that he may not be looking at the issue with a neutral POV.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> was unwilling to discuss the possibility, and became a bit hostile.</li>
<li>Smeelgova attempted to explain to <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> that his response was inappropriate, as well as his hostile attitude, see <a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody" title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User talk:Justanother/Archive4#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody</a>,<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#.2FPersonal_attacks_in_edit_summaries" title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User talk:Justanother/Archive4#/Personal attacks in edit summaries</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#Be_nice." title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#Be_nice.</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> ignored our attempts (mine to address the possibility of a biased POV and Smeelgova's attempt to get <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> to temper his attitude in responding (how can anyone resolve a conflict with someone who becomes hostile and is unwilling to discuss issues another editor raises?

<li><a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> didn't think there was enough of an attempt made by two users (by suggesting that Smeelgova's attempts were insufficient or inappropriate) to set up a RfC... the rest I think everyone knows.</li>

<dd>I honestly think that these discussions are "dispute resolution", (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody" title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User talk:Justanother/Archive4#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody</a>,<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#.2FPersonal_attacks_in_edit_summaries" title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#/Personal attacks in edit summaries</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_Archive4_9dd7.html#Be_nice." title="User talk:Justanother/Archive4">User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#Be_nice.</a>) since <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> deemed it to not be "dispute resolution" it seemed like she was saying Smeelgova was acting in "bad faith" based on her description of Smeelgova's efforts. (If Smeelgova wasn't trying to resolve anything by addressing <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother's</a> behavior, wouldn't that be acting in bad faith?)</dd>
<dd>I understand that <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> and some others may see it as a poorly executed attempt at dispute resolution, but it's important to note that the requirements do not say "Two WELL EXECUTED attempts at dispute resolution", merely that two attempts must be made.</dd>
<dd>I'd honestly like to know how to deal with an editor who not only spends a majority of his time editing articles related to his religion but trying to remove information which could any way be interpreted as negative to said religion, even though it may be appropriate. Further, the editor refuses to discuss concerns of a possible conflict in his goals and those of Wikipedia. (I'm not interested in editing Scientology articles on a regular basis, and personally don't care about the CoS any more than I do other religions, if anyone thinks I have a COI I'm happy t discuss it. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> will not even discuss his negative attitude let alone a possible COI).

<p>Looks like <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">user:Israelbeach</a> aka Joel Leyden is enlisting sockpuppets and or meatpuppets again to protect his favored articles from deletion. See also his own website: [www.israelnewsagency.com/kinnernetinternetwikipediabarhillelwoolwalescensorship47030807.html], [www.israelnewsagency.com/internetkinnernetyossivardiisraelhitechconference4888030707.html], [www.israelnewsagency.com/kinnernetinternetisraelconferencevarditechvardi4877030607.html] (complete with gratuitous mentions of Brittney Spears and Madonna.) I don't think there's any point in conducting checkusers, as he obviously has access to several IPs, and I think he sometimes enlists friends to post on his behalf. But the behaviour is classic sock/meatpuppetry, as evidenced in the contributions. And it's a pattern that repeats over and over. I've taken a lot of personal heat just for standing up to this user, so I'd appreciate another, possibly more impartial administrator getting involved, or at least expressing an opinion here. He's already under a community ban - is there any reason not to go ahead and block all the suspected sockpuppets?

<p>Virgil Vaduza aka (I suspect) Frank Thomas is behaving in a bizzare and frightening fashion in the Brian McLaren article.</p>
<p>1) Virgil will not allow me (Will3935) to contribute any edits of substance (only punctuation corrections). The contributions I have offered have been well supported by citations, yet they are promptly reverted in every case.</p>
<p>2)Virgil has been escalating hostilities while I have been trying to salvage a working relationship and make friends (user pages and discussion page will confirm this). His tone is exceedingly harsh and belittling, and he cannot be pacified. His many comments in the discussion page and the userpages have all contained personal attacks which are only getting worse.</p>
<p>3)After intense dialog with Virgil Vaduza along with mild intervention from Vassanya (admin), Virgil temporarily left the scene in favor of "Frank Thomas" an editor with no userpage who had not, to my knowledge, contributed to the article before this. Frank only had made a few previous edits in his Wikipedia career (most in subjects Virgil is interested in). Frank exhibited the same level of hostility and acrimony that Virgil had and echoed Virgil's arguments verbatim. Now Virgil has reappeared and the two act in perfect tandem, offering insults and attacks within minutes of each other. The intense level and frequncy of the attacks by far surpasses anything I have seen in my over 1200 edits in Wikipedia. Frank and Virgil's attacks seem to be clones of each other in tone, content, and severity. They have come in machine gun rapidity and in tandem. I believe my sockpuppetry suspicion is not unwarranted.</p>
<p>4)Virgil / Frank has repeatedly tried to bait me into revealing my true identity. I find this, along with the tone in which it is done, to be quite frightening. It seems to me that Virgil / Frank wants to take this conflict outside of Wikipedia. I have a personal life and a family to protect.</p>
<p>5)Though I did try to mix it up with Virgil at first, I have sinced repented and apologized. I have made many, many friendly overtures (the edit history on the discussion page and our userpages will show this to be quite true). Nevertheless, Virgil / Frank keeps escalating things to bizarre and frightening extremes.</p>
<p>6)Previous editors have apparently been scared away by Virgil's strong-handed tactics.</p>
<p>7)We desparately need intervention in the Brian McLaren article and any help will be appreciated.</p>

<dd>I would like to ask a related question: Is there a maximum size for nomination text in an AfD? This issue may not have ever come up before but it seems to me that there may be concerns about a nominator starting an AfD with an entire screen's worth of text, in no less than four separate sections, and accusing of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&amp;diff=114458968&amp;oldid=114458240" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&amp;diff=114458968&amp;oldid=114458240" rel="nofollow">rude and inappropriate action</a>" anyone who tries to respond to <i>one</i> of those sections before the nominator has said everything he wants to say in <i>all</i> his sections.

<li>Just for chuckles, we should keep in mind that, when writing an academic paper or business presentation, the rule is 250 words is a page. Therefore, the nomination was 20 pages. It's probably best, if you're going past a "page," to put your arguments on a page in your user space and then say, "See <i>pagename</i> for arguments." Otherwise, the long slog that is AfD becomes endless. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There seems to be some confusion on that. I have been told in the past that RFCU is not the appropriate place to start, but rather where to go when the case is unclear, in relation to another existing case brought before the administrators. Also, it has been made clear to me that RFCU only verifies <i>sockpuppets</i>, but that <i>meatpuppets</i> are an equal violation which usually cannot be verified by RFCU. The RFCU page itself states: <i>Checkuser is a last resort for difficult cases.</i> So it seemed appropriate to raise the issue elsewhere first, particularly given the apparently obvious nature of this case. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 07:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just some thoughts from someone who has dealt with (way too many) sockpuppet cases. First of all, Vassyana, you are correct about CU. They want you to explore other avenues first. In fact, they will reject cases based on it being obvious that someone is a sockpuppet. They will just say "too obvious. Block" or something to that effect. Secondly, it does look like a pretty strong possibility that this is a sock/meatpuppet. What stands out to me is the gap between edits and the single minded nature of Frank Thomas. Yes, there are users who edit one article much more than others, but it's usually not that exclusive. And it's quite odd for someone to come back after 2 months and hit an article that hard. On the other hand, I do see that Frank and Virgil are editing around the same time. I.e. you do not have Frank editing from say 7 pm to 9 pm and then Virgil taking over. There is some overlap. This suggests a meatpuppet, though I've seen cases (User:HeadleyDown being a prominent example) of people switching off between sockpuppets in a debate. But it's more likely to be a friend of Virgil. I am going to go ahead and block Frank's account indefinitely. It looks pretty clear cut to me. I'll also label his account as a sockpuppet of Virgil. It is obviously a meatpuppet or sockpuppet. As for Virgil, I think for now I'm going to warn him about sock/meatpuppet use. I don't see any warnings for sockpuppet use on his page. It's always best to warn first. If he uses another sockpuppet, let the board or me personally know and we'll go from there. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 11:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As an objective (?) third-party, I do notice that the usage of the diacritic is not consistent within the article and should at very least be changed to be internally consistent and consistent with the page title. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 21:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that's a first obvious sign that something's wrong. The name had a diacritic throughout the article since its very creation. The title also had a diacritic until <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> decided to move it to a non-diacritic version two days ago (disrespecting a community probation).--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 21:21, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree that Gene violated his community probation here - it was a non-contested move per the MOS and therefore ok.

<li>Yeah, although that could be attributed more to the fact that a good number of people on the internet have no clue how to actually insert a diacritic.

<li>The issue has nothing to do with whether it's correct or not. The issue here is an administrator clearly using his powers to gain a leg up in an edit dispute. What's worse, it's actually worked: he's gotten off with a warning, and no one is reverting him in order to avoid wheel warring. As he clearly knew that what he did was wrong, I would say he should be told to move it back or face a 48 hour block. I've had enough of seeing administrators who know better manage to get the upper hand because no one is willing to castigate or undo their actions. If any uninvolved admin has guts to do what's right, please do ask him to move it back or block him if he won't. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 00:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Husond, you specifically claimed that your reversion of my move was not based on the merits of the case, but rather because, in your words "You [meaning Gene Nygaard] may not do so according to your community probation". Therefore, you were not making your move based on the merits of the case; something that was further evident from the fact that you already knew that the previous move had been objected to as being unreferenced, undiscussed, and controversial--yet you provided no discussion, no references, no nothing for making your move. Therefore, if the only thing you were objecting to was <b>me</b> making the move, which in fact you explicitly claimed to be the case, then you have <b>absolutely no cause whatsoever</b> to complain about any other editor looking at it and making that same move, whether it be Jonathunder or anyone else. You had certainly provided no reason not to do so, had you? 22:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings all, I want to file a counter complaint with the administration here against user <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill3935_b5c5.html" title="User:Will3935">User:Will3935</a>. I have been a Wikipedia contributor for years now and I have contributed quality content to many articles as my busy schedule permits. I have never met such a threatening and arrogant user as Will3935 until now. He has flaunted his "credentials" with his very first entry in order to override opposing POV and despite his non-admin status he has threatened me with "blocking" when I disagreed with him. When another user challenged his flaunting of credentials he became even more irate, suggesting that he is being "attacked" when one person simply asked to identify himself. He clearly has no authority to "block" users yet he is implying this to end-users and threatening them with those actions in order to get an upper-hand in pushing a certain POV. Whenever I pointed out his ad-hominem attacks and language he always reverts to his "diabetes" problem!</p>
<p>Only once he has made numerous and substantial changes to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_McLaren_73a0.html" title="Brian McLaren">Brian McLaren</a> did he seek to collaborate with other contributors. Once I disagreed again with his "shotgun" approach he became irate and brought in numerous personal attacks, of which I quote below, some of which are of extremely personal nature, such as my health.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Frankly, I'm a little concerned about your health" (what the hell do you know about my health?)</li>
<li>"makes me suspect you are a young man" (wikipedia is age-discriminating now?)</li>
<li>"It's either Virgil's way or he goes and complains to admins" (I have never complained until just now)</li>
<li>"it just shows how poorly read Virgil is" (pure ad-hominem attack)</li>
<li>"Your ignorance should not limit the scope of this article" (another ad-hominem attack)</li>
<li>"act more mature and quit picking fights" (implying another user is not mature)</li>
<li>"if you feel a tantrum coming on just try to act normal" (implying another user is not normal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly I only expect fairness from you folks so the entire history of his attacks and interaction is in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrian_McLaren_f24f.html" title="Talk:Brian McLaren">Talk:Brian_McLaren</a>. You can read for yourself how this user has inflamed the situation and how he is now manufacturing attacks against himself in order to promote whatever agenda he has.</p>
<p>I am using my real name here, unlike him I am not hiding behind an IP address or a wall of anonymity. I never broke any Wikipedia rules, and I am simply asking that someone would intervene and stop an out-of-control maniacal user who apparently thinks no rules apply to him because he claims to have "credentials" that exempt him from participating in the collaboration process.

<p>There's been quite a bit of talk at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2007_March_7_faf6.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 7">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 7</a> (see primarily Image:Ct4e.jpg section) and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyright_problems_c09f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems">Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems</a> (see New Zealand Crown Copyright section). I nominated a few New Zealand Crown Copyright images for deletion, as Crown Copyright has long been recognized as too restrictive, and no claim of fair use had been made. No fair use claim <i>could</i> be made, either, for a few of these images, as there are free alternatives already available on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Quite a few users, however, are arguing that we <i>overlook</i> the "ideological" restrictions, or that we start a new category of images with "[l]icenses that aren't free, but won't be subjected to either the fair use rationale test or the replaceability test." There's not really a grey area for this — either images are free, which we'll allow, or they aren't, for which we'll argue fair use (though there's not much of an argument for a lot of these images) or delete. Anyone with a bit more "credibility" than me have a better way of explaining this to them? Thanks. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 19:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a little confused by the form to submit sock puppets, but I suspect this is one case. In any case, the user is engaging an agressive behaviour towards other editors (and admins) based on the fact that his page was speedy deleted.</p>

<p>I am reporting <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> for his abuse, stalking, harassment and personal attacks on User:Icar and others. He has a pattern of disruptive behavior that appears to a reasonable and objective observer to have the purpose of causing negative emotions in the targeted person (User:Icar) and others for the purpose of intimidating him/them. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> has been a trouble maker for some time now pushing his POV on wikipedia (e.g. his last edits), numerous accounts of misbehavior, vandalism, trolling. It seems that there are a group of editors with the backing of a couple of administrators who are working together in regards to POV pushing using Wikipedia as their own POV propaganda tool. One of them is also <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a>. Some people say that Dahn is a reliable contributor, and I ask you “is this model of reliable contributor?” Some other say that he’s a regular edit warrior. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam_in_Romania&amp;diff=111733632&amp;oldid=111733285" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam_in_Romania&amp;diff=111733632&amp;oldid=111733285" rel="nofollow">here</a> and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=113854347&amp;oldid=113850197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=113854347&amp;oldid=113850197" rel="nofollow">[130]</a> are just 2 examples.

<dd>I can only hope that administrators will understand why deleting valid and sourced information is vandalism, and why tweaking a lead to make it look like a Romanian citizen was not a Romanian citizen is POV-pushing. I am not responsible for whomever else got blocked. I <i>strongly object</i> to the notion that I was engaged in harassment: I have significantly contributed to <i>all</i> those articles (some of them I have virtually authored), and it is I who is being followed around with POV-pushes. As for the reliable contributor issue, let others see what I have significantly contributed to, and how much reliable and sourced-based text I added to wikipedia. That is all I have to say. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 16:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a similar case as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandru_Nicolschi_da66.html" title="Alexandru Nicolschi">Alexandru Nicolschi</a> article where <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> wants to hide that that person had <b>dual</b> citizenship and had a clear foreign allegiance (that person declared himself which one was his true country, however that's not enough for Dahn to be worth mentioning). By pushing his POV he accuses other people of POV pushing, he constantly does that by nasty behavior, calling people vandals or not smart enough to understand his posts (by allusions and insinuations) and by basically bulling everybody into accepting his POV. He also doesn't wait for other opinions (on my repeated calls for that) which basically works against consensus building of Wikipedia. I was accused of many things by <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> only because I changed 2-3 minor things to make the 2 articles more accurate. If you want to witness his modus operandi take a look and his discussion with me on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexandru_Nicolschi_5b54.html#My_2_cents" title="Talk:Alexandru Nicolschi">Talk:Alexandru_Nicolschi#My_2_cents</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecuritate_9ce7.html#Rom.C3.A2nul_Boris_Gr.C3.BCnberg.3F" title="Talk:Securitate">Talk:Securitate#Rom.C3.A2nul_Boris_Gr.C3.BCnberg.3F</a> and see for yourselves how he bullies people around by accusing them of things they didn't say and assuming unintended meanings of words only to start wars. In one occasion he even drove me to be plain uncivil -- this is something that he does very well, he bullies people around till they snap... My guess is that's exactly what happened with User:Icar. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 17:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In case someone is interested in this, my comments have been given in full on the talk page, where I have presented basic and reliable proof of why the AdrianTM's edit is POV pushing.

<dd>Yes, but constantly having a nasty behavior, calling people vandals (by allusions and insinuations) it's really a bad thing! While it feels bad to be attacked by one of the persistent, nasty, obsessive trolls, it is helpful to remember that some of these people are profoundly miserable. They are really suffering; life is hell for them: often they are neither in control of their impulses, nor completely sane. A little compassion can help, although one's initial impulse is to strike back. Don't. It's a sign of strength not to retaliate, and a peaceful response may actually do some good. Try to be as tolerant as you possibly can regarding edits by established contributors. Should you need to revert one, leave as polite an explanation as possible, with room for compromise: and if they're simply wrong, don't rub their nose in it. The risk of losing long-established contributors due to avoidable conflict is one of the greatest the project faces. People who have been here a year or more, and made thousands of contributions to the project, are its greatest asset, and this cannot be overstated. The consequences of reverting a good-faith edit with a vandalism-reversion tool or "rvv" edit summary are unpredictable, and unlikely to win you friends or trust. As a general rule, do not edit when you are angry. Wait until the feeling has passed, and you are yourself again. This was my view. --<font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">HIZKIAH</font> <small>(<a href="../../../h/i/z/User%7EHIZKIAH_e5be.html" title="User:HIZKIAH">User</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../h/i/z/User_talk%7EHIZKIAH_d319.html" title="User talk:HIZKIAH">Talk</a>)</small> 17:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is simply ridiculous. I urge HIZKIAH to present <i>what point</i> of the harassment policy I have broken and <i>where</i>. As an addition: on most of the articles in question, I have contributed most information (all sourced), <i>before</i> other users came and deleted parts of them.

<dd>Sorry to see Nssdfdsfds getting in a tizzy and telling tales out of school here. It's perfectly true that after Pogsurf was blocked by Persian Poet Gal as a "Vandal Only Account" I created the "Lobster Bloster" account. However I object strongly to the label "Vandal Only Account" which I assume is being used perjoratively, and not as an obscure reference to my Germanic ancestry. If Nssdfdsfds bothered to discuss prospective changes via talk pages I don't think so much hot air and wind would be generated. Please feel free to ban me again if you feel that is the right thing to do. There are many more names and IP addresses I could adopt, should the need arise. --<a href="../../../l/o/b/User%7ELobster_blogster_39c3.html" title="User:Lobster blogster">Lobster blogster</a> 00:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm restoring this comment because it was for some reason deleted yesterday along with several others. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=114342757&amp;oldid=114341763" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=114342757&amp;oldid=114341763" rel="nofollow">[135]</a>.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appears to not have been warned up until the report was filed, and has not edited since being warned by two people.

<p>I just received a very troubling query on my talk page. I made a simple post here a few days ago, but it now appears in the diff as if multiple other posts were deleted when I made my post. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia#Blanking_comments_on_AN.2FI" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia#Blanking_comments_on_AN.2FI" rel="nofollow">[136]</a> I have sporadically seen something similar result from edit conflicts, but some of this text appears to be on AN/I before my post, and gone after my post. Since it's not a good feeling to be accused of blanking, I hope someone can help get to the bottom of this. Sorry if this is a dumb question with a simple explanation; it's troubling.
