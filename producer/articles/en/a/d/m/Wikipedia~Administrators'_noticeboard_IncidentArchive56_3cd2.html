<dd>First - it is untrue that Pigsonthewing was reverting "all" of Karmafist's edits. He was reverting edits about himself that he considered to be personal attacks. Some of them look to me like they qualify... which is a no-no given that Karmafist is under 'personal attack parole' at the moment.</dd>

<dd>They aren't. Reversions of personal attacks on talk pages are allowed... only the definition of 'personal attack' is open to interpretation. Following someone around and reverting their article submissions without discussion and regardless of merit on the other hand... that's called stalking and <a href="../../../h/a/_/WP%7EHA_a95d.html" title="WP:HA">WP:HA</a>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 22:37, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. Except those weren't personal attacks. —Locke Cole 22:42, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You are misreading what I wrote. The edits he reverted, he reverted all with the edit summary "rm abuse". As for reverting edits, the edits that led me to give him the block were the edits in the User talk namespace. No user has any business amending other users' comments, and the diff that did it for me was the one at <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a>'s talk page. By the way, that is exactly what made me block, seeing that another user complained about Pigsonthewing harassing him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karmafist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30262304" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karmafist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30262304" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">did you read this?</a>)</sup> 22:43, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> specifically says that you SHOULD 'amend other users' comments' to just remove the portion which is an attack. Again, what this comes down to is that you blocked Pigsonthewing because you did not agree with his assesment that Karmafist calling him 'troll', 'bully', et cetera were 'personal attacks'. If those were personal attacks he is allowed to remove them. If they weren't... well then he's blocked for a week. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 23:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read the top of <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>? Over-extending the applicability of <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> is one of the big complaints about Pigsonthewing. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:18, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't dispute that he uses it alot and takes a wide definition of 'personal attack' in doing so. However, I do not see how it is possible for Pigsonthewing's reversions of Karmafist calling him 'troll', 'bully', et cetera to be <b>so</b> pervasive as to rise to the level of "harassment" worthy of a week long ban... while <i>simultaneously</i> those original comments by Karmafist do <b>not</b> rise to the level of harassment <i>against</i> Pigsonthewing. If the one is harassment then so is the other... especially when you toss in Karmafist going about reverting Pigsonthewing's perfectly valid article edits. This all started between them when Karmafist put a 24 hour block on Pigsonthewing after <b>falsely</b> accusing him of violating 3RR... but <b>not</b> blocking G-man (an admin) who <b>had</b> reverted out the same text four times in a day. In my opinion admins should be held to a <b>higher</b> standard than regular editors. The guidelines don't read that way... so be it. However, the guidelines certainly don't say that admins should be held to a <b>lower</b> standard, but that has seemed to be the practice in this case. I don't disagree that alot of the things Pigsonthewing does are borderline abusive. I'm saying that he probably wouldn't be doing them if blatant ongoing abuse <b>against</b> him weren't ignored (and thereby encouraged) as a matter of course. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 00:14, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with much of what you say, especially about admins being held to a high standard. However, the overall problem started because Pigsonthewing is unfailingly curt and impolite to anyone who edits in a way he dislikes or tries to offer him suggestions on how to work with other editors. I think a week-long block is excessive, and I would strongly support removing it if he showed any humility whatsoever or aknowledged the legitimate issues against him. Until he does that, I don't know what can be done about any of these problems. That being said, Karmafist should stay as far away from him as possible. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:30, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In my own experience this ("unfailingly") isn't accurate. I contested his edits and we worked out a compromise. I called him a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=28393543&amp;oldid=28374232" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=28393543&amp;oldid=28374232" rel="nofollow">"pain in the ass"</a> (amongst other, nicer, things) and he said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACBDunkerson&amp;diff=28392581&amp;oldid=28297259" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACBDunkerson&amp;diff=28392581&amp;oldid=28297259" rel="nofollow">thank you</a>. That's humility enough for me. He gets 'difficult' when people are rude <b>to</b> him. That's not a good thing, but it's understandable. Nobody should have to put up with someone reverting their edits as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Phoenix_Park&amp;curid=765366&amp;diff=30274232&amp;oldid=30244095" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Phoenix_Park&amp;curid=765366&amp;diff=30274232&amp;oldid=30244095" rel="nofollow">"better safe than sorry"</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Demiurge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30273659" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Demiurge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30273659" rel="nofollow">"gut reaction"</a>... nor be blocked for getting upset and objecting to that and similar treatment. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 02:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having read all of the above, I still find a seven-day block completely unjustifiable and, in the circumstances of an ongoing arbitration case in which Pigsonthewing should be encouraged to participate, counter-productive. I am replacing this with a two-day block, reduced in duration to run from the time of the original seven day block. This is justifiable under the personal attack injunction, since in my opinion the interference with Karmafist's edits constitutes a personal attack.</p>
<p>After the expiry of the two-day block, all administrators are encouraged to monitor Pigsonthewing's conduct and ensure that he does not resume this problematic conduct.</p>

<dd>I don't object to the reduction of the block. I was going to block for 72 hours originally, but after seeing he was a repeat offender, I decided to increase the length of the block. That said, Pigsonthewing has been asked <i>repeatedly</i> to answer his RFC (and then his RFAr), which he continues to refuse to do. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">did you read this?</a>)</sup> 05:05, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To illustrate my concerns, Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing) had already been blocked for thirty-six hours recently. Adding another week-long block to that would leave him very little opportunity to change his mind and contribute evidence in the case and participate in the workshop. This isn't to say that we should let him run loose, but I think shorter blocks (*much* shorter blocks, if timed correctly) are likely to be just as effective.</p>

<dd>I disagree, the state that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Tolkien_0bea.html" title="Tim Tolkien">Tim Tolkien</a> was in when he nominated it for AfD would have lead me to nominate it as well. It was only after it was nominated that he began adding content that indicated the notability of the subject. In so far as Karmafist exacerbating things; I don't believe what he posted constitutes a personal attack. If we can't even define what someones behavior seems to be, how on Earth are we supposed to suggest they be brought up for RFAr or RfC? Next thing you know we'll have people deleting comments such as "So and so is misbehaving, you should do something".. oh right, that's precisely what he did. —Locke Cole 07:29, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>If we can't even define what someones behavior seems to be</i> is not the point. Karmafist has been enjoined to back off and not interact with POTW, but is still picking at it. Posting <i>ad hominem</i> comments encouraging other editors to discount POTW's edits and treat them as troublemaking looks to me well into the territory of personal atack, especially when unjustified. For instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phoenix_Park&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phoenix_Park&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Phoenix Park edit history</a> shows POTW and Demiurge supporting a long-standing consensus against an anonymous reverter. There <i>was</i> no trouble until Karmafist waded in and automatically reverted to the nonconsensus version simply because POTW supported it (<i>so I decided to go see what he was up to and went with a "better safe than sorry" approach when I saw reverts by him</i>). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 08:36, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, this has got so convoluted that I'm mistaken on that point. On rereading, I see the injunction is against Karmafist making personal attacks; the no-interaction-whatsoever is at the proposal stage. It's not bad advice, though. Do you really think the Phoenix Park edits help the situation? Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sutton_Park&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sutton_Park&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">these edits</a> to <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutton_Park_12d6.html" title="Sutton Park">Sutton Park</a>, which look equally bad faith?</dd>

<dd>Your analogy is inaccurate anyway. This is equivalent to that same police officer, after having caught you speeding, turning up and saying "this guy was caught speeding, you know" to suggest you're untrustworthy in all sorts of situations where that's irrelevant.</dd>

<dd>I'm not the only one to view Karmafist's edits as personal attacks (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30312835&amp;oldid=30275414" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarmafist&amp;diff=30312835&amp;oldid=30275414" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 09:43, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To clarify, a statement can be a personal attack even if it's true. Describing someone's interactions on Wikipedia as "bullying" and "trolling" is a personal attack, even if the person involved is a bully and a troll. We do things differently on Wikipedia. If we have a difference with someone, we seek ways of resolving it, not ways of marginalizing that person. Karmafist is under an injunction because he had earlier described Pigsonthewing as "the scum of Wikipedia" and made repeated pig-related swipes at him. Now he's stopped calling Pigsonthewing a pig, but he hasn't stopped attacking him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:43, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just telling Pigsonthewing the same thing about using terms like 'lies' and 'liar'. Whether something is true or not is irrelevant to whether it is an attack or not. Further, estimations of 'truth' are often subjective. I don't think 'troll' or 'bully' are accurate descriptions of Pigsonthewing because both terms imply <b>intent</b> (to provoke hostility / harass for amusement) which I have seen no evidence of. In any case, they are clearly 'attacks'... that is, statements made to portray the person negatively. Though again, estimations of 'severity' of personal attacks are highly subjective. Which, in my opinion, is a significant problem... subjective definitions of what is and is not a 'personal attack' and 'harassment' inherently leads to unequal application of blocks for such. Which inevitably breeds resentment. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 13:12, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to take a moment to point out to all that RPA is <i>not</i> policy, and it <i>is</i> disputed, and there is <i>not</i> consensus for the removal of personal attack comments. Some people seem to feel that it's policy and their duty to remove personal attacks from others, this is not so. Personally, I think editing other user's comments is generally a bad thing...if an attack is made, refute the attack, but keep in mind that anyone who chooses to engage in such behavior risks a loss of reputation and risks incurring consequences (I for one won't hesistate to place a block on a user engaging in repeated personal attacks). As far as this case goes, if there is a personal attack on either Pigsonthewings or Karmafist's part, an immediate block is warranted. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 02:50, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed ... mostly. Personal attacks are unacceptable. But it's also no good to alter other people's signed comments; that's forgery ... and frequently, it's also a form of bullying or personal attack in itself. It's particularly egregious when it's done in response to allegations of wrongdoing. "You accused me of doing something wrong. I take that as a personal attack, and so I shall now strike out your words. Your accusation is now besmirched, without my bothering to respond to its substance." That sort of malicious application of RPA cropped up on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Duncharris_2a95.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Duncharris">WP:RFC/Duncharris</a> in the beginning of the recent administrative malfeasance unpleasantness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, it should be perfectly acceptable to remove or revert <i>whole posts</i> (not just individual words) that are composed of pure abuse. This is simply a corollary of the vandalism policy. Removing a whole post avoids the alteration or besmirching of another person's words, and is less likely to be done in any case where the words have <i>any</i> value at all. There is no value to retaining a talk comment that is solely composed of the words "fuck you" repeated a hundred times, or racial slurs, or other patent nonsense. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 08:29, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, Karmafist 1) probably needs to take a break for a few hours, 2) shouldn't unblock himself, no matter how wrong the block is, as mentioned on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Ipblocklist&amp;action=unblock" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Ipblocklist&amp;action=unblock" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Ipblocklist&amp;action=unblock</a> --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">mmmmm chocolate!</a>)</sup> 15:23, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I understand why the "don't unblock yourself" convention exists. But, I have a hard time bringing myself to disagree with someone unblocking themselves when no plausible reason for the block has been given. Situations like this frequently escalate unneccessarily, because then someone else can come along and say "unblocking yourself?!? that's not right, I'm going to re-block". To me this situation should have been handled with a note on the talk page, not a block. Also, maybe it's just me, but I don't like to see on-wiki consequences for off-wiki actions. If a solid reason for a block cannot be found <i>on the wiki</i>, the block should not happen. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The other half of this dispute (Pigsonthewing) was recently blocked for a <b>week</b> for 'offenses' seemingly no more serious than this one. I suspect Evilphoenix imposed this block because of an ongoing pattern of harassment of which the linked edit was only the most recent example. Several others can be found in the paragraphs preceding this one. At that, we are presently a few hours away from an arbitration going into effect (24 hours after motion to close) which will bar Karmafist from interacting with Pigsonthewing <i>in any way</i>. So it's not like this is 'out of the blue' with no justification. I don't want to see Karmafist quit over this either, but frankly I feel that the fact that he HASN'T been blocked <i>before this</i> demonstrates a ludicrous imbalance in the standards imposed on admins vs those on regular editors. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">✉</a> 15:41, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'd just like to step in here and make a comment to try and clarify, as several editors have questioned why I imposed a block for a seemingly trivial offense. I agree that the diff in question was a borderline case, but as I explained to Karmafist on his Talk page (where there has also been some discussion), at this point, he does not need to have even the <i>slightest</i> appearance of goading Pigsonthewing, with whom he has been involved in a running conflict going back several months, and an active case before the Arbitration Committee. Both users have personal attack injunctions opposed against them currently, and the situation between the two of them is <i>extremely</i> tense. In an isolated incident, such a comment from another User <i>would</i> only require a Talk page warning, however given the background of the situation between these two editors, I found Karmafist's action to be provocative and unneccessary. Pigsonthewing is under very heavy scrutiny right now, I had recently blocked him for disruption, and he was (and still is, I believe) serving another block from another Admin for personal attacks. It's important for Andy to understant that poor behavior on his part will not be tolerated, but its also important for him (and the rest of us as well) to understand that poor behaviour should not be tolerated from other editors either, particularly other Administrators. I think Andy feels that he's being punished for offenses he has commited, but that other users who have commited offenses are not. Whether this is true or not, we do need to attempt to be fair, and we do need to work to hold ourselves and our fellow Administrators to a higher standard. <i>Nobody</i> is above civility, not I or anyone else, from our plethora of anonymous contributors all the way up to the Arbitrators and Jimbo himself . This is not to say that I am defending my action as Absolutely Correct, I am simply trying to help other editors understand why I made that decision. I posted about the block here specifically to encourage public review and discussion, to allow other Administrators to review the block and choose to allow it to stand or to adjust the time, if any felt that was needed, and to be available for discussion. In general, my feeling is that any block is subject to review and adjustment by any other Administrator, and that if another Administrator adjusts a block that I place, it would be discourteous of me to further adjust the block myself. I am dissapointed that Karmafist has repeatedly chosen to unblock himself...he had to my previous knowledge followed a polite approach, had attempted to engage me in discussion of the block, which we did discuss, and I was unwilling to adjust the block, and I know he discussed it on IRC, but my feeling is that he should have approached another Administrator to review the block, rather than unblock himself. It it my hope however that he will move forward from this, and choose to remain civil and polite in his future actions. Please let me know if there is any more clarification I can provide, and I thank you all for your input in this discussion.

<p>Sorry about that. Just looking over the contribs of that ip and the discussion page, it didn't seem like there was much reason to be blocked for 24 hours. I changed the block to 3 hours, but please feel free to revert it, now that I've seen the discussion. This is my first time I've done any real blocking, so I'm sorry if I'm not quite familiar with the intricacies of policy, but worry not; I've been reading up.

<dd>Curps, you're wrong. Chooserr was not posting block messages. Chooserr was warning people that their names were inappropriate and liable for blocking. Whether Chooserr had the authority to block or had to ask an admin for help cleaning up inappropriate usernames is not relevant. Chooserr had every right to post those warnings. Your actions regarding Chooserr are documented and by now quite well annotated with the facts:

<dd>Well, his abuse of the editing capability by inserting his own definition of "vandalism" into his edits certainly didn't help things much. Then of course there was that bullshit with the sockpuppet template. But really, one thing that really bugs me is that URL he keeps linking to that is a web page which HE created. It's a bullshit FAQ, almost all of the information being false, a bullshit FAQ created out of his warped, sick, twisted sociopathic mind. Through Wikipedia definition, it is more than capable of being called a "hate site" (which it of course is) and thus it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. Never mind the fact that this sicko is trying to use it to justify his behavior towards me. Dude, don't believe Chadbryant and try to leave my side of the story out of it. This goes a lot further than you know, and part of it is that Chad Bryant is a manipulative, scheming, sociopath who will do whatever is necessary to further his point -- even if it means lying or manipulating the truth.

<dd>No, Kelly, I am not behind the vandalism of Seigenthaler's article. I've never even HEARD of that article. At any rate, I am also not an "unrepentant troll" -- I have made it more than clear that I am stopping the creation of sockpuppets (well, except for this one, at least) and that a large part of the problem is that arbitration -- or otherwise -- cannot continue so long as I am one of the other parties involved and you guys keep blocking accounts. I have spoken with <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> about this situation, and he has agreed to leave one account open for matters of discussion; however, that account has also been blocked and as far as I am aware, it remains so as of this posting. The other issue is <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbyrant</a> -- you attack my clones, yet you allow him to run unchecked. Take a peek at his Contributions list and tell me exactly how all of his reverts due to "vandalism" are warranted?

<dd>Just a note (I fully support the four-day block): I think <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> probably should remain BC, not BCE. It's hard to tell, but I've done some digging in the history. Before November 27, there was no ancient history information, but there were a few instances of BC, and none of BCE. During a very busy November 27th, ancient history went in, which at various points used BC, BCE, or both. Probably should have all been BC to begin with, based on the pre-November 27th page. Of course, I could have easily missed some earlier back-and-forthing. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 22:13, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Distiguishing "good-faith" changes from bad is impossible (heck, even Jguk is doing it, AFAICT, in "good faith": he either thinks it makes a better encyclopedia or that it pleases his God) and every change of styles is an open invitation to start edit-warring. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 23:23, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's little doubt that this is a vandal sock. There are more reasons that just the name, but I'd rather not give any details.

Most of these articles had been created or updated from User:216.20.1.214 or other IP addresses in that range, typically plagarizing whiteywatch.com and whiteyworld.com directly or very very closely. Several mug shots also appear to have been added from these sites. Myself and a few other users checked each of these articles against the sites, and for each one clearly plagarized, either removed, rewrote, or reverted to previous non-plagarized versions. The user has continued to blank many of these pages as before and with other statements such as "copywrite[sic] violation, this is a federal crime" or with {{copyvio}} tags. Most of the articles being blanked are on the grounds that the images contained therin are copyrighted(see summary of this issue below), although some appear to be for article content. The user was <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.147.103.146.html" title="User talk:24.147.103.146">warned</a> repeatedly not to blank articles and advised of the proper channels for copyright problems.

<p>I'm writing this here, because it involves three different problems: Copyright violations, blanking vandalism and pov.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copyright violations: <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_Scholar_1652.html" title="User:Street Scholar">Street Scholar</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStreet_Scholar_5141.html" title="User talk:Street Scholar">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Street_Scholar_c715.html" title="Special:Contributions/Street Scholar">contribs</a>) has many times inserted copyright violations in two articles (<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Qasim_417d.html" title="Muhammad bin Qasim">Muhammad bin Qasim</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia_4dab.html" title="Islamic conquest of South Asia">Islamic conquest of South Asia</a>. Even after I wrote about these copyvios on the talk page, he keeps inserting the copyvios. The copyvios are from <a href="http://www.pakwatan.com/main/edu/qasim_detail.php3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pakwatan.com/main/edu/qasim_detail.php3" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/arab2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/arab2.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> and other places. He started inserting copyvios already in October.</li>
<li>Blanking and Deletion: He has many times blanked entire sections of articles (in Islamic conquest of South Asia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28537903" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28537903" rel="nofollow">many similar cases</a>) and <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconoclasm.html" title="Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iconoclasm&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28322229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iconoclasm&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28322229" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>)) and deleted the entire Muhammad bin Qasim article to replace it with copyvios (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_bin_Qasim&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=30330790" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_bin_Qasim&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=30330790" rel="nofollow">many similar cases</a>).</li>
<li>POV: His copyvio material is also pov, inaccurate and without proper sources. He blatantly copies material from biased/revisionist websites, and when asked for sources, he "steals" a bibliography from a geocities webpage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have warned Street Scholar already several times and have also written about the copyvios, but he keeps ignoring this and one editor <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">Anonymous editor</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymous_editor_cbfd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymous editor">contribs</a>) even defends him.

<dd>I did not defend him at all. I asked you not you use vandal tags against him when he wasn't vandalizing articles. That is abuse of the vandal warnings. And you seem very hostile against editors for some reason. Can you not discuss this with him peacefully. If he is copyviolating articles then warn him for that. And your case was no different; I would have warned anyone abusing the vandal tags and making threats against an editor that he/she would be blocked because they were editing a certain article. Here is the discussion <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStreet_Scholar_5141.html#Vandalism" title="User talk:Street Scholar">User_talk:Street_Scholar#Vandalism</a>. I hate copyvio but I also hate abusing tags. What you need to do is discuss more with the user and not try to bring me in to your problems. Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:43, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"I did not defend him at all. I asked you not you use vandal tags against him when he wasn't vandalizing articles. ... do not try to bring me in to your problems."</dd>
<dd>You wrote about his repeated blanking vandalism on Street Scholars talk page: <i>"None of that is vandalism, ..Please stop abusing the vandalism warnings,.. Also he can't be blocked for this."</i> I didn't say you were defending his copyvios, but it looks like you defended his edits, including his blankings and pov-warring. Repeated blanking of entire article sections and repeated deletions of entire articles without proper explanations are vandalism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And about one user reverting Street Scholar's copyvios, blanking vandalism and pov you wrote: <i>"Someone (user:Karl Meier) has reverted your edits without explanation in the article Islamic conquest of South Asia."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Street_Scholar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Street_Scholar" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></dd>
<dd>The tag I used on Street Scholar was I wrote was: <i>Please stop removing content from Wikipedia. It is considered vandalism. If you want to experiment, please use the sandbox. Thank you.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The text clearly says that this tag is for blanking vandalism ("removing content"), which Street Scholar repeatedely did. By the way, I learned about the use of the "test" tags by having once seen them in your edits. You gave several times test2 instead of test1 warnings to first-time "vandals" like for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:131.91.114.12&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24837203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:131.91.114.12&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24837203" rel="nofollow">to this user</a>, so you're the wrong person to blame me for copying bad examples of the use of these tags.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This looks like you supported Street Scholar and his edits including his pov-warring and blanking vandalism and I have written about this also here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia#I_agree_with_Salma" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia#I_agree_with_Salma" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></dd>

<p><b>I don't see why you are going all over the place making articles about me? you clearly have a obsessive fixation with me. Infinite foundation is owned by a Hindutva terrorist, and you're getting your information from his website? There was no massacre of Hindus, this is a lie made up by Hindutva members to get support for there racist ideology. Theses are the same people who destroyed a mosque because their mythological god was born there. They base almost everything on <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myths.html" title="Myths">myths</a> even the whole religion on Hinduism is based on a myth, why don't you bring clear dates to the letter Mohamed Bin Qasim allegedly sent? how about you post the full letter?</b></p>
<p>Bin Qasim was no all that bad, it was the oppressive, Hindu kings, hence why the <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatt.html" title="Jatt">jatt</a> joined forces with him, and if he really was going around killing Hindus, why the hell would Hindus join forces with him? if he really was massacring Hindus?</p>
<p>Its pretty obvious, you're putting legends as facts into the article. Hindus of the time loved Mohamed Bin Qasim, because of he came and saw everyone as equal as opposed to the racist caste system which the Hindu kings used to rule with. And its funny that, even in the SEI article there is no mentioned of the Aryan Invasion of the subcontinent and it only elaborately mentions the Muslim conquests.</p>

<dd>I don't know why you are always ranting about infinity foundation. I never said anything about this site and by the way, why is <a href="http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> run by a "Hindutva terrorist?!? The date of the letter is given in the Qasim article (A.H. 73), and the full text of this letter as it is in the Chach-Nama is also given in the article. Street Schlolar, if you claim that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chach-Nama_163e.html" title="The Chach-Nama">The Chach-Nama</a> (an imporant primary source for Qasim) doesn't exist, you could as well edit the Jesus article and when asked about sources claim that the Bible (also a primary source about Jesus) doesn't exist.

Give me a brake dude, Infinity foundation is run by a Hindu Extremist, this is like writing an article about the holocaust and then getting your information from Nazi sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chach-Nama_163e.html" title="The Chach-Nama">The Chach-Nama</a> has all sorts of information in it, not just about Bin Qasim, I mean if you're going to lie then at least make an effort. Its mainly about how the administrative structure was set-up, there is no record of the letter sent by Bin Qasim, and he did not kill any Hindus. Actually he treated Hindus really well, even better then how there own kings treated them, because at the times the Hindu kings were using a racist <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste_system.html" title="Caste system">caste system</a> to rule, the lower-caste Hindus had enough of this, its the sole reason why many converted to Islam, because Islam gave them equality something Hinduism didn't. I'm not denying Hindus didn't get killed by Muslim conquers if you look at unbiased sources Bin Qasim, never killed Hindus.Even The ones who didn't convert to Islam were equal to Jews and Jews were not getting killed under Muslim rule at the time. Try to get your facts right. You can't base the whole article on one source when there are many sources.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_Scholar_1652.html" title="User:Street Scholar">Street Scholar</a> 20:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

The Chach-Nama mentions the letter and I have verified it myself. Here is a reference: Sir Henry Miers Elliot and John Dowson: The History of India as told by its own Historians. Vol. I. First Published 1867-77. p. 173.</dd>
<dd>Qasim, who committed many massacres, didn't kill any Hindus?!? You have elsewhere also supported <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> and his idea of putting the Jews back to Europe because they're stealing land so your comments doesn't surprise me. Even your newest comment about the Jews that you made above is wrong. I'm not basing the article on anything, because almost the only thing I did in the article was reverting your vandalism. The Chach-Nama is the most important primary source on Qasim, and a few days ago you even denied that the book existed. <a href="../../../k/e/f/User%7EKefalonia_ff8a.html" title="User:Kefalonia">Kefalonia</a> 18:24, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Verify what? I can to make a website and claim it to be factual information, anyone can make a website. There are no other sources to this letter. <i>"Sir Henry Miers Elliot and John Dowson"</i> there work has since been corrupted and edited mainly by Hindus, they have absolutely no credibility. Wow, you liar I never made any such comment about the Jews. I demand you to bring proof, that I made this comment on Wikipedia. Any my new comment about the Jews is wrong? hay why don't you go an read unbiased history, Jews under Muslim rule have been treated well compared to how they were treated under Christian rule at the time.

<p>As a result of the arbitration case, Andy Mabbett (<a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">User:Pigsonthewing</a>) was subject to the following limitations:</p>

<li>Probation: "He may be banned for good cause by any administrator from any page or talk page which he disrupts."</li>
<li>"limited to one revert per article per week, excluding simple vandalism, for a period of one year. Determination of when this has been violated may be done by any uninvolved administrator."</li>

<p>Enforcement is "blocked for a short period, up to a week in the case of repeat offenses, should he edit any page from which he has been banned or excessively revert any page. After 5 blocks the maximum block shall increase to one year."</p>
<p>His response to this was: ":I shall treat that with the utter contempt that it deserves." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31035832" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31035832" rel="nofollow">[44]</a></p>

<p>Looking at the history of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>, it seems that this is a continuation of a long-running edit war which he instigated.</p>
<p>He had also previously removed the picture from <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longbridge.html" title="Longbridge">Longbridge</a> in October, and it was recently restored by Leonig Mig, who did not engage in the subsequent edit war.</p>
<p>I propose to ban him from these two articles beginning 0001 UTC tomorrow morning, 13 December, 2005, for a period of one calendar month, to terminate 0001 UTC 13 January, 2005. Comments? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:03, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comments? I don't think it matters any more. If Leonig Mig, the latest Scottfisher sockpuppet, Nick Boulevard, Locke Cole, et cetera are allowed to continue reverting every article edit he makes, and Pigsonthewing cannot respond, then the ArbCom's ruling effectively translates to an indefinite ban. Why bother officially banning him from editing articles that he can't edit anyway? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He can respond: on the talk page, or utilizing other dispute resolution tools (mediation, 3rd opinion, RfC, or even an RFAr if it comes to it). The whole point of his 1/7RR and probation are, I imagine, to coerce him into discussing changes in a more meaningful manner than he has in the past. It's his choice to ignore those other avenues and revert war. —Locke Cole 13:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder, since I do unfortunately expect that Andy will probably go to other articles where he has had arguments in the past, and try to revive those, would it be better to adopt a policy of adding those articles to this ban if he keeps it up, and resetting the timer, rather than end up having several concurrent bans running and nobody able to work out when any of them is to terminate? Sorry to sound so negative, but Andy's current attitude seems to be "screw it, I'll ignore the probation." It may take a while to make him see sense. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if the ArbCom ruling allows for this or not, but I agree it may make things simpler if he gets himself banned from other articles. You might want to leave a note on some of the ArbCom members' talk pages to see if this would be OK. —Locke Cole 13:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As an editor who has had disputes with Andy on both Jeremy Clarkson and other articles I would oppose a ban on him editing Jeremy Clarkson. His behaviour could have been far worse, and actually he has been very restrained given his opposition to a major edit on the article which he did not revert, but instead expressed his opposition with a POV tag. Especially given the arbcom ruling (thanks for putting it here, I didn't know) I think under the arbcomm conditions he should be allowed to continue editing the Clarkson article, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:16, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>expressed his opposition with a POV tag.</i>: That's very disingenious, as is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jeremy_Clarkson&amp;diff=30605239&amp;oldid=30604657" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jeremy_Clarkson&amp;diff=30605239&amp;oldid=30604657" rel="nofollow">made clear here</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 19:24, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's clear that Andy could be a valuable contributor to any article; he's just been choosing not to. A funny aspect of his probation is that, given the "5 strikes and you're banned for a year" clause, it would actually in his best interests were he to be banned for 7 days per violation, since that would protect him to some extent from violating the 1/7 rule quite so quickly (if one can make the assumption that a 1 year ban is a bad thing).</dd>
<dd>But in the end he's going to make his own choices. If the consensus is that by banning him from those articles we'll be protecting him from himself, I'll give my tepid support. But, frankly, he's shown no willingness to abide by similar restrictions in the past, and I don't see that starting now. Perhaps I'm wrong, though. Maybe we can ask him what he thinks. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:26, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The arbcom ruling allows any administrator to <i>ban</i> Pigsonthewing from an article, for good cause, without time limit. I proposed a rolling one month ban because I do like time limits. The one-year clause refers to the maximum length of a <i>block</i> after five strikes. As a matter of fact I would probably reduce the length of any block applied to this editor that I considered to be excessive. He's not a vandal so I think much shorter blocks make more sense, unless he completely stop doing anything useful. Then a long block would be a reasonable option just to get the problem off wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:54, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks all for the input.

<dd>Actually, I don't think it's required at all. Personally, although I think what Pigsonthewing did was in poor taste and stubborn self-righteousness, he didn't violate any rules (besides, perhaps, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="meta:Don't_be_a_dick">meta:Don't be a dick</a>). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Alex Schenck</a> (that's <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> to you) 22:21, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, while Pigsonthewing's reaction was typically self-destructive, these admins had no real policy grounds to be reverting this text back onto his talk page. No grounds to use admin abilities to enforce their preferred version in this edit war. And no policy grounds to protect the one page he is currently allowed to edit. Have I got that right? Is anyone getting why I say maybe he wouldn't be so pissed off if people would stop messing with him? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 22:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't think it was appropriate for people to start an edit war with Andy Mabbett over the contents of his talk page. Let him have it how he wants; he has read the notice I posted and so the notice has served its purpose and doesn't need to remain on the page. It was also inappropriate to protect the talk page as he isn't a vandal and he's currently blocked from editing everywhere else. I have released the protection. Whoever did it, please don't reapply it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:46, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the cool heads Linuxbeak and Tony. I know Pigsonthewing makes alot of people crazy, but I do think he'd be much easier to work with if people could try harder to understand where he is coming from. Evilphoenix is generally a nice guy (as Titoxd may well be also, I don't really know him), but clearly is getting into 'wikistress' territory with this situation. I don't know if this is an issue for policy shifts or just a re-evaluation of personal interactions... we should try to help people even when they are annoying us. Doing otherwise makes them more annoyed... and then they make you more annoyed... and then... bleh. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 23:05, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no reason to ever have this sort of revert war with a registered editor on his or her own talk page, or to protect it. Talk pages are for communication; removal by the editor in question indicates they've received the communication. Protecting the talk page of a blocked user is particularly abusive, as they then have no way of communicating with anyone else. I realize Andy's behavior is aggravating, but this was uncalled for. I find that politeness goes a long way with Andy. He's made an apology of sorts on his talk page; perhaps reciprocation is in order. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 00:21, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I'm back from work (hence my lack of activity over the past few hours, I had posted the above while walking out the door), and it seems consensus is against what actions I took on Pigsonthewings's user space, so I accept that. Tony Sidaway is right, he's seen the notices, and hopefully has read them as well. I think there does however need to be a page somewhere that is maintained to record what pages Pigsonthewing is banned from, I suggest something like Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing/Enforcement. I have reached a point where I am too involved with this issue to intervene anymore, despite my best efforts to remain neutral, enforce policy, and be fair. Pigsonthewing does contribute meaningfully to the encyclopedia, which is I think the only reason his presence here has been allowed as long as it has, but the amount of time that Administrators and other users are spending trying to reign him in far outweighs what benefit he may be to the encyclopedia. I think, for the best interest of the project as a whole, that it is time for Pigsonthewing to go. The only reason I have had any wish for him to stay was in some hope that he would learn to work positively with others, but I think the future from this point forward will be a continuous battle between him and any Administrators who attempt to enforce the Arbitration decision. His response to the notice of the Arbitration decision is reprehensible, and I have no faith whatsoever that this user will reform. The behavior of Pigsonthewing is simply not the behavior of a positive contributor to Wikipedia, and should not be tolerated. I have faith that other Administrators will continue to monitor this situation, and take action as needed, and I encourage any Administrators monitoring this thread to do so as well, but I myself am backing off at this time. Thank you all for your comments and participation in this discussion, and best of luck resolving this issue.

<dd>The sort of page you are talking about was set up at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pigsonthewing_Probation_2b43.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing/Probation">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pigsonthewing/Probation</a>. As to the rest of this... all true, but very incomplete. The REASON Pigsonthewing is so angry is that people, especially admins, have repeatedly broken or stretched policy to 'punish' or harass him, not themselves been 'punished' for doing so even when it is agreed they were in the wrong, and consistently refused to even apologize to him. You say that you must 'reign him in' because he's angry and disruptive. If you would 'reign yourself in' he wouldn't have valid reasons for feeling that way. That's the biggest 'disconnect' in this whole thing... you (meaning admins in general) wouldn't have to 'spend so much time reigning him in' if you treated him fairly in the first place. <b>NOBODY</b> should have to put up with having an admin block them and protect a page solely and explicitly to win a content dispute, that admin then justifying the block by <b>falsely</b> accusing them of having violated 3RR, and the admin community in general going along with it (beyond a few stating that it wasn't 'kosher'). That's just WRONG. You (again, collective) did it... you own the problems it caused. He never got an apology for that - from any of you. Just as it is now agreed that your (singular) recent actions against him weren't 'kosher', but you (apparently from the above) aren't about to apologize and don't face the kind of hair-trigger block/punishment that he does.</dd>
<dd>Is Pigsonthewing ever going to calm down and return to just making the thousands of positive contributions he used to? Probably not. And that's bad. But don't tell yourself you didn't have a hand in making it so. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly I don't think that there's been widespread violations of policy on the part of Administrators. Karmafist was found to have lost his temper towards him in the RfAr, and was placed on a personal attack probation, and I myself placed a block on Karmafist for what I felt was a violation of that personal attack injunction. I protected Andy's Talk page, and posted an explanation of it here, and the consensus from other Administrators was strongly against that action, and that action was reversed, which was the appropriate response on the part of Tony Sidaway or any other administrator who disagreed with my action. Other than those instances, I feel that for the most part other users have been expecting him to simply behave with some level of civility and respect for the rules. While the users who interact with him may not be blameless, he does himself no credit by screaming about their faults while refusing to address the justified issues people have with him. When Karmafist got blocked, he got upset, attempted to talk to me about it on his Talk page, which we did, he was upset about it for a while, but eventually he calmed down, realized the block had been placed to help him, not to hurt him, actually thanked me for intervening, and moved on, and has been contributing positively since. Andy's reaction to any criticism is to accuse any who criticise him of lying, to declare it a personal attack, and to remove warnings from Administrators from his Talk page. This shows a lack of good faith towards working with others and compromising, and if you want to work on this Wiki, you have to be willing to do that, and not simply constantly point fingers at others and cry foul. He has to follow the rules too, and he doesn't seem to accept that whatsoever. I have posted to his page what is expected of him, and the behavior that is expected of him, and told him that if he followed that, he wouldn't get blocked, and that if he <i>did</i> follow that behavior and still got blocked or punished, I would be the first one there to defend him. I have exhorted him to rise above the actions of others, and that though some others <i>might</i> be getting away with things that he is not getting away with, that he needed to clean his own house first, and make <i>his</i> actions correct. He ignored that, and continued right on with the behavior that he got in trouble for in the first place. This is not a situation of Admins ganging up on some poor user, Andy has been consistently rude, stubborn, belligerent, disrespectful, insulting, which as I said before, is not the behavior of a positive contributor to Wikipedia. None of us <i>enjoy</i> blocking him, we would be just as happy to have him be a positive contribution to Wikipedia, but it's his choice. If he respects the rules, he won't get in trouble. If he disrespects the rules, he won't get to edit on this Wiki. There's not much more to it.</dd>
<dd>I also did not block Andy nor accuse Andy of violation 3RR, I used no such phrase when I described the actions that occured before I protected his Talk page, nor did anyone else in the discussion following, that I have noticed. I simply listed what happened and linked to the diff in question, I made no assertion of any application of 3RR. I also was not the Administrator to place the block that was on him at the time. Nor did the community go along with it, they told me I was wrong, and undid my protection of the Talk page and IP block. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 18:00, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I tend to agree that a lot of Pigsonthewing's motivation is anger at what he views as asymmetrical treatment--which of course doesn't excuse his bad behavior, but does suggest that he may improve if he isn't treated unfairly.</p>
<p>I lifted the block on his IP number for blanking this page, as he did make an apology of some kind and it doesn't serve Wikipedia to antagonize an editor unfairly. While we should take reasonable steps to prevent further disruption, we must also act to regain his trust and enable him to rehabilitate himself. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:44, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Brian blocked him for 12 hours; I don't see that he's posted any talk page comments since that block expired.

<li>Have you discussed subst: this template with Noisy before you did so. The text remains the same and it was already in the state noisy preferred. Surely you can do some talking before doing the change? At any rate, blocking someone you're in a disagreement with is explicitly forbidden by blocking policy. Please discuss this with Noisy and get in a neutral third party if you have to.

<li>I've unblocked him and asked him to point out any negatives that using subst: could have on the use of this particular template.

<li>Ok, thanks, note that I normally use blocking very sparsely, but he was reverting me very rapidly, and when the revertions are knowingly against consensus it amounts to nothing more than vandalism. <i>If</i> he does think up some reason why he is correct, it still doesnt matter because community consensus has already been proven easily, he is of course welcome to try and change that. He also has a history of reverting me like this, and when he did it before no one agreed with him either, even though he spammed the complaint in ~5 different places. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Without commenting on this specific case, let me just point out that it's <i>never</i> wise for an admin to block someone s/he is in conflict with; even if it is justified, it gives a perception of blocking for unjust reasons.

<dd>Hmmm. Can I just point out that this is the second time that <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">User:Bluemoose</a> has gone against policy? In the first instance, he was running his <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebot_e595.html" title="User:Bluebot">Bluebot</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBluebot_7df9.html" title="User talk:Bluebot">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bluebot_ab21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bluebot">contribs</a>) without explicit permission for the changes he was making. Also, I naturally assumed that Bluemoose's actions were the prelude to deletion of the template, because I have seen the behaviour before of someone removing all instances of something's usage before nominating it for deletion and saying it isn't used. Bluemoose may claim this isn't the case, but I'm sorry—somehow I've just lost all faith in his credibility. If he is genuine, then he has my apology.</dd>

<dd>As to the template, it seems I was wrong in an assumption, because it was <a href="../../../l/i/v/Template%7ELived_727d.html" title="Template:Lived">Template:Lived</a> that had survived a VFD attempt in the past. Consulting <a href="../../../l/i/v/Template_talk%7ELived_2e4e.html" title="Template talk:Lived">Template talk:Lived</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Template_talk%7ELived_Delete_f289.html" title="Template talk:Lived/Delete">associated archive</a> should show that there are arguments for keeping this template, and retaining it in article space.</dd>

<dd>Noisy, I have subst:'s 10s of thousands of instances templates, and not deleted a single one. The previous dispute you bring up is interesting because when you placed the complaint in about 4-5 places, the few people who bothered to respond all agreed that you were wrong. Also in regard to "is the second time that User:Bluemoose has gone against policy" the policy breach before was a minor technicality, I can think of at least one bot I saw today that was running without permission. I apologise for having to block you, but rapidly reverting consensus driven edits are is not much better than vandalism.

<p>User <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvetlyo_1bc1.html" title="User:Svetlyo">user:Svetlyo</a> posted two external links related to the Macedonian <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_f62e.html#Greece" title="Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia">naming dispute</a>, one written by Bulgarian sources and one written by Greek sources but both links expressing two different approaches to the problem.</p>
<p>His external links were removed as "self-promoting" and the user was warned not to add them again. Then the user was blocked for 1 hour "to cool down" (excibition of power) and finally his own talk page was locked for "vantalism", just to mute him from further disccsuion about control and <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a> within wikipedia.</p>
<p>Is the future of wikipedia community as liberal as a virtual type of comunist dictatory? Can China use Wikipedia and if yes, how can we ensure that Chinese users don't fall into simmilar sensoring methods as the ones used by the Chinese government? Sensoring to protect the society? I think administrators should be more careful when using their power. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EALEKSANDAR_7346.html" title="User:ALEKSANDAR">ALEKSANDAR</a> 13:10, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Apparently, he does not intend to retract or apologize, and does consider my statement a personal attack, because his response was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jmabel&amp;diff=31126889&amp;oldid=31126336" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jmabel&amp;diff=31126889&amp;oldid=31126336" rel="nofollow">Okay.

<dd>I will not apologize to Node because Jmabel's accusation against me is false; and I dismissed his accusation on my talk-page by clarifying that the comment was not meant to be anti-Semetic and that I am not anti-Semetic. I cannot apologize for something that was not said by me in the context that Jmabel puts it. I told Jmabel to start a RfC on me, on this subject, because I'm confident that I can prove my case with reason and documentation. I also didn't like the tone that Jmabel used on me, plus the fact that he didn't come to my talk-page to first investigate the matter, but only to give me an ultimatum by forcing me to apologize; and then threaten to have me banned for as long as possible. If a RfC is started on me, I would like to be informed about it on my talk-page, and, I would like to be given 12-hours, from the time that I was notified, to build on my case. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 01:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, this is untrue... there are thousands of Moldovans who would be offended if you called them 'Romanians'.

<dd>Actually, that was true. If you referr to the russians, of course they will say that are not Romanians, how should they accept this since they were there to keep Moldova in Soviet hands.

<dd>I don't think it was appropriate for Annitas to make such a remark, but I'm suprised that Jmabel is getting so worked up over this. On an RfC regarding numerous uncivil remarks made by <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">User:Deeceevoice</a>, Jmabel defended her and ended his summary with "<i>"Cry me a river, white boy.</i>" (This was also the edit summary) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deeceevoice&amp;diff=30660742&amp;oldid=30651843" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deeceevoice&amp;diff=30660742&amp;oldid=30651843" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>.

<dd>Spoken by another Jew? Possibly harmless, even jokey. Spoken by a Gentile? Nasty, but I've never had that one followed by a physical attack. Being called "Jew boy" usually means "go away, you're not wanted". What Anittas wrote is usually about 5 seconds before a fist slams into your face. Also, I suggest that you might want to look at the context in which I quoted that remark before presuming my intent. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:10, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Anittas, even if you didn't mean your remark to be anti-Semitic, can't you just say "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it this way?" A few friendly words can go a long way.

<p><b>Comment:</b> That remark is not anti-Semitic. That remark, in my opinion, is not even a personal attack. Someone is trying to milk that slightly aggressive (its only flaw) remark for all it's worth and should stop, because it's disruptive. Using Anti-Semitism, a real problem in today's world, to start an RfC against someone who has not made anti-Semitic remarks is more offending in my opinion. Jews have suffered a lot due to anti-Semitism and that label should be restricted to what it is: hostile attitudes towards Jews because they are Jews; not a tool to gain an advantage in a dispute. Your accusations of Anittas making an anti-Semitic remark, in my view, are akin to accusing him of making a Nazi remark; very nice. Izehar (talk) 09:57, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not true. For the comment to be anti-Semetic, it needs to have a strong cause in it. It's not up to the interpreter to decide.

<dd>So if I called you a tsigan, you wouldn't take offense? Sorry, but intent is only half the story in determining a slur. How it is interpreted is the other half. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:17, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To call someone german, if he's german he won't take as an offense. If you tell to a tsigan that he is a tsigan, again he will not take as an offense. But to state that Moldovans are not Moldavians and are not Romanians that's an offense.

<dd>"if it is perceived as such, it is anti-semitic" is a very silly position imho. Still, Anittas made an unfriendly or provoking comment.

Last time I checked, we had a little thing called <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, didn't we? Now Anittas's remark is, if you AGF (which I hope you are doing), could be a mere observation and a stuck key. But no... It's much better to interpret it as a vile anti-Semitic attack.

<p>I'm not stopping him, at least for now -- it's useful to have him out his own sockpuppets. While most of these I recognize, I didn't know about some of them, especially the older ones; there are, however, a <i>lot</i> more, especially recently. Apparently the vandalism goes back to April, and the edits he attributes to himself are clearly all the same person. Maybe he's annoyed we never gave him his very own long-term-vandal page. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>How bizarre. If confirmed, they should all be blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 16:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seen this before ... the concept is... if someone sees the sockpuppet tag, they assume an admin has already blocked the account and as such the sock gets to go on vandalising a little bit longer until said admin realizes that no they are not in fact blocked. Solution simply becomes make sure to check the block log whenever you see a sockpuppet tag and make sure said sockpuppet is in fact blocked. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 02:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>But make sure the vandal isn't maliciously listing other Users as his sockpuppets. Zoe (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.130.130.html" title="User:216.234.130.130">216.234.130.130</a> 17:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC))</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Could I suggest renaming the accounts to something like "X sockpuppet of Sausage!" so that they don't take up names that could be used by new accounts, if you see what I mean?--TheDoctor10 (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDoctor10_16f5.html" title="User talk:TheDoctor10">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_TheDoctor10_c96e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/TheDoctor10">email</a>) 17:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't have the ability to rename accounts. By the way, about 90% of the accounts he tagged I remember from reverting and blocking over the last several months. The <i>complete</i> list of his sockpuppets would have over a hundred names though. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 17:41, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am ready to discuss the issue in a (nice), civil manner at anytime. We could not reach a decision between ourselves (even with my coutless entreaties) and I thought we could reach concensus by vote. Please don't misunderstand- I don't hate (or even dislike) TheOrgy. I just believe he sticks to POV, and various people have addressed this to him since his arrival. Note after I proved my point on my talkpage, I thought it over and decided to apologize. He promptly ignored my kindness (twice), and I am being blamed for slanderous actions...I will continue to be nice as I said to Mr.Sidaway, and I even would like to work alongside TheOrgy, but he keeps blowing off my attempts to help.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a> 21:54, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>No hassle. Sometimes it takes a new editor a few weeks to work out that they can't treat people like they might do on a fan forum. Thanks for your patience, I assure you that it's worth it for the sake of the encyclopedia. On Wikipedia you gain massive community respect by treating newcomers appropriately, and I think you should keep up the fine job you've started. It's unpleasant, though, so don't feel that you must respond to personal attacks. I can be contacted by email. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:38, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is protected again. There may be consensus on the semi-protection proposal, but I don't think that by that we can divine that semi-protection would be the will of the community for this specific case, nor that full protection is the will of the community in its absence or for this specific case. All we have is a policy that says that articles linked from the main page should not be protected and that instead vandalism should be reverted promptly. (<a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html#Uses" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol#Uses</a>) Given that it seems like the proper thing to do is to unprotect the page and monitor it, or else come to a differing consensus to validate the current protection. The purpose of this policy is to attract new users by inviting them to edit. I would venture to say that in addition to attracting new users in this way, prompt reversion of vandalism and swift blocks against vandals in this case, in accordance with the warning already embedded in the top of the article, will also help impress and attract the kind of users we want. The existing policy is a way of demonstrating that wikis work. Protection is more of an admission that they don't. That may be the case, but the only ratified policy here is to unprotect. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 00:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read the talk-page he refers to above and the edit history. Based on that I think his point is that he wasn't violating 3RR because the first of those four reversions was a revert of text which included copyvios. However, as I understand it, 3RR refers to removal of <b>any</b> portion of valid text four times within a 24 hour period... and thus his four would still count since that first version (and the subsequent three) apparently also included some text which was <b>not</b> copyvio. Still, that's getting far enough into technicalities that it's understandable where he might have thought he didn't violate 3RR. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 09:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It was in doubt in regards to the copyvio, so what Freestyle should have done was discussed with others in regards to this. Unless it's a clear case of vandalism, it's 3RR.

<dd>If it's a clear case of copyvio, you have carte-blanche to revert it away unless and until there is an assertion of permission or page-protection is applied.

<dd>You'd think so, but Wikipolicy doesn't seem to read that way. <a href="../../../c/v/_/WP%7ECV_27f7.html" title="WP:CV">Copyvio policy</a> says to revert copyrighted text to a version without it, but <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert policy</a> excludes only vandalism and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism policy</a> doesn't classify copyright violations as vandalism. So it seems like, as the policy currently stands, you should revert copyright violations on sight... but if you do so to the same text four times in 24 hours you should be blocked. I put a question about whether this should be changed/clarified on <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree-revert_rule_d7c8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule</a>.

<p>I need some help. I'd like to log, but there's a situation at <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">Economic fascism</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">User:Firebug</a> moved the article, and inserted a redirect-specific form of the old Template:Twoversions. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">User:RJII</a> pasted the article back into its original spot. I locked the template version into the normal articlespace and the article at its new location, in the hopes of having less of an authorship history mess to sort out.</p>
<p>I am tempted to delete the templated version, and move the article version back into place, and move the new Talk page into an archive, then protecting the page against moves. But before I go ahead and do that, I would like some feedback. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 05:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Considering the amount of emails, I wonder if he is using some kind of bot. In any case, our software developers should prepare a way to stop more then one request for a given username password reminder per 5 minutes or something, plus making sure that blocked IPs cannot request password reminders). PS. The emails I got are with 20 minute timestamp delay - either our email server is out of sych, or ot has been overloaded with vandal requests. In any case, I am looking forward for hunderds of emails...yuck. Help appreciated. PS.

<dd>Disconnect the email feature from your account for a little while, the requests will bounce.

<p>Usual occurrence of sock and meatpuppetry at the afd discussion, I'm sure you heard it all before; however what this lot have taken to doing is mentioning the questioned notability of the subject in the article itself, and referring to Wikipedia specifically and to the deletion debate. I have removed the specific section that does this (titled "Controversy") however came back online just now to find that it has been restored. Can one or two people just watch this page in case of a comeback of the self reference to Wikipedia?

<dd>I'd say that sort of self-referential nonsense in the article isn't worth worrying about until after the article survives AfD; an unlikely proposition. In the meantime, letting the puppets or whoever leave it in the article does Wikipedia very little damage and serves to highlight how little the authors understand about what Wikipedia is supposed to be. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hall Monitor is reverting my addition of a copyvio header to the Image:Tookie.jpg without discussion. When I go to his Talk page to ask him why, he deletes my question without comment except to note the text at the top of the Talk page which says he will not discuss anything with people who do not log in. Just because he won't discuss anything with anons doesn't mean he has the right to revert their valid edits without explanation. I cannot log in because I'm posting from work and we can't keep cookies on our work PCs. This is not a valid reason to revert a valid edit without discussion and violates Wikiquette.

<p>The story in short: one wikipedian sends an e-mail to another wikipedian. That other wikipedian publishes part of that e-mail on a talk page. The first wikipedian protests. I recommended a <i>hard revert</i> of that talk page to a version prior to the e-mail content being posted, here: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Posting_emailed_content_disputes" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Posting emailed content disputes</a>.

<dd>By a "Hard revert" I gather the user means a selective deletion of the relevant revisions. I don't see anything in the deletion policy which would support such an action, nor in any other policy i am aware of. Disclosure: I argued in the VP thread linked to above that the posting was legal and at least arguably ethical, so i am probably not unbiased. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:22, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Quite specifically, he says, he objected to my posting of material <i>without asking first</i>. I would argue that to make such a distinction logically implies that he does not actually object to the posting of the material, just the posting <i>without asking</i>. Incidentally... Nowhere does he even bring up <i>not getting permission</i> -- only <i>not asking for it</i>. Since he tends to be a very literal person, I would assume that is all he has objected to, and nothing else. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>Well, in your example, at least under U.S. copyright law, that particular short message is not likely an "original work of authorship." But the general rule is true - if someone writes to you, they continue to own the copyright in their creative work and you can only exploit the work if there is an exception in the law (e.g., "fair use") that allows you to do so. For example, the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Kaczynski_7c14.html" title="Theodore Kaczynski">Unabomber</a>'s manifesto is clearly an "original work of authorship" and the fact that he delivered to someone else does not give others the right to simply ignore his copyright. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 03:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Untrue, just like a recorded phone call in the majority of US states, use of public communication (IE: Phone, Email, Physical Letter) is not a copyright violation as long as one party consents to its use. The issue becomes whether or not the state in which both users reside have this policy in place or not. In several US states public communication cannot be granted "privacy rights" and redistribution is legal even without both parties consent, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> where I live for example. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 08:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

If you send me an email, I can legally redistribute that email to whomever I want, in whatever manner I want, modulo certain edge cases such as you emailing me a manuscript of an original novel.

<p>Anyway, on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Posting_emailed_content_disputes" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Posting emailed content disputes</a> I suggested to try solve this particular issue <i>not</i> by ever more remote "legalese" discussions, but by courtesy. The issue here is that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Demkina_9971.html" title="Natasha Demkina">Natasha Demkina</a> article is still blocked and that the people interested in that article are somehow hampered in trying to solve the content discussions on that article on its talk page, as long as this yes-or-no publication of the e-mail's content is pending. And I'd like these people interested in the topic to move on, try to search agreement on the <i>content</i>, so that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Demkina_9971.html" title="Natasha Demkina">Natasha Demkina</a> article can be unblocked without further fear of controversial edits.</p>
<p>I see three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both Keith and Askolnick agree that they move on with the discussion on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatasha_Demkina_d1ce.html" title="Talk:Natasha Demkina">Talk:Natasha Demkina</a> from the point where I removed the content of the disputed topic (the e-mail content can be found by browsing history). In that case both Keith and Askolnick take a step: the thing is not "permanently" removed, but there is a fresh start, allowing both (<i>and</i> others involved in the talk) to use only the arguments they see themselves fit for use in the public debate.</li>
<li>The e-mail content is <i>permanently</i> deleted from the talk page history: in that case Keith has to give in most (while some of his argumentation may go lost in the process, or at least become meaningless, as it is not clear to what he is replying). <i>Copyright/GFDL</i>-wise this is the solution least prone to further "legalese" discussion. If both agree to this solution, and it is executed by an admin, the thing is solved.</li>
<li>The section regarding the e-mail is restored, as it was before I removed it. If that is the <i>wisest</i> decision, I'll have to apologise for my rash action of removing it, and am prepared to do the job of restoring that section. Note that Askolnick's reaction was <i>positive</i> on the fact that wikipedians were trying to help solve the issue, see <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Posting_emailed_content_disputes" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Posting emailed content disputes</a>. If the section is restored, anyway, Askolnick should receive permission to delete/modify the passages of his own e-mail he thinks not fit for publication on such talk page (one would get something in the vein of the way Askolnick's second letter is treated <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatasha_Demkina_d1ce.html#My_responses_to_second_letter" title="Talk:Natasha Demkina">here</a>). Anyway, Askolnick should have permission to withdraw anything that qualifies as "original research", which to his own words he had reserved to publish elsewhere. Once that publication is out in the open, it will be easier to make references to it by all disputants anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Summarizing: for each of these proposed solutions, we could ask both Keith and Askolnick whether they could agree with it, in which case the thing can get solved by "etiquette" and "negotiation" and not by "legalese", and the content dispute over the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Demkina_9971.html" title="Natasha Demkina">Natasha Demkina</a> article can further be solved by trying to find consensus. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 11:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It didn't seem like a major difference, the only difference being that with comments on a user page, a blocked user can't simply remove them, like they could if they were on the talk page, these moves were an experiment to see if it maks the process of dealing with blocked anons a little easier, by taking away their means to alter other people's comments, in retrospect it was a poor idea, revert the moves of you wish--Aolanonawanabe 02:25, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Jake013 started his "career" at the Wikipedia with this "gem": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_Prometheus_%28JPL%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_Prometheus_%28JPL%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Project Prometheus (JPL)</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_Prometheus_%28JPL%29&amp;oldid=17720762" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_Prometheus_%28JPL%29&amp;oldid=17720762" rel="nofollow">first version</a>). Note the recurring theme "Thunderstorm Corporation/Enterprises" and "Prometheus"? He then went on a spree of AfD nominations, and has recently popped up again at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Joaquin_Maria_Gutierrez&amp;diff=31353126&amp;oldid=31351325" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Joaquin_Maria_Gutierrez&amp;diff=31353126&amp;oldid=31351325" rel="nofollow">an AfD discussion</a> with an utterly inappropriate rant (which I've since taken the liberty of removing). The long period without any edits whatsoever of Jake013 makes me suspect that there are other sockpuppets of his. If possible, I'd like them to be identified in order to fact-check their contributions. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 11:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jake013 is editing from the Phillipines on a /17 owned by Meridian Telekoms Inc. Several other editors have used this IP address in the past few weeks, leading me to suspect that it's a DHCP address with a short lease period. I also note that the AfD in question has dragged a number of other relatively inactive editors out of the woodwork; I think this might be caused by topical interest, rather than any malice toward Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:44, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
