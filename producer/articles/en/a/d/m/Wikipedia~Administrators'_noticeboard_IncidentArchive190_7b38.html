<p>These are the instances that I have run into with this user.

<dd>First, I have read all the talk page of <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> article and aware of the discussions and I have contributed to the talk page in 28 ,19 January recently (didn't you see that?)</dd>
<dd>about Ahmadinejad article it is totally biased towards warmongers; they didn't even mentioned in the lead that he is at most the second "decider" in Iran after <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Khamenei_23dc.html" title="Ali Khamenei">Ali Khamenei</a>, (beside the meaning of the "president"). It needs <b>total</b> rewrite and I didn't have time till next weekend and must get help from some other editors, too. Till then I think the tag of {{POV-section}} (which I was reverting it) must be there. take care.--<a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">Pejman47</a> 07:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not understanding what either of these edit wars is about: you're moving text from one part of the article to another, and people are reverting back.

<p>User:Azer Red/ED discussion page was recently nominated for deletion at Mfd. As the page contains libellous statements regarding the Encyclopedia Dramatica website and its owners, along with legal threats, I've repeatedly attempted to tag it for speedy deletion. Apparently libel is something we vote on now, rather than deleting it on sight. I'd appreciate it if an admin took a look at the page in question. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 07:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What libel statements? Saying that posting personal contact information on Wikipedia contributors and calling specific Wikipedia editors pedophiles and various other things is a possible violation of their hosting provider's TOS is libel? I have&#160;!voted for deletion and regret stooping to counter obvious trolling on that page but calling it libel is equally a violation of <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a>. This page was a discussion on how to prevent off-site abuse until ED turned up out of no where.

<p>Hey folks. I deleted the page last night speedily after much consideration as an attack page. It's purpose was to collect information to disparage its subjects. The subjects may be reaping what they've sewn, but two wrongs don't make a right and we don't need that kind of counter-attack on Wikipedia. Encyclopedia Dramatica is all about the "lulz of drama." Pages like this only feed the trolls the drama they want and belong off-wiki, <b>especially</b> if any talk of legal action is involved. There is really no need to mention ED on here anymore, even if you're upset that they're talking about you or other users in their uncyclopedic fashion. Don't slow down to gawk at the car wreck. Happy editing to all. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 18:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fredrick day, the term is a sexual slang. If you insist on confirming this for youself, try turning off the adult filter the internet search engine you use and doing a search. I am not interested in testing this myself. For one, I have little doubt the term is a sex slag; and I don't want to view lots of gay pornography.

<dd>My experience with Miltopia on <i>Encyclopedia Dramatica</i> has been that he generally tries to tone down anti-Wikipedia activity. I have personally tried to create attack pages on ED and have been reverted by him. Look at this: &lt;www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Miltopia&gt;. He's actually getting on some of their nerves because of this.

<dd>I would very much appreciate it if you would explain how this disrupts anything significant. It was a waste of space and of time, certainly, and not a serious or wise action, to be sure, but the only disruption that it appears to have caused for users other than Miltopia is this very acerbic section. Is there need for such hostility here? Calling for community banning of a user, discounting the entirety of the user's contributions to Wikipedia, making insinuations regarding sock puppet abuse, admonishing users for having an opinion that differs from your own - are such actions really necessary over such a minor issue? Think for a moment about the situation - is all of this hostility warranted for putting a welcome template put on a vandal's talk page? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 16:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is no hostility on my part. I have done nothing wrong except inform the community that Miltopia is still being disruptive. The vandal account he welcomed was created by Cplot, who has created the largest sock army I have ever seen on wikipedia, and who has been vandalizing numerous pages for months now. Desnm creates an account and his/her first edit is here to defend Miltopia and knows a lot about me and you tell me that isn't a sock account of someone? Simply put, we don't aide and abet vandals by welcoming them on their talkpages.

<p>First point is that Miltopia, on being unblocked, was given the condition that he was to stay as far away from MONGO as possible.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Miltopia&amp;diff=88000007&amp;oldid=87990745" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Miltopia&amp;diff=88000007&amp;oldid=87990745" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (His early edits were trolling and wiki-stalking MONGO.)</p>
<p>Second point is that Miltopia was involved in the pages relating to MONGO's RfAr, so he most certainly knows that MONGO has been very badly stalked and harassed by Cplot, even if Miltopia doesn't think that's a problem. (LOL, Loldongs, LULZ, Duh, Whoopeedoo, etc. Hope I got all those words right.)</p>
<p>Thirdly, anyone who is even remotely familiar with this case recognizes Cplot from his edit summaries, and knows that this is a troll engaged in very persistent harassment of another user, and that he is to be reverted and blocked on sight.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what Wizardry Dragon means by reminding people to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. If he agreed that Miltopia was being provocative, but that we shouldn't take it too seriously, and should just move on, I could understand that, though there has to be a limit to how much harassment of Wikipedians good users should be prepared to condone, and whether good users should be content to see someone in dispute with a harassment victim treating it as a joke. But if that's what he means, I fail to see where AGF comes into it. AGF would apply if we were to think that Miltopia was just checking the new user log, and sending random messages to people without checking their contributions, and had NO idea that this was someone who was trolling MONGO. Miltopia has admitted that he saw OurAnthem's edit, and was going to revert it himself, but was beaten to it. (For the record, I don't have a problem believing that.) In that case, it was in very bad taste. To treat harassment of your opponent as a joke is quite simply inappropriate.</p>
<p>I'm also puzzled by GTBacchus's post about how he himself has welcomed vandals. GTBacchus, you know Miltopia and MONGO have an rather stormy history. You have read that Miltopia saw the edit (and presumably realized who it was, since he has been following the case), and that he welcomed him as a joke. What you say about your own use of the welcome template may be valid, but it's completely irrelevant in this context. Miltopia didn't welcome him in the hope that he'd become a good contributor. He welcomed him in order to make a joke about someone harassing MONGO.</p>
<p>Those who defend Miltopia here seem to be unaware that an action or utterance can change its meaning according to context — just as "Good afternoon" can be a friendly greeting or a sarcastic rebuke to someone who is late. As Tbeatty says, there are just too many of these coincidences. And those who think it didn't do any harm — of course it did. It caused ill feeling. Miltopia, instead of saying how uninterested you are in MONGO, and how little you care for what he thinks, perhaps you could try (for your own sake, not for his) to care enough to stop making jokes that you may think are <i>just</i> below what's necessary to get you blocked. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 00:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Musical Linguist, you need to take a look at all these little situations and see what all this nonsense is originating from. These is like, the sixth time I've had to stop what I'm doing and troop off to ANI to dispel general mischaracterization and/or paranoia from other users. It's alarming that I managed to brush off MONGO for over a month and avoid him completely, save for these truly boring threads, and you still think <i>I'm</i> the one with the personal vendetta here. I don't see anyone else being followed to articles, WP:AIV, and several other pages. And you dragging up old junk already looked at by arbcom is only prolonging this.

<dd>There is no loss of good faith here. The question remains as to if Miltopia is here for purely constructive purposes. When editors knowingly welcome those that vandalize, this is not constructive. The best thing to do with repeat vandalism is to block and ignore, not welcome them. That you would see it otherwise is surprising. Miltopia has had to stop his work to come here over the last week three times I see, not just this time and not just because of my report alone. <b>IF</b> Miltopia was doing nothing but constructive edits, then there wouldn't be any complaints to the contrary. That is not the case, however. Furthermore, not sure what has happened since, but anti-Semitic nonsense may be the norm on ED, however threads such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:K37#Welcome.21" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:K37#Welcome.21" rel="nofollow">this are not welcome here</a>. Wikipedia does not tolerate bigotry or find puns on people's religion or ethnicity acceptable.

<li>I'm replying to Musical Linguist's paragraph directed to me. I don't know who "Cplot" is and have no knowledge of that user's harassment of MONGO. When I commented, I was simply replying to the idea that welcoming a vandalizing or trolling editor is automatically disruptive. I disagree with that principle, and I said so. You say I had read that he posted the welcome message "as a joke", but in fact I hadn't scrolled down that far when I made my comment. I reacted to what I had just read. I'm sorry if I gave the impression that I think "joke" welcome messages are a good idea. It's certainly not how I use the {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} template. If I knew that my comment was irrelevant, I wouldn't have made it, certainly.
<p>I would also reply to MONGO's comment above that Miltopia's noting of the {{Bruchim}} template is somehow antisemitic. Have you read the TfD? It's pretty clear to me that Miltopia saw the template, thought it was in absurdly bad taste, and showed it to his friend. The TfD agreed that it was absurd, and that's why it's deleted now. I'm not sure how you're seeing antisemitism there, but if you already think that someone is antisemitic, I guess you'll see what you look for. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was too hasty in assuming that you knew the history of the Cplot harassment when you made your post, and for that, I apologize. I know nothing about the {{Bruchim}} matter, but would suggest that Miltopia would be less likely to cause suspicion if he refrained from jokes about a situation that many Wikipedians are rightly upset about, and if his reaction to accusations could be a little less provocative and flippant than LOL, Duh, cool it, and WHOOPDEDOO. I would also suggest that for someone who comes from a website that harasses Wikipedians, but who wants to edit seriously here and to be regarded without suspicion, it's not enough to claim to have no intention of antagonizing the people trolled by that website; it's also necessary to have an intention <i>not</i> to antagonize them. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 23:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Miltopia posted a WikiProject logo that he noticed that is used to welcome editors who may be interested in the Judaism WikiProject on <a href="../../../k/3/7/User%7EK37_b18f.html" title="User:K37">User:K37</a> talkpage. K37 responded "The hell? LOOOOOOOOOOOOL" LOL is <i>laughing out loud</i> of course. Miltopia then suggests K37 should post it to talk pages on persons who may be Jewish "Start using it on Jewish n00bs plz". K37 responds as to how he is supposed to know who is Jewish on the internets...read the thread. I am well aware that ED enjoys and supports lampooning all religions and ethnicities and was merely pointing out that since this is Wikipedia and not ED, the same kind of behavior here is much less likely to be seen as a playful pun. In fact, this kind of behavior certainly appears to be more akin to the disruption for which I myself and a number of editors associate Miltopia with. Thanks.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I read the whole thing. I know what LOL means, too. I didn't take Miltopia's suggestion at face value; I read it as pointing out how ridiculous the template was, and not a serious suggestion that K37 use the template on "Jewish n00bs" pages, because, as K37 pointed out, how would anyone know whether a "n00b" is jewish? That's why the template was absurd, and that's the observation they were sharing. Nobody was lampooning a religion. The template was, in fact, absurd. I laughed out loud when I saw it, too, and I wasn't laughing at Judaism or Jews. I was laughing at an absurd template. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 14:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Huh. I'm talking about the <i>entire</i> thread, and have been all along. The content of the jest was that it's ridiculous to have a special template for welcoming Jews when this is the Internet and you can't tell if someone's Jewish. <i>Every</i> line of dialogue that you cite was saying that. ED doesn't mock Jews; it mocks antisemitism, by caricaturing it and showing it to be absurd; many ED editors are Jewish. I agree that Miltopia shouldn't be disruptive here, and I've repeatedly given him advice to that effect; I don't think that pointing out absurdity to his friend on his friend's talk page is disruptive. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Speaking of "shoot first, ask questions later" - do we actually need indefs? (I did a few myself this morning, but am having second thoughts.) Normally we consider one-time vandals to be reformable, don't we? Wouldn't the "commodity" prank go stale anyway within a day or two, so that there'd be little likelihood these guys would try it again later?

<p>In doing so, he has also falsely-cited a "25-2" poll which he <b>knows</b> is the result of vote-stacking. Two different administrators have declared that poll to be entirely invalid. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWOT&amp;diff=60373804&amp;oldid=60373163" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWOT&amp;diff=60373804&amp;oldid=60373163" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xoloz&amp;diff=60482947&amp;oldid=60388539" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xoloz&amp;diff=60482947&amp;oldid=60388539" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. To my thinking-- citing a poll you know to be the result of vote-stacking is just as bad as actually engaging in the practice. Worse, in fact, because he's been warned repeatedly the poll was invalid, but continues to cite it, saying the two admins' opinon that the poll was invalid does not override the opinions of the 25 users who voted in it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Rangeley&amp;diff=104160804&amp;oldid=104138465" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Rangeley&amp;diff=104160804&amp;oldid=104138465" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>

<dd>Rofl I dont know how many times I and everyone else has to tell you that you need reading lessons. It says that I agreed with the views of Rex who was a sockpuppet, learn to read. Your smear campaign wont deter from the fact that the concensus is growing againts you, your attempts to eliminate people with a different view, through this post, the Arbcom you tried to file on Rangeley and now the RfC you did file against Rangeley is quite a dishonest way of attempting to make a concensus.

<p>I need some help from some admin willing to communicate with <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESys_Hax_a317.html" title="User:Sys Hax">User:Sys Hax</a>, as I believe it no would be productive for me to try it myself.</p>
<p>I tagged the image Image:Abigail brittney hensel twins.jpg as "<i>replaceable fair use</i>" (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#i7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#i7</a>) some days ago and left him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sys_Hax&amp;diff=101109151&amp;oldid=99450486|a" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sys_Hax&amp;diff=101109151&amp;oldid=99450486|a" rel="nofollow">(non-boilerplate) message</a> explaining matter. Then, after the 7 days period, the image got ultimatelly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Abigail_brittney_hensel_twins.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Abigail_brittney_hensel_twins.jpg" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> by admin <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESys_Hax_a317.html" title="User:Sys Hax">User:Sys Hax</a> wasn't happy with this outcome and left me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104312702" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104312702" rel="nofollow">harsh message</a>, calling me a "<i>jerk</i>" (edit summary) and "<i>self-appointed bowdlerizing luddite</i>". As I get a lot of such attacks (and as I don't know what "<i>bowdlerizing</i>" means), I decided to ignore it at the time.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESys_Hax_a317.html" title="User:Sys Hax">User:Sys Hax</a> took some time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FAbu_badali&amp;diff=104427950&amp;oldid=104252110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FAbu_badali&amp;diff=104427950&amp;oldid=104252110" rel="nofollow">contribute</a> to an (already existing) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_b366.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abu badali">RFC dedicated to my persona</a>. There, he developed his thoughts on the image deletion issue and asked "<i>WHY HAS WIKIPEDIA NOT BANNED THIS HOODLUM?</i>". He also took the opportunity to define me as a "<i>punk who would prefer to drive around at night and break off car antennas with a baseball bat</i>". I decided to ignore that too. A good thing from this RFC is that people now has some place other than my talk page to attack me, and I got less "<i>You have new messages</i>" warnings (note that I don't want to imply that this is the sole reason people contributed to my RFC). (btw, I don't know what's a HOODLUM).</p>
<p>Later in the day, he left me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104430145" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104430145" rel="nofollow">another message</a> explaining me I'm a "<i>vandalizing punk who should be banned</i> ", called me an "<i>image vandal</i>" in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104456297" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104456297" rel="nofollow">article's edit summary</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104459380" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104459380" rel="nofollow">voiced</a> in this same article's talk page that I'm a "<i>known image vandal</i>" and a "<i>punk who's deleted hundreds of images for fun, always giving a ridiculous, bogus rationale</i>". Also according to him, I "<i>would rather be driving around at night smashing off car antennas with a baseball bat</i>".</p>
<p>After some more time, he decided he needed to left me one more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104467569" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104467569" rel="nofollow">message</a>, calling me an "<i>asshole</i>" (at least an English word that I have already learned!) and explaing me again his theory about "<i>smashing car antennas with a baseball bat</i>". It's funny that in this same message he says that "<i>Judging by the number of complaints filed against (me)</i>", I "<i>won't be an admin very much longer</i>". Well, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Abu_badali_107f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Abu badali">I'm not and had never been an admin</a>. But anyway, based on this misguided assumption that I am an admin, he goes on to wonder how did I "<i>get to be an admin anyway?</i>", and offers alternatives: "<i>Are you the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottom_%28sex%29.html" title="Bottom (sex)">"catcher"</a> homosexual boyfriend of a real admin, or are you just a pimply high-school social reject who hacked into the wiki admin database with a <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_kiddie.html" title="Script kiddie">kiddie-script</a>?</i>".</p>
<p>At this point, I decided he needs help. And that's what I came here to ask for.</p>
<p>Btw, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104469070" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Abu_badali&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104469070" rel="nofollow">removed his last message on my talk page</a>, according to his edit summary, to "<i>take (his) concerns to wiki administration</i>".</p>
<p>If someone here is willing to talk to this user about his behavior, I would really appreciate.

<blockquote>
<p>All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself "SwatJester". I will also be editing his articles with various IP addresses. Both of these little dirtbags can go to hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignoring the fact that I've been in the army for almost 5 years, including an Iraq tour, and experience with special operations units like 5th SFG, CAG, and liaison work with CIA, this isn't about the content dispute: it's about the announced intention get around his block with IPs to specifically target articles I've worked on.

<p>Dear fellows, following <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> accuses and his reverting of the article on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> I was arbitrarily blocked by English speaking user William Connolley who based his decision on the conclusion of Jkelly.. It is evident that they cannot validate statements of Biophys that I have violated BLP. Is the court sentence is enough reliable source? <a href="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/061120prigovor.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/061120prigovor.html" rel="nofollow">Official Court Sentence on Russian language dated 20.11.2006</a> This is now the most important matter in the dispute. By the way, if we would apply the same criteria to Stomakhin supporters statements they should be deleted too since they contradict to official materials, news articles and so on. Biophys wants only his sources to be in the article.

<dd>Ok, I see. But the block itself is dubious. The reference for which I was blocked was inserted by other user, I have corrected the reference. I was practically blocked for other user who linked particular phrase in the article to other source which is disputed. Second thing, it is evident that administrator who blocked me just accepted the POV of one person and blocked me, because he can't actually evaluate Russian sources. He blocked me without evaluating any evidence of my wrongdoing which is contrary to blocking policy, he just relied on phrase of other - Jkelly - user, who also is incompetent in Russian. It is evident that both these individuals violated Blocking policy which requires administrators to review the causes before blocking. Vlad fedorov.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Here is the procedure from Wikipedia policy</dd>
<dd>Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for controversial blocks is:</dd>
<dd>1. Check the facts with care.</dd>
<dd>2. Reread appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy.</dd>
<dd>3. Contact other administrators to sanity-check your reasoning, preferably on ANI.</dd>
<dd>4. After receiving feedback, place the block, wording the "reason" message with care and without jargon, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked.</dd>
<dd>5. Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies.</dd>
<dd>6. Stay around to discuss the block with other Wikipedians.</dd>
<dd>7. If an act or acts of disruption do not warrant a 24-hour block, consider a warning or posting to ANI before issuing a short term block. (Someone may well block them longer than you would have!)</dd>
<dd>8. If in doubt, don't block.</dd>

Usually 24 hour blocks aren't brought here for review and especially not when they are being invoked as a result of a decision on AN/3RR.

<dd>Further comments. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">User: Vlad fedorov</a> continue violating LP policy, so I had to revert his changes. Main problem is a single citation taken from two unreliable sources and used for defamation of a living person. The source is unreliable because (a) the cited article is not dated (worse than blog); (b) the text of the article (Russian language) is clearly different when compared from two different unreliable sources; (c) the site has no any editorial oversight; (d) the cited text is ridiculous (someone asks Chechehn fighters to start nuclear war against Russian Federation). There are also other problems. None of other users (except Vlad Fedorov) ever disputed my arguments. See also Living persons notice board. Therefore, <i>I ask you to block <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">User: Vlad fedorov</a> permanently from editing article <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> if he continue inserting this citation or other defamatory materials</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Biophys disputes the phrases not contained in the article on Boris Stomakhin, and namely the phrases about Shahids and about stinky Russia.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes these phrases by comparing them to the source he claims to be unreliable (RKO website).</li>
<li>one disputed phrase (about Shahids) is contained also at RKO website and match perfectly to that cited by Journalist.</li>
<li>Some words from the second disputed phrase (stinky Russia) are contained in both the Official court sentence and conviction.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes here only RKO website, which is not relevant to the dispute right now, because we discuss only Izvestia article.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes these phrases based on the logic that 'they were probably taken by Maksim Sokolov' from RKO website. But he couldn't know actually.</li>
<li>Biophys logic is that all Stomakhin citations should be contained on the RKO website, although we know that there are newspaper 'Radikalnaya Politika' edited by Boris Stomakhin and there are publications of other radicals which could have published citation of Stomakhin in question. I don't understand why Biophys think that all Stomakhin citations should be contained only at RKO website.</li>
<li>Biophys failed to show that there are contradictory phrases. Out of three citation by Maksim Sokolov, two are found at the RKO website<a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" rel="nofollow">1 citation at RKO website</a><a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">2 citation at RKO website</a> and they perfectly match those of the Journalist and one (about 'Stinky Russia') is not found, because Journalist haven't provided sources. The impossibility to found right now missing citation is not contradiction to Izvestia article. The fact that this citation couldn't be found does not mean contradiction.</li>
<li>The phrase 'worse than blog' is absolutely incorrect in regard of RKO website, since Biophys doesn't have evidence that this site has no any review, Biophys has no information on who runs the website.</li>
<li>Journalists have the privilege not to disclose their sources, in order to provide the freedom of speech.</li>

<dd>I would like to notice that currently Biophys claims that these sources: 1) Unreliable; 2) not neutral; 3) Non-encyclopedic style. Given the history of Biophys contributions and namely insertion of Putin into 'Phallus' article and creation of the deleted latter article on blog "La Russophobe" I suggest anyone to think one more time about <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> good faith. He contributes only to biophysics and anti-Russian materials. He failed to prove the contradiction - which was the main point of his argumentation. He lied intentionally about contradictions. And he deleted the material which he called "contradictory". Biophys believes that there is a plot (conspiracy) by Russian government against <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremist.html" title="Extremist">extremist</a> Stomakhin sentenced for <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremism</a>]. And Biophys tries to delete from the article on Stomakhin all information that could doubt this thought. My citations prove that Stomakhin actually wasn't dissident since he called for violence, called terrorist attacks legitimate and called Chechen terrorists heroes. He wants now to delete these supported by sources phrases from the article on Stomakhin by claiming they are unreliable. But these phrases are supported not only by the official court sentence.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 07:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As one can see by the section a little bit above, there have been serious issues at <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Darby_3562.html" title="Larry Darby">Larry Darby</a> with User:LarryDarby. Darby has most recently attempted to use a sock puppet User:User:BopBeBop(confirmed by checkuser) to get around <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues and making nearly identical edits, personal attacks and general claims that Wikipedia is controlled by Jews and Zionists. Example difs include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABopBeBop&amp;diff=104300500&amp;oldid=104270009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABopBeBop&amp;diff=104300500&amp;oldid=104270009" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larry_Darby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104310133" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larry_Darby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104310133" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larry_Darby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104311305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Larry_Darby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104311305" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.

At this point, some other admin probably needs to talk him and/or give him a long block for personal attacks and other issues. However, I wouldn't object to treating him as having exhausted community patience. (This was added at/by 20:44, 30 January 2007 JoshuaZ)</p>

<dd>I had seen that section and it states in relevant part, "Community bans must be supported by a strong consensus and should never be enacted based on agreement between a handful of admins or users." I'm not questioning the action; I'm trying to understand the rule. Does four or five people constitute "widespread community support" rather than "agreement between a handful of admins or users"? --<a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a> 04:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Reading this section, I see six people supporting the ban (JoshuaZ, J.smith, Grandmasterka, Sandstein, Yuser31415 and ThuranX (if I interpret his/her post correctly)) and noone opposing it.

<dd>Randroide, has any administrator taken action about this yet? It would surprise me if someone could just delete 2 weeks worth of discussion from an article talk page without any consequences. Did you restore the posts that were deleted? Further, it seems to me that the policy he cited in deleting applies to articles, and not what is on the talk page. Since you were actively discussing the issue, it should have remained on the talk page, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 09:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A quick look over the issue shows the text does still exist (but now on <a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandroide_45c5.html" title="User talk:Randroide">Randroide's talk page</a>). It should not have been excised from the Primal Therapy talk page. I've asked <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahameKing_bfb7.html" title="User:GrahameKing">GrahameKing</a> not to repeat such a removal, noting that any subsequent disruptive removal of valid discussion will result in a block to prevent further occurance. I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and trust he won't do it again. Randroide, I am sorry that nobody responded to your request the first time around (it does happen, and you did the correct thing in reposting it, civilly). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No Sir: Your look was <i>too kick</i> for a complex issue like this. The text I restored in my own talk pake was from a <i><u>different</u></i> discussion deletion made by GrahameKing in his/her own TalkPage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104282082" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104282082" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. That deletion <i>qua deletion</i> has not been reported by me because, well, after all I think that deletion is a private issue among GrahameKing and the other guy. I simply copy-pasted (and linked) the deleted text in my own talkpage just for the sake of preserving data.</dd>

<p>I am fairly new here so I am not sure if this is the right way to deal with a user that has been making personal attacks and deleting people's discussions. This person's IP address changes everytime they edit, however, it appears to be the same person. I started out ignoring it in the beginning, but I think it should be looked into.</p>

<dd>While I certainly think the anon IP's words could be chosen with more care, I don't really see personal attacks going on. On the other issue, that of removing or altering comments of other editors, you are correct. That is bad form, and a <s>warning should be given</s> message should be left on their talk page. I doubt that would have much effect, though, since it is multiple IPs. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 15:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I understand, it is probably difficult to warn and even stop an editor when their IP address changes. That was why I did not think much could be done or was even sure if something should be mentioned. I was going to suggest a semi-protection on the page but that seems to be only for the article and not the discussion page. Or a way to keep the editor from deleting people's comments. Thank you very much for looking into it so quickly. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosePlantagenet_bf5f.html" title="User:RosePlantagenet">RosePlantagenet</a> 15:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, sorry. As I said, I am just kinda new. But, thank you for trying to help. I went back and removed the rude parts of the editor's statement and kept the rest. And, suggested to them that if they want to help out with the article that is great, otherwise there is no need to delete other people's comments nor talk down to them. I doubt it will do much good but there does not seem to be much else to do at this point. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosePlantagenet_bf5f.html" title="User:RosePlantagenet">RosePlantagenet</a> 12:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There have been several postings of nonsense on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Charge_7344.html" title="Electric Charge">Electric Charge</a> and i was wondering if user:Ayan2289 is the same as 71.225.220.43, as they have both posted very similar styles of vandalism. If so, then there is repeated vandalism happening by that user/IP. If not, then its just some copycat. Also if this is the wrong board, can someone please point me to the right one before removing it. Thanks User A1 11:26, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't believe this vandalism is serious enough for a CheckUser at this point. Just continue to revert (as long as you're not violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> and if one of them does, you can report them on the proper "board," listed at the top of this one) and warn them if you spot vandalism.&#160;:) Once (and if) one gets to a test4, report him/her to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 12:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Vandalism isn't covered by <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. If it's truly vandalism, just revert. - 131.211.210.11 13:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's not clear-cut vandalism, it's not...and from the way User:A1 is describing this dispute, it doesn't sound very clear-cut. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 13:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Srose - Will do&#160;: I'd say it's fairly clear cut vandalism/nonsense, Paco didn't name the symbol for electric charge (q) after his favourite food, nor is it named after the fictional character from the bond series. So i think 3RR is not applicable User A1 13:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I received a {{test4}} Final warning on my talk page without previous warnings. Is there any way I can remove it or at least get a "first" warning if I did indeed vandalise Mr. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Silverman_cf67.html" title="User:Paul Silverman">User:Paul Silverman</a>? The follow incidences have lead to this: I reverted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APaul_Silverman&amp;diff=104506887&amp;oldid=103586490" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APaul_Silverman&amp;diff=104506887&amp;oldid=103586490" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> because I thought he accidentally put the examples on his page. I wrote on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APaul_Silverman&amp;diff=104506804&amp;oldid=104359873" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APaul_Silverman&amp;diff=104506804&amp;oldid=104359873" rel="nofollow">here</a> telling him about the <a href="../../../s/a/n/WP%7ESandbox_e5a9.html" title="WP:Sandbox">WP:Sandbox</a>. He retaliated and vandalised my user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AOnathinwhiteline&amp;diff=104817496&amp;oldid=98849304" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AOnathinwhiteline&amp;diff=104817496&amp;oldid=98849304" rel="nofollow">here</a> even admitting that he was openly vandalising. So I wrote him a first/accidental warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Silverman&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104817405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Silverman&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104817405" rel="nofollow">here</a> which caused him to give me my "final warning" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOnathinwhiteline&amp;diff=104819385&amp;oldid=104817546" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOnathinwhiteline&amp;diff=104819385&amp;oldid=104817546" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I've recently read through his talk page to see if there was any information and it's littered with people accidentally editing his page and asking repeatedly for him to respond. Thank you for your time. I hope this gets cleared up because I would rather not like to be banned for something so silly.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 11:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There does appear to be quite a bit of confusion over his user page...which makes absolutely no sense to me. He's made it clear with his edit summaries that he wants the stuff there. It would be a good idea for people to look at the page history before editing someone else's user space. I do agree that giving you a {test4} was inappropriate. I'm assuming that he may have overreacted because he's sick of people blanking his page. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 12:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As to 'any way to remove' the warning... just do so. Users are free to remove comments/warnings/whatever from their own talk pages if they wish. Doing so frequently or without following up <i>may</i> sometimes be viewed as 'uncivil' or 'sneaky', but even then it is <i>allowed</i>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good day, I am writing to report what I view to be administrator abuse by the following Wikipedia administrator: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> <a href="../../../l/a/r/Talk%7ELar_de49.html" title="Talk:Lar">(talk)</a>. The following reasons are as followed:
<dl>
<dd>1.This user began by giving me warnings about the layout of content of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> article. While the user in question came off as well meaning, this user disregarded my own input in the matter while ordering me, with strong language to "take the advice of everyone else". This matter would not be a very big deal in and of itself, but a number of users, most notably <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> engaged in profanity and personal attacks against me, something that was not assessed by the administrator. The dispute itself has been a hinderance to the acheivement of consensus, and simply put, this administrator criticised me while "looking the others way" with regards to the questionable actions of the other users. Dialogue of this can been seen at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">the Socialism talk page</a>.
<dl>
<dd>2. This user gave me a number of warnings on my user page with regards to what he/she perceived to be a disruption. The issue at hand here is that he/she threatened to block me for the deletion of these warnings by me. This is not a blockable offense, yet this user clearly demonstrates that he/she believes it to be by stating that his/her "patience is wearing thin...". No user, not even administrators can tell other users what they can and can not include in their talk pages. This can be seen in my talk page. Checking the history might be useful.
<dl>
<dd>3. This user has gone against Wikipedia blocking rules and regulations in that he/she has bolcked me for 24 hours: A. On no particular grounds, no specific reason or violation was cited as reason for the block other than that this user had perceived me to be difficult. B. This user and I were clearly engaged in what could be characterised as a "content dispute". It is clearly stated under the blocking guidelines, that it is not acceptable for an admin to block someone which is in a content dispute with them. This dispute referred to the discussion of page layout/settings in the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> article, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">where the dialogue of this dispute can be viewed here</a>. C. This user, while not giving any specific citations/reasons for the block in question, stating that I should review the policies of Civility, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a>. I agree, as I admit I could use a change in going about some edits. But the Wikipedia block guidelines has stated that none of these violations justify a block, and once again, no direct reason was given for the block in the first place. It should also be noted that the block in question took place almost immediately after I stated my intentions to report what I view to be administrator abuse.
<dl>
<dd>4. This user has blanket reverted minor edits of mine on the grounds that "no consensus was given". This is a valid reasons for reversions regarding major structural changes, but does not apply to minor edits characterised by correction of grammer, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is my sincere belief that the actions of this administrator with regards to my account are not sufficiently justified. It is therefore my humble request that the actions in question be reviewed, evaluated, and that proper sanctions be given is such measures are found to be necessary. Thank you for your time, and have a good evening. ---- <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishEfternamn_7051.html" title="User:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>EnglishEfternamn</i></b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/n/g/User_talk%7EEnglishEfternamn_2fa1.html" title="User talk:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>talk</i></b></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EnglishEfternamn_01d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Tahoma, helvetica" color="lightblue"><b><i>contribs</i></b></font></a></sub> 04:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nothing to see here, beyond Lar being <i>extraordinarly</i> patient with a rather...vexatious editor. A short review of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of EnglishEfternamn's talk page</a> shows Lar patiently and politely advising Efternamn how to handle a dispute at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">Talk:Socialism</a> (Efternamn was attempting to change the article from American to British English). Efternamn responded by removing Lar's advice with rude edit summaries, calling it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104211694&amp;oldid=104192724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104211694&amp;oldid=104192724" rel="nofollow">"harassment"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104473461&amp;oldid=104463253" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104473461&amp;oldid=104463253" rel="nofollow">"vandalism", and "personal attacks"</a>. See further up this page at <a href="#EnglishEfternamn_and_WP:POINT" title="">#EnglishEfternamn and WP:POINT</a> for details and discussion about how Efternamn earned his most recent block.</dd>
<dd>The only 'proper sanction' that I can foresee is an additional block of Efternamn (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:EnglishEfternamn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:EnglishEfternamn" rel="nofollow">he's had three</a> in the last six weeks already) if he doesn't start behaving in line with Wikipedia norms. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:58, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>These are clearly ridiculous and severely misrepresented allegations of the way Lar handled this issue.

My subsequent 24 hour block was characterised as mild by some. I remain hopeful this editor can reform, (although the wording choices in the above are perhaps somewhat indicative that it hasn't happened yet) and will continue to monitor this situation. As always I welcome review of my actions.

<dd>I'd like to point out that he was blocked as a sock of me, even though he is a seperate individual, simply because he edited from behind the same router as I do before he moved. Since I am <i>not</i> in Seattle, and he currently is, that means that he was falsely blocked as a sock, and he is not evading anything. Alternatively, for the sake of argument, if he is me, I am not blocked and therefore he would not be evading a block. I have removed my votes and comments from the AfD, because I have no desire to be blocked again for the actions of another user who has been falsely identified as my sock. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 21:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">User:Abu ali</a></b> has decided to make usage of his wikipedia page for malice intent, when the issue was mentioned to him, his response was to add my user name to be pointed out together with the rest of the intentional attack on zionism.</p>
<p>after given fair warning and increasing on his offense (such as reintroducing my username after a wikipedia admin - Ryanpostlethwaite removed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Abu_ali&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Abu_ali&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>) he was recieved an issue of a final warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Abu_ali#Warnings_from_userpage" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Abu_ali#Warnings_from_userpage" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>.</p>
<p>his response was to reply with false naivity.. that he did not see offense in the "zionism = moshe katzav" issue (he actually enhanced the issue by adding two more categorical misrepresentations), while he ignored his blatantly offensive reaction (i.e. putting me out on display). i honestly feel the best summary for the innapropriate activity of this user lies behind the warning in with these words:</p>
<p><i>"this finger pointing [at me] is unacceptable, i suggest you let go of your anti-zionist bash tactics or that you merely move them to a website which allows such activity. Jaakobou 11:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)"</i></p>
<p>in conclusion, i request this user be banned due to his counterproductive and even destructive use of wikipedia. Jaakobou 07:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

His compaint above is factually incorrect. He has accused me of vandalism for editing my own user page. He has accused me of making personal attacks from my user page, but declined to provide the text of these attacks (the simple reason being that no personal attacks were made by me). He has mischaracterised my reply to his "warnings" without providing a link to the text <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jaakobou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104528511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jaakobou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104528511" rel="nofollow">reply here</a> and accused me of making two (unspecified) misrepresentations. If you examine his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jaakobou_bdbe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jaakobou">contributions</a> you will find a mixture of personal attacks on other editors and aggrassive POV pushing (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lebanese_prisoners_in_Israel&amp;diff=103101364&amp;oldid=102990937" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lebanese_prisoners_in_Israel&amp;diff=103101364&amp;oldid=102990937" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>).

<dd>I agree that singling out Jaakobou and posting his name in the Zionism links on Abu Ali's user page was inappropriate, and I am glad to see that Abu Ali has removed it from there. But it's not such a big deal, surely? After all, it's not as though Jaakobou considers the term to be defamatory. I don't see any inappropriate content on Abu Ali's talk page; and after all, on his own talk page, Jaakobou refers to " crack head arabs" and suggests that other editors are lying. Isn't this also a personal attack -- and racist, in addition?</dd>
<dd>There is no possible excuse for banning Abu Ali, even the original "offence", which I do not think warranted any sanction, has been remedied by him. I suggest that Jaakobou drops the whole storm in a teacup, and gets on with editing. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 12:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Roland. Personally, I don't like political material on userpages, but many people do this, and I don't know that there's a clear rule, is there? If there's not a clear rule, I think we need to be very careful about singling people out. As far as insulting people, I recently had a situation where two other users were dealing with a much more serious political accusation, and along with some admins, we talked it through and got the material removed. I think Jaakobou had a right to be annoyed, or even offended, but even alleged incivility can be dealt with civilly, and in this case I think that was accomplished with the removal of the material. I hope that resolves the issue. Best, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 14:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no such thing as a pre-warning. If you want to complain about me, go ahead -- I'd like to see you explain how your dismissive reference to "a couple of crack head arabs" was anything but racist.

<dd>I am very surprised that anyone sees a copyright issue here. Naji al-Ali created <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handala.html" title="Handala">Handala</a> as a symbol of the Palestinian people, the image has been very widely copied by other artists and cartoonists, in graffiti, on t-shirts and elsewhere. It is universal in Palestine. Preventing use of the image in Wikipedia is almost equivalent to censoring a conscious Palestinian presence. Surely, if there is any doubt, it is possible to contact his family and establish the status of this image. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 12:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No one stops you from doing just that (be sure to get a release that is acceptable to Wikipedia, not just an informal mail or even worse a telephone call). Until then, it is a fair use image, and we have to follow the image policies. Note that e.g. the famous <a href="../../../c/h/e/Che_Guevara_7c64.html" title="Che Guevara">Che Guevara</a> photo <a href="../../../f/a/m/Image%7EFamousphotoche.jpg_fd34.html" title="Image:Famousphotoche.jpg">Image:Famousphotoche.jpg</a> is also a fair use photo. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But there is a difference between a cartoon character and a photo. Even if the particular version of the image used by Abu Ali is fair use, there is nothing, as far as I know, to prevent him from himself drawing and using Handala. I don't think that the idea itself is copyright. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 14:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, you are not allowed to do that either. Making your own version of copyrighted cartoon characters is still a copyright violation (otherwise you could make your own <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a> cartoons and no one could stop you!). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Good day, I am writing to report what I view to be administrator abuse by the following Wikipedia administrator: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> <a href="../../../l/a/r/Talk%7ELar_de49.html" title="Talk:Lar">(talk)</a>. The following reasons are as followed:
<dl>
<dd>1.This user began by giving me warnings about the layout of content of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> article. While the user in question came off as well meaning, this user disregarded my own input in the matter while ordering me, with strong language to "take the advice of everyone else". This matter would not be a very big deal in and of itself, but a number of users, most notably <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> engaged in profanity and personal attacks against me, something that was not assessed by the administrator. The dispute itself has been a hinderance to the acheivement of consensus, and simply put, this administrator criticised me while "looking the others way" with regards to the questionable actions of the other users. Dialogue of this can been seen at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">the Socialism talk page</a>.
<dl>
<dd>2. This user gave me a number of warnings on my user page with regards to what he/she perceived to be a disruption. The issue at hand here is that he/she threatened to block me for the deletion of these warnings by me. This is not a blockable offense, yet this user clearly demonstrates that he/she believes it to be by stating that his/her "patience is wearing thin...". No user, not even administrators can tell other users what they can and can not include in their talk pages. This can be seen in my talk page. Checking the history might be useful.
<dl>
<dd>3. This user has gone against Wikipedia blocking rules and regulations in that he/she has bolcked me for 24 hours: A. On no particular grounds, no specific reason or violation was cited as reason for the block other than that this user had perceived me to be difficult. B. This user and I were clearly engaged in what could be characterised as a "content dispute". It is clearly stated under the blocking guidelines, that it is not acceptable for an admin to block someone which is in a content dispute with them. This dispute referred to the discussion of page layout/settings in the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> article, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">where the dialogue of this dispute can be viewed here</a>. C. This user, while not giving any specific citations/reasons for the block in question, stating that I should review the policies of Civility, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a>. I agree, as I admit I could use a change in going about some edits. But the Wikipedia block guidelines has stated that none of these violations justify a block, and once again, no direct reason was given for the block in the first place. It should also be noted that the block in question took place almost immediately after I stated my intentions to report what I view to be administrator abuse.
<dl>
<dd>4. This user has blanket reverted minor edits of mine on the grounds that "no consensus was given". This is a valid reasons for reversions regarding major structural changes, but does not apply to minor edits characterised by correction of grammer, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is my sincere belief that the actions of this administrator with regards to my account are not sufficiently justified. It is therefore my humble request that the actions in question be reviewed, evaluated, and that proper sanctions be given is such measures are found to be necessary. Thank you for your time, and have a good evening. ---- <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishEfternamn_7051.html" title="User:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>EnglishEfternamn</i></b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/n/g/User_talk%7EEnglishEfternamn_2fa1.html" title="User talk:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>talk</i></b></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EnglishEfternamn_01d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Tahoma, helvetica" color="lightblue"><b><i>contribs</i></b></font></a></sub> 04:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nothing to see here, beyond Lar being <i>extraordinarly</i> patient with a rather...vexatious editor. A short review of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of EnglishEfternamn's talk page</a> shows Lar patiently and politely advising Efternamn how to handle a dispute at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">Talk:Socialism</a> (Efternamn was attempting to change the article from American to British English). Efternamn responded by removing Lar's advice with rude edit summaries, calling it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104211694&amp;oldid=104192724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104211694&amp;oldid=104192724" rel="nofollow">"harassment"</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104473461&amp;oldid=104463253" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EnglishEfternamn&amp;diff=104473461&amp;oldid=104463253" rel="nofollow">"vandalism", and "personal attacks"</a>. See further up this page at <a href="#EnglishEfternamn_and_WP:POINT" title="">#EnglishEfternamn and WP:POINT</a> for details and discussion about how Efternamn earned his most recent block.</dd>
<dd>The only 'proper sanction' that I can foresee is an additional block of Efternamn (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:EnglishEfternamn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:EnglishEfternamn" rel="nofollow">he's had three</a> in the last six weeks already) if he doesn't start behaving in line with Wikipedia norms. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:58, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>These are clearly ridiculous and severely misrepresented allegations of the way Lar handled this issue.

My subsequent 24 hour block was characterised as mild by some. I remain hopeful this editor can reform, (although the wording choices in the above are perhaps somewhat indicative that it hasn't happened yet) and will continue to monitor this situation.

<dd>I reinstated the incident because it has not been properly reviewed by even on person with proper oversight. It is not been addressed that <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> broke the "content dispute" regulation either. Lar, again, did not cite a SPECIFIC offense for the block as well, which is also against the rules. At this point, there is a bigger issue as to whether or not I broke the rules, an issue of protocol on Lar's part. This is why this incident must be further addressed.-- <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishEfternamn_7051.html" title="User:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>EnglishEfternamn</i></b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/n/g/User_talk%7EEnglishEfternamn_2fa1.html" title="User talk:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>talk</i></b></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EnglishEfternamn_01d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Tahoma, helvetica" color="lightblue"><b><i>contribs</i></b></font></a></sub> 02:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has been removing LGBT tag from talk pages of articles relating to our project.

<p>First of all, I am a male. Stop with the female pronouns. Secondly, I have been removing unencyclopaedic content, that is all. I maintain that what I am doing is for the good of wikipedia, and I put such a userpage comment because of the LGBT hype up on wikipedia. I am removing the LGBT Issues banner on pages where there is no hint of an LGBT issue. <a href="../../../e/e/d/User%7EEedo_Bee_d006.html" title="User:Eedo Bee">Eedo Bee</a> 12:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>My apologies for misidentifying your gender. I saw you referred to as female in another area, so assumed it was correct. I have cleaned up my initial post here. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 12:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely think it's POV - the person seems to be Catholic, so is likely religiously opposed to the LGBT project. Somebody should warn this editor. Also, the "no hint of an LGBT issue" is rubbish, and this isn't for the good of Wikipedia. The person can demonstrate their Catholic, anti-LGBT bias in a different manner other than disrupting Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 12:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're incorrect Eedo Bee - I'm blaming you for trying to disrupt Wikipedia, not anyone else, but yourself. It's you who is being a vandal, not Catholics. Other Catholics, while holding their contrasting opinions, choose to respect other people's differing opinions and still edit in a fair, balanced and objective manner. I welcome such Catholic editors, and hope they continue to participate in Wikipedia. Your bias paints Catholics in a negative light, which is wrong of you - perhaps you can take your anti-LGBT agenda elsewhere - this is an encyclopaedia and is meant to respect both sides of the coin. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 12:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notice that Eedo's final userbox says "This user is against LGBT issues and Queer Theory," which is a strong indicator that he is acting for POV reasons.-<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 12:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have now reverted seven of his edits, and notice he is returning to the pages and taking the tags off (at least one so far0 again. This is getting tiresome, and I politely but firmly request administrative intervention. I should also add that Eedo seems like a new editor. His contribution history only goes back to Jan. 2. Perhaps he is not aware that Wikipedia is run by consensus. I invite you, Edo, to review the policies here before you continue editing like this. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 12:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think he misinterpeted my opinions - I was trying to explain that his Catholic views may be a reason why he dislikes LGBT issues etc. This isn't to say all Catholics dislike LGBT issues or anything of that nature may I add. I'd like to also say that the issue is Eedo Bee, and not Catholic editors - Catholic editors have and will continue to play a valid, important role in Wikipedia, and I respect their differing opinions. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 13:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have asked Eedo Bee to stop unilaterally removing the LGBT Studies tag from article talk pages, since this appears to me to be potentially <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruptive</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point of view</a>-driven. The example of <a href="../../../a/v/e/Aversion_therapy.html" title="Aversion therapy">Aversion therapy</a> is clearly within the legitimate scope of the project. I would also ask <i>all</i> participants to step back and remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. There is no need to further escalate this dispute, and name calling is certainly not warranted by anyone involved.

<p>You people keep editing, so it is difficult to reply. I have already tried 3 times now. I will jus sum up. It does not say I am Catholic anywhere. You people just assumed. You people is the same people that was meant when it was stated "We" Billy Tipton did not have a sexual relation ship with a woman. This is a lie. Those libel attacks are a response to attacks against myself and my beliefs. I will continue to revent non LGBT articles to LGBT banner free articles. <a href="../../../e/e/d/User%7EEedo_Bee_d006.html" title="User:Eedo Bee">Eedo Bee</a> 13:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First: Jeffpw please note that Eedo Bee's edits are clearly '<i>not</i> vandalism. Labeling them as such is exactly the sort of escalation of this legitimate content dispute that I asked all participants to avoid. Second: Eedo Bee, please do not continue to remove these tags without first reaching a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a> on the article's talk pages. I have warned you that taking unilateral action of this kind is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruptive</a>. It is not the way that Wikipedia works and if you persist you can be blocked from editing at all. Finally to everyone involved I again appeal for calmness here. Eedo Bee is correct that the issue of whether he is Catholic is not germane to this at all. Please concentrate on the user's editing actions, not their background. Everyone should read our policy on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>.

<dd>I've not said a word about Eedo's religion. That is not an issue to me. I do, however, see his actions as vandalism, and highly disruptive to both the LGBT Project and Wikipedia. And I note he is continuing his ill-advised campaign despite several people warning him against it. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 13:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This isn't an issue to me either, and I clarified my stance in an earlier comment left here. Perhaps Eedo Bee can also not concentrate on "background" when commenting on people's talk pages. I'm sorry, but this is vandalism which as far as I am concerned - I disagree with the above which Gwernol said, and suggest Gwernol please note I was accused of being anti-Catholic, and the LGBT Project was referred to as "you people" on someone's talk page. I have made no "personal attacks", but I call a spade a spade. Vandalism is vandalism - I don't call it an alleged "content dispute", I call it what it actually is. This is my opinion and I have nothing further to say on the subject. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 13:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>. I note that this user is relatively new and may not have fully understood what project tagging means. He may have assumed it gives project members special rights to edit articles. I have left a note explaining that this is not the case, per <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and an explantion of why projects tag pages.

<p>Redvers, when AnonMoos or I bring up the Iraqi dinar vandal here, there's usually someone who doesn't understand the problem. This has been going on for ... what, a year? ... has happened a dozen times, it involves the use of rotating anonIPs or the creation of multiple new acounts, and it's always an attack against the same two articles and the same two editors. Sure it doesn't look like much if you look at just one account. Look at a few hundred to get the full picture. The guy is mentally ill, is my guess, and is determined to PUNISH the people who thwarted him. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

However, the IPs refuse to discuss the matter and keep adding it back. What should we do? Semi-protection might work, but the IPs come back sporadically to insert the information.
