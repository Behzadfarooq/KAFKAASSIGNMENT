<p>Some time back I wandered into what is obviously a bitter external dispute between proponents of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> (PRT) including <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">User:Fresheneesz</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">User:Skybum</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">User:ATren</a>; and a cartoonist and environmentalist, <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">User:Avidor</a>, engaged in a campaign against PRT, which was apparently being used as a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking_horse.html" title="Stalking horse">stalking horse</a> against light rail in Minnesota. I made many changes to the article which were initially welcomed, but the PRT proponents decided they didn't like the fact that, overall, I insist on the article reflecting the fact that <i>no such system currently exists anywhere in the world</i>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">User:Stephen B Streater</a> did some sterling work too, and they had less of a problem with him.</p>
<p>ATren, formerly "A Transportation Enthusiast" has a blog, <a href="http://weinerwatch.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://weinerwatch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://weinerwatch.blogspot.com/</a>, which attacks Avidor and also makes very plain the fact that ATren is a strong proponent of PRT. Which is where it gets messy. ATren is currently loudly demanding on my Talk page that I denounce Avidor's bias. I have said that that I am opposed to <i>all</i> abuse of Wikipedia for political ends, but ATren will accept nothing less than singling out one side of this plainly bilateral dispute. ATren flatyly refuses to admit that he <i>has</i> any bias, paints his bias as neutral, and insists that anyone more sceptical than he is themselves biased. I don't see why I'm supposed to have a view on the subject beyond an engineer's usual curioisyty about some new subject, but there is no possible doubt that overall the article is about a system of widescale urban tranport, whereas in practice after forty-odd years of debate we have a couple of test tracks and (now) two orders to service car parks at Heathrow and Dubai.</p>
<p>We have found a good, neutral, impartial source which states that the literature of around 200 published papers is typically favourable and marked by a lack of self-criticism. It states that the concept faces "formidable" challenges in the shape of political opposition, indifference, unproven technologies and vested interests (which I reckon is spot on - remember, this is supposed to replace use of the private automobile in entire cities).</p>

<dd><small>Note: this is false - no PRT proposal I've ever seen aims to replace the car. PRT is always proposed as a multi-modal solution with cars and possibly other forms of public transit. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 08:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>We have a statement from the Minnesota Sierra Club, a group which might ordinarily be expected to support anything which would reduce private car use, which enumerates these challenges and therefore resolves to oppose the PRT proposal in Minnesota. Nope. Can't have that - it's "astroturfing". Silly of me even to think that the Sierra Club might be <i>actual</i> opposition rather than <i>fake</i> opposition. Meanwhile the literature is still verifiably dominated by a lack of self-criticism and the technology still faces verifiably formidable challenges...</p>
<p>One day the Heathrow system will open and we will have a solid basis for an article. Until then we have a fanwank which desperately needs to be brought down to earth. But I find Avidor's Roadkill Bill cartoon (agit-prop for integrated urban planning) funny so <i>obviously</i> I am quite incapable of forming a balanced judgement on the issue. Or something. I don't want to lose my temper with this argumentative pair so I've come here to vent my spleen a bit and see if anyone else feels like chucking a bucket of cold water over them for me.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm wrong. Who knows? Thanks for your time, anyway. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:54, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Several points in response, since JzG is misrepresenting this dispute:
<ul>
<li>The "stalking horse" theory that JzG mentions is <i>unverifiable fluff</i> that has no basis in reality. Avidor has been on an <a href="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">anti-PRT</a> <a href="http://www.lightrailnow.org/features/f_prt_2005-01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lightrailnow.org/features/f_prt_2005-01.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>political crusade</i></a> (<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/237556_antiprtop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/237556_antiprtop.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/comments/2006/3/2/11421/90995/6#6" class="external autonumber" title="http://gristmill.grist.org/comments/2006/3/2/11421/90995/6#6" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8781" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8781" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://theroblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/personal-rapid-transit-revisited.html#111740409336646248" class="external autonumber" title="http://theroblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/personal-rapid-transit-revisited.html#111740409336646248" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/anokaflash/112389193751759922/#349820" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/anokaflash/112389193751759922/#349820" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_TsVzSPi-Q" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_TsVzSPi-Q" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://dumpbachmann.blogspot.com/2006/10/open-letter-to-star-tribune-about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dumpbachmann.blogspot.com/2006/10/open-letter-to-star-tribune-about.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, etc)for over 3 years, spreading disinformation like the "stalking horse" theory all over the Internet. He's also admitted to using sock puppet identities to spread his message. <i>There is no basis to any of his conspiracy theories.</i></li>
<li>I came upon Avidor when he tried to push his <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_Avidor_e31e.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor">completely unverifiable POV</a> here on Wikipedia, in order to sway local political elections in Minnesota. He spent several months gaming the NPOV tag on the PRT page, and using the "disputed POV" tag as evidence that the Wikipedia article was being infiltrated by "pro-PRT cultists", in his political blogs and forums. This seemed to be a blatant misuse of Wikipedia as a platform for political propaganda.</li>
<li>JzG came along in the dispute and immediately expressed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=45333985&amp;oldid=45330729" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=45333985&amp;oldid=45330729" rel="nofollow">admiration</a> for Avidor and his <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadkill_Bill_93cb.html" title="Roadkill Bill">cartoon</a> - in fact, he created the Wikipedia article on Avidor's cartoon and later defended it from deletion. Despite his admitted affection for Avidor, he proceeded with the mediation. Personally, I was concerned that he was such a fan of Avidor, but I <i>trusted</i> that he would recuse himself if he couldn't be neutral.</li>
<li>Over the next several months, JzG was positively <i>hostile</i> to the three editors on the other side of the dispute. Even though we all agreed on perhaps <b>90%</b> of his edits <i>without argument</i>, he repeatedly accused us of POV pushing for any change <i>we</i> made, reverting of all our edits <i>on sight</i> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" rel="nofollow">threatening</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46326855" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46326855" rel="nofollow">twice!</a>) to <i>lock down the article</i>. The threats to lock the article were particularly egregious because (a) they were done at the behest of Avidor (Avidor posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" rel="nofollow">this</a> 30 minutes before JzG's initial threat), and (b) they were based on <i>his own misreading</i> of a single word in one of Skybum's edits. Even after Skybum (who, unlike Avidor, has always been a good faith editor) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46368644" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46368644" rel="nofollow">politely told</a> JzG he misread the word, JzG continued to insist he read it right and threatened Skybum <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46369299" rel="nofollow">again</a></i>, <i>insisting</i> he <i>had</i> read it correctly, even though the history showed he clearly didn't! It was clear that JzG was not only willing to do Avidor's bidding, but was unwilling to consider any argument from the reasonable editors on the other side (<i>none</i> of whom had a political agenda, as Avidor did). In the months after that, JzG continued to revert almost every change we made, no matter how small, and in many cases insinuating that we were POV pushing. The absoluteness of his reverts made it clear that he <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owned</a> the article - and after his threats to lock it, we really had no way to fight it.</li>
<li>The Minneapolis Sierra Club supports Minneapolis light rail, which competes against PRT for funding, and therefore they opposed PRT. They are a <i>local chapter</i> of an environmental group. Against this, the <i>European Union</i> has endorsed PRT in cities - they did a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/newsanddoc/article_2650_en.htm" class="external text" title="http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/newsanddoc/article_2650_en.htm" rel="nofollow">3 year study</a> of PRT and <i>endorsed it unequivocally</i>. The study was rigorous, involving 16 partners in academia, transit consulting, and city planning, and focused on 4 different PRT schemes in 5 cities. This augments 40 years of peer reviewed research, several textbooks devoted to PRT design, and fully-functioning prototypes that have <i>carried passengers</i>. Despite all this, JzG continues to call it "pseudo-science" - despite the existence of fully-functioning prototypes. He's also called it a "quixotic dream". To me, it's clear he is sympathetic to the <a href="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" class="external text" title="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" rel="nofollow">unsupportable POV of Avidor</a>, that PRT is a fraud and a hoax.</li>
<li>I have absolutely no political agenda. I stumbled upon PRT a year ago, and I was shocked at the amount of blatant disinformation being spread by <i>a single individual</i>. I therefore decided, <i>in the interest of truth</i>, to set the record straight. Hence, my blog, which is <b>apolitical</b>. I only use it to answer the disinformation that Avidor spreads, and to call out the people who implicitly support him by quoting his propaganda. However, I challenge anyone to scour my blog and find any statement of political support. Even when I reference politicians, it's purely in the context of their statements on PRT. Despite this, JzG has begun to accuse me of having a political motive - apparently someone just fighting for truth can't be believed. In any event, <b>I would be willing to reveal myself to a neutral third party to confirm everything I've said.</b></li>
<li>I have nothing to do with PRT, PRT companies, or PRT advocacy. I have absolutely no financial interest in PRT companies. <i>I've never even met a PRT "proponent".</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The fact is this: when someone we admire is involved in a dispute, try as we might, it is very difficult to remain neutral. JzG has a clear affection for Avidor, and therefore has taken much of Avidor's views at face value, including the undue level of skepticism for a technology that has a large amount of verifiable support. JzG should have recused himself from this mediation from the beginning, because his affection for Avidor affects his neutrality. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 01:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify: I did write that comment, but it was my first month on Wikipedia, and I didn't understand the way things worked then. Also, that comment was after several weeks of Avidor edit warring the NPOV tag (for the express purpose of advancing his political campaign), as well as incessant linkspam and personal attacks on the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_Avidor_e31e.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor">talk page</a> (repeatedly calling editors of the PRT article "cultists"), and I simply lost my temper. Some examples of Avidor's comments on that talk page: <i>"If I fixed that, the PRT cultists would change it back..."</i>, <i>"No links to anything real... just true believers in a lost cause following crackpot 'visionaries'..."</i>, <i>"Yep, the PRT cult is in firm control of this Wikipedia page..."</i> <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 03:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, ATren, for giving everyone a perfect example of the problem: you portray your bias as neutrality, and anyone who disagrees with you as biased. Note that Avidor (unlike ATren) has not edited that page for over six months. This is not about your off-wiki fight, it's about a Wikipedia article (do not bring your battles to Wikipedia). Stalking horse is unverifiable fluff? Not according to the Sierra Club it's not - but of course they are <i>biased</i>, it's only you who is neutral, right? As Cotterell says, the literature is predominantly supportive and marked by a lack of self-criticism. Citing that literature as evidence of a lack of criticism is not terribly helpful and fails to explain the observed fact that after over forty years of discussion <i>not one</i> real-world system currently exists. The article is about a wide-scale urban transit system, but the only projects looking likely to be completed in the near future are in car parks, nothing like we describe in the article. You may think it's perfectly fine to document the PRT proponents' dreams and ignore the realities, I happen to disagree, based on my well-documented bias against using Wikipedia to promote new, great things which might one day change the world. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ha! Locate me <b>one</b> single reliable source on the stalking horse global conspiracy theory. Go ahead. Find me one. For the uninitiated, the stalking horse theory is Avidor's pet conspiracy which claims that hundreds of researchers on 3 continents have spent the last 40 years perpetrating a <i>hoax</i> - all for the purpose of blocking a Minneapolis light rail line! This is the ridiculous conspiracy theory that I've fought <i>nearly a year</i> to keep out of the PRT article, as Guy has done everything he can to get Avidor's completely unverifiable POV into the article. He started out trying to get Avidor's tasteless anti-PRT propaganda cartoon in. Nobody supported that, so he tried pushing content from the <i>Light Rail Now</i> astroturfing group - a group that contains unverifiable anti-PRT content <i>written by Avidor!</i> When that was rejected, he found a single paper that kinda-sorta is critical of PRT <i>literature</i> - not PRT itself, mind you - and had used that one conference paper to invalidate 40 years of research. Now, Guy is pushing a resolution by the <i>Minneapolis Sierra Club</i> (which, for all we know, has Avidor as a member!) into the top of the article, while he <i>suppresses</i> content from peer-reviewed journals and engineering conferences as <i>biased</i>. Can anyone, even a well-respected admin like Guy, justify such a position? I am at wits end here - this has been a nearly year long dispute, and I'm still arguing that peer reviewed journals are a more reliable source than a local chapter of an environmental group! And yet Guy continues to say <i>I'm</i> the one letting my biases affect my judgement.</dd>
<dd>BTW, just a point of clarification: Avidor stopped editing the article because he no longer had to - Guy took up his fight. Whenever he wants something done, he just asks Guy to do it and the war starts up again. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 14:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hate to repeat it, but content resolution is not the role of admins (you know that, Guy).

<dd>It was not an administrative action, never was. I went to the article as an editor. My problem is with ATren's months-long campaign of argumentation based on his obdurate refusal to admit to his own personal bias (and I really don't think it's a coincidence that every time I even allude to the dispute in <i>any</i> discussion he pops up and starts all over again). I think I'll just nuke the thread from my Talk page and leave it at that - nothing in the world will ever satisfy ATren other than getting his own way, in this case a unilateral condemnation of the massively less active side of a bipartisan dispute. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Guy came to the article as a <i>mediator</i>, not just an editor. He then proceeded to threaten to use admin powers to prevent any change to what he wrote (in response to Skybum's good faith edits - see links above). So which is it? Was Guy an editor, mediator, or admin, or all three? This all came up again because he wrote comments in an arb com case implying Fresheneesz was just bitter because his article was deleted, when the dispute went much deeper than that. In fact, Fresheneesz, Skybum, and I had <i>repeatedly</i> expressed exasperation at JzG's <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> of the article and rejection of any changes to his version of the article. I am frankly sick of being painted as a POV pusher in this dispute, when in fact there were three other editors who supported me, and all three had the same level of frustration with JzG's actions. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 17:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No I didn't. I have never been a member of the mediation cabal or mediation committee. I saw a notice of an edit war and thought the subject looked interesting (still do), so I came along to see what I could do. And you seemed not to have a problem with it until I said that I like Roadkill Bill. Given that Avidor has not edited that article since April, I hardly think his (openly admitted) bias is a pressing problem, and your insistence on continuing to fight a battle that was over, in Wikipedia terms anyway, months ago, does you no credit. Neither does your continued campaign of vituperation off Wiki - nobody likes a sore loser. But hey, frustration is a good word - exactly the word I'd use to describe someone who is still coming back with "and another thing!..." half a year after the discussion ended. Why not click Random Article and find something to improve? It's what I sometimes do when I get wound up. It was advice I picked up here, I think.

<dd>Not a mediation?

It's clear you considered yourself a mediator, and we treated you as one.</dd>
<dd>Avidor has not edited the article - but why? Could it be because <i>you are representing his POV</i> - he just lets you know what he wants and you do it? It started with the threat to block the article (which he had requested just 30 minutes earlier -see links above) and has continued even until today:
<ul>
<li>Avidor recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90237814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90237814" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> that the link to his personal page was removed, and you immediately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=90276269&amp;oldid=90061801" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=90276269&amp;oldid=90061801" rel="nofollow">restored it</a>, calling his personal anti-PRT propaganda page "notable skepticism".</li>
<li>Then Avidor gave you a link to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89956684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JzG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89956684" rel="nofollow">resolution</a> by his local Sierra Club, and despite the questionable reliability of quoting such a group, you immediately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=90279621&amp;oldid=90276269" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit&amp;diff=90279621&amp;oldid=90276269" rel="nofollow">added the link</a> the article <i>in the intro!</i> Just to put this into perspective, you have removed <i>journal-sourced content</i> from us, but when Avidor sends you a link to a <i>one-page resolution</i> from a <i>local chapter of an environmental group</i>, you put it in the intro!</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I can cite <i>many</i> other examples of you doing what Avidor asked, including the Unimodal page, which you submitted for deletion soon after Avidor started complaining to you about it. <i>Why would Avidor edit the article when he can just ask you to do it for him?</i></dd>

<dd>Precisely. ATren has threatened ArbCom, but dcided not to because of "the cabal". Of the three of us - ATren, Avidor and me - ATren is the onyl one still actively editing that article, the only one pursuing the long-dead dispute, the only one to refuse to acknowledge any personal bias whatsoever. He says I reintroduced a link but forgets to mention that it was he who removed it, despite an ongoing off-wiki dispute with the owner of the site linked. Deleting it? Fine and dandy. Re-introducing it? Bias. Sierra Club article opposed to PRT? Astroturfing. PRT proponent's homepage? Authoritative source. Look at all the terrible things these sceptics - no - <i>pseudoskeptics</i> have done to ruin an article on a technology which will surely exist Real Soon Now! It's a silly spat about really very minor detail of the article, the amount of disruption caused is out of all proportion. He;s also still knocking on about <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skytran.html" title="Skytran">Skytran</a>, a project with no prototype, no backers, no known realistic prospect of existence, which I still don't think deserves an article, but I have left it alone in its much less advertorial form. <i>Left it alone.</i> For months.

And above all, Minnesota, the closest they've yet come to an implementation, was defeated due in no small part to the completely untried nature of the technology.

<p>Just a heads up really - the page that had been in Raul's user space had recently been upgraded to policy.

<p>The main change, and reason I've bought this up here, is that the policy now requires admins who protect or semi-protect the Main Page featured article to drop a note here explaining why and how long they think protection should last for.

<dd>I am sure this must have been suggested before, but would there be any objection to having the featured article of the day <i>move</i> protected while it's on the main page? There's really no valid basis on which a user would move that day's FA (or probably any FA) to another article name, so any such moves are highly likely to be vandalism, and inability to move the page doesn't interfere with ability to edit which is the rationale for rarely protecting that day's FA. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's the argument <i>against</i> using it preemptively. Are there any circumstances in which there could be a non-vandalistic move of that day's featured article? Or are there circumstances in which trying out the move-page feature would be a newbie's introduction to Wikipedia? If we agree the answers are "no" and "no" then I think suppressing the move tab on the day's FA should be routine practice, especially after this morning's experience. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:39, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've replied on Mike's talk page. It seems that Zacheus has published personal details of other users on his blog.

<p>Hi, I know that there are about 1,000 administrators. I am interested in starting a small "long article" breakup committee so to provide assistance to those who need "super" long pages broken up. Many pages are fortified with seasoned editors who do not wish to see their beautiful articles broken up, and as such impose great resistance to even small changes. Especially with featured articles. Hence such a committee would need at least three administrators to control revert wars during the process of a page break up. Personally, I like to break up long science-related articles, so that new contributions can be made.</p>
<p>Can someone guide me to administrators who would be interested in this. Over the last month, I have been proposing an outline on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticle_size_ea6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Article size">Wikipedia talk:Article size</a> page. Long article issue problems are presently a major weakness in Wikipedia.

<dd>Good idea, in theory. But I don't really like the fact that you seem to think that instead of establishing a consensus that a page <i>should</i> be broken up, it is better to recruit some admins to prevent people from reverting such a thing. If this idea is implemented well, there should be absolutely no need of admins. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 00:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, my plan is that:
<dl>
<dd><b>First</b>, an editor tries to establish consensus: the issue is brought up on the talk page, and it is suggested that the regulars break up the article into subtopics, with short summary paragraphs (w/ main article attachments), see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> as an example, so that the main page gets below a certain limit.</dd>
<dd><b>Second</b>, if plan #1 stifles out in argument and indecision to act, for a number of consecutive weeks, than an breakup arbitration committee notice is placed on the talk page, putting an ultimatum deadline, such that either the regulars break up the page to below a certain limit by that date or an external breakup committee, enforced by a team of administrators, will do so.</dd>

<dd>That would be a worst case scenario. Ideally, if an article “breakup team” existed, then the mere placement of a "talk page notice" would be enough to compel the regulars to break up the page on their own. When one works on a page for more than a month, then article <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_goggles.html" title="Beer goggles">beer goggles</a> tend to develop, wherein the page seems perfectly fine no matter how long it gets. Presently, the “32 kb warning” tag that pops up on long pages is completely useless, because editors will unconsciously justify their “unique” long pages for so and so reason, and argumentitively attack anyone who questions them about page length. ---<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 02:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My problem still exists. A breakup committee should not have the power to decree that a page <i>will</i> be broken up by the involved editors, or someone else will come and do it for them, with admins preventing any reversion of changes. With the exception of the fact that they are openly acknowledging that they have that power, that is called a cabal, and it is bad. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 03:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well what alternatives do you recommend? Should we let bloated 100 kb page articles linger around for months or years on end because of a few hard-minded editors; while, in the mean time, hundreds of thousands of readers get turned off and give up reading or better yet can’t load the page in the first place because they have dialup or are using a Blackberry, etc.? I don’t see what harm can come from this. We open up some new pages, cut and paste, everyone does some cleanup work, and than instead of having one 100 kb page, we now have, for example, three 33 kb pages. The process takes a day or two. It’s not that complicated. But a project team is needed for a “pressure-effect” and administrators may be needed to give user warnings to seasoned editors. In the end, everyone is happy. I am certainly open for other ideas? --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 03:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um... The current method of establishing consensus before changing anything seems to work just fine. Obviously, the "few die-hard editors" think there is a good reason why their page <i>should</i> be 100 kb long.

While this would be problematic enough, he seems completely unable to understand the concept of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, no matter how many times the concept is explained; some examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=89500580&amp;oldid=89294632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=89500580&amp;oldid=89294632" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Israel&amp;diff=88699883&amp;oldid=88612219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Israel&amp;diff=88699883&amp;oldid=88612219" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euphrates&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90287123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euphrates&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90287123" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> He seems to have no compunction about replacing cited information from reliable sources with his own speculation and arguments, using dubious sources at best. In addition, his Talk: page comments are intemperate at best, and often highly uncivil; see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89506523" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89506523" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, or the entire Talk:Flag of Israel page starting at <a href="../../../f/l/a/Talk%7EFlag_of_Israel_b611.html#Separation_of_Church_and_State" title="Talk:Flag of Israel">Talk:Flag_of_Israel#Separation_of_Church_and_State</a>. I am currently unaware of a single edit of his that has actually managed to stick in an article, though one or two might have slipped through, and most of his Talk: page comments consist of political rants.

<p>Because I have previously edited this page (as has Pschemp) I ask that the following blocks be reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><small>22:38, 27 November 2006 Pschemp (Talk | contribs | block) blocked "207.70.152.4 (contribs)" with an expiry time of 48 hours (vandalism) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Pschemp&amp;page=User%3A207.70.152.4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Pschemp&amp;page=User%3A207.70.152.4" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></small></li>
</ul>
<p>This comes a full 7 hours after the last edit. After the anonymous user received a warning on their talk page, they have not continued the disruptive behavior. So what purpose does the block serve other than to be punitive, as the editor has brought there actions inline with our traditions.</p>
<p>Also this block fails to assume good faith:</p>
<ul>
<li><small>22:37, 27 November 2006 Pschemp (Talk | contribs | block) blocked "68.100.239.10 (contribs)" with an expiry time of 1 week (vandalism) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Pschemp&amp;page=User%3A68.100.239.10+" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Pschemp&amp;page=User%3A68.100.239.10+" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></small></li>
</ul>
<p>The editor has two edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>22:31, 27 November 2006 (hist) (diff) Temple garment (→Construction and symbolism of the garment - deleted offensive picture) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_garment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90527399" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_garment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90527399" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></li>
<li>05:17, 6 September 2006 (hist) (diff) The Greatest American Hero</li>
</ul>
<p>The only justification for such a long block after 1 edit is if that IP is a sockpuppet of an existing user. But we have no proof of that and as I tried to explain on the <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">Pschemp</a>'s talk page, this kind of vandalism is not unexpected given that the picture is very disrespectful to many people's belief systems. What we need to do is educate and welcome - not smack them for trying to make a contribution they feel is their duty. The first user shows, once educated, these users will stop being disruptive. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 23:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Did any of you notice that I changed the block to 48 hours? Obviously not. Get your facts straight before you complain. Additionally, the edit pattern shows this is a user who is hopping from IP to IP and making the same edit repeatedly in a short amount of time. It isn't a new innocent IP every time, its the same guy who was already reverted 3 times. The only way to deal with people using proxies is to block immediately. However, the entire issue has been resolved since the page is now semi-protected so the IP vandals can talk about their feelings on the talk page first. (which Trodel agreed was a good solution) We had a discussion and came to conclusions. Trodel's posting here is superfluous. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 17:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd be happy if pschemp could acknowledge that there might be <i>any</i> problem with her blocking strategy. Looking back over the last month or so, the vast majority of her blocks are no-nonsense username and vandalism-only accounts. <u>However</u> her use of "trolling" as a block reason appears somewhat hit-or-miss. Leaving aside her blocking me, a quick glance back shows
<ul>

<dd>where a serious contributor was blocked for a straightforward (if strident) dialog on a user talk page. Again, without warning or clear justification. The weakness of the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} procedure is also made clear by this exchange, by the way. If these more controversial blocks could be brought here for review <i>and</i> Pschemp was a bit more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pschemp&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86790672" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pschemp&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86790672" rel="nofollow">open to dialog</a> regarding the blocks, there would be no problem here.

<p>Oh that's your issue. I think if you remember correctly another administrator reviewed that block and found it appropriate. As did the person whose page you were disrupting. If you'd like to complain about that block, go start another section. Continuing to whine here about an action already deemed appropriate by four admins is childish.

<li>The (first) response is not only <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">rude</a> in "continuing to whine" but doesn't *ahem* get it's facts straight. (It conflates several different incidents.) Blocks, like all applications of adminstrator privledge (and in fact all Wikipedia edits) are subject to review and discussion. The ability to take part in discussions about one's actions in a civil and rational manner is in fact a pre-requisite to participation here. I'd ask if the level of venom could be turned down just a tad. I'm also asking (as Trödel is) for some adminstrator input into pschemp's blocking, so a "another section" is not called for. - 152.91.9.144 22:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This block was out of line, the review was half-arsed, and your hostility is deeply unbecoming. If you are unable to handle civil, reasonable requests for examination of your blocks, don't make them.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive150_35bd.html" title="Edit section: Copyright violation and abuse question on 6.5 Grendel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Copyright violation and abuse question on <a href="../../../6/2E/5/6.5_Grendel_9711.html" title="6.5 Grendel">6.5 Grendel</a></span></h2>
<p>Ok, first the background. In the past week there have been dozens of edits to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">Assault rifle</a> by anon IPs making unreferenced claims that say the 6.5 Grendel cartridge is the best thing since sliced bread, etc. It was definitely not NPOV, had no sources etc. It was almost to the point of being an advertisement saying "Alexander Arms bullets are better than any other bullet out there". Anyway, I noticed a similar IP had posted on the <a href="../../../6/2E/5/6.5_Grendel_9711.html" title="6.5 Grendel">6.5 Grendel</a> page. Some of the text there looked fishy, so I did a brief Google search and found the ballistics testing paragraphs were ripped straight off another page. It's possible the entire page is a rip as well, but only slightly paraphrased. A lot of it looks similar.</p>
<p>Anyway, I removed, tagged copyvio, posted on the copyright violations page etc. Great, grand. The talk page has suddenly exploded in its absence with anons and new contributers suddenly claiming I work for Remington (I don't, I'm a student), that I have a history of malicious edits (I've never received a warning), etc. Also no less than 4 people and probably more now have now claimed to be the copyright owner and release their work: but some of them are releasing it into public domain (which I don't think is GFDL compatible) and some only to specific users.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*<i>"The malicious charge that SwatJester has made that images and comments regarding terminal ballistics gel testing cross-posted at TheHighRoad by John Hanka, aka Grendelizer at 65Grendel.com, are the property of that site when John is not only the moderator on the 65Grendel.com site, but is in fact paying for its existence, are absurd. " <b>(note: this refers to my tagging as copyvio.)</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>"Beyond this, SwatJester has a history of destroying the work of well-intentioned contributors on many sites by constantly reverting them to versions he finds more palatable. Such behavior, if allowed to continue by the Wiki staff, will destroy the desire and ability of knowledgeable and well-intentioned individuals to contribute to the Wiki effort."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Is it possible that someone here at Wikipedia is on the payroll or has vested stock interest in Remington?" (not so subtly hinting at me).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The talk page had not received any notice in almost 30 days. Suddenly all these posts, with competing and overlapping incompatible copyright releases, most from anon IPs and none of which can be confirmed yet....and then this abuse spewed at me: sounds like someone is organizing off-wiki to orchestrate something on wiki.</p>
<p>And to be honest: I'm F*ing sick of it. I like to think I do a good job on wikipedia. I've been editing here almost a year, something around 8000 good edits on over 4000 pages. It's one thing for a random IP to flame me, or vandalize my user page, that's happened before and it's entertaining. But this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Will another couple of eyes take a look at this and maybe hearing from an admin that I was justified in removing the copyrighted material will get it through their thick skulls? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 03:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should mention one of those editors, <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidpoint_f212.html" title="User:Solidpoint">User:Solidpoint</a> who was responsible for some of those claims including an edit summary accusing me of vandalism for removing the copyrighted material had this to say on a similar article: emphasis my own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*<i>"Thinly veiled listing of Pinnacle's bitch list RE: DOD testing</i> This Wiki page is a disgrace. There is nothing objective or unbiased about anything written here and I say this as a huge DragonSkin fan. If Wiki cannot police itself better than this it is not a credible source of information about anything. This page is not about DragonSkin at all. It is about the unfair way Pinnacle Armor's product was tested and the author is just grinding an axe. It is pathetic beyond description to find this sort of thing in what purports to be an Encyclopedia.

<dd>I disagree. I find it a bit hypocritical that people are unwilling to say that a user with the same apparent screen name is the same person when it comes to a copyright release, but are quite content to make that leap when blocking someone for purposeful attacks. Certainly, Solidpoint has been incivil, and should probably apologize to keep things functioning smoothly. But I have found, through my own experience, that sometimes forcing an apology does more harm than good. My impression is that Solidpoint isn't very familiar with the way we do things here, and rather than focusing on retribution, we should try and turn someone who clearly has knowledge and interest in a particular field into a valuable Wikipedian. Permanent banning isn't going to do that. Especially when there's such a clear insider/outsider dynamic as there is here, such measures are just more likely to cause anger. --<a href="../../../e/y/r/User%7EEyrian_d64b.html" title="User:Eyrian">Eyrian</a> 22:21, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow I mised all of this? Yeesh. I think this very much exemplifies the dangers inherent in offwiki groups banding together to push a POV onto their specific articles. I briefly looked through their claims on their forum about me and found so many things, for instance that I had made a diff that I didn't make, that I have never created an article of my own (<a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_%28U.S._Army%29_aba8.html" title="RSTA (U.S. Army)">RSTA (U.S. Army)</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Mine_Squadron_SEVEN_f9fe.html" title="Commander Mine Squadron SEVEN">Commander Mine Squadron SEVEN</a> that I recreated from the face of CSD death,) etc. This is a case of the things that can happen when people who do not know how wikipedia works attempt to band together and push something through through the strength of their numbers. Unfortunately, I don't have any good ideas on how to fix that. I will say that while I appreciate the apology, "Perhaps now he will find the references he so craves" makes it ring rather hollow. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 23:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The following is MY OPINION. You are permitted to reintroduce edits from a confirmed sockpuppet of a banned user. However, you should not do so using 'revert', you should introduce it as new text. Note that you will be taking full responsibility for the content, so any NPOV or uncited claims, for example, will be your responsibility to fix prior to inserting. The content will be considered to be contributed by you and you may be warned or blocked if it is inappropriate or if it is introduced in opposition to established consensus. It is important to note that you may not reinstate text that a banned user contributed <i>if the banned user has asked you to do so</i>. This would be a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. For the record, any time I revert a banned user's contributions, I welcome someone else to reinstate the changes <i>provided they accept full responsibility for them</i>.

<dd>There's no real difference, of course. But a reversion using the admin roll-back tool is pushing for a wheel war. Reintroducing the change and using an edit summary like "rvv" or the like would similarly be what I mean by a revert. The trick is that an editor must treat it as original content that they are introducing and the edit summary would reflect that. For example, when reintroducing a spelling change, the edit summary should probably read along the lines of "(m) spelling - 'happyness' to 'happiness'". The key point is that the change is treated as new rather than as a roll back to a version introduced by the banned user. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 17:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yamla's advice is ood sense. I'd also make a comment on Talk to confirm that this is what has been done. As long as the edit is good (which seems not to be in dispute) there should be no problem, and if there is I'm sure it can be fixed by rational discussion well before the publication deadline.

<p>That edit was 1) not vandalism, 2) accurate and NPOV, and 3) there is no proof that it was made by Bonaparte or any banned user. If a banned user corrects a typo and he is reverted in mass rollback, am I not allowed to revert back? Frankly, I see no difference. I would agree if it were a talkpage post or vandalism, however we're talking about an article edit which would be totally legitimate had it been made by a regular user (which there is no proof that that anon was not). Finally, is this blockable and if so how? Don't just say "disruption" - explain <i>how</i> it is "disruption". Many admins block by citing "disruption" but forget that the blocking policy specifies that such blocks are nearly always controversial.--Euthymios 17:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This isn't reverting a typo though, this is reverting to a version of the articlecreated by an Anon (with a suspiciously good understanding of Wikipedia policy) that is against the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> on the talk page.

<dd>Ok, as a very involved other use this seems to have exhausted community patience. Over 20 users endorsed the basic RfC complaint and his editing behavior changed not at all. Indeed, his main response on the RfC page was to make accusations at other editors and to assert that "JoshuaZ, the creator of this RFC/complaint page, is a evolutionists zealot and who is on a current crusade against me". At minimum the user should be put on community probation from editing all evolution related articles(as proposed by Pschemp in the RfC) and a general community ban may be more in order. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is becoming silly - the page has already been protected, blocks made on particularly aggressive users acting inappropriately.

The last time it was unprotected, I came here to protest and was informed that Wikipedia relies on editors' reverting vandalism not on protection. Well, I figure that admins who won't protect articles should do the reverting.

<p>This was moved from <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>: <i>Droliver has been vandalizing the breast implant article for months. He is a plastic surgeon who keeps adding links to promotional websites (that plastic surgeons pay to be listed on) -- thus turning this article into free ads for plastic surgeons (presumably including himself, but since I don't know his real name, I can't say for sure). What I can say with certainty is that there are numerous factual errors in his version of the article, in addition to bias. He removed research articles, FDA regulatory statements, and other information about the risks of silicone implants. The FDA now has a 40+ page "informed consent" document to warn patients about the risks, but you'd never know if from Droliver's version on Wikpedia. After reverting to his version of the article several times today, he persuaded Samir to block the article from any subsequent changes. This is all new to me, I am seeking help.

<dd>Interesting that the version locked was not the most recent, nor the most accurate. Equally interesting how vehemently the one doing the blocking defends himself. I hope that he can be as diligent in helping resolve the issues and arriving at an article that is accurate - that states the recent approval of the breast implants, along with the conditions and why they were imposed. Ditto with the recommendations. Also reading the sources would be useful, in seeing how they have been shaded or actually misstated. Rather than defending himself so, perhaps Samir can put his energies to constructive use. I not that the comment by Pascal was simply ignored by Samir and his choir. WHen an objective third party sees a problem, it would behoove the admin to pay attention.Jance 07:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've found her responses to requests for review of these blocks less than edifying. For example, after telling me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:152.91.9.144&amp;diff=86698153&amp;oldid=86683167" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:152.91.9.144&amp;diff=86698153&amp;oldid=86683167" rel="nofollow">"get [my] facts straight"</a> when I later explained that she was mistaken, she simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pschemp&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86790672" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pschemp&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86790672" rel="nofollow">removed</a> my message without comment. As is her right of course, but for the fact that making mistakes when blocking for "trolling" has fairly serious consequences, and learning from mistakes is generally a good thing.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of her blocks appear to be perfectly sound username/vandalism blocks, I'd like to see pschemp use more caution with regards to blocking for "trolling" and in particular to both use warnings before applying them and bring the block here for review. I'd also like to see a higher level of civility from her when queried.<br />

<dd>User 152.91.9.144, I'm not sure that I understand why you have created two sections here, or why you reordered the comments, repeatedly, in the previous section, or why you're taking quite such a strident tone. It may be best to present the facts dispassionately and succinctly and let the facts speak for themselves. Since those facts ARE presented, the best thing to do now is stop completely,. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 04:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Starblindy's indef block seems completly uncalled for as a result of his good contributions and nice personal comments and attitudes. Since his formation he has been a useful contributor and created 2 useful and well sourced articles. His block seems to be a rush reaction from him posting a message questioning the blocking of one user. Since that he has been considered immediatly to be a sockpuppet with no real evidence. Starblindy indef block should be reconsidered as to loose such a user would be a great upset to the wikipedia community. --87.74.17.152 09:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

In October I proposed a community ban for this editor who obsessively edits wars at <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_for_Jesus_eb46.html" title="Jews for Jesus">Jews for Jesus</a> and is uncivil (see the original post for details). Two other admins agreed to a ban and two more decided to give him one more chance at mediation, and implement the ban if he broke 1RR another time. Since then, mediation has failed, and he has not only broken 1RR multiple times, he received his second 3RR block in that time today.

<p>Well, it's that time of the year again... there are some accounts that remain unused for months, but when a certain specific issue comes up they suddenly return, make a dozen arbitrary edits and start advocating this issue. Of course we routinely discount new accounts on grounds of sockpuppetry, but these tend to slip between the bars since the account is up to several years old, it just so happens that it only edits when the issue comes up (see DRV for examples). What would be a reasonable reaction to such an account?

<p><a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">User Duja</a> is putting up the article List of Serb war criminals for deletion.

<dd>That is the purpose of AFD - to discuss whether the article should be here or not - simply posting it for deletion is not acting out of line, it is within the rules of the site. Looking at his nomination rationale and the article itself, it does indeed warrant such a discussion.

<p>Hi, I am the user in question, Rememberkigali. Please help me. I am being harassed unfairly by an admin who has blocked me without warning and is completly abusing my account.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like RadioKirk banned from editing my user-talk page because of the THREE clear violations listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a <b>seperate</b> issue, I would like either my account deleted or user talk page because of the negative attention, vandalism, and other issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>The legal implications of RadioKirk's continued potentially libelous accusations, name calling, and public harrassment merrits your full attention.</li>
<li>Please take concrete steps to settle this dispute.</li>

<li>Yadman response...please don't misunderstand...I have no time for legal bickering in courts. I think that is stupid.</li>
<li>BUT Wikipedia states that one must report ANY potentially <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libelous.html" title="Libelous">libelous</a> actions to wiki administrators because of their legal implications. While it may not be a biography of living person on which the harms occured, it still is wikipedia policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you disagree that libel must be reported for legal reasons? I think it should be. That is has to do with rememberkigali makes it more important to me.</li>

<li>"Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous." That is wiki standard. In quotes.</li>

<dd>I'll admit that my intuition is often wrong, but I can't shake the feeling that Whedonette is the incarnation of banned <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheese_Dreams_5d36.html" title="User:Cheese Dreams">User: Cheese Dreams</a>, aka <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">User:-Ril-</a>. Whedonette demonstrates an aggressive &amp; disruptive wikilawyering similar to this banned user, as well as other marked yet inconclusive similarities. Does anyone else share this intuition? Or am I simply being paranoid? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not seeing that. CheeseDreams/Ril struck me as far less assertive, far more focused on religous articles, and less intelligent. Most of all, the Ril sarcasm struck me as primarily juvenile in nature, while Whedonette's is ... sharper, more angry, more didactic. Do I find the pattern of contribution's suspicious? Yes. But until and unless I see something that falls afoul of a policy, I -- and everyone else -- should assume good faith. My take. My opinion. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 05:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I see this because I had far more interaction with CD: in her earliest incarnation, she was always eager to file a complaint with the ArbCom whenever someone crossed her. And CD had a knack for convincing a number of editors, who were normally at odds with one another, to join together &amp; complain about her -- much as Whedonette is beginning to do now.</dd>

<dd>I'll admit that "assume good faith" should be how we treat every new contributor -- yet there are times that we need to also watch them carefully. Frankly, if Whedonette <i>is</i> Cheese Dreams, but she becomes less confrontational in her future actions here, I won't mind her staying. (And if she isn't, my hope is that Whedonette simply changes her style so people like me don't associate her with a notorious, banned user.) People change, &amp; sometimes it's for the better. But sometimes it is only to change their online behavior enough to obscure their identity. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Initially there had been a long list of external links for modding the motorola razr V3, they were removed citing spam. Upon removal the vandalism started (inserting the links more than once in the page). The page was semiprotected and the vandalism stopped until Pacificamark started readding the list despite constant spam warnings and discussion on the talk page. Upon doing research for my girlfriend I went back to the first edit that he made and discovered that he added his own motorola modding link (www.hackthev3.com) When doing a google search for just "Pacificamark" the first link to pop up is hackthev3.com and when doing a little more investigating he says he's the owner of the site itself <a href="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?threadid=921556" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?threadid=921556" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> (click on "display images" if the signature doesn't appear initially).

This user has a history of getting into disputes with other editors over petty things, and making <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> edits. He approached a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violation on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season_1e0c.html" title="2006-07 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season">2006-07 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season</a> by constantly reverting a sentence about <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapid_deepening.html" title="Rapid deepening">rapid deepening</a>, and had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season/Archive_01#Current_storm_info_standard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season/Archive_01#Current_storm_info_standard" rel="nofollow">unprovoked and heated exchange</a> with the editors there after making edits that weren't within the standards of the <a href="../../../w/p/t/WP%7EWPTC_6d55.html" title="WP:WPTC">tropical cyclone WikiProject</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, he decapitalized "Southern Hemisphere" in that article, and was reverted since it is capitalized in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Hemisphere_8e3e.html" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>.

<dd>Where is the "history of getting into disputes with other editors over petty things"? And where is the history of being "problematic for a while"? There is no evidence to support either claim. I have had disagreements with <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">User: Chacor</a> twice, and Cordesat has sided with him both times, best evidenced by adding unreasonable warnings to my talk page about the three revert rule. The warnings are unreasonable because my 2000+ edits history proves that I am well aware of and have never violated that rule. Cordesat, however, keeps warning me about the rule whenever Chacor and I disagree about something. Cordesat is willing to stick a warning on my talk page after one revert but declines to stick the same warning on Chacor's talk page after he has had made two reverts. Why is that? I am truly puzzled. By the way, I changed the heading for the warning on my talk page because the warning was clearly unreasonable in my opinion. I did not edit, delete, or archive the warning itself in any way - it's still there for anyone to see.</dd>

<dd>When have I ever made a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> edit? Never. Chacor pointed out that "southern hemisphere" should be capitalized because the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Hemisphere_8e3e.html" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> capitalizes the term. When I went over to the article, I noticed that "southern hemisphere" was capitalized sometimes and not capitalized other times. In other words, the article was internally inconsistent. I fixed this problem and made the capitalization of that term consistent with ordinary usage. Despite my explanation, Cordesat persists in claiming that my fixes were <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Why is he not assuming my good faith <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in making these edits? And even if both "Southern Hemisphere" and "southern hemisphere" were stylistically acceptable, which they are not, note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Disputes_over_style_issues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Disputes_over_style_issues" rel="nofollow">the obligation of editors to ensure that articles are internally consistent about style issues</a>.</dd>

<dd>The problem I encountered about the standards of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season_1e0c.html" title="2006-07 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season">2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season</a> is that no one would tell me what the standards were. They just kept saying that I violated them. I repeatedly asked to be told the standards and was ignored for 3 days. Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season/Archive_01#Current_storm_info_standard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season/Archive_01#Current_storm_info_standard" rel="nofollow">discussion page that Cordesat cites</a> to see how perplexed I was.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "rapid deepening" issue, I reverted a change twice, discussed my logic for doing so each time, and tried (but failed) to understand the logic of Chacor for opposing the change. Cordesat's characterization of my actions as "repeatedly" is at least a slight exaggeration, as is his claim that I got into an "unprovoked and heated exchange" with "editors." The disagreement was not "unprovoked," was not uncivil, and was with only two editors: Chacor and Cordesat himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would ordinarily assume good faith about Cordesat's complaints, but I think the evidence supports the conclusion that this whole thing is nothing more than harrassment of me for trying to improve an article that Chacor and Cordesat have long been associated with. For example, look at my talk page and you will see a comment from Cordesat about how the author of an article is entitled to decide whether certain edits are acceptable. In this context, i.e., more than a mere disagreement about two acceptable styles, that's an incorrect reflection of Wikipedia policy about authors and editors not "owning" articles. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 09:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is an uncivil comment if there ever were one. Honestly, I am not trying to cause disruption anywhere on Wikipedia, and I think an objective look at my edit history would prove it. I am simply trying to improve articles and fix problems where I see them.

<dd>If I may give my opinion, from what I read it appears that <i>Tennis expert</i> engaged in edits that did not meet the agreed upon standard of inclusion of various sources and he was wrong in being persistent with his edits. Also the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Hemisphere_8e3e.html" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> edits show no evidence of it being "internally inconsistent" as described by him. But nevertheless this <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2006-07_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season_Archive_01_97ec.html#Current_storm_info_standard" title="Talk:2006-07 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season/Archive 01">discussion</a> does not appear to have any "unprovoked and heated exchange" described by <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a>. The 3RR warning seem like they might have been a little premature at times due to the users frustration with him. I would conclude that <i>Tennis expert</i> is quite persistent in pushing what he seems is right and editing to make a point instead of sticking to discussion. If <i>Tennis expert</i> indeed sees no sense in the agreed upon guidelines yet, as his comments suggest, I would urge <i>Tennis expert</i> to take a break from editing this subject and let things cool down, and then get into an editless discussion until things are cleared out. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 17:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just getting really concerned that the denizens of WikiProjects have decided on rules that they expect every other editor to abide by, in violation of Wikipedia editing policy.

<p>It's not about us "owning" the article, but when there are conventions set, one expects someone new not to just butt in, but rather to discuss possible changes. The conventions are accepted and followed by every member of the wikiproject; why should we let someone who isn't part and just has a trivial interest in that article break it as he wishes, then when confronted about it say something to the lines of "I don't like it, it's not good, change it"? It is equivalent of someone new joining wikipedia, making personal attacks, and when warned saying "therefore, your policy is wrong, change it" - this policy has been agreed on by consensus. The wikiproject covers all TC articles, it is ridiculous to say that we can't set minimum acceptable standards for articles we cover. I would say we have one of the highest turnover rates for high-quality new articles, and that's thanks a lot to our expectations. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 00:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you know I have just a "trivial" interest in the topic? When have you asked me about my level of interest? Unlike you, I don't profess to know your state of mind, so perhaps you truly don't believe you "own" the article. But when a new-to-the-article editor makes a change and in response you curtly tell the editor to "learn the standards" and then refuse to divulge those standards while continuing to publicly berate the editor about not knowing the standards, you are de facto exercising "ownership" of the article. When you refuse to discuss improving the standards of an article with an editor despite being asked to engage in a discussion of them, you are de facto exercising "ownership" of both the article and the standards. When you refuse to discuss the logical basis of the existing standards of an article with an editor while publicly berating the editor for wanting to improve them, you are de facto exercising "ownership" of both the article and the standards. And equating anything I've done with making personal attacks, as your last post appears to be doing, violates innumerable Wikipedia policies, foremost among them are civility and assuming good faith. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 19:31, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Verily uncandy Block occassioned by what I believe is revenge. A nomination that appears to be based on pure prejucial facts, such as cplot's previous track 3RR record of being blocked. I hope Mongo will have the decency to realize that he is only making the situation worse and is not only avoiding the main issue but violating <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html" title="WP:Block">WP:Block</a>.

<p>I have extended Cplots block to indefinite due to him using IP's to evade the block. Ip's and Cplot make the same spelling errors, and there is of course a list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Cplot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Cplot" rel="nofollow">Cplot socks</a>--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also have to say that looking at the list of suspected CPlot sockpuppets, you're not getting Cplot or me. You're just casting a wide net that will hurt other Wikipedia contributors. It would be better for the Wikipedia community to just come to an amicable solution to this dispute. There's a lot of IPs out there. I don't know exactly how many, but it's a lot. And I don't care which one I use. On the other hand, you have not identified any that CPlot uses. How about next time I use Mongo's IP address. Which one are you using Mongo. I'll use that to post next time. --68.30.199.11 08:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Agree</b>, I second travb suggestion. I believe there is grounds for an RFC based on the lack of wikipedia civility. (see comments at <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">user:MONGO</a> talk page for more information on the abuse of <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html" title="WP:Block">WP:Block</a>.) I can definatelly sympathise if cplot is suckpepetteering. However, there may be grounds to extend the current block if he is. Nevertheless the alleged sockpuppets is all a secondary matter... and again prejucidial information that should not be considered for the original block. I have investigated the communications between cplot and MONGO and I believe MONGO has abused his administrive powers because of his lack of civility towards cplot and then his biased controversial block, which violates WP:Block rule. Currently I have tried negotions with MONGO as a neutral party and this doesn't appear to be working. As part of my AMA affiliation and ethics to WP:DR and wikirules, I will need to follow through with all the necessary steps.--74.101.14.217 16:50, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has been a problem once before when MONGO wanted to have an article call some people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59109112" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=59109112" rel="nofollow">"conspiracy theorists"</a>, another user reverted that as not being neutral, and MONGO blocked them and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APokipsy76&amp;diff=59307959&amp;oldid=59307208" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APokipsy76&amp;diff=59307959&amp;oldid=59307208" rel="nofollow">threatened</a> to reblock for a week if the user reverted him again. In that case there was not even a thin justification like this 'threat of violence with Occam's razor'... rather a direct statement that he would use his admin position to 'win' the content dispute. While the community largely gave him a pass (incorrectly IMO as that block threat was beyond the pale) there was a general agreement that he should refrain from admin actions/threats for disputes he is involved in. This current incident seems to be very much along the same lines. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody is saying anything like "all Russian are evil", quite to the contrary the vast majority of Russians are really decent people, just like the vast majority of people of any nationality. The problem is that a small but aggressive minority of Russians refuses to accept the crimes committed by their country. Right now, right here a group of Russians is trying to remove the category tag from Holodomor so that people won't find information about the event when they browse the category, this however is only a small organized group and on the Russian Wikipedia which contains a much more representative cross section of the Russian society the article is present in <a href="../../../../ru/%D0%B3/%D0%B5/%D0%BD/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%7E%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B4_7b17.html" class="extiw" title="ru:Категория:Геноцид">ru:Категория:Геноцид</a> (a permalink to the article before this happens <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5&amp;oldid=2464002" class="external autonumber" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5&amp;oldid=2464002" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>).

<p>Dear anon (193.219.28.146 - please consider registering), I have to agree with Amarkov that this is the wrong place to bring the issue up.

Finally, remember that a key policy of Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>: if scholars disagree whether the event can be classified as a genocide or not, then this should be noted in the article, and also note our guidelines for categories (at <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a>) state that: 'Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category.'

<p>User:203.36.224.162 has added to multiple articles on drugs external links to GlaxoSmithKlein Australia webpages for the drug. Yet all the articles already contain one link to GSK's description of their product, namely their American website fork. We surely do not need to link to every webfork page GSK maintains for each country across the world? (No I'm not being pro-US here, as a British citizen I feel no desire nor need to add additional links to GSK's UK fork too) Adding such multiple links seems inappropriate and spamming (unless of course the regulatiom or licensing in one country for a particular drug is notably different).</p>

<dd>Procedure-wise things seem to have been done properly, as the terms of your probation does indeed state that you are placed on Probation and that you may be banned from any article or sets of articles for disruptive edits. A discussion here would be good concerning the article ban, though, as, while it is only for a week, at a glance I cannot find extensive editing or disruption on <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">far right</a> by you.

<dd>(ec) I haven't looked into the actual situation at <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a>, but it looks like other people have. From reading the arbcom decision, such a ban is entirely in line if you've been disruptively editing. Tom Harrison seems to have explained himself at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Intangible_92fa.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Intangible">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible#Log_of_blocks_and_bans</a> which is the right place- he even linked to discussion of the issue. The arbcom decision specifically says "He may be banned for appropriate periods from any article or set of articles for disruptive edits." Also I object to your description of the ban as "unilateral"- he posted his suggestion for others to review a day before taking any action. I'm not sure I see your cause for complaint here. I also note that you're objecting to various side-issues here, rather than saying you were not being disruptive. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but you seem like you're being a bit <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENSE_4967.html" title="WP:DENSE">dense</a> to me. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An article ban under a probation must be for good cause.

<dd>Yep, just an arbitrary, capricious, and unilateral ban, because I was bored and looking for trouble.

I have always abided by the terms of my probation, namely to refrain from edit warring. Again, what specific edit is disruptive? What Wikipedia policy is being violated? There is a content dispute, and that's why I put a POV to an article, and put forth an argument on the article's talk page based on reputable third party sources. This is not a crime, and I should not be banned for that, certainly not when no counter-arguments has been provided by other Wikipedia editors, not even <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">User:Cberlet</a>.

<dd>I have other issues with Cberlet's conduct, but this is not the place for it, and I do not agree with every complaint he has made about you. In this case, if reliable and notable sources (media, politicians, political scientists) decide to call a party "Far Right," "Far Left," or even "Stinky cheese", then we can report that as long as it is clear we are reporting the views of others with sources. If you do not accept this and continue to fight the issue after the 5 day ban expires, it will probably be extended. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:59, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two points. There is no context in the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">far right</a> article. Why is the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_Canada_d10e.html" title="Reform Party of Canada">Reform Party of Canada</a> called "far right" by Ignazi? One does not obtain the information from the article, which makes it a bad article, since Wikipedia articles all should be stand-alone. But, I guess, next time I'll put a tag to the article and mention this point on the talk page I'm gonna be banned even more. So this is all simply mute. The next point, is also related to the first one. If all significant points of view are to be mentioned in an article, they should at least provide for some context. The introduction of an article is unlikely to be place to provide for such a context. What help is a newspaper or scholarly article labelling a party "far right," when that newspaper does not provide for any reason thereto? This is simply dishonest referencing, and not worthy of a serious encyclopedia that Wikipedia tries to be. Intangible 14:43, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

Not to take sides with either Whedonette or Yuser31415, I'll just say that a) sarcasm is hardly the type of thing that needs to be resolved here, or at all; and b) that if anything, Whedonette is the one who could be making a complaint here regarding borderline incivility. However, I really don't see any situation at all that needs intervention, but you're free to look and make your own decision. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 04:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that being intensely sarcastic and aggressive is not something for Admins to concern themselves over. But as my previous section says, there is something deeply suspicious about someone who knows so much about Wikipedia and its policies that from Day 1 they MfDed everything they didn't like. I was here three months before I knew enough to AfD something, let alone how to dispute the nuances of policy. This person should not know so much so soon. Also, her responses to allegations to sockpuppetry are all "This is the only account I edit under" - that would make sense if she has been blocked in a previous one. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 09:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I am well aware we have a big note that '<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Personal attacks</a> should be reported at the <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">personal attack intervention noticeboard</a>'.

I <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html#User:Ghirlandajo_and_User:Piotrus" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">explained on his talk page</a> (technical note: if the link does not take you directly to the relevant discussion, scroll down, the thread name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=91176271&amp;oldid=91174239" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AShell_Kinney&amp;diff=91176271&amp;oldid=91174239" rel="nofollow">has been changed in a less then friendly way...</a>) why I believe WP:PAIN is the right place to pursue it (all steps of DR has been tried with the exception of ArbCom) and asked him to reinstate the thread there for a second opinion; he declined suggesting ArbCom or WP:ANI. I am thus following his advice with the following question for the community: with all due respect to Shell Kinney, I believe the case I reported to WP:PAIN was rather straightforward (I and User:Constanz where accused of trolling and vandalism (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;oldid=91140458" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;oldid=91140458" rel="nofollow">here</a> for diffs), thus either we are trolls/vandals to be blocked or <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">User:Ghirlandajo</a> who calls us those names should be warned/blocked for incivility). I don't deny that there is potential for further disupute resolution, but I don't think that if a there is a conflict between users (with a potential for a DR in the future...) users involved in this conflict gain immunity from <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>/<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and thus their offences are not egligible for report at <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>. In other words, I think the case should be heard on the basis of whether Ghirlandajo violated those policies or not, not on the basis whether <i>in addition</i> to reporting I should consider further WP:DR or not.

<dd>Ghirla, what 'unspeakable offences'? I just quoted your posts from my talk page.

I don't see why I should reply to your series of personal attacks lacking a single diff on my talk page, especially as you habitually remove my comments from your talk page. I asked the community for input - please don't attempt to 'sweep the issue under the carpet', to use your phrase, by telling readers of ANI this issue is discussed elsewhere or that the community has already passed a verdict.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 19:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Piotrus has this habit of seeking the upper hand in <i>content</i> disputes through achieving the blocks of his opponets, particularly by inciting <i>others</i> to do the dirty work (so the request above with his own name signed is rather atypical). Further, user likes to portray the content disputes as civility issues while he supported me when I condemned such approach when a similar attack was mounted on his friend user:Halibbut (Multiple editors annoyed by Halibutt's POVness mounted a civility attack at that time and I called to go back to the core of the issues, tha call Piotrus supported expressing double standards). The endless crusade this user carries is moved by him between multiple pages, article's space discussions, edit summary fields, user talk space, Wikipedia space and even the DYK page. User needs to be told to take a Wikibreak/cool it and return to creating encyclopedia rather than running extermination campaigns and attempts to involve others in them. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:23, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Personally I have no idea why Piotr spoke in favor of Ghirlandajo at Ghirla's RFAr. Clearly it wasn't for the gratitude. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 19:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, I have long ago learned that offering criticism is not a way to earn gratitude and make many friends. On a minor note: <s>there was no Ghirla's RfArb,</s> although there has been a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ghirlandajo_3146.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ghirlandajo">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ghirlandajo</a> which we begun with 'User:Ghirlandajo is a great guy' - is this the case you are reffering to? I have never denied that Ghirladnajo is a very active and prolific contributor, and I have pointed that out in several controversial cases, but unfortunatly, I think it is obvious Ghirlandajo is also an editor with little regard for civlity (as noted in RfC and many other cases, his block lock including) - and no matter how active an editor one is, that person must be held to the same standards as the rest of us.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 20:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I regret to say that I, too, have had a less than ideal experience interacting with Ghirlandajo.

I was unable to engage him in discussion on the talk page and was instead faced with impolite edit summaries (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_Expedition_to_Kiev&amp;diff=87719826&amp;oldid=86486996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_Expedition_to_Kiev&amp;diff=87719826&amp;oldid=86486996" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_Expedition_to_Kiev&amp;diff=88175603&amp;oldid=88055039" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_Expedition_to_Kiev&amp;diff=88175603&amp;oldid=88055039" rel="nofollow">2</a>).

I also rolled back their two edits that hadn't been rolled back.

<dd>It's not as if he has a case. Internet harassment is only if we constantly e-mail him with rude and/or threatening letters.. as it is, people are just enforcing the rules, and he's subjecting himself to this voluntarily..

<p>Hello, I created the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_War_of_1812_books_7448.html" title="List of War of 1812 books">List of War of 1812 books</a> to shorten the book list at the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> article, then an editor <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> moved the article to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812_bibliography.html" title="War of 1812 bibliography">War of 1812 bibliography</a> without any attempt at discussion or posting a rename +tag. I put the article back to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_War_of_1812_books_7448.html" title="List of War of 1812 books">List of War of 1812 books</a> and left a polite message on his talk page advising him of the rules. However, again he simply recreated the list at <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812_bibliography.html" title="War of 1812 bibliography">War of 1812 bibliography</a>. Now there are two identical articles, would you kindly intervene and ask the editor to post his rename +tag at the original article location and wait for input and a consensus. This will avoid an edit war. Thank you <a href="../../../o/c/t/User%7EOctopus-Hands_81c0.html" title="User:Octopus-Hands">Octopus-Hands</a> 22:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
