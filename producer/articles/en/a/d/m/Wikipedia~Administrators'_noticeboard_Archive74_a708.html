<p>There is a hotly contested template at <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template%7E911ct.html" title="Template:911ct">Template:911ct</a>. There is a discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:911ct#Now_the_TfD_is_over_let_us_settle_this_template.27s_form_and_function" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:911ct#Now_the_TfD_is_over_let_us_settle_this_template.27s_form_and_function" rel="nofollow">here</a> over aspects of naming the template. That discussion has pretty much run its course, and we need an experienced editor, probably an admin, who has not edited any 9/11 articles, and who will look at the arguments over naming with a wholly impartial eye, and bring formal closure to the debate, ideally with a rationale.</p>
<p>The template is currently locked to prevent edit warring. I believe that the result of the debate will allow it to be unlocked and we all hope that people on either side will acknowledge and work within consensus.</p>

He has been warned twice, and reported twice in the past 24 hours, but apparently, no admin wants to be the one to deliver the death sentence to this pest. The reportings simply were not acted on.

<p>I understand not blocking IPs indefinitely, but how are we to be protected from this vandal otherwise? The vandal has not shown one ounce of good faith. The IP address has been static ever since he/she began vandalizing, and the user did not use another account or IP address to vandalize during any of the blocks, which seems to indicate that he/she either cannot switch IPs, or has been permanently banned in the past from creating a Wikipedia account. This is why I don't understand the Wikipedia policy of allowing anonymous users to edit. Anybody can create an account, and if it was required, the whole issue of IPvandals would disappear. -- <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaich_46f1.html" title="User:Elaich">Elaich</a> 07:19, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not blocking IPs indefinitely does not mean one can't block IPs for a long time.

<dd>I changed this block to six months. The longest I've ever heard of for an IP is one year. I imposed one of those: a static IP with a long history of vandalism posted a suicide note to the site. So I looked up the location and filed a report with the Pennsylvania state police. (Was it trolling? A troubled teenager? I didn't know, but it seemed like the right thing to do and people supported me.) Shortly afterward the vandalism resumed. So okay, this person didn't eat a loaded revolver, but my tolerance sank right down to zero. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 21:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-:) A bot <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7ESTBot_bbca.html" title="User:STBot">User:STBot</a> is changing multiple articles however many of these changes are wrong. The owner is offline and I wish until he came online someone stop the bot. The problem is that bot is claiming articles related to Afghanistan which have nothing to do with Afghanistan. For example these are <b>101%</b> Pakistani thing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_and_Staff_College_b1b3.html" title="Command and Staff College">Command and Staff College</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balochistan_Engineering_College_a675.html" title="Balochistan Engineering College">Balochistan Engineering College</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balochistan_University_of_Engineering_and_Technology_8515.html" title="Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology">Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology</a>, <a href="../../../g/w/a/Gwadar_International_Airport_7031.html" title="Gwadar International Airport">Gwadar International Airport</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barkhan_District_8b6a.html" title="Barkhan District">Barkhan District</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulistan_%28Pakistan%29_2d75.html" title="Gulistan (Pakistan)">Gulistan (Pakistan)</a> <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balochistan_University_of_Engineering_and_Technology_8515.html" title="Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology">Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohlu_District_c62a.html" title="Kohlu District">Kohlu District</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetta_Electric_Supply_Company_e7bc.html" title="Quetta Electric Supply Company">Quetta Electric Supply Company</a> and many many more. Similarly many other mistakes by bot for example <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiest_sites_in_Islam_6614.html" title="Holiest sites in Islam">Holiest sites in Islam</a> are now in Afghanistan project. I know if you look in more detail you will find kind of mistakes made by the bot and it is still runing.

<dd>Hm. Grunt.

<dd>Well, I run a similar bot. But in this case, the owner seems to have picked up entirely irrelevant categories. I guess they just need to be more careful while picking categories for tagging — <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hi! All the articles were directly in a category listed at <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_AfghanistanSandbox_ecbf.html" title="User:ST47/AfghanistanSandbox">User:ST47/AfghanistanSandbox</a>, and the bot run was requested at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTREQ_4084.html#Afghanistan_articles" title="WP:BOTREQ">WP:BOTREQ#Afghanistan_articles</a>, the wikiproject people, who know a lot more than my geographically-challenged mind, looked through that list and fixed it, and I have no clue what category those other articles came from, but I've never had articles just appear before. <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 13:29, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest picking up the categories more carefully. The damage is caused by irrelevant subcategories that may have more than one parent cat. For example, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulistan_%28Pakistan%29_2d75.html" title="Gulistan (Pakistan)">Gulistan (Pakistan)</a> which is in <a href="../../../q/i/l/Category%7EQilla_Abdullah_District_e489.html" title="Category:Qilla Abdullah District">Category:Qilla Abdullah District</a>. If you go about 4-5 categories up in the hierarchies, one of the parent cats is somehow related to Afghanistan. The project people need to give you much better categorisation. A similar solution is need for the Spain tagging too. I am unblocking the bot for now, but please discuss with the project people before you resume the tagging. And please undo the tagging that has been done so far as it will need a bot to undo — <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Film producer <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Murphy_9357.html" title="Don Murphy">Don Murphy</a> has recently expressed an interest in "purchasing" an admin. This request was removed from his board when <a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKynn_59bb.html" title="User:Kynn">User:Kynn</a> found out about it. Mr. Murphy has reposted his request here: <a href="http://www.donmurphy.net/board/showthread.php?t=17170" class="external text" title="http://www.donmurphy.net/board/showthread.php?t=17170" rel="nofollow">Shitapedia- Updated</a>. A member of his forum apparently has an admin who is willing to be bought out. This really isn't a problem if the admin does decide to allow his account to be used, he would most likely be blocked from editing indefinatly.

<dd>I was just looking at his message board and neither the person who apparently knows an admin nor Mr. Murphy have posted again. I think it is resonable to assume that they are continuing their dealings through e-mail. While the account can be bought, they are unlikely to have the skills to do any lasting damage. We can hope that the admin has good character and refuses the offer. If I knew how to, I would certainly take it to WMF, but I doubt they could do much about it. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Gronowski_08ac.html" title="User:Philip Gronowski"><font color="OliveDrab"><b>Philip</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Gronowski_f606.html" title="User talk:Philip Gronowski"><font color="OliveDrab"><b>Gronowski</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philip_Gronowski_acda.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philip Gronowski"><font color="OliveDrab">Contribs</font></a></sup> 19:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>Seems sensible to add</dt>
<dd>There was a significant change to <a href="../../../d/p/p/WP%7EDPP_9a13.html" title="WP:DPP">WP:DPP</a> this weekend, relative to templates tagged with {{<a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EInterwikitmp-grp_beba.html" title="Template:Interwikitmp-grp">interwikitmp-grp</a>}}, as I'm fairly sure editing the latter on the last two occasions locked the data-base for a time... a geometric propagation effect of so many tools templates in wide use being tagged and exported to our under manned sister projects.<br />
<br />
For those unfamilar, this is the best online discription of the proto-project <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2007_January_15_2c56.html#.5B.5BTemplate:Interwikitmp-grp.5D.5D" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 January 15">currently available</a>. Now that it's moving out of experimentation into minimal implementation, I'll be innaugerating a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_template_sharing_7d60.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject template sharing">project page <b>(just in!!!)</b></a>... and this is and would be an assist in freeing up time for that. The specialist normally editing many sisters are both undermanned and have not our wide deep pool of template coders, and viewing some of their VP posts (<i>How can I do this...</i> stuff) is eye-opening, as are the responses.<br />
<br />
If some have a moment to assist in adding the 'doc page pattern' technique to such tools templates, especially the protected templates, this will be a big help in innoculating (preventing) the system from such server loads. The {{<a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EInterwiki_doc_page_pattern_b151.html" title="Template:Interwiki doc page pattern">interwiki doc page pattern</a>}} subst'd gives a boilerplate on the /doc page, so only a little cutting and pasting is needed to achieve a permanent fix.<br />

<p>Hello. GT, Pat, Duja and the crew normally do stellar work in keeping the requested move page flowing but the girth of recent move request have put a bit of a backlog on the page and I hope that other admins could help tackle it.

It been open for 10 days now and has been suprisingly contentious despite having a grand total of 6 editors commenting on it. This is the second move request on this page within a month.

<p>For some time now, I have been telling Dutch vandals in Dutch not to vandalise Wikipedia. See for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:145.102.0.32&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105785636" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:145.102.0.32&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105785636" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:80.127.41.119&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104846350" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:80.127.41.119&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104846350" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:80.200.248.46&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101184748" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:80.200.248.46&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101184748" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. I believe that addressing a vandal in his or her own language has a better chance to get the message across. A problem with this, however, is that admins who do not speak Dutch will not be able to see that the vandal has been warned before. Could standardized templates in other languages (for instance test-nl, test-es, test-fr, test-fy, test-bg etc.) help overcome this problem? The vandal will be addressed in his/her own language, and other admins will be able to see which warning has been issued. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Brievenbus</a></sup> 13:03, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I sometimes warn in the vandal's own language, so I agree that such warnings work better than doing so in English. I'd think that it's clear from context that the warning is a warning, but perhaps adding <code>&lt;!--Test1 warning--&gt;</code> or whatever it is from the actual warning templates might be useful and less trouble? <b>〈<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RED</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="red">VEЯS</font></a>〉</b> 13:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's a decent idea, but is it worth remembering that if someone is unable to speak English, they probably shouldn't be editing en.wikipedia in the first place?

<dd>It's not inability to speak English, rather English being a second language.

He was previously banned due to legal threats but has returned and is almost as combative as before.</p>
<p>RTR is the head of a very small film production company, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_2593.html" title="American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a> (AMBC), which is the main focus of his editing.

In the course of his editing RTR has attacked the purported agendas of other editors and claimed harassment(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_AMBC_4e1a.html#Accusations_about_other_editors" title="User:Will Beback/AMBC">#</a>, <a href="http://www.familyfirst.com/american_mutoscope_and_biograp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.familyfirst.com/american_mutoscope_and_biograp.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>), made demands, and issued legal threats to other editors (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_AMBC_4e1a.html#Legal_threats" title="User:Will Beback/AMBC">#</a>) (one of which resulted in the ban of an earlier account (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:AMBC" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:AMBC" rel="nofollow">#</a>)).

<p>First, I apologize for the lengthy posting. I am a film fan/historian. I am from NYC and now live in Los Angeles. I am new to Wikipedia and thought it would be a good source to contribute pertinent information on film history and its companies. I thought it would be fun, and I was in for a great surprise and disappointment. I was to start from the beginning, which was <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaumont.html" title="Gaumont">Gaumont</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathe.html" title="Pathe">Pathe</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_2593.html" title="American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a>. The third article mentioned and its discussions intrigued me and after looking at it further the article looked mauled at best. I then continued on the "Sprouts" which were the people involved and its history. by this I mean attempting to contribute to the information. By doing this triggered a controversy worse than the 1950's McCarthy hearings. Every little thing I did with this article was questioned and scrutinized. This can be seen by going to all talk pages on the subject. With time allowance, I then tried to study and learn about Wiki-Policies and protocol. I am thorough and attempted to follow this in good faith. However, I was constantly confronted by -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> and a coalition that is and has been in contact with. I decided that along with my other contributions not to edit <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_2593.html" title="American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a>, this controversial article but to "Tag" this and attempt to bring in other neutral editors for their contribution which was according to Wiki-Policies.</p>
<p>Here comes the rub. I was accused by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> of being a member of the new company mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Mutoscope_and_Biograph_Company_2593.html" title="American Mutoscope and Biograph Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a> article. I responded of course and even contacted an AMA advocate <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis">Tutmosis</a> since I knew no one on Wikipedia. I even had no problem with removing the "Dispute" tag, but I wanted other contributing editors to come onboard.</p>

<p>Hi, we are having trouble with a disruptive editor at <a href="../../../u/n/w/Unwinnable.html" title="Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. The user seems to be playing a game of revert-war over the article - every single edit is reverted to his <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> version. In an attempt to close the issue, we logged a case at <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>(third opinion) and the decision was in our favour (see <a href="../../../u/n/w/Talk%7EUnwinnable_0aab.html#Third_opinion" title="Talk:Unwinnable">Talk:Unwinnable#Third opinion</a>), and we assumed this would be an end to the issue.</p>
<p>However, the disruptive editor returned today and started reverting the 3O implementation again. He has been blocked for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> once previously over this page, and whenever there are attempts to engage him on his talk page, all the warning templates are instantly removed. (see the history of <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProsfilaes_b44c.html" title="User talk:Prosfilaes">User_talk:Prosfilaes</a>). The user seems less concerned with the welfare of the article (he has now slapped an "OR" banner on the page in a fit of pique) and more concerned with "winning a battle" (the wikipedia-as-MMORPG mentality).</p>
<p>Its hard to know how to proceed in this situation as the dispute resolution has already been done, but the user won't accept the result.

<dd>I admit that I have been stressed and inappropriately using reverts, and need to stop that behavior.

<p>Over at <a href="../../../k/j/%C3%A1/Kj%C3%A1rr.html" title="Kjárr">Kjárr</a>, a budding edit war broke, so I protected <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/the_wrong_version" class="extiw" title="m:the_wrong_version">m:the wrong version</a> and left a note to that effect on the talk page.</p>
<p>Followed an email exchange with <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">User:berig</a>. I'd like to state first that email seeming unnecessary here doesn't put me in an extremely agreeable mood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for protecting that KjÃ¡rr article and for showing that the referenced version of the article is the wrong version.<br />
<br />
It is obvious that I was wrong in believing that it was the referenced information that should stay. FYI, Dusis was getting back at me for losing a discussion we had had on the Scandinavia article.<br />
<br />
I am so insulted, that you will not see me around anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to stick to the fact in my answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The wrong version" is a satirical page. I use it whenever I protect a page because when a page is protected, someone will inevitably be displeased.<br />
<br />
I do not care for the content dispute or any previous relationship you might have had with this user. Revert or edit warring on <i>any</i> article instead of calmly debating the question on the talk page is, and will aways considered harmful to the encyclopedia. <i>That</i> was the reason why the "wrong version" was protected.<br />
<br />
If you can't understand that such behavior is a problem and that we do have a dispute resolution process (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution</a>), go ahead and leave. I'm not going to run after you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I don't take very kindly to threaths to leave when the matter is at best a misunderstanding. At this point, Berig switched to french, and the next messages are translations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you'd taken the time to look at the article, you'd have understood that Dusis was changing cited information. In addition, your compatriot<small>(I have no idea why that came up,as I had never came across Dusis before)</small> didn't listen to my arguments, and in one edit he reverted, I had added information the importance of which he insisted on.<br />
<br />
I don't create articles like these, on which I work hard, tobe treated like a troll. I hope you understand that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now saying that I wasn't annoyed would be a lie, but I still tried to correct the user assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the content was orwas not cited does not matter to me. If editors cannot solve their disagreements via discussion, it is perfectly reasonable to impose a cool down period to the article itself, and as I just said, in such a dispute, one side is guaranteed to be in disagreementwith the results. That's why <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a> says:: "Protection is <b>not an endorsement of the current version</b>". In fact that<small>(imposing a cool down period)</small> is the administrators' duty. ("A temporary full-protection is used for enforcing a "cool down" period to stop an edit war.")<br />
<br />
If my tone might have seemed condescending at one step or the oter, I am sorry for that. I normaly try toavoid personal involvement whenever a protection is necessary, and an email like that is not particularly constructive when it comes to theactual problem; that is, whwther or not reliable sources confirm or not that Kjárr is a representation of Caesar.<br />
<br />
If Dusis is stalkingyou, I don't mind looking into that allegations (but I don't have the time right now<small>because I was at a friend's house without my usual browser and just looking my mail</small>) I couldn't have know:I only saw an edit war, and acted on that specific situation. If that is not the first incident involvingyou two,maybe a Requestfor comment or one formediation are appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All thta was to no avail, however. Looks like we can add a French-Canadian Cabal to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_cabals_c46f.html" title="Wikipedia:List of cabals">List</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I wrote a lot of articles about nordic myths because few people are working on it(and are really interested in it).<br />
<br />
As you can see on my user page, a few people have left signs of their appreciation of my work.<br />
<br />
However, I feel like I'm at the end of the road A French-Canadian gets angry at me for telling him we must respect information from reliable sources of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. then he starts ruining information at Kjárr that I worked hard to source properly. Then a French-Canadian admin protects the page in the version of the French-Canadian and tells me he wants to stop an edit war. That's the fastest protection I ever saw. I can't see why I would continue writing articles whe stalkers are helped by compatriot admins like this. I'm done with Wikipedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entitlement almost made me laugh. I told him in my first message: I wouldn't run after him. SoI didn't answer. However, I'd still like to have others' opinion here. (I think the protection of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjee.html" title="Banjee">Banjee</a> was pretty rapid too, for the records.)<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 17:09, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you could have used different wording than "the wrong version" in the protection log; it's a fairly inappropriate place for satire, especially when it's highly unlikely that editors in the dispute will understand and/or find it amusing. As for the accusations of a cabal; I wouldn't worry about it. Some editors just don't get the point that not everyone is out to get them; it might be worth explaining one more time, simply, that the protection action is neutral, and until all editors involved can learn to see things from more than their own perspective, or at least withhold their editing until they can, the page will be protected. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 17:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only information I'd add to the above is, that if someone deliberately changes cites, or verified information, to read <i>deliberately incorrectly</i> (as opposed to different emphasis or something thats a legitimate editorial issue) - for example they change a quote or a fact that the citation shows a different thing for -- then that may be held to be vandalism, not bona fide editing. Correcting obvious vandalism is outside 3RR and "wrong version", because one isn't aren't taking a stance in an edit war by doing so, you are fixing a vandalized quote. I know this since we had the same problem on <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_Retriever_e5a5.html" title="Labrador Retriever">Labrador Retriever</a> a month ago -- reverting the vandalised quote was not considered preferential treatment of a version or 3RR violation, but repair of vandalism, which may be done whether the article is blocked or otherwise.</dd>

<dd>Actually, CFD/W already serves both renaming and clearing purposes I believe. The bots just run down the list and do whatever unless it says 'NO BOTS'.

<p>I came across James E. Sabow through a mention on Jimbo's talk page, but I'm on deadline and haven't the time to do anything about it - it definitely needs some extra eyes, though.

<p>The general concensus source would be the large critic's website called Rotten Tomatoes. This website includes all the respected, major movie critics citing their publications. In your career section, discussing the movie Derailed, Jennifer Aniston did not receive "much praise" for... "doing it well" from the greater majority. The reviews of her performance were scathing by almost all (90%+) the professional critics; largely stating she was miss cast and out of her element and ability.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Journalist2 (<a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist2_0dc7.html" title="User talk:Journalist2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist2_cca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist2">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I was just wondering (there is probably a page out there that'll tell me, I know... sorry) why Wikipedia allows edits from those without a username? Surely a large percentage of vandalism would dissapear if only registered users could edit pages. Registering isn't a labourious task but it is enough of a task to weed out those who vandalise on a whim... Those who are more hard-core can easily be blocked and investigated for sock puppetry. I'm just wondering as I've been spotting (due to having contributed in the talk pages of, reverted vandalism on random pages searches of or have contributed to the pages of several articles and therefore have them on my watchlist) a fair bit of vandalism recently and it is nearly always IPs doing it.</p>
<p>Is there a good reason for continuing to allow IP edits? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanD_76a4.html" title="User:AlanD">AlanD</a> 00:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If he is sure he wants to leave Wikipedia for awhile, I will be glad to facilitate (and if he is not sure he wanted to leave Wikipedia for awhile, he's about <i>thisclose</i> to someone proposing a community ban anyway). This user unfortunately does not appear to be suited for this project at this time. Given that this is a minor editing under his real name (not just disclosing it once on a userpage, but actually signing with the name), and that his checkered record here will come back to haunt him years from now when someone on a college admissions committee or something does a Google search, I think allowing a vanishing would definitely be in order, with the understanding that he is to allow an appropriate period of time (I suggest three months minimum) before returning under a new username, which would be confided to a trusted admin or two, before quietly starting over. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

Most of my interaction with his has been to attempt to persuade him that listing his email address and/or telephone number is a very bad idea and that he should consider editing under a pseudonym. I fully endorse him disappearing, but would ask that he be counseled to seek advice from an experienced user if and when he chooses to join us again. Mind you, even if he doesn't I suspect he will come to our attention before too long. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 07:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>As previously discussed on this board, I have had problems with A Man in Black. I ended the image debate as it was clearly never going to go anywhere. Today, an article I worked very hard on, <a href="../../../k/x/g/KXGN_847f.html" title="KXGN">KXGN</a>, was messed up entirely by A Man in Black. I tried to distance myself from A Man In Black and it seems like he wants to pick a fight over anything. I don't want to deal with this user and would very much like it if he were to go away. Anything can be done here?

<p>Just wanted to note that the oldest case on <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> is <i>down to</i> less than one month. That is still horrible (cases should be decided in 10 days), but is a lot better than <i>over two months</i> which is what it was when Robdurbar posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100236583" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100236583" rel="nofollow">the call for help</a> on January 12.</p>

By the way, the only reason I'm not nominating both for <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> is that the former had a fairly recent one, and the latter refused my nomination. They're good folks - a big hand, please.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if any other admins want to help out closing a few, we would all appreciate it. Otherwise for the last month I've been basically the sole admin closing cases for this page, and it's not as if I'm more qualified than anyone else - I had barely even heard of the page before the call for help came. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just deleted the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colleen_Shipman_217c.html" title="Colleen Shipman">Colleen Shipman</a> article and prevented it from being recreated because it violated <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>(she is the non-public crime victim in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> case). While I agree with others that the article's subject is also not notable, the fact that this was a violation of BIO made the deletion urgent (IMHO).</p>
<p>One editor, though, questioned this decision and I said I'd bring it to the attention of other admins. As the BIO page says, "Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. <b>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm".</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid. It is not our job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives." Because of that, I do not see a reason to unprotect the page. Other thoughts? Did I go too far? --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 19:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alabamaboy did explain the deletion to you. I support the deletion. At the moment Shipman is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> and putting up personal information about here is a violation of her privacy. There needs to be a strong public interest case to violate the privacy of a non-public living person and I just don't see it.

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>All that being said, I'm not so sure about the protection from recreation. Depending on what happens in the next few days I could see Shipman becoming article-worthy. Personally I'd have left the article unprotected unless it kept being recreated.

<dd>I'd also support removing the protection from recreation if the subject becomes more article worthy AND well-referenced information that doesn't violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> can be added. For now, though, I thought that was the best way to keep a flood of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>-violating info from filling the article (as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> shows, articles about this case are attracting a ton of attention).

<p>well after alabama boy explained himself i promptly put up a message on his page noting that he now had a better explanation...yet his intitial instantaneous move was without much explanation at all and i felt highly insufficient for such a drastic move on a public figure in the space program that is involved in a major news story...i was going to remove the stop sign i gave him myself yet my computer time expired right when this all was going on last night and i have had to wait for access again till this morning here in switzerland...i was however going to leave a minor warning about too quick a deletion that wasnt initially properly justified, yet done in good faith...anyways...(please read my note on the colleen shipman talk page)...i agree completely that colleen is a crime-victim...yet i put up that she is a public figure...and very very high profile right now...if someone had stalked some other person in the public domain that wouldnt have us remove their page...to have some basic facts about her such as her college and exact position in the space program are worthwhile...the space program is by its very nature a high profile highly public civilian enterprise (even tho the military &amp; navy is naturally heavily involved)...this information all exists in the public domain now thru various news sources...why not wikipedia???...if we merely restate what is in other reliable news sources there should be absolutely no problem...to keep colleen somehow blocked and a mystery is somehow strange...she is the third figure in this story...i agree speculation about her should be instantly removed from her page...and as to lible...i see it more a problem for lisas page...i think someone should keep a rough eye on lisas page to ensure it doesnt get too out of hand and in the realm of speculation...only info from reliable news souces and no sensationalism (and even some of the reliable news sources are going to play it sensational to get readers and listeners)...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 11:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was working with AMIB on something last night (shocking, I know) and [[User:Calton] PM'd with a kind of argumentative message on my talk page. This would go on for hours of back and forth argumentative PMs from Calton...with me finally asking, twice, "Did you PM me just to argue?". He stopped with the PMs.</p>

<dd>I am going to respond to this and leave it at that...Calton, you PM'd me, you continued to PM me, and I like to respond to people's comments (good or bad) in a timely fashion...so I wasn't pestering you, I was answering your comments.

<dd>My point here, which you have missed completely and showed perfectly, is that you are completely uncivil in your posts. I have not, except for my last comment, be in anyway uncivil or impolite.

<p>As far as I'm aware the ability for administrators to protect pages for a specified amount of time is a relatively new thing, but it seems to be getting used quite a lot. I've just noticed a problem with it, though, which doesn't really seem to have been addressed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Administrator protects a page for, say, a week because of vandalism</li>
<li>Administrator applies {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotected_2018.html" title="Template:Sprotected">sprotected</a>}} to the page</li>
<li>Protection expires a week later and nobody notices, {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotected_2018.html" title="Template:Sprotected">sprotected</a>}} remains in place</li>
<li>Potentially useful edits are not made because anonymous users think they can't edit the page. Alternatively, anonymous users vandalise the page and confuse everyone who doesn't understand time-limited protection.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Indeed; I was wondering the same thing after going back to remove {{<a href="../../../t/p/r/Template%7ETprotected_c65c.html" title="Template:Tprotected">tprotected</a>}} on several articles, only finding that someone else had already removed them in each case. Maybe an option that can enable some kind of automatic (i.e. built into MediaWiki) template on time protected protections? In other words, a new MediaWiki:Timeprotectnotice page, or something to the effect, would be created, and the message would be displayed on time protected articles when it is still protected. A checkbox would enable admins to turn off the notification template, when necessary. This seems like the best solution here.

<dd>Well, there already is one, but it only comes up when you edit. I think it's a bit big to be displayed when you're viewing an article, though – <a href="../../../q/x/z/User%7EQxz_3066.html" title="User:Qxz">Qxz</a> 02:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A possible solution would be to ask the devs to e.g. automatically display MediaWiki:PageIsProtected at the top of every protected page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Something in the interim that might help is simply using a different template for timed protection. Even if visually identical, it would allow people to scan through to remove them as needed. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 14:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another solution would be for some bot to automatically remove the template once the page is unprotected (it would also help when some users add protection templates thinking adding a template is enough to protect the page). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 14:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually that's easy. Have a bot remove <i>all</i> protection templates, daily. Since the bot doesn't have admin rights, it will fail to remove the template from pages that actually are protected. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:48, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>But it would be able to remove templates from semi-protected pages, correct? And move protected pages. I <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTREQ_4084.html#Removal_of_protection_templates" title="WP:BOTREQ">suggested</a> this type of bot awhile ago, but it didn't seem like there were any takers. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 15:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In all honesty, I'm not sure that the tag is that dangerous, I usually go for "Edit this page" and if it's not there THEN I look for the template, or if it's tagged, I'll check to see that it says "View source". I suspect I'm not alone. As to removing the template, is there a magic word like "PAGEPROTECTION" that could be read? If so, if the template could have a condition where if it was on an unprotected page it would change to something like "This page was protected [for whatever reason], but is no longer. Please edit this page to remove the "{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtectBU_9396.html" title="Template:ProtectBU">protectBU</a>}}" template. If that information wasn't easily obtainable, it could just say "If this page is unprotected and it has been at least 5 minutes since it was added, please speedily remove it and notify the poster".

<p>Reposted from <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>:</p>
<p>A notification, rather than a request, but I'm not sure where else to put it. I am undeleting Cyrus Farivar as per Jimbo's previous endorsement of exactly this act: "Even if VfD _did_ produce a consensus that this article should be deleted, then VfD is broken and should be ignored." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-08-08/Greenlighting_Cyrus_Farivar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-08-08/Greenlighting_Cyrus_Farivar" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">User:Jaranda</a> expressed concern that this was not brought to DRV, so I figured I should leave notice here (and also on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> before restoring it again. I will not continue to restore at this point, but I will bring the issue through proper dispute resolution channels should it continue to be an issue.</p>
<p>I am not asking for or opening a full review because, well, it's unnecessary and beside the point. DRV is a process through which we review deletions, but it is not the sole way in which they are reviewed. This is something that there is a definitive ruling on - journalists with the publication record of Cyrus Farivar are notable. Small segments of the community may create pages that proport to establish other criteria for notability, and AfDs can fail to attract the attention of anything but the mindset that currently dominates the page, but none of this changes the basic fact that a notability guideline of that extremity has been actively rejected from the very top, and the act of unilaterally restoring this article has explicitly been sanctioned.</p>
<p>This ought not only terminate the debate, but also serve as a rather sobering warning about the sad state of so-called policy on Wikipedia, whereby it clearly does not provide useful guidance on our actual best practice. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

It's also not clear in what context Jimbo said that because the signpost article doesn't provide a link to the mailing list or a diff. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 01:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In the process of making sure there wasn't a red link on the article, I rolled back the edits, removing very little, yet Krome007 felt I was wrong and I said that anyone can edit on Wikipedia.

I responded saying that the image did not have the correct tag or copyrights, suggested that if the image were in the public domain that Mr. Colquhoun email permissions, and that he not be incivil with me. He responded and finished his statement by calling me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106007546" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106007546" rel="nofollow">"self righteous fool."</a> I blocked him indef, after which he sent me an abusive e-mail about my block.</p>
<p>He posted an {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} request in which he personally attacked me. I was discussing the block with Shreshth91 privately, and he came to the conclusion that the block was too harsh, and I had a change of heart. Shreshth91 unblocked and then reblocked for 4 days, and I unblocked and stated that I was putting him on probation for 96 hours. During this whole time, I had put <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Harry_Colquhoun_913b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Harry Colquhoun">Harry Colquhoun up for AFD</a>.

<li>Don't worry about it, this sort of thing happens all the time, and most of the time when admins get yelled at it's because they've done the right thing.

<p>An anon IP has vandalized <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetoscope.html" title="Kinetoscope">Kinetoscope</a>, a featured article, by deleting an entire section of content. Unfortunately, I cannot revert this because the original text contains a citation link which is apparently now part of the blacklist. This link is a legitimate citation, present when the FAC was approved, yet its presence allows this article's vandalism to stand. Can someone please rectify the blacklist or at least exception this case so that the article can be properly reverted without the citation being removed?

<p><a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJPatrickBedell_18fb.html" title="User:JPatrickBedell">User:JPatrickBedell</a> has an image of his business card — Image:Cannabis-bcard-2007-01-10 000001.png — on his userpage. I find that this is contrary to policy and the general principles of Wikipedia.</p>

</ul>
<p>There was a recent incident, discussed here (or it might have been on AN/I), in which an editor removed what they considered to be inappropriate content from another editor's userpage without first talking to the editor. The gist of the discussion pointed to an overall agreement that concerns should have first been made known to the editor to give him a chance to remove the image on his own. I've done this on the user page. I've been politely ignored. (JPatrickBedell has posted on my talk page in response to another editor's posted concern that JPatrickBedell might be using a sockpuppet for editing, so he's clearly aware of talk pages and has been reading his and others.)</p>
<p>I've not deleted the image myself, but instead I'm bringing it here for comment/to get sense of community opinion. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 12:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it may be a moot point now, since the account has been blocked, but almost immediately after User: 134.148.5.104 was blocked, <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerdy80_6a45.html" title="User:Perdy80">User: Perdy80</a> began making the exact same vandalism edits.

<p>I don't deal much with images so I'm not much on an expert on licensing... so hopefully someone else here deals with it more and can answer this question. An editor has loaded some images (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FIGURE_11_A_4cda533808cecbb8952a1a001392adc86ad9a4f282ee2e97f56e28849b88048f.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FIGURE_11_A_4cda533808cecbb8952a1a001392adc86ad9a4f282ee2e97f56e28849b88048f.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> being an example) with a GFDL license. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to release something GFDL, you need to be the content creator don't you? There is no image source information and I somehow doubt the uploader actually created this image so it probably is a valid license, but like I said I don't do enough with images that I'm 100% sure that is the case. If any other admins want to take a look or just explain it to me on my talk page, that would be great.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either the creator must release it under GFDL, or it must be a modified ('derivative') version of a work under a GFDL-compatible licence (such as public domain or CC-by) and released by the modifier under GFDL, for the resulting image to be GFDL. I can just about imagine that image being a derivative of a public-domain image, but it doesn't seem likely and anyway that should be stated to be true on the image if it is, so it looks somewhat suspicious. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 18:50, 9 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Where is the best place to report a string of sock/meat puppets these days? I've been editing as anon for years now, and am not familiar with the current meta practices on en.</p>
<p>I noticed some <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ugly_Hill_e38e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ugly Hill">serious disruption in an AfD</a> involving massive sock and meat puppetry, including external incitements to disruption. Somebody with checkuser needs to sort this out. Just as my luck would have it, I happen to get into a passionate AfD right after I leave the IPs behind, and now I can't bring this up in the AfD itself, as it has moved to semiprot (as it should be) to stop the puppetry.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 00:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm, I don't see much need for sanctions or investigations here. The closing admin just needs to discount the puppets, i.e., the very new users with their very passionate opinions or the older accounts who have not edited Wikipedia since 2004. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 12:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I don't really know who to report here because there may be sockpuppets involved. If you see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Action_figure&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Action_figure&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this history page</a>, you'll notice that recently, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.88.183.189_12fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.88.183.189">219.88.183.189</a> and I (<b>Power level (Dragon Ball)</b>) have been having a dispute about which image should be used for that article. Recently, someone creates an account named <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_OJHomer_8d07.html" title="Special:Contributions/OJHomer">OJHomer</a> and reverts back to the version that 219.88.183.189 wanted on the Action figure article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Action_figure&amp;diff=106977737&amp;oldid=106946169" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Action_figure&amp;diff=106977737&amp;oldid=106946169" rel="nofollow">link</a>. This newcomer, however, was reverted by <a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESUIT_2181.html" title="User:SUIT">SUIT</a>. I don't know what to suggest here. Perhaps <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">CheckUser</a> would be the best thing to use here to find out who created that account to help sway consensus. But the problem with that is that this user may very well use dial-up or something and his IP address <a href="../../../i/s/p/ISP_a5e9.html" title="ISP">can change over time</a>.

<p>Hi everyone, I had semi-protected it due to the initial burst of vandalism. No problem if someone removes it to just move protection (which already was done). Not a big deal to make an ANB report ... Had I been online in the last couple of hours after I protected it, I'd have un-semi-protected it myself.

<p>Thanks for making wikipedia great! I would like to include the images Image:FIGURE 11 A 4cda533808cecbb8952a1a001392adc86ad9a4f282ee2e97f56e28849b88048f.jpg Image:FIGURE 11 B 1a65945fc077c716da682e8c877fb62c9957ad5ef20afcd497353f7c9f23c4fb.jpg Image:FIGURE 11 C 9de163fa3d855d4d1c5273e0ea16bf984f185f5fdc314b4410e55d6bd6be45cf.jpg in the James E. Sabow article. The images make plain that Col. Sabow suffered a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_skull_fracture.html" title="Basilar skull fracture">basilar skull fracture</a> before a shotgun was discharged in his mouth. The images (initially on commons at Image:FIGURE 11 A a5cd1064fb7502e6a9e10b1dfe54ea5872c3279f.jpg, Image:FIGURE 11 B f1992ff75a9c82108c08c27e207879b8115fc9bf.jpg, Image:FIGURE 11 C 3ae8ad0330aeba8d5250813b471dc58c7a248e9e.jpg) are <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> photographs that are not generally copyrighted. The fair use rationale provided with the images at en.wikipedia.org would apparently satisfy wikipedia's copyright policies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the edits including the images have been reverted twice, and I am seeking help here. I believe that, despite the graphic nature of the images, it is important that users of wikipedia be able to see the facts of a disputed case for themselves.

<dd>The three images on commons (Image:FIGURE 11 A a5cd1064fb7502e6a9e10b1dfe54ea5872c3279f.jpg, Image:FIGURE 11 B f1992ff75a9c82108c08c27e207879b8115fc9bf.jpg, Image:FIGURE 11 C 3ae8ad0330aeba8d5250813b471dc58c7a248e9e.jpg) have each been tagged with the copyvio claim. I don't believe that claim is valid, although I may of course be wrong. Copyright issues are, in criminal justice proceedings, a non-issue, and the OC Coroner doesn't assert copyright on the images. They don't sell autopsy images, either. Thanks for your help! <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJPatrickBedell_18fb.html" title="User:JPatrickBedell">JPatrickBedell</a> 20:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A copyright dosn't need to be asserted to be valid. Orange County would own the copyrights by default unless they have a policy of releasing the info into the public domain (for example some places release mug shots, some don't). Fair Use might apply if the article was talking about the photo or it had a section on his head wound. I'm not 100% sure tho. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 21:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Inclusion of the images may also constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It is not wikipedia's job to prove anything with regard to the subject, and this article looks like a textbook case of axe-grinding. Several of the references are self-published by the subject's father in what appears to be a highly contentious investigation. I certainly do not accept the claim that coroner's records are not copyrighted. At a minimum they are medical records protected by <a href="../../../h/i/p/HIPPA_7568.html" title="HIPPA">HIPPA</a> and may not legally be disclosed without written authorization from the subject's estate or authorized medical proxy.

<dd>Thank you for your suggestions. The images are now referenced in the text in a way that makes the importance of the images clear. This is fair use for a matter of public importance. Also, please note that Dr. David Sabow is the brother of Col. James Sabow. Simply ignoring the references does not demonstrate NPOV.

<p>There are changing licensing claims on these images. See the upload summary. User asserts public domain claiming they are the work of the Naval Investigative Service. Then, it is changed to the county coroner. In fact, it is likely that the source that the JPatrickBedell took these images from is a copyright protected report from <a href="http://meixatech.com/COLSABOWHOMICIDE.pdf" class="external free" title="http://meixatech.com/COLSABOWHOMICIDE.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://meixatech.com/COLSABOWHOMICIDE.pdf</a> . These images, as noted from their file names, are likely scans of figure 11 in the report.</p>
<p>The use of these images are part of JPatrickBedell's self-declared mission ("I am determined to see that justice is served in the death of Colonel James Sabow...", see <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJPatrickBedell_18fb.html" title="User:JPatrickBedell">user page</a>) to use Wikipedia for finding "justice" in the death of Col. Sabow.

<p>I originally posted this to the VP, and it was suggested to try here:</p>
<p>This isn't quite ANI territory, but it does look a bit suspicious and may require a bit of unpicking. On random browsing I came across Anthony John Bailey - it looked like it was a little too polished and my suspicions were only raised further when I see virtually a mono-contributor history (a couple of accounts and IP addies, but almost all of them bar the most recent few are most likely all the same person). There is certainly some fact in there, but there is certainly also a good deal of what, for a better phrase, could be described as promotional material. Hi-res photograph (publicity shot), verbose language, <i>"Bailey is one of the most decorated living Briton"</i> (is he? no source and sounds promotional), coupled with fudge facts, <i>"Freedom of the City of London 2004"</i> - as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_the_City_8ba4.html" title="Freedom of the City">Freedom of the City</a> details for London that basically means being as part of a Freemason/guilds type linkage - the text as it is in his article makes it sound like it is on par with Neil Armstrong being bestowed freedoms.

<p>If folks can manage to actually decode any real english words out of that pea soup of management speak then it looks to me like a straight up PR firm. It was also <i>"Founded in 1997 by Anthony Bailey"</i>. Of the other references a couple are from reputable sources, but the rest of them are from various "organisations" setup by him or his company. Matters aren't helped by the multiple edit accounts this has all been created from - including 81.149.151.110 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.149.151.110_7f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.149.151.110">contribs</a>), Digby2 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Digby2_8490.html" title="Special:Contributions/Digby2">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seisal_083a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seisal">contribs</a>), Cahce (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cahce_d899.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cahce">contribs</a>) and the most obvious, Eligo (<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEligo_dee2.html" title="User talk:Eligo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eligo_4d5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eligo">contribs</a>). A couple of them may be genuine editors, but the IP addy and Eligo are definitely the same thing.

<p>The issue I set out here is not some nn situation - these all appear to be real things - but what it does appear we have is some sort of promotional, PR web. I say web because the methodology of the editing is all too intermingled and from too many new accounts all editing on the same subject. The main article on the individual most definitely reads as nothing but self-promotional vanity and is in no way objective.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive74_a708.html" title="Edit section: 3RR Problem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3RR Problem</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to request some insight into a matter surrounding a 3RR report violation I filed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive37#User:Viriditas_reported_by_User:Arcayne_.28Result:.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive37#User:Viriditas_reported_by_User:Arcayne_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">Feb 8th</a>, The report appeared to have falled by the wayside, with one editor commenting on how the violations didn't appear to be patterned, and that the first instance didn't seem to be a revert. I submitted additional evidence of pattern with prior instances of reverting (that had not been reported). The report went unanswered. Eventually, it was archived without result. I resubmitted the same report (with a notation that it had been filed previously without result). Shortly thereafter, I received the following result, noted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Viriditas_reported_by_User:Arcayne_.28Result:No_block.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Viriditas_reported_by_User:Arcayne_.28Result:No_block.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The first responder, <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">User:Humus sapiens</a> stated "no violation, so no block." The second responder, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a>, chided me for submitting "ancient" requests, implying that I had dredged through the history of an article to find something from long ago, and that I had re-submitted the article after it had already been ruled upon, neither of which was accurate. In subsequent conversations between Jayig and myself, he suggested that "3RR reports that aren't acted on are typically those that are seen as problematic for one reason or another, which is why they aren't acted on." As I am not really aware of any issues surrounding what appeared to be a simple violation of 3RR (with an unreported history of same), the only "problematic" part of the equation appeared to be that it was a relatively user reporting an editor (who was clever enough to disguide his edit summaries to escape notice). I am submitting my concerns here because it was suggested (though not recommended) that this was the next venue of appeal. I feel that the reasons the 3RR report were denied (ie, no violation, stale reportage) are not in keeping with the spirit and letter of the rule. I had reported the instance of 3RR in a timely fashion, and supplied supplemental information as to prior bad acts and bad faith as needed, both politely and (so I hope) succinctly. I know that 3RR is not ment to be applied punitively, but I feel it has to be applied consistently and fairly. To have the report result skewed because of a perception that it was "ancient", it implies that the complaint was noit actually or adequately investigated. I am not asking for a pound of flesh; I am asking for a bit of fairness and consistency of policy application. I thank you for taking the time to read my concerns, and I apologize if my language was in any way impolite.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 23:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, your languages is fine and your complaint is valid. It's an unfortunate result of the 3RR desk being understaffed. In my experience the WP:3RR monitors typically do a good (and often thankless) job... but its entirely possible for something to slip though the cracks.</dd>
<dd>I know it's not your fault that the report went un-acted-on for so long, but it's not within the spirit of the blocking policy to block people for behavior that has stopped.</dd>
<dd>I haven't looked at the content of the report, so I can't say it was a valid report or not. Sorry... someone with more time can comment on that for you. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 05:40, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, in retrospect, this has gone on a bit longer than it should have. The reverting stopped because I (as the one getting reverted) decided that it wasn't worth the risk of furthering an edit war, and stopped posting the edits that were getting reverted. That the user in question dodged a bullet is immaterial at this late date; that sort of behavior has a way of popping up again, and with them, it probably will.</dd>
<dd>As I look over this, I probably should have let this go after the mistake; I hope you will chalk it up to newbie idealism. I didn't mean to disparage the 3RR desk; they are human and make mistakes - this is why they put erasers on pencils and delete keys on keyboards. I could have posted my complaint showing the reverts a lot better than I did. Ciê la vie.</dd>

<p>Following the edit warring between me and <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhinarticle</a> was protected by administrator <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">User:Cbrown1023</a> who told that he would unprotect that page till I reach an agreement with <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a>. The underlying problem for edit warring is that Biophys holds strognly Russophobic views and maintains that criminal Boris Stomakhin, who got 5 years of prison in Russia for public calls to <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremism</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> against Russians including me, is actually innocent dissident. Biophys took his text material inserted into the article <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> from blog [<a href="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" class="external text" title="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" rel="nofollow">La Russophobe</a>].

It is evident that this Blog La Russophobe is inciting ethnic hatred at least.

My question for Wikipedia administrators: If Wikipedia is a proper place for publishing Russophobic statements (anti-semitic statements), inciting ethnic hatred against Russians? I understand the position of <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">User:Cbrown1023</a> who doesn't want to verifiy reliability of Russian texts, but a simple search in Google on Boris Stomakhin would lead to all <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobe.html" title="Russophobe">Russophobe</a> sources which are published by <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> in current protected version of the article on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a>.

<dd>I will forgive you for the personal attacks. Looking at the talk page, I see that both of you have been uncivil, and many a personal attack has been thrown. I'm going to have to ask both to step back from the article and from each other and try editing something else (as full protection is now making you do). Both of you seem to have reached a point where alternative solutions are not being contemplated as plausible and acceptable to all. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">Ellol</a> has offered a compromise, but does not seem to be acted upon.

<dd>I wonder, if anyone here could make Biophys calm?

I have corrected Biophys POV to NPOV, since <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> is not described as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_police.html" title="Secret police">secret police</a>. As to the Human Rights article, I have employed the same approach which Biophys has taken in regard to the <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a> article in <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> case. Biophys uses unconfirmed allegations of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Politkovskaya_ee36.html" title="Anna Politkovskaya">Anna Politkovskaya</a> which is said was publishing her materials without verifications. Moreover, in the cited sources on Russian there are no allegations of Politkovskaya that people were detained because of their religion, while Biophys inserted these claims into the passage dedicated to the freedom of religion, which is evidently is not appropriate.Vlad fedorov 07:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Luckily, administrators are not so stupid as to believe in your another empty accusations. Second, I have deleted Alex Bakharev comments because the matter was solved, as to you I could note that you have deleted comments of other users which addressed your vandalism, POV and conspiracy theories. Amd I would like to notice that these comments weren't 'favorable' of you.

<li>I have hidden text in the lower part of the list that keeps track of meta log changes. Since I am moving backward from 28 June 2006 when I first started tracking the count, it could be an error in counting the changes in the two logs. If any permissions changes were made outside of the logs (i.e. by a developer) I will certainly miss it, which is why I will be limited in how far back I can calculate the count accurately, since developer actions are not logged. Obviously, when building a tracking list backwards, any errors will be cumulative. There were no desysoppings between EOM March and your promotion time. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 18:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Better to just use userID's. HIBC, yours is 899386, still no 420 though ;-). NoSeptember is 244888, which is quite a nice number. Newyorkbrad = 990214, Deskana = 309128, and I = 451766. There used to be a tool to go the other way, so you could find out who is user 666, 6666, 66666, 666666... but it doesn't exist anymore. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 18:31, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, your information is an excellent source for info on adminship trends. I absolutely love the color coded graph of admin 'classes', if you will. It shows the rate of admin creation better then a simple bar or line graph could. One thing I notice is the wave pattern on the admin promotions by month graph. We seem to be in a trough right now, and perhaps all this concern over admin promotion rates is not entirely warranted. On the other hand, it is significantly lower then other growth rates now. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 19:24, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Re: Durova--yes, I agree that the promotion rate needs to be quickened, though how to do it is a question. NoSeptember's graph suggests (possibly--this may be a coincidence) a dropoff after the February '06 wheel war. The less stressful we can make being an admin, the more people will want to do it.

<dd>As someone who got sysopped when the <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> boards were both backlogged and tried to keep them running (and succeeded until some cases went to arbitration), I draw a direct connection between the decline in the admin-to-account ratio and the difficulty in keeping up with those complaints. Although I don't want to come across as alarmist, there's a basic principle I draw from the law enforcement of New York City: during the 1970s it was almost impossible to get the police to respond to a noise complaint because the usual line was, <i>we're too busy dealing with rapes and murders</i>. During the 1990s those priorities changed. When smaller quality of life violations got attention the felony rates went down substantially. What the city discovered was that a friendly police officer walking the beat, asking someone to turn down the volume on a radio or writing a small citation for vandalism actually stopped potential troublemakers from graduating to more serious crimes. I'd like to recruit more sysops - more beat cops as it were - so we have enough admins to intervene early and keep the serious problems to a minimum. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 21:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This sounds like <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixing_Broken_Windows_46ce.html" title="Fixing Broken Windows">Fixing Broken Windows</a>, a book (and an ensuing discussion) that I highly recommend to those interested in crime, its causes, and prevention. I recall that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tipping_Point_%28book%29_c3b0.html" title="The Tipping Point (book)">Tipping Point</a> also touches on the issue.

<dd>An important point that the Fixing Broken Windows page overlooks is that the <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Giuliani_8115.html" title="Rudolph Giuliani">Giuliani</a> administration continued and expanded upon initiatives from the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dinkins_3c24.html" title="David Dinkins">Dinkins</a> administration. Also, the specific tactic of addressing turnstile jumpers had an enormous impact on the subway crime rates. New York City actually has a separate police force for its transit system. What they found was that people who sneaked into the system without paying the fare committed a large portion of the more serious crimes (which makes sense intuitively when you think about it for a moment). Anyway, back to Wikipedia: let's look for more good people to mentor into sysops. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 22:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>(Reset indent)</small> Of course, the reason for such a low increase lies in the now-adays rediculous 'requirements' for being an admin. Reading the RFAs, you have to be a walking encyclopedia with an edit count of 10,000 (minor edits don't count!) and have an immaculate reputation that surpasses that of the Pope! I'd love to help out, and I do what I can as an editor. But I'm not one that creates articles by the dozen, nor do I have any expert knowledge (other then that which is already on Wikipedia). But you can see me do plenty of 'janitorial' work, which is what I believe is being an admin is all about. You want more volunteers? Get rid of the 'Nay-sayers' first; they're the only reason admins don't get elected. I know consensus is the basis on which the community is build, however bureaucrats still tend to go with the numbers instead of the arguments.</p>

<dd>The same photo may be used elsewhere, or may have future purposes. A7 is for articles, there is no such speedy deletion criteria for images.

<dd>It may, although frankly I often speedy delete (as <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a>) obvious vanity photographs uploaded for a vanity page, and I see no reason not to. I don't think there should necessarily be a CSD for them, since as HighInBC says if they're properly licensed they could be used elsewhere, but I also don't think we should permit people to just upload pictures of themselves willy-nilly, and keep them here indefinitely. Note that orphaned free images have been and should be deletable through IfD, even if they're not speedied. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 00:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you there Chick Bowen... If the image is unlikey to be used anywhere else, I don't see the problem in deleting it. However, if it's a good image and might be usefull elsewhere (and it's free) then perhapse uploading it to Commons is a good idea too. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 05:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually ran across this issue last night. I deleted the image as I do in the case of the myspace-ish articles created, by IAR. I notified the user who tagged it that A7 wasn't appropriate. I delete these orphans for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>They will be deleted by Orphanbot tagging and cause backlog work</li>
<li>If they are just free images floating around, they should be on commons.</li>
<li>Most importantly in my judgement, the users do not realize what the free license means. A picture of a kid goofing off can wind up like the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a>. We should be more proper in content than YouTube.</li>

<p>Sometimes this board or ANI gets questions about how to handle a complex investigation. I've thought of writing up some pages in my namespace on the subject, sort of a quick self-study course. Gumshoe 101 would deal with the basics such as how to read a page history and find a diff.

<p>Due to the way I envision this it would probably stay in user space. Part of the challenge is to minimize the exploitation potential: if a TV news show runs a public service story about how people can protect their homes from burglary, the burglars are sure to tune in also. I'll see about drafting something that does more good than harm. Might be slow in rolling it out, with other irons in the fire.

<dd>The user has continued to make anti-Serb and even fascist comments and I really think that this is enough. I am not a Serb, but i do not like nationalism and ethnic hate, which is evident in this user's case. He wrote the article "Serbian Genocide" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbian_Genocide&amp;diff=107612233&amp;oldid=80781680" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbian_Genocide&amp;diff=107612233&amp;oldid=80781680" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and added a link to it on his user page. The article used to redirect the page to the article about how Serbs suffered during World War II due to the attrocities and genocide committed by the Nazi Ustashe, but this user tried to invent his own history, claiming that Serbs committed genocide in WWII, which is nonsense. He also wrote "<i>This user is TOTALLY IMPRESSED by the Croatian romantic feeling of the Montenegrins; their heroism, despite their Serbian affiliations and is simply dying to learn more about the beautiful Red Croatian culture</i>" on his user page, once again claiming that Montenegrins are Croats, that they have a Croatian history, thus insulting an entire nation of Montenegrins. He has also affiliated himself with the fascist nazi Ustashe of WWII, by stating "<i>Bog i Hrvati, Ivane. --Za Dom Spremni!</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ivan_Kricancic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107600586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ivan_Kricancic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107600586" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, and "Za Dom Spremni" was the fascist slogan of the nazi puppet state of Croatia in WWII. Isn't there a quick way to solve this problem, because I don't think a user with such extreme radical opinions can change, he will only continue with his POV pushing, and this is only going to get worse. He has committed several acts of vandalism, refuses to cooperate, and we now see that not only nationalism is the case, but also fascism. --<a href="../../../b/o/%C5%BE/User%7EBo%C5%BEe_pravde_dfae.html" title="User:Bože pravde"><small><b><big>G</big></b>OD <b>O</b>F <b><big>J</big></b>USTICE</small></a> 19:57, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like a pretty basic attempt to try and intimidate you to <i>not</i> block the user for inappropriate behavior. If it makes you feel better, this person is on a cable modem, so while they are not a static IP, it isn't the same as blocking a dial-up account; Chances are that any block that is less than a month would not even effect any other users. Regardless, I gave the IP a 48 hour block for incivility a near personal attack on you, and wikilawyering.

<p>I have asked and it appears that there is not a template that lets other administrators know that an article for speedy deletion is currently being reviewed by another administrator? There have been several time where I go do a quick google search or try to start discourse with the creating editor and by the time i do, the article has already been deleted? I think a template such as {{hangon-admin}}, with similar wording, that notifies that the article is being reviewed (for those non clear cut cases such as possible copyvios etc) by an administrator. Anybody have some feedback on this idea? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 21:11, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict x3) Yeah, sorry: instruction creep. If your researches reveal that an article should have been kept, then undelete, warn the tagger of the article (if it wasn't a speedy delete, they need to be told as they need to learn from the mistake) and drop an line to the deleter telling them what you've done. Don't bother with the latter step if it's me, since I'm fallible and say so on my user page :o) Added: a single revert isn't wheel-warring, it's just normal editing; and you're likely to find the article deleted whilst you're adding the template; and what about templates left forever a la the much-misused {hangon}? Nah, instruction creep.

<p>Although I've dealt with the same problem, any editor can add a template, giving admins the mistaken impression that the article is being handled.

<p>He has weighed in on the page adding the following</p>

</dl>
<p>This is clearly intended as a smear. It's absurd and false. The ads are not produced by Dale, and most importantly do not say anything of the kind that Thomas is claiming. The ads attack him, not for supporting gay rights (absurd as Dale is gay), but the apparent inconsistency between supporting al-Qaradawi on the one hand (whom they link with anti-gay sentiment) while claiming to be in favour of gay rights. Equally, the suggestion that the TV station alleged <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> plotted terrorist acts is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>Anyway, he edited the page a half-dozen times or so, each time reverting the content, which the subject of the article (Iain Dale) said was libellous, and was removing, but he continued to revert war, claiming that it didn't matter what the user saying he was Iain Dale had said because he wasn't logged-in. Since then he changed his allegations to say that Dale is linked to right-wing Christians Conservatives. I removed this, as it's an attempted smear, just arbitrarily selecting a few of his media colleagues to associate him with. He also referred to the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Foundation_f66d.html" title="Heritage Foundation">Heritage Foundation</a> as "extreme right-wing", and in the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Iain_Dale&amp;diff=107043014&amp;oldid=106970633" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Iain_Dale&amp;diff=107043014&amp;oldid=106970633" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> referred to the article's subject as an "extreme-right British conservative". He has also edited related page <a href="../../../1/8/_/18_Doughty_Street_f128.html" title="18 Doughty Street">18 Doughty Street</a> with the edit summary "just telling the facts" talking about 'homophobic and extremist libels.' See page history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=18_Doughty_Street&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=18_Doughty_Street&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, in this context I removed his attempted smear, which he describes as "Information of great interest to Dale-watchers", saying "remove persistent POV pusher MarkThomas". Unfortunately since this time he has been attacking me. See here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nssdfdsfds&amp;oldid=107690729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nssdfdsfds&amp;oldid=107690729" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. He likes to accuse people of breaking rules, threatening them with permanent blocks. He's since come back twice, weighing in on a dispute with another user (see 'three revert rule'), even when the user's comments were right below his own.</p>
<p>Another user criticised his edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iain_Dale#Should_the_user_MarkThomas_really_be_involved_so_closely_with_this_page.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Iain_Dale#Should_the_user_MarkThomas_really_be_involved_so_closely_with_this_page.3F" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, and he has immediately weighed in with more attacks and threats against me, when I replaced his threat of a permanent block against <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELondon1982_20f2.html" title="User talk:London1982">User Talk:London1982</a> (simply for suggesting on <a href="../../../i/a/i/Talk%7EIain_Dale_d968.html" title="Talk:Iain Dale">Talk:Iain Dale</a> that he is biased wrt the subject of the article) with a standard welcome template (the user only has 3 or 4 edits, and no talk page), he has since accused me of being his sockpuppet or something, although that's blatantly obviously not the case. After I got fed up of responding to all his attacks, I removed his content from my talk page, and he's sinced been edit warring it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nssdfdsfds&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nssdfdsfds&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:London1982&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:London1982&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, somewhat bizarrely suggesting on my talk that I had no right to edit London1982's talk page, when he'd just edited himself (double standards from him are typical: he's happy to threaten others but still is rude himself).</p>
<p>His parting shot has been to say he will file a sockpuppet report against me tomorrow, as apparently to him anyone who doesn't agree that referring to mainstream Conservatives as "extremist right-wingers" must be sockpuppets</p>
<p>I've just wasted an hour of my life on this pointlessness, and am not happy at all about MarkThomas' destructiveness. I would like him blocked from editing the pages <a href="../../../i/a/i/Iain_Dale_dfe5.html" title="Iain Dale">Iain Dale</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/_/18_Doughty_Street_f128.html" title="18 Doughty Street">18 Doughty Street</a>, and my own talk page. I don't want to waste my time here going over this. I really don't have time for it, and won't be able to edit wikipedia if I have to waste my time going through this stuff. Can someone get him away from me - please, I don't want to waste any more of my life on this.</p>
<p>BTW, his username is causing confusion, as Iain Dale thought he was well-known UK left-wing political comedian <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Thomas_7d11.html" title="Mark Thomas">Mark Thomas</a>. I would suggest it should be changed. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 00:40, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I actually did place the {{<a href="../../../d/o/n/Template%7EDon%27t_know_44a7.html" title="Template:Don't know">Don't know</a>}} because I was asking the question. I believe it meets GFDL and I think that every image from that website meets the requirement... kind of like NASA. (I've seen a template for those type of pictures). One reason I left the question open was to see if we could have a discussion towards perhaps even making a template for all pictures from that website. In my text I indicated: Maps in the Atlas of Canada are offered for personal, public non-commercial and commercial use and may be reproduced. For details please go to the <a href="http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/aboutus/important_notices.html" class="external text" title="http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/aboutus/important_notices.html" rel="nofollow">important notices</a>. This image was Free to use with the condition the coorporations advise the NRC so they may send them one of the most up to date pictures. I figured out the that is essentially a type of GFDL or Free Copy licences (whatever the term is). The NRC is a government organization of Canada and for this reason it is believed that this image meets the requirement for Free Use. Making thing even more complicated I just made a new picture with that map. <a href="../../../h/u/d/Image%7EHudson_bay_explorer.png_6f79.html" title="Image:Hudson bay explorer.png">Image:Hudson bay explorer.png</a>. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Finally figured out how to rename page "Hawaiian ecosystems at risk project" to "Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk project" (only capitalization is changed), but see below* for what I got in reply. Looks like the move succeeded, but "talk" pages from both the old (previously-redirected) all[-but-first-letter]-lowercase version and new (various-uppercase letters) versions need to be COMBINED on the new page for "Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk project" (capitalized exactly like that), and I don't know how to do that; seems like something an administrator might need to resolve.</p>

<p>Hang on, I think this is a bit much. Flameviper is by no means perfect but he should be given a final chance to become a more productive contributor, possibly through mentorship. As for that post on Elara's talk...I have seen worse. There is a sort of implied threat but the edit summary is certainly honest and - am I allow to say this? - sort of accurate as well. I have faith that Flameviper can improve his conduct here. I agree that 24 hours of enforced wikibreak would do no harm, but a month is a bit much. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 21:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no drum to bang for the guy, but it looks to my eyes that we gave him the provokation he was seeking, then, when he responded, we provoked him again. He responded again, and then we blocked him.</p>
<p>I'm always happy to block on a threat, but we could be accused of using it as a pretext here. This guy isn't the best contributor in the world - by a long chalk - but we've talked ourselves up from some minor disruption to indef blocking being on the cards in a matter of hours. We block disruptive sockfarmers for less time than this guy has got and with more provokation.</p>
<p>Some coolheadedness would not go amiss here.

<dd>I agree with you in general, but in this one particular case, he came right out and said he wanted to stir up trouble. Trolls come in (at least) 2 flavors: people who sit down at the computer and say "today I will troll Wikipedia", and immature editors who get into conflicts, are unable to let it go, and start trolling by accident, still convinced they're "fighting the good fight". This guy may have been unfortunately and needlessly provoked, I don't know, but we <i>still got to see his reaction to provocation</i>. He reacted by stating his intention to troll.

<p>I can totally understand everyones concerns, but please could this be reduced to a 24 hour ban? I am more than happy to work with this user and try and point him in the right way. In my opinion, a month will stop him editing completely and as I've already said, flameviper means well and has much to give to wikipedia.

<p>A comment here on the increasing number of community ban discussions: although this noticeboard is open to everyone, its title does tend to scare away the unmopified crowd (it certainly had that effect on me before I assumed janitorial responsibilities). So since community bans - and potentially <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_Community_enforced_mediation_d2d3.html" title="User:Durova/Community enforced mediation">community enforced mediation</a> as well - are in principle for the entire community, perhaps we should initiate a new noticeboard for community-specific action.

<dd>Well, someone created the board almost as soon as I suggested the idea. The door's very open to discussion. It would work with the new mediation I've been proposing, to welcome the entire community in community decisions. Things fly along fast here and at ANI - a regular editor who doesn't follow sysop topics would probably miss a lot. It seems to me we should encourage open involvement in community decisions. Admins don't carry extra weight at these discussions over any other editor in good standing. It's the equalizing principle. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 03:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If it's for general community discussion/decision making (the two are rather synonymous), then it really is a duplicate of the village pump with one additional subject. The pump already has all the areas it would discuss that aren't community bans/enforcement that I can think of covered, so to avoid duplication we should put it in the same tree as the others. The pump already has problems with duplication here and on various ancillary Wikipedia talk:-space pages (for the proposals and policy sections especially), adding another general discussion area would presumably result in even more duplication. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 05:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Siteban discussions would proceed there the same way they proceed here or at ANI.

<p>To be honest, I think I'd rather move AN over CN; from my perspective, splitting the discussion like this seems more confusing than anything. It adds another page for me to watch over, fragments already-hectic discussion, and may add to the unfortunate perception that admins are more important than other users. Well-intentioned, I am very much sure, but a move/merge may be more useful than a split, is my take. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 02:55, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. Since it's a general board it'll probably pick up a fair amount of misposted traffic from novice editors.

For example, <i>User A</i> creates attack article, <i>User B</i> doesn't know about speedy deletion and AfDs the page, <i>Admin C</i> speedies the article per CSD G10 but forgets to close relevant AfD, <i>User D</i> can therefore close the debate as <b>speedily deleted by %admin%</b> (linking to the deletion log of the article would be a good idea, however). <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 05:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I frequently close AfD's where the article has been speedied and I'm not an admin (eg. in the past 15 minutes I closed 2: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Radio_Tramp&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108028151" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Radio_Tramp&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108028151" rel="nofollow">[58]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Andrew_lapsa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108028422" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Andrew_lapsa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108028422" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>).

<p>Right. Non-admins closing an orphaned AfD after the article has been speedy deleted is a Good Thing™; closng an AfD as delete because it should be speedied and is so tagged, debateable at best (I did it a couple of times and got a polite "Don't do this message".) <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 14:47, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This (should be) a fairly uncontroversial matter to review. The issue is a proposal for a slightly enhanced rewording of the disclaimer pages so that the word "article" is either implicitly or explicitly modified. The modification: indicate that disclaimers apply to *all* informational resources on WP, (not just articles). This applies (for a notable example) to the "reference desk" resources. This is a fairly important issue to consider, since <i>"reference desk" responses routinely include content that could reasonably be mis-interpreted as direct advice</i>. More details can be found at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Legal_disclaimer#Edit_Request_.22articles_-.3E_articles_and_resources.22_.28applies_to_all_disclaimers.2C_not_just_legal_disclaimer.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Legal_disclaimer#Edit_Request_.22articles_-.3E_articles_and_resources.22_.28applies_to_all_disclaimers.2C_not_just_legal_disclaimer.29" rel="nofollow">legal disclaimer discussion page</a>.

<li><b>Proposing a long block.</b> The IP is obviously static -- it's been blocked for the same reasons, at the same pages, as early as March 2006, and the user on the other end is obviously both well aware that legal threats will lead to blocks, and that legal concerns should be kept off-wiki whenever possible. I'm personally inclined to block for quite some time -- 3 to 6 months, at least.

<dd>Tell me, I'm just curious - nothing to do with this matter above, it just reminded me - what is the policy on editors issuing legal threats, I've had one myself from another editor sent off-wiki - naturally being me I have sold my wife and children, changed my name and destroyed the family home before the writ can appear - but what is the wiki-policy, and what should the average editor do if he receices such a threat? - I hasten to say (being me) I just told the editor concerned exactly where to place his writ, but some editors are less forceful than me - so what should they do. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 23:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A "go" on "Otto Warburg" was originally redirected to <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Heinrich_Warburg_e5c5.html" title="Otto Heinrich Warburg">Otto Heinrich Warburg</a>. I recognized confusion between this person and another of the same name <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Warburg_%28botanist%29_fadc.html" title="Otto Warburg (botanist)">Otto Warburg (botanist)</a>, so I created an article for the botanist. I then attempted to change the redirect of "Otto Warburg" to this latter gentleman, as he is the one with the name (and no middle name). The redirect source appears to be correct, but when a "go" is made, it is not redirected anywhere. Why is this and how can it be fixed? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDoe0007_58dd.html" title="User:JohnDoe0007">JohnDoe0007</a> 12:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears that 100% of this user's contributions have been hoaxes; he's inventing new species and even assigning them binominal Latin genus/species names (and then altering the corresponding genus's page to include his latest creation). I've already reverted all of his changes and prod'ed all of his new pages, but I'm not sure if an admin wants to issue warnings, block him, or both.

<p>We could use some more contributors at UCFD. As of right now there are discussions that are as old as 13 days that are long overdue for being closed, as well as others that are 10 days old that still only have two contributors adding their input. It looks as if I'm going to get the mop shortly, but even then I don't feel comfortable closing the discussions that I was the original nominator of (which happens to be the majority of discussions). If we could get a few editors to help close the overdue discussions that would be helpful (as well as add your input to any discussions). <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 09:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The trouble is that closing UCFDs (as with CFDs) often requires (as I've said before) a black belt in Bot. I could merrily close every discussion on there in an hour, but would have no clue what to do afterwards, as the instructions provided are very complicated. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 13:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've compiled a list of policies that are partially or wholly redundant with one another, or overlap in a significant amount. The list is <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOverlapping_policies_and_guidelines_bdf2.html" title="Wikipedia:Overlapping policies and guidelines">here</a>.

<p>Hey folks, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_no_copyright_tag_6642.html" title="Category:Images with no copyright tag">Category:Images_with_no_copyright_tag</a>'s backlog is currently a week old which works out to about 1,400 images. All hands helping would be nice. This includes non-admins, there is sorting to do as the bots tag some pages that have the source but no tag. We have fun with dramatic issues, but copyright violations are the core of keeping the encyclopedia running.

<p>Hmm I am not impressed. I think the best thing to do is block your new account too as it is clearly too associated with your old one. If you wish to return do it under a completely new username and stay away from editors that you have clashed with before. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 10:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>{{Template:User Nazi}} I AM A NAZI. I live in the disgraced country of Germany. I am against the treaty of Versailles and want the french to pay back ALL the reparations they stole from us.
