<dd>Blocks are not punitive, and warnings don't accumulate. The user needs a final warning and to commit a new vandalism in a, say, 30 minutes interval, to be blocked. We don't block for final warnings delivered two weeks ago. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 13:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Does that mean that an editor can make vandal edits every day and accumulate infinite 'final warnings' so long as those edits are spaced out nicely? From a pragmatic point of view, is a temporary block of anonymous editors from a vandalising IP not an improvement on wasting positive contributors time on reversions? Every vandal edit to Wikipedia reduces the credibility of the encylopedia in its entirety but also removes time for valid contributions. At some point we have to say that the potential loss of valid contributions for a short time from a vandalising shared IP is less that the negative effects of allowing them to continue undeterred.

<dd>That could be a number of different students. So rather than moaning about inactivity - give them a warning and then see what happens. Most kids stop when they notice they are watched.

<dd>It isn't surprising that some users repeatedly vandalise. They know they can get away with it. When they've accumulated a few "final warnings" and nothing has happened I'm sure they feel encouraged to keep on vandalising. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 15:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe the warning should be rephrased to

<p>'<b>This is your final warning. If you continue to vandalize you will be blocked unless you wait a few hours in which case you will get another final warning.'</b></p>

<dd>Curtains99 is absolutely correct, we are way too nice to these vandals, that's why to do it so much.

<p>To quote Jimbo, "When I am asked to look in to cases of admin abuse, and I choose to do so, I generally find myself amazed at how nice we are to complete maniacs, and for how long." Just do what you have to do to stop it, as you aren't required to coddle these people. Give the longterm4im next time, and if the reviewing admin is wise they will soft block the IP after the IP violates that warning. <a href="../../../c/v/u/WP%7ECVU_b199.html" title="WP:CVU"><font color="black">声</font></a><a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP"><font color="gray">援</font></a> -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 00:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the quote by Jimbo together with the comment by <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">User:Zsero</a> and ordinary users' comments indicate at least three things: (a) that there is a lack of clarity amongst admins of what is appropriate action to take, and (b) there is certainly a lack of clarity amongst ordinary users about what to do, particularly given the apparent inconsistent approaches taken by the body of admins. Meanwhile, (c) through the gaps brought about by these inconsistencies, vandals are running around, playing the system, and making the lives of people trying to make serious contributions much more difficult. It is made more difficult by reversions of vandalism that could and should be prevented from taking up valuable time which could have been spent adding good content. As I said in a previous message, it seems that little may be able to be done about it, as that may require time spent specifying more clearly the processes that should be followed in dealing with vandals, and this time may well not be available, because of the amount of time spent trying to combat the vandals! <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 01:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think that those willing to take the time should - no <i>need</i> to take the time discuss this. There needs to be at least a standard convention for this type of thing. This type of long term abuse cannot go unpunished because the vandals don't log in. As you said, they are playing the system. As long as legitimate, registered users aren't hurt by the move I don't see what the problem is. <a href="../../../c/v/u/WP%7ECVU_b199.html" title="WP:CVU"><font color="black">声</font></a><a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP"><font color="gray">援</font></a> -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 04:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my experience, putting together an abuse report is a pain in the rear, and usually accomplishes nothing -- the ISPs generally aren't responsive, and in some ways can't afford to be (brings up customer privacy, all sorts of fun legal issues). Which means I only do it in really, really dire circumstances. But, I say that as somebody who prefers to keep on-wiki business on the wiki. I have submitted a few abuse reports, and I've sometimes been able to get a response for the really unsavory kiddos. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 19:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would seem to defeat the purpose of having parameters in the first place, would it not? If we're going to do that, we might as well just hard-code them entirely, but then we lose the ability to disable malfunctioning individual features (as we did when FixInstructions was found to have a bug), or for the community to determine consensus (if it ever changes) on the backlog limits. As HighInBC so aptly put it, do we really need to lock up the light switch? The parameters can be re-set easily enough, it doesn't really cause any significant harm. Once the vandals realize it's not going to accomplish anything (other than getting themselves blocked very quickly), they'll presumably give up. —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/r/e/User_talk%7EKrellis_922e.html" title="User talk:Krellis">Talk</a>)</small> 02:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><small>(De-indenting; that's a lot of colons...)</small> Well, one thing you can do is simply not enter a "Subject/headline" when using the "+" to add a report - it'll result in a blank edit summary, but it will also add the report w/o a new header, and it seems to avoid the possibility of edit conflicts. As far as the bot goes... I'm not sure what the best behavior would be. Would we want it to always remove any additional headings underneath the "=== User-reported ===" header? Do that all the time (whenever it sees it), or only when we're removing another report? Or only when we're removing the report immediately below the header? It's a little complicated, unfortunately. One thought I had - put the template in the header, then the report below it. That way the bot will remove the header as the report, and the line(s) below as comments to the report. Not exactly the prettiest thing in the world, of course... Let me know what everyone thinks is best, and I can make it happen - easiest might just be not entering anything as the header when using "+" though. —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/r/e/User_talk%7EKrellis_922e.html" title="User talk:Krellis">Talk</a>)</small> 23:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If we can figure out a good way for the bot to remove surplus sections, I wouldn't mind those at all -- whatever makes it easiest to keep this place moving and fulfilling its purpose. The best idea I've got is if it counts the number of sections on the page, and removes any section headings after the <i>X-th</i> section, which could probably be a variable (<i>numsections</i>, say). Note it would only remove the heading line, not the contents. I think. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 18:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The bot will start archiving in Archive 6. I removed the archive indexer code because it will be written by MiszaBot now. I also added the auto=long parameter in the archive box so that links to archives are generated automatically instead of manually. I didn't change the HBC AIV helperbots code.

<p>I am opening a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_POLICIES_bb10.html" title="WP:RFC/POLICIES">request for comment</a> concerning what I perceive to be excessive leniency towards persistent vandals who space out their disruptive edits in order to evade blocks by taking advantage of the requirement that "the vandal [must be] active <b>now</b>".

<p>I have only gone back as far as July 2006; however, my point is that the sheer quantity of these debates (several of which are quite lengthy) is reason enough for the policy to be corrected. The present situation is opening a grave loophole in Wikipedia policy which is readily being exploited by several long-term vandals. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 20:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FWIW, I have been a fairly active vandal hunter for months now, and I have <b>not</b> run into problems with admins refusing to block this type of vandalism. From what I have seen, most admins deal with each vandal report on a case-by-case basis, weigh the facts on each case upon what is just and prudent for each case. I have reported MANY vandals that have the editing pattern you describe here. I usually leave a nice note on AIV that says something like "I know that the standard policy is to only block vandals that are currently editing, and while this report is for a stale edit, it is clear that this IP has been used to vandalise several times a day for a while now" and EVERY time I have reported a vandal of this nature, they have been blocked. It seems to me that admins are NOT blindly applying the policy of "Only active in the past 30 minutes" and have clearly taken <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> to heart in dealing with all sorts of abuses. Yes, the slow-moving vandal does take longer to get blocked, but thats because it often takes a week or two to generate enough edits to make it clear that it is a vandalism only IP. One can create a written plan for dealing with this, though it feels kinda <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEPy</a>. My own personal preference is to continue to let admins deal with each vandal on a case-by-case basis and continue the fine work they are doing. And hey, if some admin rejects a block request, remember that a) if the vandal returns, report them again, and chances are they will eventually be blocked b) if they never return, who cares, they didn't need to be blocked anyways. Anyways, that's alot more than 2 cents, but its how I feel on this one. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regrettably, although I have only been involved with <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> for a relatively short time, it has been already made clear to me that the 1-hour activity-window criterion is, in fact, the standard practice and <i>is</i>, contrary to what you claim, being blindly applied.

<p>&lt;-return To respond to <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a>: what I see is a specific dispute with a specific admin over a single judgement call, not some systemic failure to deal with long-term anonymous vandals. It is debatable whether the IP in question meets the threshold for a long-term persistant vandal. 14 edits is pretty miniscule, IMHO. The kind of vandals I am thinking of when I wrote the above have scores of nothing but vandalous edits spread over weeks and weeks. I would disagree that this IP represents a long-term vandal. Bring up someone with 100 vandalous edits with the once or twice a day pattern you describe. As a counter example, look at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/203.208.88.138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/203.208.88.138" rel="nofollow">this contrib list</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:203.208.88.138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:203.208.88.138" rel="nofollow">this block log</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114565812" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114565812" rel="nofollow">this dif from AIV</a>. I reported a slow moving vandal that showed up 2-3 times a day and spaced their edits over several hours. My report by all acounts was stale (7 hours after last edit and warning) and yet, within 3 minutes of my report, the block was issued. What seems to be at issue here is the difference between a <i>punitive</i> block and a <i>damage control</i> block. Blocking a user who has not edited for hours simply because 3 hours ago they blanked a page does not seem to be stopping anything. 14 edits does not a major problem make. The people at RFPP will be glad to semiprotect your page for you, and when this guy has 2 months of bad edits showing the block avoidance behavior you describe, come back and renominate for block here. You will get a much better result. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 03:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really hope I misunderstood what you meant by your last post. Are you expecting me to stay watching this once-a-day vandal, reverting his blatant deletions and issuing ridiculously-named "final" warnings for 2 months before he will get blocked? Come on! 14 edits from a vandalism-only IP is more than sufficient; the fact that some vandals are getting the chance to reach the 100-edit mark is completely pathetic. I really hope you will not take these (admittedly angry) comments personally, but I honestly cannot stand this lax attitude favouring the vandals.</dd>
<dd>And, just to drive my point home, take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trance_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115169095" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trance_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115169095" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Nopes, only a single objectionable case, no grounds for blocking. Took place two hours ago; we would have 'missed' it anyway. Oh well. What's that you're saying? That this user's edits are identical to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.168.32.36_62cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.168.32.36">another user's</a>?

Heck, this guy must be really smart. Nah, no use reporting him to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>; that's already been tried.

<dd>Ok.. breathe.. in... out... relaxed? Good. Now the point I was hoping to make is that blocks are not meant to be punitive. The admins aren't punishing people for vandalising wikipedia. The block is about damage control: stopping a vandalism problem. No, my recommendation is NOT to stalk this IP address waiting for someone to use it to vandalise again. My recommendation is to go find some article to edit and work on it. If you find a vandal, and you think they need a block to control the damage being created, ask at AIV, but if they aren't blocked, move on. Simply wanting 14 edits over the course of a month to be "enough" to block an IP address for a long time does not mean that the admins will agree with you. Work with the admins to improve wikipedia; don't rail against them for failing to do your bidding. There are ways to deal with this problem, complaining isn't one of them. The whole point is you shouldn't be hunting specific IP addresses waiting for them to vandalise enough to be blocked. Interestingly, in the time we have been having this disussion I have requested blocks for 2 more vandals which were the kind of long-term, time-spaced vandals you claim aren't being blocked, and yes, they were blocked. They had far more than 14 bad edits, however. The kind of vandal you describe is routinely blocked by admins here, the problem is, the example you gave is <i>not that kind of vandal</i>. That doesn't mean you should wait around for that person to become that kind of vandal. It means leave them alone. If they continue to be a problem, renominate them again. If they aren't blocked, don't take it as a personal affront. Find another article that needs improvement, and make it better. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and if the problem is sockpuppetry, (users using multiple IPs or usernames to evade blocks) then you can report the problem at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets" rel="nofollow">suspected sock puppets</a> or better yet, just go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> and ask them to semiprotect the page in question. Then, no IP can vandalise the page. AIV is for dealing solely with simple vandalism by a single IP that is currently vandalizing. That does NOT MEAN that users being disruptive in other ways will not be blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> is exactly for dealing with the kinds of problems that require some investigation to deal with rather than simply quick blocks. Its not a question of allowing disruptions to go on, its simply reporting it to the right forum to deal with it. You don't call the paramedics if your house is broken into... likewise, you should report complex problems to the correct source. AIV is not designed to handle every kind of disruption. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am going to be succinct and straight-to-the-point:
<ul>
<li>I am fully aware that blocks are meant to be preventive and not punitive; however, it should more importantly be ensured that avoidance of the latter does not hinder execution of the former. In the vast majority of cases, failing to block the persistent vandals is only resulting in further disruptions which could have been prevented.</li>
<li>I find it unfair that this discussion is being treated as if I were merely "complaining" about a specific decision. In my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114882867" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114882867" rel="nofollow">second post above</a>, I linked to ample discussions where dozens of editors faced the same issue that I have presented.</li>
<li>Please stop being difficult. "[Do not stay] waiting for someone to use [the IP in question] to vandalise again" - the <b>same</b> person is <b>persistently</b> using the said IP to perform <b>identical</b> acts of vandalism. On the same article, same sections, same content.</li>
<li>If my specific case indeed belonged to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, then the header text of both articles should be reworded, as it is grossly misleading.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the above point, I find it highly incompetent of admins to simply dismiss (without taking action) any reports of vandalism which they deem require more investigation than they are ready (or capable) of performing. The least they could do is to refer them to (or just leave them intact for) someone else who can handle them. Wikipedia is slowly turning into a bureaucracy: for a simple report, editors are finding themselves being bounced from <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and now on to <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>. As if we are the ones who are requesting a favour from admins by trying to fight vandalism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To sum up, I am severely disappointed to find that no-one else appears to be preoccupied about this present state of complacency. I did not open this RfC to bring one or two admins round to my point-of-view, but to close what I perceived to be a serious loophole in Wikipedia policy. I would like to thank the two editors who contributed to this discussion; however, I am considering this RfC closed from my side. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>: If you want to reply to my last set of statements, feel free to do so, <s>but I will not be posting again unless a point actually worth discussing is raised</s>.

<dd>What a lot of people don't seem to realize is that we're <i>already</i> pushing the boundaries of vandalism control. The original idea was to allow everyone to edit every page, all the time. One could argue that that's an impractical idea (and I <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_Wonkapedia_4860.html" title="User:Kafziel/Wonkapedia">agree with you</a>) but the point is that right now we're doing our best to balance freedom with damage control. I know it can be frustrating - believe me, it's just as frustrating for us to remove reports as it is for you to have them removed - but Wikipedia has made it this far, and it's not about to fall apart now.

<p>I have sympathy with both "sides" of this. I nearly always find my reports at AIV blocked. Because I'm interested in becoming an admin and want to develop my skills (I know that inappropriate blocks are sometimes a problem, especially with new admins) I follow through with admins on the rare occasions when I think they've been unduly lenient. This has taught me much. For an example, see Kafziel's talk page just today. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 15:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">What this means</span></h3>
<p>If we are blocking vandals for edits they made a while ago, that is a punitive block. There is no way to get around the fact that a block for vandalism which is not currently happening is punitive. I'm not passing any judgement on whether or not that's good, but it's important that people who support this realize it, and accept it. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 04:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I want to add a few words to this discussion, based on my two-years experience in blocking vandals. I have about 1,000 articles on my watchlist, articles I have written myself either completely or for the greater part (the many thousands of small changes to other articles are not on my watchlist). Every day I have to spend one to two hours checking all these changes, half of which consist of vandalism. These vandalisms may have been reverted already (but I have to check anyway) or still have to be reverted. In other words vandals cause me to waste minimum a whole hour every day with their antics. How many other serious contributors find themselves in the same position&#160;? In other words, vandals cause a waste of time of thousands of hours (probably much more) every day, when checking the watchlist. And I’m not speaking yet of the vast amount of time that goes in the intervention against vandalism (user warnings, blocking…). In other words, vandalism is a serious problem on Wikipedia. How to deal with this&#160;? Can we remain as lenient as we have been up to now or are stronger measures needed&#160;? This has been debated many times on this talk page, with leniency being favored in the end. I think of myself that I have been rather lenient when blocking vandals. But then I start wondering what is more important&#160;: being nice and lenient or the huge waste of precious time caused by this policy. I think the time has come to become more stricter in our policies and not shy away from harsher measures. This should be debated again. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 09:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Usernames at AIV</span></h2>
<p>A couple of users insist on bringing every username that contain words like 'lol', 'omg' and anything that might be construed as even slightly amusing to AIV. Can we have a rule that goes something like this: "Unless usernames contain one of the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_dirty_words.html" title="Seven dirty words">seven dirty words</a>, they are not blockable upon sight"? OK, so maybe I'm joking, but only a little bit. It's kinda tiresome to remove usernames which "might be a clear violation of username policy" (that was seriously what someone wrote a couple of nights ago). I think this is what RFCN is for. – <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms"><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a>_<a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta"><b>dzasta</b></a></span> 07:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can usually tell the ones that no admins think are clear violations because they sit on AIV for a while until the backlog of real vandals is clear. Because that's when it usually happens, at backlog time! I think we need to let the users who are reporting them know when we come across one we aren't going to block, because I am fairly sure it is just a handful of people who are reporting them on a regular basis. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hotep</a> 08:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree about trying to notify the users who list this type of name, in particular - I understand that there are too many reports to always notify someone when a report they make isn't blocked, but I suspect that these people just aren't paying attention to the history and seeing their entries removed, or, even if they are, simply don't understand that they're not appropriate. Some of the edit summaries I've seen recently when these are removed make it clear that some admins are (justifiably) getting quite frustrated with them - better notification when this happens is probably the best way to limit it. I'll keep an eye out for this type of entry being removed, and try to notify some of the reporters myself if they haven't already been notified. —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/r/e/User_talk%7EKrellis_922e.html" title="User talk:Krellis">Talk</a>)</small> 16:14, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, I didn't mean to imply that all TWINKLE users get it wrong (in fact, it's a very low percentage) or that TWINKLE itself gets it wrong, but as both of you have suggested, perhaps make it clearer to those (perhaps newer users) who use it what goes where. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 01:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What annoys me is when someone posts a username that is a clear violation and some admin removes it with an edit summary to the effect of "Username violations don't go here". I haven't seen it happen often, but it is extremely annoying when it does happen, especially when the RFCN page then sits there with person after person putting "Disallow, obvious violation" for the next however many hours for no apparent reason while the user remains unblocked. An example off the top of my head (not one I reported though) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=111238124&amp;oldid=111237789|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=111238124&amp;oldid=111237789|" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>.

<dd>One tricky issue is that something could be a clear violation of user name policy, but not fall into the "attacks and profanity" range. I think for ones that are clear, but not threatening, the user should be asked to change the name, but that's just me. If there is no response, then maybe it could go to AIV since it's a clear violation and requests to change it have been ignored. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 05:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion one should follow the standard process of posting {{subst:<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>|reason for objection}} on the user's talkpage in cases like those you describe, but my main point is that there is no reason to post an obvious violation on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> instead of here after doing so. RFCN is a page to request comment about possibly questionable usernames (hence the name), not a place to post obvious violations for blocking. It is highly inefficient to do so, because far fewer admins watch the page and many don't seem to block obvious cases until hours of pointless debate has ensued. People moving obvious violations from here to RFCN (which happens rather regularly) is nothing more than a complete waste of everyone's time.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 05:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In the end, I think just notifying people would be the best option. (To my knowledge, all the ones I've reported have been blocked, but I try to report only the most egregious cases. And I do use Twinkle.) Maybe develop a bit that could go on <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> to refer people to, or a short guideline? Granted, people that come in with "EditorNameIsAnInsertProfanityHere" type ones should be blocked on sight, but someone that picks "Britney Spears" or something is probably just unaware it's not allowed and should be dealt with a lot more gently. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 06:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You need to demonstrate you have tried very hard to modify the behavior of the user, that you have warned him several times, and that all efforts have been void.

<dd>Punish? With what? And how? If people are persistent problems, we can block them. If they can't take a hint, we can break out a few heavier tools. I've only taken things to an ISP once, and it was for a very serious problem. I'd really prefer to limit our jurisdiction to on-wiki events. That said, truly persistent problems can and should receive longer blocks, in my opinion -- not to punish them, but to prevent a pointless drain on resources which could be better spent elsewhere.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding "1=" to username in vandal/userlinks templates</span></h2>
<p>There has been a complaint that usernames containing equal signs (like <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbailey%3Dlegend_d8e3.html" title="User:Billbailey=legend">Billbailey=legend</a>) "break" templates like {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserlinks_5339.html" title="Template:Userlinks">userlinks</a>}}. The solution is simple: prefix such usernames with "<b>1=</b>" (or "<b>User=</b>") when putting them in as parameters. This isn't necessary for other usernames, but doesn't hurt either. That is, "<b>1=</b>" could safely and usefully be prefixed as the default format. May I suggest that the WP:AIV header <b>and header template</b> be modified to add the "<b>1=</b>" accordingly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Registered Users:<br />
* {{Vandal|<b>1=</b>username}} optional brief reason for listing (keep it short) ~~~~<br />
* {{Userlinks|<b>1=</b>username}} optional brief reason for listing (keep it short) ~~~~</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would also require a coding change in the HBC AIV helperbot, to parse the username looking for the "Vandal|<b>1=</b><i>username</i>" first, then look for just "Vandal|<i>username</i>" if the "<b>1=</b>" isn't found. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_22f7.html" title="User talk:Ben"><b>TALK</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 00:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I must apologize: I reported inaccurately that an abnormally large number of accounts were created over a period of five minutes. What happened was that all account creations were reported during the database resynch, while other edits were not, so that it appeared as though account creation was the only editing going on. That said, the current account creation rate is ~6/minute during the daytime, measuring in the several thousand per day. Is there a record somewhere of the statistics of editing from all accounts?

<p>I am not sure, but I accidentally came across a vandal when I looked up Antithesis. It is an IP address, and I think it belongs to BELLCO. However, I am not sure whether it is a shared address. The IP is 68.212.55.125. I do not want to put in links, as I am not good at that. Anyway, I checked on the vandal's history, and it was his first vandalization. I left a warning to the user. However, today I found out that the user vandalized two more pages. Could you check wither this is a shared IP address so that it can be marked accordingly? The user inserted several random vulgar comments. Please reply, and I will keep a watch on this user. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/e/e/User%7EHeero_Kirashami_0ad4.html" title="User:Heero Kirashami">Heero Kirashami</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/e/User_talk%7EHeero_Kirashami_5f9e.html" title="User talk:Heero Kirashami">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heero_Kirashami_bb9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heero Kirashami">contribs</a>) 00:37, 23 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I've seen people blocked with a single warning...issued after the last incident of vandalism.

<dd>For me they must have had a 3rd or 4th level warning (one that mentions they will be blocked) and have vandalised after that was issued - at least 2 minutes after it so they have had a chance to see the warning. For IPs the vandalism must have occured within the last 30 minutes to an hour and the final warning must have been for the most recent vandalism spree not one a day ago. I never block a user as against an IP) indef straight off for vandalism, they always recieve a 24 hour block first to give them a chance, even if all their edits are vandalism - but I think I am in a minority for that one. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the problem is that people are waaaay too trigger-happy with the bv template. It gets so overused that a lot of us don't think of it as a final warning anymore. That's probably what you came up against in the past. If there's a full series of warnings, I'd consider bv an acceptable last warning. But if it's given the first time a user ever vandalizes a page in some minor way, I don't consider it a "first and only warning" type of thing. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 23:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

Doesn't last mean well, last?

The length of time between acts of vandalism actually means the vandal is MORE persistent rather than less because they have remained a vandal for so long a period. IMO, those vandals who do their thing only once a week shouldn't get a "break" because of the occasion of their actions. It is their consistency that should determine their status as persistent. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 01:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is what I thought as well. If a user has done 24 edits over the period of 2 years, and not a single one of them is constructive, wouldn't that be a persistent (though infrequent) vandal?--Rsl12 16:15, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would think someone who vandalizes 24 times and does nothing but vandalize should be recognized as a persistent vandal despite the length of time between "events." I suspect the problem with getting a block applied to such a vandal might have more to do with the requirement that a vandal be "active now" rather than that s/he is persistent, though that guideline seems to be rather vaguely applied as well. I've seen a couple of instances where the IP vandal report was removed because the vandal had stopped... for the moment. (Some admins remove a vandal report if the vandal hasn't done anything in the last 15-20 minutes or so, which strikes me as strange.) A glance at the address' activity, however, makes it pretty clear the vandal didn't really stop... s/he just went to bed. They'll vandalize again 20-30 hours later when they get home from work/school, eat a meal and sit down at the computer next. Or maybe the next day because they're busy an evening or two with band practice or whatever. Personally, I think the length of blocks should be scaled to the vandal's "period of persistence" if you will. That is, if they vandalize once a week they should be blocked (after the appropriate warnings) for a week in hopes they will actually discover they were blocked and actually stopping their next vandalism. The frequency should determine how often (not how long) the vandal gets blocked. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeman_7ef2.html" title="User:Geeman">Geeman</a> 05:03, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Long term IP vandals</span></h2>
<p>I understand that there's assumption that most IPs are dynamic and so shouldn't be blocled for a long time. But I was just removing vandalism and I came across one that seems pretty stable and is nothing but a source of vandalism. If an IP has a long history or vandalism why wouldn't it make sense to put a longer block on? Say a couple months, nothing permanent but long enough to maybe stop him next time? 67.63.207.98 is the IP I'm talking about. Another question is why can't I add to the reporting page, even if I did want to add someone I couldn't...anyway, questions from a newcomer. <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihilon_dd87.html" title="User:Nihilon">Nihilon</a> 15:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A lot of long-term vandals are schools, so warning and blocking them doesn't really accomplish what is intended because the students just hop on and hop off the computers at their leisure. Blocks usually last for a day or so, enough for the vandal to lose interest for that day. About your reporting problem, the page is <a href="../../../s/e/m/WP%7ESEMI_521e.html" title="WP:SEMI">semi-protected</a> so that only users who have been registered for 4 days or more can edit it. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 16:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's understandable, I should been clearer. The IP I used as an example has done nothing but vandalism in it's whole edit history (going back to last fall). I understand there are proxys and so on out there but in this case for example a longer block wouldn't seem to prevent any good contributors. <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihilon_dd87.html" title="User:Nihilon">Nihilon</a> 16:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Except that if this IS a school, there is a very good chance that sometime in the future a positive contributor could come from this IP. Still, even in such cases, a 6-month school block can be issued to minimize damage if particularly eggregious. Just some things to consider. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 05:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's usually easy to figure out whether an IP is registered to a school system using standard network utilities such as <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whois.html" title="Whois">whois</a>. Very often it's possible to locate the specific school. I've been tagging these with {{schoolIP|name and locale of the school}} as I run across them. There may be exceptions, such as tiny schools that dial in, but I suspect they are rare. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 06:01, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wondering, any chance the final warning rule can be loosened today in the case of obvious, repeat vandals? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotman1974_0598.html" title="User:Robotman1974">Robotman</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobotman1974_2283.html" title="User talk:Robotman1974"><sup>1974</sup></a> 02:43, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, but remember you can start with {{vandalism4im}} if the situation warrants. It's a blunt instrument and not to be applied without cause. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 06:03, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, you can feel free to skip warnings, probably 2 and/or 3. 1-4 isn't a required pattern. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 06:06, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually, use 4im (or BV) if it's particularly nasty, malicious, or obviously intentional vandalism.
