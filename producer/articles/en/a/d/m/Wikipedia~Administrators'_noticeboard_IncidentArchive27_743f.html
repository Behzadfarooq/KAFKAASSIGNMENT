<p><b>Comments:</b> He is engaging in an edit war. So far within 24 hours I have reverted a total of three times and he has a total of four on homosexuality. It is concerning the Epic of Gilgamesh and its homosexuality, something that has been accepted for months now on Wikipedia. An acclaimed scholar last year translated a previously untranslated portion of the 12 tablet containing male homosexuality. Unfortuantely Mikkalai's attitude is "since I, myself, have not read the new book, it must be a lie." Also, I just noticed I myself reverted the article Epic of Gilgamesh four times and he did five. I herby report myself as well. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.41.186.237.html" title="User:67.41.186.237">67.41.186.237</a> 03:17, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The user cannot count. The fourth revert was of user:69.235.29.7. His edits are left intact. I decided to abandon the case. I even did not block this guy for <b>his</b> 3-RR violation. His aggression and lack of listening to common sence is outrageous, and I am sure some other editors will deal with him.

<li>I'm sorry to play the devil's advocate here, but it doesn't seem this anon was properly informed of the controversy surrounding the issue. I think this should be done before he's ever blocked. If he doesn't know, he may genuinely feel the insertion of whatever language name it was is spam, therefore making his edit summaries quite understandable. In short, I'd say, try to inform them first. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:05, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not "interesting", it's merely an attempt to imply something by someone without the courage to say something directly, all as way to direct attention away from his dishonest avoidance of the straightforward facts.

<p>I don't know who closed the Gdansk enforcement vote, but it obviously has no authority to gainsay the 3RR. Only 50 out of 78 votes to support it. After 6 voters were excluded for low edit counts, the figure was only 44 out of 72. These figures wouldn't be a rough consensus even by a generous 2/3 standard. By contrast <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> passed by something like 159 to 28. I really don't mind if the Gdansk/Danzig people want to inflict these rules on one another, but I think we should draw the line when they claim to be exempt from the strongly supported <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> because of a mere 50 votes.</p>
<p>I have altered the vote conclusion and general notice to conform to a more realistic intepretation of the vote, bnut I won't get involved in it beyond that. It just isn't worth the time. However I hope we all will strongly oppose any further attempt to alter the 3RR on the basis of that flawed vote. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:56, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "Talk:Gdansk/Vote rule" describes a (slim) consensus, i.e. reverting to the "rule" version may be reverting to the "consensus" version. However, "reverts to the consensus version" are <i>not</i> exempt from the 3RR. Why, if it really <i>is</i> the consensus version, there should be no need to break it, since lots of other editors will do the same revert, sooner rather than later. The only reverts exempt from 3RR are those of clear vandalism. Altering the consensus version is not considered vandalism. Thus, I basically agree with Tony: you break the 3RR, you'll be blocked, Gdansk/Vote or no Gdansk/Vote. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:05, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Tony. Also, note that the most disputed part (Period from 1466 to 1793) was 47:48 (!) before the exclusion of users with few previous edits - which I support in spirit but is not supported by any existing policy or semi-policy! And once agains, it comes back to the problem with current <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_guidelines_ef72.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey guidelines">Wikipedia:Survey guidelines</a> - they don't specificy required majority, consensus, anything, and thus the Gdansk/Vote is open for dispute after dispute (and plz note that this as this is not the fault of Gdansk/Vote but wider policy fault - thus it may and will cause more disruption as more votes are disputed, unless we fix the policy - please comment on my proposal at [[Template_talk:Gdansk-Vote-Notice#Constructive_proposal]. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 11:08, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm acting in accordance with the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">Talk:Gdansk/Vote</a>. It says specifically that <i>For Gdansk and other locations that share a history between Germany and Poland, the first reference of one name in an article should also include a reference to other names</i>. Since this rule is often interpreted very broadly (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a>'s revert war on <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacznosciowiec_Szczecin_27ce.html" title="Lacznosciowiec Szczecin">Lacznosciowiec Szczecin</a>, for instance), I took the liberty to act accordingly and add the cross-naming to German cities that have a mixed Polish-German history.

<dd>I'm sure that Halibutt could provide some specious explanation of why Aachen shares a past between Germany and Poland, but this is clearly against the intended meaning of "sharing a history" in the vote - it is quite clearly against the spirit of the policy, and is very clearly an example of disrupting wikipedia to prove a point. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:55, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While it has been correctly pointed out that this borders on POINT, and I'd ask Halibutt to stop this, I'd like to note that this serves to illustrate the fact that the vote needs to be reexamined. Also, Halibutt's behaviour is not far from that of Chris or several other users. We need not only to redo the vote, but well before we do this we need a clear policy on such votes, or no matter what the results, this will happen over and over again, and affect whatever future votes we may held. Plese check the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Template_talk%7EGdansk-Vote-Notice_0690.html#Constructive_proposal" title="Template talk:Gdansk-Vote-Notice">Template_talk:Gdansk-Vote-Notice#Constructive_proposal</a>. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 10:30, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a sidenote to what many of you said: I'm not trying to prove any point here, I'm merely following the rules set by the voting and the interpretation established by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">User:Chris 73</a> and many others. If it made you understand the flaws in the rules - I couldn't be more happy. However, it was not my intention to show it to anyone or to prove it in any way. And please stop accusing me of breaking the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> since it's not the case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, what exactly would be the point I'm allegedly trying to prove? Finally, what exactly is wrong with my behaviour? I'm only enforcing the Wikipedia's Community Consensus, reached through wikipedia-wide voting. Perhaps if I tried to break it or fight against it you could ban me or question my behaviour. But it's the contrary: I'm trying to enforce it - yet I'm being bashed and reverted by as honourable wikipedians as <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">User:Mackensen</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">User:John Kenney</a> or <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">User:RickK</a> (the latter even threatened me on my talk page that I will be blocked from editing - yet without stating a reason). They revert my edits to the article on the former Polish capital - without explanation - yet they claim that it is my behaviour that should be changed... Strange? To me it seems so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And now <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">User:Chris 73</a>, who established the same rules I'm following now, has listed me here as someone who is trying to <i>demonstrate a parody</i>. What the heck is that? Gentlement, the voting might be right or wrong, it's none of my business to judge it. But once some of us are allowed to follow it literally, all should be given the same right. Or perhaps I am wrong? Perhaps some of us have more rights than the others? Perhaps the voting was applicable only to Polish cities? If so, please be so kind as to cite the exact place where it is written.</dd>

<dd>Your actions and those of <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">User:Chris 73</a> are not similar. The exact text of Vote 9 at <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">Talk:Gdansk/Vote</a> was:
<dl>
<dd><i>The naming of many places in the region that share a history between Germany and Poland are also a source of edit wars. For these places, the first reference of one name should also include a reference to other commonly used names, e.g. Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) or Szczecin (Stettin). An English language reference that primarily uses this name should be provided on the talk page if a dispute arises.</i></dd>

<dd>Now when Chris 73 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Szczecin-Klucz&amp;diff=14737380&amp;oldid=14737341" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Szczecin-Klucz&amp;diff=14737380&amp;oldid=14737341" rel="nofollow">adds "(Stettin)"</a> to the first reference in an article, it follows the most reasonable interpretation of this text.</dd>
<dd>However, to interpret the text of the proposal in a way that it applies to, for example, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig_%28city%29.html" title="Braunschweig (city)">Braunschweig (city)</a>, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Braunschweig_%28city%29&amp;diff=14745167&amp;oldid=14743684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Braunschweig_%28city%29&amp;diff=14745167&amp;oldid=14743684" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, you have to use a very unnatural interpretation of:
<ol>
<li>"the region": Braunschweig is not in the same region as Stettin or Gdansk, as most people would define regions;</li>
<li>"share a history": most people seem to interpret it as "was a part of both countries", only you use the definition: "there were some Polish people there";</li>
<li>"commonly used names": Brunszwik is not a commonly used name (at least not in English);</li>
<li>"English language reference": both on <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBraunschweig_%28city%29_2468.html" title="Talk:Braunschweig (city)">Talk:Braunschweig (city)</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMainz_db6b.html" title="Talk:Mainz">Talk:Mainz</a>, you pointed at a google search, which only returned a very few pages in badly-written English by Polish authors, that weren't even about those cities.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Seeing that those are all tenuous interpretations; that you yourself think that it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Braunschweig_%28city%29&amp;diff=14747420&amp;oldid=14745575" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Braunschweig_%28city%29&amp;diff=14747420&amp;oldid=14745575" rel="nofollow">absurd</a> what you are doing, and that you don't like doing it; that you are only doing this because of the community's consensus, but that you haven't found a single supporter of these actions; that none of your changes actually stick, as all of them are reverted immediately; and that the only thing you accomplish is to annoy your fellow contributors; wouldn't it be better if you ended this crusade?</dd>

<dd>Some additional comments to the comment by Eugene van der Pijll. Since the outcome of the vote i have not really added any double naming to an article. However, I have reverted mass removals of double naming while enforcing the vote. While doing so, there may have been a few questionable reverts (i.e. a handball team in gdansk), where double naming may or may not have been neccessary. Additionally, some users complained about <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_language.html" title="Germanic language">Germanic language</a> vs. <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a> links (as in the revert link you randomly picked). Hence I also occasionally change a Germanic language link to German language as suggested by halibutt. My edits are not perfect, but I try my best to work in the spirit of the vote.

I didn't mean to pick on you (Chris) personally; so Halibutt, if you have an edit by someone else than Chris, that you feel: 1) contravenes the outcome of the vote, and 2) is accepted as a valid edit by "us", the other wikipedians; that would be a good example too.) <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 17:14, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Halibutt, if you are being reverted and warned by three separate admins, I would tend to take that as evidence your edits are not in good faith. That, in addition to <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a>'s well reasoned comments, and your own comments, lead to a clear indication that you are not editing in good faith and are violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. If you were being clearly helpful and trying to improve Wikipedia, and achieve consensus on these issues, it is likely you wouldn't have so many different people claiming you are not being helpful.

<dd>Hmmm. Well, to really do it right, you need to convert them to binary and see how long the common strings of bits on the left-hand-side is. But let's see, the existensce of both 190 and 217 in the third byte means the range spans the 10xxxxxx to 11xxxxxx boundary (which is at 192 decimal), so you'd need a /15, i.e. block from 80.141.128.0 to 80.141.255.255. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:56, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Deleting comments made by other users is vandalism, in my opinion, and so any reverts to restore said comments aren't covered by the 3RR.

<dd>Yup, it is disputed and you are one of the sides in that dispute.

<dd>Chris, I must agree, you are a party to the dispute, so you should not have protected the template. Instead, post here, and ask another admin to do it, don't do it yourself. So please unprotect it, and someone else can protect it if they agree it should be. I do however, tend to agree with the protection, because inserting disputed in the template is disruptive, as the template appears on a lot of pages. Also Witkacy's changing the vote results in the template appears improper, since clearly there were a number of questionable votes. The criteria for what votes would be counted was applied equally to all votes (and favored each side in different cases), so using the removed votes now as a basis for changing the template is improper. Consensus would be needed on the talk page for that change to the vote results. I would actually suggest re-voting, only for the disputed period in order to clear up the issue. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:49, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that changing the vote results in the template is not the best option. However, both the result of the voting and the template itself (its shape and usage) are disputed on the talk page, so adding a {{disputed}} tag is appropriate. I believe that the tag should be added until all controversies are resolved. Also, retaking the vote seems a decent option. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 15:20, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with the disputed tag in the template, is that it then appears on the talk page of each article the template is used as saying "this article is disputed", which is most likely incorrect. It is not the article that is disputed, but the template message. Further, it's not really the template that is disputed, but the results of the vote. So the disputed tag can go on the template's talk page, but not in the template. So while Chris73 being the one to do the protecting was somewhat improper, it looks like it was the right thing to do. And to be pedantic, since what he did was the right thing, even though he shouldn't have been the one to do it, there aren't any sanctions that should be placed on him. I would consider this the end of the matter. The template's and the vote's talk page are the place to carry this further. If the results of the vote are to be changed (and therefore the content of the template), consensus on the talk page would be required. For the record, I have no stake in the dispute either way, and I would consider myself as neutral in this matter as it is possible to be. (Bordering on I simply don't care, except that the discussion is civil and conducted fairly.) - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:47, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Every time I wait for an IP check god kills a puppy.</b> was my first out loud laugh today. Wikipedia needs more humor, wit, and lightheartedness in the DISCUSSIONS (not articles). All the time I see childish rants about imagined slights (I don't see that here tho). My point is I think Wikipedia would benefit from an atmosphere on the talk pages that promoted humor and wit rather than took offense at it. Thanks for the laugh. 4.250.201.219 20:11, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Socks are not blockable <i>per se</i>, but I understand the concern that it could be GRider. How about we unblock him and tag all his edits on VfD as possible socks of a banned editor? This way he can continue to contribute to Wikipedia (which he's been doing very well for some time) and David will get more evidence for his sock puppet check from the edits he does. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:39, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My curiosity was raised on this issue when I saw a few edits in my watchlist to GRider's school watch page, and then one to the "redirected without consensus" section. At least at the times I happen to check my watchlist, few people edit that section and so I decided to take a look at the users contributions. What struck me was that all bar about 2 or 3 of their several hundred edits were to widely disperate school articles or school related pages. David Gerard's original comments were that GRider and the other accounts he blocked at the time were "being used as role accounts by someone" (or words to that effect). Having nearly 100% of edits to any single theme is not typical behaviour of the vast majority of wikipedians. Combined with the schools topic, the GRider/Schoolwatch edits and the VfD votes I had enough of a suspician to consider it worth my while sharing them. If you look again at my first note on this subject, you will see that I didn't call for him to be blocked, nor did I block him myself. I am suspicious enough that if IP evidence were not available I would certainly investigate further (e.g. editing times, wording of VfD votes, etc), and if nothign contradicted my inital impression then I would consider a block. In the event I posted here, so others were aware of my suspicians, and DG's talk page to request an IP check. Also, as David was the one investigting the last tranche of sockpuppets, he will likely familar with his MO. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 21:35, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm always at least a little worried when anyone has "Wikipedia" or some variant in their username that it will be especially confusing to newbies who may think the user has some kind of official status. Further identifying it as a "Bank" is just asking for trouble.

<dd>I've been keeping an eye on the "Bank" for a while now. It was odd, and something about the user's style bothered me, but I figured it was harmless.

And once he posted his "rules" I was pretty sure (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=14728947#Advice_on_username_block" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=14728947#Advice_on_username_block" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>).

<dd>If it's Iasson, that's a blockable offense in itself. He doesn't have to do anything blockable per se, since using sockpuppets for the purpose of getting around a block is blockable. However, in order for this to stick, we need some fairly substantial evidence that it's Iasson. So far, I agree that this seems to be Iasson. If I were an admin though, I'd probably do a little more digging before I block. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 12:31, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You would want to talk to Fennec about this - the IRC channel is not official, and my status as an op there is unrelated to any status on Wikipedia proper. He's the final court of appeal.

<li><i>go back to the GNAA, SPUI</i> doesn't have a friendly tone to it. Sure it correctly characterizes SPUI as a GNAA member, but it also implies he isn't wanted in the discussion. Nevertheless, let it be clear that I totally agree with him being blocked. There's no place for the comment "fuck off" whether you're provoked or not. Unless it's to discuss the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> article it's the kind of language that sparks arguments and it shouldn't be allowed EVER.

<p>has there been any discussion about making the irc channel at least semi-official? Given the importance the exchanges on irc seem to play for community interaction, and given how naturally people here discuss events on #wikipedia (as opposed to any random irc channel) as wikipedia-related, it seems to be <i>de facto</i> wikipedia turf, and should possibly acknowledged as such, <i>de jure</i>. Otherwise, imho, it is the same as any other chat forum on the internet, and should be considered as having no relevance to the goings-on on wikipedia at all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Statement, not a "threat" (if that can be called such): if this channel gets to be any more "official" than it currently is, don't count on ever seeing me there again. The whole <i>point</i> of the channel is so we can go there and discuss things in a way that wouldn't be appropriate or useful were it done on the wiki. That does include informal and unproductive discussions as well. I refuse to see this as any more than what it is: petty squabbling. Were people blocked from editing? Did this affect the encyclopedia in any way, aside from editors becoming slightly less productive? No. We're wasting our time. This should have never been taken to the wiki, let alone here. If anything it demonstrates the need for a separate way of discussing IRC issues, not to make the IRC channel more wiki-like. That would completely ruin it, for me at least.</dd>
<dd>If you have problems with someone on the wiki, start an RFC or an RFAr. If you have problems with someone on IRC, well frankly I don't know what you do, because I just can't take a hundred or so people chatting about whatever comes to mind seriously enough, but whatever you do, don't do it here. IRC is IRC and wiki is wiki and never the twain should meet. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 20:39, 2005 Jun 6 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps we need #wikipedia-rfc and #wikipedia-rfar channels for the off-wiki disputes. :) It would be pointless to try and make #wikipedia official.

<li>The evidenced reverts are not breaking the 3RR rule, as they are not done on the same day. And just look above for the same argument about the other party in this debate. This is taking us nowhere.

<li>For an admin, you certainly don't know very much about the 3RR, namely that it applies to 24 hour periods, not calendar days (which, rather blantantly obviously, differ depending on where you are in the world). And you, being involved in the dispute, are abusing your powers by interfering in administrative decisions. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 22:01, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am involved in the dispute as you are, trying to cool heads here. I concede that Halibutt has done 4 reverts in 24h period, but I see his excuse - that he was empowered to this by vote - as valid one. Both sides are arguing that they can avoid 3RR (if broken) because of unclear vote results. What authority gives you the right to decide one is right? I don't think anybody here has such a right - I certainly don't presume myself to be the oracle here - thus I am encouraging fixing the policy. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 22:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the other side appears to have abided by the 3RR, and spent most of the past day asking Halibutt to stop. Has anyone else broken the rule, or claimed the right to? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 22:13, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>a) I'm not involved in the Polish/German dispute. You are. b) If there is any doubt whatsoever as to the applicability of this "immunity" policy, it cannot be used as a basis to overrule the 3RR. I'm not going to let a disputed vote on an article talk page overrule official Wikipedia policy. Anyway, he should have been blocked for disruption even if he hadn't broken the 3RR. He's causing havoc, and that's not acceptable. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 22:18, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither am I - I have yet to do a single revert on this matter. Both sides have been asking the other sides to talk, and both sides have violated the 3RR and claimed immunity based on the Vote results. Consider also that one side is represented by a well-known an administrator and one is not before you judge the support votes. I see both parties as quilty, and perhaps all users involved in the reverts should be blocked for a day to make them stop their POINT, but I strongly object to blocking only one party. Each side has arguments backing them, and they can't be discarded - it only points to our loopholes in voting policy, and this is why I am trying to make people do the constructive thing - improve the policy - instead of pointing fingers and trying to put a blame on one user. Chris has already agreed with me that policy needs fixing, Halibutt has done the same, so we should make an effort to cool tempers down, not inflame them by blocking one side, which has claimed immunity and can rightly state that if they are blocked, so should be their opponents, since both sides are claiming the very same arguments. In the end, if you want to block one of them and assign blame, I am afraid it would have to go to ArbCom - we have no authority to decide this matter. So please, can we work on improving the policy? Although all arguments on talk pages of involved parties you can make, the better, and I hope this ban threat will make Halibutt more reasonable - I am just afraid it may encourage Chris to the opposite (pray I am wrong). --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 22:24, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe there is a policy that says that four or more reverts in a 24-hour period may result in a 24 hour block. I cannot see how Halibutt is exempt.

<dd>Halibutt emailed me 4 hours ago, saying that he is still blocked (that is 34h after his orginal block. IIRC he bas blocked around ~2100 on 6th, and he wrote the email to me ~0700 in 8th). I was under the impression that block would last 24h - unless you decided to block him pernamently? Also, he told me that Proteus is ignoring his emails. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 09:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I checked the logs. He was blocked, as I wrote, on ~2100 on 6th. He tried to log in 7th on 2300, which 26h after his orginal block. The block was still there. It looks to me like a violation of user rights, as 3RR rule clearly states blocks can be done UP TO 24h. And note that up to does not mean exactly 24h, it can be shorter. As for his offending email, I'd like to see it. I have known Halibutt for over a year and never to my knowledge he has offended anyone, and weighting his word against yours, I am inclined to put my trust on him. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 13:45, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Especially that there are other users here who were not blocked for the very same reason. Who exactly made Proteus responsible for which cases are compliant with the rules of the Talk:Gdansk/Vote and which are not? As far as I know, this right is reserved for Jimbo or ArbCom, not for any of the admins, even as honourable as Proteus.</dd>

<dd>I can understand Halibutt's complaints, if he genuinely doesn't understand that breaking the 3RR by using an interpretation of a "disputed" vote shared by virtually no other user as an excuse is unacceptable. But you are just being ridiculous, and demonstrating a lack of knowledge about the workings of Wikipedia that I find absolutely astonishing in an admin. Anyone can easily look at the block log and find the following:
<dl>
<dd>23:25, 6 Jun 2005 Proteus blocked "User:Halibutt" with an expiry time of 23 hours (reinstate block removed in violation of policy again)</dd>
<dd>23:05, 6 Jun 2005 Proteus blocked "User:Halibutt" with an expiry time of 23 hours (restore block)</dd>

<dd>Now, I guess there may be some confusion from time zones, but even so, my calculations do show that Halibutt was blocked for at least 33h. Now, I could understand a 2-3h difference (up to 27h), since after you blocked him, I unblocked him and RickK blocked him again at least 2h elapsed, and I'd assume his block was set for 24h, and thus it was reset by RickK reblocking. But, since you blocked him around 2100, and RickK reblocked him around 2300, the block should have expired around 2300-2400 next day (I am using my and Halibutt's timezone here). But Halibutt states he was still blocked at 0700 on the day after. That is 7h after a 24+2=26h block should have expired. How is that possible? I admit I know little about this mechanism, since I have not been involved in similar case prior to this (and I still consider this a giant waste of time of all parties involved). In any case, I think we can resolve this matter peacefully, if both sides can step forward and apologised for their mistakes: Halibutt, you should apologise for your actions. Setting aside the fact that other users act in a similar way and cite the very same vote for immunity (and yes, I think they should be punished as you were, but this is not the issue here), the fact is that your actions bordered on POINT and eventually broke the 3RR rule. Proteus, you (or whoever is responsible) should apologise to Halibutt for over-24h block (and clarify the insulting letter issue). Then we can go, fix the voting policy and have all this childish pointing fingers behind us.

It was you who blocked Halibutt, not Wikipedia itself, and you should accept responsibility for that - unless simple 'sorry' for you is impossible? So far, in the discussion between you and Halibutt I see you have offended him with allegiations you cannot support, not the other way around. Halibutt has every right (as specified by 3RR policy) to demand an explanation and your failure to respond to this borders on abuse of powers.

<dd>Piotrus, this is getting really tiresome. Please <i>provide a copy of a log entry</i> showing where Proteus blocked Halibutt for more than 24 hours, <b>or</b> stop making these wild accusations of "abuse of power", and apologize to Proteus. There is at least one known technical feature of Wikipedia (over which admins have no control) that can extend blocks (i.e. autoblocking), and there is also a possible bug that causes blocks not to be cleared (see, e.g. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive16_e059.html#User:William_M._Connolley" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive16">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive16#User:William M.

<dd>Well, if everybody sais it's a technical fault, I guess it really is - thank you for explaining it to me. But I would still like to see the offendig letter, because current reasoning by Proteus is very similar to Catch 22: 1) policy states a user blocked by admin can complain to him 2) Proteus thinks that complain disputes his reasoning thus it is automatically offending and may be discarded. See my problem? Now, if we see the letter and agree it was in fact offending, I will apologise to Proteus and warn Halibutt. But until this is resolved, I have every right to demand from people with power (i.e. admins) that they prove they are not abusing their power, don't I?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 11:14, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Piotrus, back down, apparently there's no sense in requiring common sense here. Let's just forget about the issue and stop wasting our time. I won't file a complain against Proteus, though I hope his behaviour improves with time. Also, perhaps we should modify the ban warning, since so far it says that you can contact the admin that blocked you but it doesn't mention the fact that you should not wait for any answer to come. Also, the 3RR should mention the fact that 24 hours here in WP might last for much longer. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 11:56, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

A controversial name change had been proposed. The proposal had not been highlighted so very few people participated. 5 took part. 3 supported the change. 2 opposed. Then <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> as an admin came to the page, cast their vote in favour of the change, and <i>within seconds</i> announced that there now was 66% support and moved the page.</p>
<p>It was a gross abuse of position for an admin to in effect cast a vote in a deadline free vote about which few people were aware, and about which the proposer of the motion had failed to draw people's attention to, and then immediately <i>themselves</i> move the page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Economic_history_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland&amp;diff=14797785&amp;oldid=14794519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Economic_history_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland&amp;diff=14797785&amp;oldid=14794519" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> It broke every principal of neutrality, impartiality, fairness, etc. If they wanted to vote, they should have then left it to others to implement the decision. But for an admin, <i>seconds</i> after voting, to shut down the vote and make the move on the basis of a majority their vote had produced, was a disgrace. Yet the admin doesn't seem to think they did anything wrong. How can users trust admins is one admin thinks it ok in effect to use their position to be judge and jury in the making of the decision. If they had a least left it for day or so to see if others might want to vote, and <i>then</i> come back, it might have been tolerable behaviour. But what they in effect did was highjack the debate, produce a decision and enforce it in less than a minute. That is unacceptable behaviour for an admin. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">22:36, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<dd>I have fully explained my actions on that talk page and think that this is mostly down to Jtdirl being upset that the vote went against him.

<dd>Violetriga's actions seem perfectly reasonable. A more important issue is Jtdirl's general comportment.

<p>Yes I disagreed with the decision, but that isn't the issue at all. I would be just as angry if someone on my side of the argument did that. <i>No</i> admin should intervene in a debate, cast a vote and in the same edit announce that there now was a consensus and make a change. No admin. Ever. The admin making the change should be neutral from the debate, or if a participant be returning to the page to implement <i>whatever</i> decision the participants had decided. They should not simultaneously be the person who casts a vote and <i>in the very same edit</i> then announce that their vote had now produced a decision and <i>immediately implement it</i>. For all we know, 30 seconds later another voter could have come along and cast a vote a different way and meant the consensus wasn't there anymore in numerical terms. It is wrong for <i>any</i> admin to do that. It is disrespectful to wikipedians and should never ever be done that way by any admin in any debate on any debate at any time. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">23:24, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<dd>And for all we know 30 days later nobody else might have voted - sorry, but that logic can't work when it's been over two weeks since the vote began. I find it more disrespectful to publicly berate a persons actions rather than dealing with it on their own talk page. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:27, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>30 days? I see votes in that poll going as far back as 22 May. What was the great rush, violetriga (and yes, that is a déjà vu on that question)? <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:46, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't say the poll was going on for 30 days - I said "over two weeks". The "great rush" was the fact that it'd gone on for a long time and I was asked to look into it. What is the point in waiting for another week? Why make myself have to keep track of such things when I'm just going to be annoying those that want it moved (which, by the way, are in the majority)? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 06:42, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>You were asked to look at the poll;</li>

<dd>That is <i>outrageous</i> behaviour. Other admins would never dream of using their vote to produce a two-thirds majority that was not previous there, and then use the outcome <i>produced by their own vote</i> instantly to rename a page. What is even more astonishing is that you don't see anything wrong in that behaviour. In parliaments, speakers follow what is known as <i>Speaker Denison's rule</i>, whereby if in a tied or indecisive vote their casting vote will result in either the maintenance of the status quo or the overturning of the status quo, they vote to maintain the status quo, on the basis that they would be breaching their independence if they used their casting vote to create a <i>new</i> decision. Instead they vote to leave <i>as is</i>, allowing the issue to be revisited later, or if their decision to vote one way produces an irrevocative decision (eg, the fall of a government, the killing of a bill) they vote in a way that allows a future decision to be taken (eg, defeat for a government would force it out of office - an irrovocable decision - support for a government allows a later decision to be taken in parliament to defeat them later on). The way you intervened broke every concept of good practice, fairness, and respect for users. If you wanted to vote and it was clear that your vote would be decisive, then you should have left it to others to do the move. Frankly, if this is the standard of behaviour you think is acceptable, then you are unfit to be an admin. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">18:56, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

Several articles were moved from "...Republic of Ireland" to "...Irish states" without any vote or consultation been taken some months ago and on a basic level this moving back is simply housekeeping and realigning article titles to more appropriate titles. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 19:22, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The issue is not where the page was moved to (though there is a fundamental issue of accuracy in putting articles under names that did not exist for most of the timespan covered by the articles). The issue <i>here</i> is one admin's blatent abuse (clearly not for the first time) of her powers to push per personal viewpoint. Admins have been sacked in the past for doing so, in cases far less clearcut than here, where an admin used her vote to create a majority and then in the same edit announced she was moving the page on the basis of that majority. That is disgraceful behaviour. The fact that she does not see that admins should not act that way, suggests clearly that she is unfit to be an admin. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">19:38, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<dd>Hi, I'm <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">Violet/riga</a>, have we met before? To comment on my suitability for being an admin without really knowing anything about me is hardly a sensible thing to do. Just because I disagree with you on this issue doesn't mean that I immediately assume that you're a problematic editor. I disagree with your point of view, and still think that it's coming out of annoyance from the decision rather than the action. You claim that the move shows bias? Well you know what? I really don't care about any Irish history and was only there because of a move request. My vote was based on opinion of the content of the article and naming of similar articles, and is very relevant. Now explain to me why I should've waited for other people to vote. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 19:47, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because you blurred two incompatible roles simultaneously. You were perfectly entitled to vote. You were perfectly entitled to implement the decision of the vote. But what should <i>never</i> be done is to cast a vote that produces a decision, and then instantly turn from being a participant in the vote to the enforcer of that vote. That crossed a fundamental line. It would have been an abuse of my position as an admin if I had turned up on a page where one more vote was needed to get the required majority, used my vote to produce that majority, turned around in the edit and said in effect 'oh look. There is a majority here' and implemented it there and then. If you wanted to vote, you should have stood back and let someone else not involved in the debate implement the decision. At the very least, you should have left the page until other votes were cast and then, a day or two later, see if the consensus your vote had created was still there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The principle should be not merely to <i>be</i> neutral in your conduct on moving the page but to be <i>seen</i> to be neutral. All sides need to be able to trust your impartiality in implementing that decision. It is possible to do so even if you have expressed a vote, provided it is not <i>your</i> vote that created the decision <i>you</i> then are implementing. Your actions set yourself up <i>simultaneously</i> as <i>judge</i> (implementing a decision) and <i>jury</i> (the voter who created the majority). That is imcompatible with your role as an admin and should never be done by anyone. Admins try to avoid using their powers on pages where they are an active participant, because, even if they are neutral in their own eyes, they may not be perceived as neutral. I try where possible to avoid being an admin <i>and</i> a contributor. There may be occasions when an admin who is a participant in a debate has had to intervene using admin powers (such as protecting a page) but we do so only in emergencies, only when immediate action is needed and where no other admin is available to act. In every case a full explanation is put on the talk page. All sides usually agree in those cases that the action was justified in the case and had all been done openly, fairly and honestly.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You simply have not have realised that what you did was fundamentally wrong, but it was. You <i>personally</i> created a decision which then you <i>personally, immediately</i> implemented. You should never do that. Having in effect sat on the jury there was no need for you in immediately leap on the bench, don the robes and assume the role of judge. Having voted, you should have left the implementation to someone else. Or at the very least given time to see whether others might vote to disagree with you, especially as your vote created the smallest conceivable percentage above two-thirds. Creating a majority and simultaneously implementing a decision you have been responsible for creating, is something no admin should ever do. You may not intended it that way, but it looked like an abuse of your role. In effect, what you did was to enter a page where there was no mathematical consensus for a move, used your vote to create that mathematical consensus, then enforced the consensus, and told the people on a page that would not have had a consensus without your consensus, that now <i>they</i> would have to build up a consensus to overrule you.</dd>

<dd>If you didn't understand the underlying principles behind the behaviour of admins <i>as admins</i> in using admin powers, perhaps they need to be spelt out more clearly.

<dd>And as I said above I still disagree. The fact that you see this as an abuse of admin rights is totally illogical when, in most circumstances, a move can be performed without admin intervention. You may try to argue that I moved it too quickly but cannot say that it was an abuse of admin rights. Secondly, if it were any random person that voted and then moments later I made a decision, you could still claim that there could've been further votes that tipped the balance the other way. Indeed, if you look at it that way no vote would ever end. The fact that there was a majority without my vote totally seems to escape you, and some could argue that the move should've been done because of that – there have in fact been recent discussions at WP:RM about what constitutes an actionable majority. By my view it is <i>you</i> that has acted improperly and caused the situation to look a farce simply by your outbursts on that articles talk page. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:11, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you still cannot see the problem, then frankly, you should not be an admin, for your own sake as much as for everyone else's, because if this is your concept of what an admin is, you are going to get yourself into severe problems. And BTW decisions on wikipedia are not decided by majority but by surpassing a set percentage that can be said to be a consensus. A vote of three people out of five does not quality as a consensus. Numerically four out of six <i>just about does</i>. So you created the numbers to justify the move, and then it looks like, rushed the implementation through in case another person might appear and reduce the total below the consensus threshhold.

Not all decisions on Wikipedia are not made by consensus - they should be where possible, but it simply cannot happen (VfD, for example). As per the rules of WP:RM the page should've been moved.

<p>I'm amazed and appalled that we're having such an inflammatory debate over this incident filled with charges that an admin is abusing her position. <b>May I remind everyone that you don't need to be an admin to move a page?</b> This action might have been taken by anyone, and still can be again (not that I wish to incite a move war).

<dd>Perhaps, but I agree with others in finding violet/riga's behaviour here questionable at best. When it's seen in light of the earlier issue to which El C referred (protecting a page in which he or she was editorially involved), I think that it indicates a certain lack of understanding of an admin's responsibilities. It's overheated (to say the least) to demand de-adminning or the like, but a re-reading of some of the documents on the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Administrators' reading list</a> mightn't be a bad idea. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:06, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's not any "we" having an inflammatory debate that's to be seen above, it's Jtdirl flaming violet/riga. At least, I can't see anybody else being inflammatory. Jtdirl, I don't even understand how a page move--something anybody can do, and undo! housekeeping! a move only five people were interested in!--can have the capacity for deserving that much abuse. You're the one breaking the concepts of "good practice, fairness, and respect for users" here. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:16, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I didn't realize that any user could move pages; I have never moved a page. Still, I never claimed to be a compotent admin (or editor, for that matter!). It struck me as analogous of the past incident, which I do not think I'm wrong over, though I don't find it important enough to press on. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:38, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually it's rather disingenuous to say that anyone can move pages; any user has the ability to do it (except anons and very new users), but when there's controversy, so that a poll is needed, there are accepted norms of behaviour. My view is that violet/riga behaved inadvisedly (at best) in this case, thought that's not because he/she's an admin — no editor should have done what she did. Nevertheless, as an admin, she should be more careful than other users (and the earlier incident <i>was</i> directly related to being an admin). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am very aware of the way move polls work. As I am the one that makes the WP:RM decisions, I decided to move it. The fact that my vote tipped it over the edge of the (previously non-existant) 66% rule is not relevant. My vote and my decision were unrelated. The simple fact is that the vote had been going on for over two weeks and decision needed to be made. I still haven't seen any decent explanation why I should've waited any longer. And as I said previously, if I'd decided one minute after any other user made the decisive vote would that still make it the wrong thing to do? Sorry, but I don't see anything wrong with what I did. People also seem to forget that it's hardly like it's a fixed decision and I explained what people could do if they disagreed with the move. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:32, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow. There have been a lot of electrons spilled over this topic, haven't there? I think that two weeks is plenty of time to consider a page move, so there's no problem there. There's no specific rule requiring a 66% majority for a move, so Violetriga hasn't overstepped or twisted a policy in that respect. Since she seems to be the only one who usually carries out pages moves, it seems unfair to bar her from ever having an opinion. In this case, I'd say she acted more like the chairperson at a meeting or the Speaker of the House in government. Normally those individuals don't vote on issues, but their judgement is called upon to break a tie. (Of course, this instance didn't even have a tie, violetriga was just adding a bit more weight to the preexisting majority.)

<li>I swore to myself (and at myself) that I would never, ever post on an/i. I might <i>act</i> on it, but I wouldn't post on it. Now I'll have to perform prayers of penitence. Folks very often follow the first red herring that swims by in these discussions, and so I'm doubly sorry that I'm about to release one into the stream, but for over a year I have thought that one of the most critical holes in the policy structure of Wikipedia is that lack of <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum.html" title="Quorum">quorum</a>. This is not to be on one or the other side of this particular page move, but rather to say that far too often people are claiming consensus in the dark. <b>Again, this is not to take a position on this particular issue,</b> only to say that, if anyone wishes to draft a quorum policy, I would be happy to lend whatever skills I have to the writing of it. One critical function of such a thing would be to establish where and when a quorum is needed. Page moves wouldn't need one, for the most part, so it wouldn't apply here, but it would at least relieve the concerns of folks to know that we have a quorum policy that says that it is not necessary for page moves. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:30, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>A light of common sense, Geogre.

<li>Indeed: when we say "consensus" we very rarely mean that everyone is happy with a position: at best, there is a plurality or supermajority. Just on a point of order, while VR executes most of the requests on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, particularly the ones that need an exercise of judgement, VR is not the <i>only</i> one to make page moves; however, I have to say that I would trust VR to exercise any judgement required properly (this case included). -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 17:03, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe that's that LaRouchites can't insert references to LaRouche into articles otherwise unrelated to him? Worryingly, that leaves an enormous amount of room for interpretation. To those of us who aren't LaRouchites, the idea that LaRouche is worth mentioning in a general article on economics seems rather silly, but to LaRouchites it seems preposterous to have an article about economics without mentioning him. So how do you decide what articles are unrelated to him? You'd have to side with one POV or the other if you were going to make judgements about these kinds of cases. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:30, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>On sock checks: at present the query in question is timing out (it's an expensive query so the server happily lets it die if it takes too long). On But, in any case: Herschel sockpuppetry: he only got busted as Weed Harper by &gt; &lt; this much last time (he slipped up) and the AC declared C Colden might as well be a sock owing to the IDENTICAL EDIT PATTERN and stuff.Herschel is not stupid and I expect he'd do a better job of sockpuppetry another time around - it's not hard. Please keep in mind that IP-username matching is not Magical Truth Sauce, <i>it only goes back a week or so anyway</i>, and that almost all socks are spotted the way they always have been, i.e. acting the bloody same. There are many banned users who have returned to Wikipedia under a new name and been left alone if they don't do something really dumb like make the same trouble again. And if someone imitates a blocked user sufficiently, they are liable to be blocked again.

<dd>The huge problem here is that the guy did nothing but edit some articles with a LaRouche POV, and he was labeled a sockpuppet as if there is only one LaRouchite in the world. Beyond that, I didn't see any other similarities, did anyone else? He left a note on my talk page referring to the LaRouche Youth Movement and Herschel called himself "an old guy". This is dangerously close to blocking a person purely on account of his or her views. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:29, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Circularly, there's something to that, because it wasn't necessery. Edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14815258" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lyndon_LaRouche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14815258" rel="nofollow">this</a> are prohibited for all users, a rule you objected to, Everyking, and which I suggested to seek clarification on. There was no need to sock it if the (any) user was explained the policy as per blatant promotion/sanitation of LaRouche and yet argued he was going to circumvent it under the guise of npov and relevance. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I expect this would all look pretty dismal from the outside. We justify it in our own way, which satisfies some of us, but in reality it's repression of a particular POV. Note that I was the first person to revert and caution this LaRouchite, yet I'm also the first to stand up against his mistreatment. Is it so difficult to have that balance, to disagree with the edits and yet also stand by policy and fairness? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:56, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Noted. But, circularly again, what you are charging in this case is that you don't find a piece of policy to be fair, which is why I suggested you seek clarification on or find ways to challenge that. I'm not sure what else to recommend, so I withdraw. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 04:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What policy do I object to? I don't know of any. What I object to is the particular case of the blocking of this user by an individual admin, which as far as I can tell has no policy behind it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:47, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see the point in your going on about this, except in pursuit of your vendetta against Snowspinner. The Power of Reason's edits violated the NPOV policy because they reported the views of a tiny-minority without making clear that that's what they were; they violated the NOR policy because they relied on LaRouche publications, which are not credible publications by any standard, and which the arbcom has ruled amount to original-research; and they violated two arbcom rulings, which said that LaRouche supporters must not promote the views of Lyndon LaRouche or engage in advocacy on his behalf. The second arbcom ruling also stated that "Herschelkrustofsky is restricted to one account for editing. All other accounts showing the same editing patterns are to be blocked indefinitely." Arguing against this is perfectly valid so long as you've read it. But you're disagreeing for the hell of it, without knowing the subject matter, and without having read the relevant policies and rulings, as part of your campaign against Snowspinner, the arbcom, and all or most administrators. I wish you'd stop it, because it's incredibly time-consuming. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:49, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>None of that is grounds for blocking except the sockpuppet claim. But since there's no real evidence in favor of that, then that doesn't count either. Note also that I opposed this before I even knew it was Snowspinner who made the block. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:38, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

His edits to other articles need checking as well.</p>
<p>This user <i><b>really</b></i> needs a block. His talk page consists of nothing but warnings about inserting nonsense going back to November. His MO is to come along every so often and repeatedly insert unexplained and incorrect information into cartoon articles. He is the only user to have edited from this IP, and so a long-term block (in the order of months not days) is really needed. I would do it myself but I am too involved, having been reverting his changes for the past few months. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:47, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since these are cartoon articles the user is probably a child, and if the subject of Thomas the Tank Engine is any indicator a rather young one at that.

<dd>I'm not really sure he's a child. The user has created several articles which were completely false -- I can't remember the exact name of it, but it was Hollywood something or other, claiming that there was a long-running TV series which had cartoon characters from every known cartoon production company all working together in one show. He created a category for this fake show and linked just about every single cartoon character to it at one point or other. He's created fake Simpsons characters. He's created other fake cartoon shows and cartoon characters. I do have a feeling that English is not his native language because of some of the wording, but he is persistant and keeps coming back after being blocked with one account and using another. He has worked on commercial icons and other non-cartoon material, which would make me think it isn't a kid. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:23, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
