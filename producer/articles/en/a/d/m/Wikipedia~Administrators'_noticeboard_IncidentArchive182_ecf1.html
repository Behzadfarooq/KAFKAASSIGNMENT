<dd><b>[Interjection - if I may]</b> FeloniousMonk, I have tried my best to be completely open to reason -- and continue to do so. I remain fully reasonable. Your pessimistic comment is either because <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a> has completely misrepresented me in the above, or because you don't have a solid understanding of this dispute.

<dd>Well, agree to disagree here. I think he has a clear lack of understanding of policy (as shown by his insistence that since he only recreated the deleted article three times, it should not have been SALTed and the SALTing should be deleted to make room for the recreated article again). I'll do my best to explain things, but I need an answer to my question — is a copy of the article residing anywhere in user or talkspace?

<dd>You are unfortunately rather mistaken.

<dd>Guy I am by no means a troll. Do you believe you have been beyond reproach here? Do you believe I have no reason to be frustrated and confused? You block my userpage, somebody deletes my hours of work, you cite WP:SOAP and I cite WP:USER and instead of being civil you block my userpage, you deleted some harmless userboxes -- and all of this was after the SALTing of Anal Stretching. So in many ways I have been rather tormented by admins, yourself included. My editorial of your one post on my talk page -- which I have apologised for -- was not too inappropriate at the time considering I thought you deleted all my work -- and I wouldn't dream of doing that anywhere else but on my own talk page.

<dd>He seems to be unable to tell the difference between an article and yet more meta argument. At what point do we cut our losses? As to his comments above, they are utterly without merit. I did not delete "some harmless userboxes", I deleted a rant, and some random crap got swept up with it (a self-awarded barnstar, for example). And that was only the second time, the first time I removed it I managed to leave the random crap behind, but being Rfwoolf the rant had to go back of course. Oh, and I have since restored the random crap anyway, which makes the complaint doubly baseless.

Upon review, the generic vandalism warnings he had received did not specifically mention removing speedy tags, and I had intended to warn rather than block. However, when I reviewed the content of the articles themselves (listed on the userpage), they appeared to be vicious attack articles on members of an obscure band, and the user appeared to have usernamed himself after one of the people he was attacking. These were the user's only contributions and I therefore blocked for creation of attack articles, WP:LIVING violations, and bad username.</p>
<p>The user has posted an unblock request denying that anyone was attacked or that his username is an impersonation, not explaining further but referring to another user's page for verification. Upon reviewing that second page, it appears that the attacked individuals and the entire band may be fictional characters rather than real people, although the articles I deleted contained no indication to this effect. If that is the case, the articles were still properly speedied as nonsense but the block should be lifted forthwith.

<dd>Seriously Brad, get ready for new messages about things that you would have never gotten messages about before. Being an administrator isn't fun, it's a voluntary acceptance of extra responsibilities and with that comes demands for accountability. Conflicts will happen most every day, it's why I took three months off after having the bit for a month. I had to get my head together.

<dd>NYB, it is best to make a case and leave discretion to whether or not it should be investigated to the presiding checkuser. They deal with these cases for large parts of the day, all day, and (no offense intended) better suited to make such a jdugement call. It is also beneficial in that, even if the case is declined, it puts the user "on the radar", and further cases of suspected sockpuppetry will be given much more gravity.

<dd>I'd like to point out that I was not out-right reverting the content of that page. I also made an attempt to incorporate their edit in a more appropriate place and in a more appropriate way in an effort to compromise and was told that it "wasn't convincing" (whatever that meant) and was reverted again. If their edit was B and the page was at state A, then I went B-&gt;A, B-&gt;A, Compromise text, B-&gt;C. I will have to review 3RR but I felt that because I had introduced a new version that a revert to that version was not in the spirit of the rule since I was working towards compromise on this issue and they were simply ignoring my efforts and reverting to make a point. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 23:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This brings up an interesting sourcing issue. Every item listed on this list had a wikilink to an at least one other article (usually a biography, sometimes an article about the incident itself). I haven't checked them all, but those linked articles I did check did have sourcing for the death incident. So they are sourced on Wikipedia, but not on this particular list article, where each incident is just briefly mentioned. Are we now going to require sourcing of an incident in every article in which an incident is mentioned, even just in passing, or is linking to an article with proper sourcing adequate? We could have a field day if every list must be sourced on the list itself. Who wants to delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_criminals_862d.html" title="List of Australian criminals">List of Australian criminals</a> and the dozens of other related biographical list articles?

<li>I think it is a very bad idea for an article, open for all kinds of sneaky POV and vandalism, and bound to fail to give adequate context.

The items were sourced on wikipedia (just in the actual biography articles, not on this list article) and the sources would have been easy to find on wiki. At a minimum these would qualify as the equivalent of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConvenience_links_271d.html" title="Wikipedia:Convenience links">Convenience link</a>. There are hundreds of list articles that are in the same format (unsourced on the list itself, but just a click on a wikilink away from proper sources). We should not get too lazy when deciding to delete these articles, save the deletions for the truly bad articles, not well maintained ones like this one was. (This in no way reflects on how I would vote on an AfD of this article - I'm addressing the sourcing issues of lists only).

<li>"Sourcing" via wikilinks is probably fine when the information is readily available and not controversial; in such instances, the convenience link argument holds. However, for information that is contested, controversial, difficult to find, or -- most especially -- covered under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, wikilinking is unsuitable as referencing. We have no means to ensure that the references in Bob the Living Person's article today will be there tomorrow, for example. This is one of the reasons that Wikipedia does not consider itself a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<dd>This is a perfect segue (although maybe not a perfect forum) for an issue I've been thinking about: contentious categories.

<p>I'm not sure what the policy/guideline is with regard to renaming discussions on Talk pages, so I thought that I'd asked here.</p>
<p>I made a proposal to change the name of the article to what I take to be the most common form. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum">Anas Salloum</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anas_Salloum_17cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anas Salloum">contribs</a>) opposed the change, on the basis in large part of Internet searches. Once I'd demonstrated that Internet search engines present "Al-Kindī" as "Al-Kindi", and so can't be relied upon, another editor – hitherto uninvolved on the Talk page so far as I can tell – suddenly turned up to support Anas. When I checked, I found that Anas has been asking editors to join the discussion. That might not be in itself a bad thing, though there's a strong suspicion that he's been canvassing editors whom he takes to agree with him in such cases.</p>
<p>Is this acceptable in such cases? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 14:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, no-one seems to know or be interested, but Anas has said that he was merely approaching people whom he knew to be knowledgeable in Arabic. As that is irrelevant to the discussion, I still don't understand, but I'll assume good faith.</dd>

<p>I dont know what this is doing here, nor was I informed. This editor claims any criticisms of his work such as inserting POV and OR is a criticism of him. The article has been criticised as a rascist rant because that is what some editors believe it is, besides it being OR. This entry by Ju strikes me as being from an editor who cant cope with the frustration of editing and who goes behind the backs of other editors, coming here for absolutely no reason than trying to drum up support for his rather extreme POV.

<dd>Here's the situation: Cindery's talk page contains a section that is entirely about me. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User_talk%7ECindery_8084.html#Stop_it." title="User talk:Cindery">User talk:Cindery#Stop it.</a> In this section, she makes the false statement that I restored material that she repeatedly blanked (ironically, on this very page). When I asked her to clarify or responded with a correction, she deleted my response. When I deleted the false statement, she restored it and filed this complaint. JS, if you go back a couple more diffs on the history of her page, you will see where she deleted my response to her false comment. My actions were merely a response made necessary by her insistence on editing the discussion into a biased and false state.</dd>
<dd>I have a very simple request for any admins who read this and may take action - either allow me one sentence of response to correct the false statement, or remove the false statement, I'd be fine with either. Obviously, I realize that users have the right to blank their talk page, however I find it deceptive to blank selective parts of a discussion instead of the whole thing.</dd>
<dd>I'd be more than happy to supply diffs if there's any doubt that the statement is false (on the history of this page, Cindery removed a comment of mine several times and it was restored each time by editors other than myself).

<dd>The problem is that you are fixated on trying to revive and escalate a dead argument. You should be dropping the issue. You have absolutely no right to "edit" my talkpage, and you are in high-escalation mode, blanking a section of my talkpage, and inserting phony npa tags. It's harassment. Post a screed giving "your side" or something on your own talkpage, and leave me alone.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm perfectly willing to drop the issue once the false statement about me is removed, or if I am allowed to respond to it. You insist on "leave me alone" but you refuse a request to remove a false statement about me (leave <i>me</i> alone)? If you're truly interested in "disengaging" as you put it in your edit summaries, simply remove the false statement about me. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 21:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(edit conflict):::::::For me, it has absolutely nothing to do with Milo, and everything to do with ending on a nice note between Spartaz and I, since we have not always seen eye to eye. But--that's completely irrelevant. The issue is that no matter what Milo thinks, he absolutely cannot blank a whole section of my talkpage, edit war to blank my talkpage, insert phony npa warnings etc--that's disruptive, and it's harassment.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 21:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Edit conflict):If Cindery considers the blanking disruptive, I'll simply add my response to your false comment and ask that she not delete it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Considering the whole reason that section of the talk page exists is because you deleted my comment here on ANI <i>many</i> times (I'll provide the diffs if anyone would like to see them), for which I did not request admin action, I think I have been incredibly understanding and tolerant. But I will not accept you lying about the situation <i>you</i> created and refusing me the opportunity to correct your flat-out lies. I think my simple request to have my side remain a part of that discussion is perfectly reasonable and modest. One comment on a talk page correcting a falsehood.

<li>Note: I deleted Milo's posts after politely requesting that he rewrite them with care not to violate anonymity/ WP:BLP (and more to make him stop and consider what he was doing/could be about to do. He was clearly upset and I didn't think he was in the frame of mind to consider his actions carefully, and I don't think he was fully aware of the BLP/anonymity issues he could violate if he wasn't more careful. The order of events is: first he ignored my polite request not to blank a section at Barrington Hall, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder#Disruption" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder#Disruption" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and responded by blanking the section again. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=101860990&amp;oldid=101850805" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barrington_Hall&amp;diff=101860990&amp;oldid=101850805" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. After I reported it here, he ignored my polite request re anonymity and BLP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder#Privacy.2C_anonymity.2C_and_WP:BLP" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder#Privacy.2C_anonymity.2C_and_WP:BLP" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>--so I did what I felt I had to do to make him stop and think, and it worked. People noticed; Milo slowed down; someone else told him to rewrite it, the upshot is that he was more careful. It protected him from maybe accidentally doing things I think he would have regretted as much as it protected me.) Now he has returned long enough after-the-fact re the ANI report that it should be over/no one else has anything to say about it anymore, to add argumentative comments to my talkpage, blank my talkpage, post phony warnings, call me names, etc. I just ask that he stop.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(edit conflict, this is in response to Cindery's last comment) Wow, that's just bizarre, I'm not why you've chosen to re-open this whole can of worms. The blanked section had consensus to delete (that's hardly "ignoring a request not to blank") and was also removed by at least three other editors. I'm not sure how I could have possibly "ignored' your request for BLP (which a number of admins agreed didn't apply since I was just repeating info you had posted yourself) since your request to rewrite them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101855212" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Milo_H_Minderbinder&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101855212" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> came <i>after</i> you deleted it for the first time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101872883" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101872883" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. It wasn't really possible to edit my comments, even if I wanted to, with you revert warring over them. I'll agree that people noticed, they restored my comment that you deleted and warned you on your talk page not to do it again, and you only stopped deleting it when threatened with a block.

<p>The trouble caused by <a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaakko_Sivonen_2a5c.html" title="User:Jaakko Sivonen">User:Jaakko Sivonen</a> might have served to distract attention from the other side in his conflict. The article on the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_N%C3%B6teborg_0dcb.html" title="Treaty of Nöteborg">Treaty of Nöteborg</a>, which is about a treaty concerning the division of part of what is now Finland, doesn't mention Finland anywhere. Any attempt to introduce such a reference, including the Finnish name for the treaty, is reverted (indeed, a correction to the English and a request for a citation were twice included in a general revert when I tried to amend thengs). There's a "poll" currently in which a number of people are offering specious reasons not to allow the inclusion of the Finnish name (it's apparently "revisionist" and "counterhistorical"). It seems to me that ownership has been taken of the article by people who have their own politico-nationalist position every bit as unacceptable as Sivonen's. Could other admins take a look? If you think that I'm wrong about it, OK, but if I'm right then it needs sorting out and dealing with. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 18:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I took part in this poll, and I agree. Part of the problem is that Jaakko's behavior has been quite poor, and it's only convincing people to stay away from him.

<dd>AFAIK, PNNL does a lot of govt contract work but is not part of the government. However, work done <i>for hire</i> is treated as though it belongs to the hiring body. This is a tricky one, regardless of PNNL's claimed copyright. Needs a more expert review. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought the "work made for hire" concept applied primarily to employees, not independent contractors, or in other situations only when expressly agreed by the parties. In this context, the contract between the government and the lab would probably define who owns the copyright. Agree a more detailed review is needed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As Brad said, it would depend on what is in the contract. The link you gave above says that the contractor gives the government a non-exclusive license to reproduce the materials in question, which I would assume would imply that the contractor still owns the copyright and they are not PD. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear admins, <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">User:Afshar</a> has no any useful entries in Wikipedia, except the guarding function of his own promo article in which he tries to convince the world that with some simple experiment he has disproved a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">User:Afshar</a> repeatedly reverts posts that summarizes results opposing to his own. Such papers have been released in respectable e-print servers <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003048/" class="external text" title="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003048/" rel="nofollow">Georgiev, D.

One of the arguments against my edits is that I put link to my own work, so it is original research, however it is unserious objection taking into account the fact that he himself is promoting and vandalizing an article created by his own sock-puppet. Afshar's sockpuppeting was proved in the year 2004, and since then he is threatening various wiki-editors who do not support his promo editing with legal issues, and his latest strategy is to remove posts from the discussion page <a href="../../../a/f/s/Talk%7EAfshar_experiment_13df.html" title="Talk:Afshar experiment">Talk:Afshar experiment</a> concerning ideas of improving the main article. Thus with his actions/deletions/reverts/and moving of sections from the discussion page to other pages <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">User:Afshar</a> interferes with the editing process of his article, so that wiki-editors willing to improve the text are impeded in their work. I suggest that <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">User:Afshar</a> is blocked from editing the article <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> and the associated discussion page. If the mentioned user wants to contribute something substantially to Wikipedia let him edit any other topic he wants, but I suspect he does not intend to contribute anything to the encyclopedia, except for patrolling on the edits of his promo entry. My own contributions in areas of quantum mechanics, biophysics, mathematics, and molecular biology, with full length wiki-articles can be easily verified.

<dd>Dear Admin, <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">User:Afshar</a> is not the first one to open promo entry. Some already blocked scientists have opened their own autobiographies, presented novel theories, etc., and now are blocked from Wikipedia. However, I don't think such an extreme punishment should be imposed of the mentioned user despite of the numerous personal attacks, threats and vandalism. I think it is enough to be prevented this user to interfere with the editing of the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> article.

A long time ago, we were having a long argument about heights and weights of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_888c.html" title="Street Fighter">Street Fighter</a>-characters. There are many different versions of the heights and weights of these characters. Now JuJube has removed these Heights and Weights because this is too difficult to verify. Other users have asked him why the heights of these characters have been removed and JuJube blames me and says that these things have been removed because of <b>my</b> "constantly editwarrings". But to me, he said that the heights have been removed because this is too difficult to verify.

<li>Yes, the issue here is a content dispute. Here's some background: as an anonymous user and as Lieutenant Dol Grenn (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lieutenant_Dol_Grenn_12a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lieutenant Dol Grenn">contribs</a>), the user in question would constantly add false height and weight information to Wikipedia; not just Street Fighter character articles, but also the pages of various wrestlers and the heights at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tall_men.html" title="List of tall men">List of tall men</a>, among other things. Per the SF character, he claimed as his source a webpage with a Flash fan-port of SF2. The edit warring got to a tedious point, and ultimately the best solution was to simply omit the height/weight from the SF pages altogether as trivial information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this happened, the user, who changed his name to Sergeant Gerzi (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sergeant_Gerzi_3bf8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sergeant Gerzi">contribs</a>), has been harassing me because he feels that if an anonymous user changes the heights/weights, I will blame him. I do have reason to believe he still attempts to insert his erroneous information every now and then as an anonymous user, but I've decided not to edit war over something as silly as this. And since then, <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKung_Fu_Man_00fe.html" title="User:Kung Fu Man">Kung Fu Man</a> (<a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKung_Fu_Man_ff3e.html" title="User talk:Kung Fu Man">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kung_Fu_Man_b2ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kung Fu Man">contribs</a>) has re-added the statistics. Again, it's not something worth losing sleep over.</p>
<p>That's what's going on here in a nutshell. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 09:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Just to chime in, I added back that info without realizing the reason for it's removal believing that it was significant to the articles. I have to state flatly also that while I've been here on Wikipedia I've never seen Danny Lilithborne/JuJube harrass anyone despite himself getting flamed a few times and has handled things always within WP's guidelines. Gerzi's claims of harrassment are unfounded: the most that'd come up about the guy *at all* was JuJube telling me why the measurement info was removed and who was behind the edit warring, and as you can see on my talk page that was done in a very professional manner.--<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKung_Fu_Man_00fe.html" title="User:Kung Fu Man">Kung Fu Man</a> 10:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm. I might say that despite having a long group discussion in <a href="../../../c/r/i/WT%7ECRIC_6f7a.html" title="WT:CRIC">WT:CRIC</a> last year, where it was reached consensus that because Sikh cricketers bearing the name "Singh" and Muslim cricketers named Khan, etc, are always known by their first name, Gene repeatedly flouts this. This is despite having been party to the discussion. See the history of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/v/Yuvraj_Singh_49c7.html" title="Yuvraj Singh">Yuvraj Singh</a> (also <a href="../../../y/u/v/Talk%7EYuvraj_Singh_bdc3.html" title="Talk:Yuvraj Singh">Talk:Yuvraj Singh</a> for example. Every now and then, Gene drives past and hopes we aren't paying attention, and switches it to "Singh, Yuvraj" again. He also does it for some other analogous things, etc, some of which still stand. There have been RfCs in the past about Gene doing his thing on these sorts of cat sorting and formatting, patterning issues before. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I've gotten very frustrated with Gene whenever I've been in a dispute with him as well. However, I think Darwinek should've gotten someone else to block him, or made a report about him here. Blocking him himself wasn't a really good idea. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 04:48, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That has nothing to do with Darwinek's improper block, <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a></dd>
<dd>However, if you participated in that discussion, you <b>ought not lie about it here</b>.</dd>

<dd>First of all, first-name indexing is a property of a category, not of a person.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, the decision at WikiProject Cricket, with which I took issue, was specifically to first-name index the cricket players from <b>three specific countries</b>: Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Oman. (Addition: there may have been one more, but it was <b>not</b> India. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third, after lengthy discussions, the specific compromise there was that for those three specific countries, the "compromise solution: catgeorize as [[Category|last name, first name]] outside cricket related categories, and preserve current categorization of [[Category|article title]] within cricket related categories."</dd>

<dd>Fourth: Neither <a href="../../../y/u/v/Yuvraj_Singh_49c7.html" title="Yuvraj Singh">Yuvraj Singh</a> nor <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> are from the specific countries for which WIkiProject Cricket decided on first-name indexing for the cricket categories related to those coutries. Both are from India, whose cricket categories are sorted on a last name, first name basis.</dd>

<dd>Gene removes diacritics and does not respect other editors. Three editors on the talk page told him Marek Špilár is a correct form and even this he put Marek Spilar there (there is a redirect from Marek Spilar to Marek Špilár already). I do not understand why he is doing his disruptive edits. Also As-Salif is another one, arabic native speaker <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum">ANas</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> told him <b>As</b> means <b>the</b> so he should not put it into category, which I seconded on the talk page, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:As-Salif" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:As-Salif" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>.

<dd>Hello. I just lost my mind, that's right. I won't make the same mistakes I used to make. It was just another emotion. It was running through my veins. But the truth gave me its devotion and something in me changed. Next time I will ask somebody not involved to review the situation and consider blocks. As for the insults, I showed my regret for them and blocked myself for violating WP:NPA. It was against the rules, I was subsequently unblocked but haven't made any edits during that "detention time". - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 10:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What sticks out, apart from from the general overlap, is the editing to <a href="../../../l/u/_/Lu_Sheng-yen_2ac1.html" title="Lu Sheng-yen">Lu Sheng-yen</a>. In the last year, only five registered users (excluding vandals, single purpose accounts, vandal reverts, and typo fixing) have edited this article. Of these, three of them are Hanuman_Das, Ekajati and 999, all parties to the Starwood case, all of whom are on one side of the fence. Similarly a look at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Roach_b1f7.html" title="Michael Roach">Michael Roach</a> shows the same thing, very few people edited this article, so both articles are likely to be obscure, and a new user appearing, immediately after the retirement of another, editing with the same viewpoint, editing on a similar set of articles, especially two common articles which are almost inactive. So all the socks have been blocked and the owner also blocked. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ramachandran, I have a hard time believing. I've had a few interactions with him, and he seemed like any other new user. He didn't have any people complaining to his talk page, other than one friviolous complaint about a NPA warning (which was most certainly deserved).

<dd>There's something not right here about Hanuman Das being a sock of Ekajati. A little poking around shows that:
<ol>
<li>Hanuman Das has been on Wikipedia quite a bit longer than Ekajati</li>
<li>Blnguyen is <i>also</i> one of the five regular editors of <a href="../../../l/u/_/Lu_Sheng-yen_2ac1.html" title="Lu Sheng-yen">Lu Sheng-yen</a> and it looks like he may have had a dispute with Hanuman Das</li>
<li>There are a number of notes from Hanuman Das on Ekajati's talk page asking her to help him with Buddhist topics. One is a note thanking her for helping with <a href="../../../l/u/_/Lu_Sheng-yen_2ac1.html" title="Lu Sheng-yen">Lu Sheng-yen</a>. I don't think their both editing that article can be taken to mean anything, if there is actually no confirming checkuser.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Just my 2 cents. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 07:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and one more thing. I don't see any report of abusive conduct on either of the other two socks. What did they do? The tag says they committed "abuse, libel, or ban evasion." It is my understanding that even if they are socks, they have to commit an abuse to warrant being blocked. My opinion is this: I don't believe that Tunnels of Set is Ekajati at all. The articles he edited are not at all the sort she edited. A Ramachandran is more believable, but I don't see any misbehavior on his part. And for the reasons I've given above, I don't think Hanuman Das and Ekajati are the same user at all. They collaborated, yes, and the evidence of that is on their talk pages. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 07:24, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(unindent) I have had a long conflict with several parties mentioned above. 999 posted an ANI complaint against me on August 21.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive130#User:Mattisse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive130#User:Mattisse" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> . <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a> posted his first comment on my talk page the same day.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattisse&amp;diff=70990435&amp;oldid=70983933" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattisse&amp;diff=70990435&amp;oldid=70983933" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>..

<dd>Addendum - There were several instances when 999, Ekajati, and Hanuman Das left notes about me or my alleged sockpuppet Timmy12 on each other's pages alerting each other about information they aready knew about.

<dd>I'm not convinced by Ekajati and Hanuman Das being socks of each other.

Ekajati has denined the allegations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ekajati#Undeserved_block" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ekajati#Undeserved_block" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, which I find convincing. A Ramachandran asked to be unblocked with the comment "I don't understand, please discuss" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Ramachandran&amp;diff=102361581&amp;oldid=102344358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Ramachandran&amp;diff=102361581&amp;oldid=102344358" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>.</dd>
<dd>All users do share interests in spiritual matters, Tunnels of Set is clearly interested in the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> and related stuff, the other are more into Yoga and Indian spirtuality. While there is an overlap there is considerable difference in the editing pattern of ToS and the others. Ramachandran had a unique interest in valves which was not shared by any of the other contributors.</dd>
<dd>Overall I'm quite skepical of sockpuppetetry and I'm not sure the block have really helped the arbitration. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 19:27, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't see any support for the notion that Hanuman Das and Ekajati are the same person. They have similar intrests, but have engaged in discussions on talk pages for a LONG time, and have mentioned extremely different past histories in these discussions. Both their editing patterns and their use of language differ. Furthermore, the tag stating that the supposed use of socks was for "abuse, libel or ban evasion" seems totally unsupported. And it seems that no attempt was made to allow Ekajati to address these accusations before action was taken. The arbitrator who initiated this has taken what IMO seemed to be a position advocating one side of the Starwood issue, made proposals (unlike the four arbitrators who actually signed in and accepted the position), and has now recused himself. I am very confused about this whole turn of events, the timing within hours of another involved party's call for a ban on me, the pressured withdrawal from Wikipedia of two other involved parties, and the fact that NO such action was taken against the proven use of 18 sockpuppets by Mattisse (who comments above). I hope I am mistaken, but there is the appearance of something very wrong. I think Ekajati has been unfairly treated here. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 20:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Several points.
<ul>
<li>A number of editors have brought up the fact that blocks are warranted for sockpuppetry only if one of the accounts is "abusive" in some way. In my opinion, at the very least, Hanuman Das harassed Mattisse.</li>
<li>Salix Alba brings up an intersting point in that Ekajati did not endorse the RfC against Mattisse. Indeed, Ekajati did not even edit the the RfC at all, and requested that his/her username be removed from the RfC. Salix Alba interprets this as a difference between Ekajati and Hanuman Das. Hanuman Das and Ekajati otherwise seemed to act in unison, so this is a rather notable fact. However another interpretation might be that a single user wanted to avoid using two accounts in a single RfC, knowing that such an action would <i>most certainly</i> be a violation of policy. Both interpretations are, however, conjecture.</li>
<li>I assisted Hanuman Das in being unblocked on a previous occassion. I had great misgivings about this. I like to be forgiving. I like to give people second chances. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. And <i>I like to try to work things out with people who have been disruptive</i>. However, after I encouraged the unblocking of Hanuman Das, I became concerned that I was <i>enabling</i> behavior that was disruptive to other editors, even if it was something that I <i>personally</i> could forgive. I helped Hanuman Das out of a indef block once. This time, I fully support an indefinite block (even if there is a chance that the grounds of the block are mistaken.</li>
<li>I am concerned about the quality of evidence for blocking Ekajati. Although there are good reasons to support the idea that Ekajati and Hanuman Das are the same, I lean toward the "beyond a reasonable doubt" school, (at least in cases that involve a block of more than a day or two) and I'm not sure if that threshold has been met.</li>
<li>I do note that a common trait between Hanuman Das and Ekajati is a rather incessant nagging about the fact that Mattisse was not given a lengthy block in August for sockpuppetry. (diffs available upon request). I think most editors would have moved on, but Hanuman Das (until his retirement) and Ekajati have not been able to let go of this. I felt that this similarity is worth noting, although I repeat that although I find the Ekajati/Hanuman Das connection plausible, I don't think the evidence meets the standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt".</li>

<p>Sadly, I find this all quite plausible. I think <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a>, plus any of his sockpuppets/sockpuppeteers, should have been blocked indefinitely when s/he made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattisse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86662167" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattisse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86662167" rel="nofollow">this vicious personal attack</a>. The block for that was insufficient, imho, and s/he then voiced elsewhere the intention to use sockpuppets to violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (which resulted in a longer block). The editing patterns between Hanuman Das and <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> are quite similar. Ekajati's intense focus and seeming obsession with sockpuppets in the Matisse case also made me suspect s/he was using sockpuppets, due to the possibility of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_projection.html" title="Psychological projection">psychological projection</a> being a factor. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 01:26, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made a longer post on my talk page in response to a few inquiries I had. I checked HD and AR against Ekajati and there are no overlapping editing periods at all, although they frequently stop editing and the other begins editing within one hour, and often less than half an hour changeover. However, there is never any overlap. This pattern is statistically absurd. It is not as though it is because they are in different time zones, because the changeover happens at different parts of the day. Also, as I mentioned above, AR registered the same day that HD "retired" and edited two obscure articles which HD edited, and was only edited by five-six other users in the last year. The CU said that they were all unrelated except that it confirmed Ekajati and had no data for HD (expired), so that leaves a very unlikely probability that we have a new user on two articles which only six people edited in a year, the same day that another retired, which also interleaves edits with Ekajati, as did HD which also interleaved with Ekajati. Thus Ekajati has been engaging in large scaling 3RR evasion, block evasion of Hanuman Das and large scale AfD vote stacking. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 01:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I did some comparing myself and found that <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">User:Blnguyen</a>'s assertion about no overlap between H.D. and Ekajati isn't true. I found several examples: on November 14, Ekajati starts editing at 14:24 and ends at 15:05 and Hanuman Das posts to Mattise's talk page at 14:59. On November 13, Ekajati starts editing at 14:51 and ends at 15:24, while Hanuman Das post on Ekajati's talk page at 15:08. On November 1st, Hanuman Das startes editing at 15:43 and ends at 15:54, while Ekajati edits Tantra at 15:51 and posts on Hanuman Das' talk page at 15:52. I'm sure more examples could be found. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 13:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless the there mentioned reasons to block Ekajati, which I find here to be highly questionable as well (after incidentally working at a same article, many users follow one-another's work often for very acceptable reasons) - if the A Ramachandran account was not being used more inappropriately more often than that of many valued contributors, there is no reason for that one to be blocked. Especially not while this account appears mainly responsible for definite Wikipedia improvements. <i>The usage of a single PC or 2 PCs without router on one Internet connection by people living together, is not forbidden</i> and easily explains them never to work simultaneously as well as to usually have similar interests and viewpoints (culturally and as being able to live together). They may well keep eachother informed, and often cooperate on articles of their mutual interest, as such they may even talk between themselves and come to a consensus before making an important contribution to Wikipedia (good idea, I'd say). Even occasionally both voting on an AfD or so, does not make these people's behaviour blockable sockpuppetry: each user has the right of expressing an opinion as much as any two users living with eachother but escaping suspicious indications simply by using more expensive separate technical equipment [no socio-economical discrimination, please]; this is not like disputed POV-pushing or edit-warring together or +3RR with prevention of bans. Banning an account is only appropriate if the account is causing more harm than offering a cure, this has not at all been demonstrated for 'A Ramachandran'. Violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is scolded upon when it appears as an inappropriate comment; banning someone, and most certainly by a durable ban, is a lot more serious than a mere unfortunately phrased remark. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_23.html" title="Jan 23">23 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 16:49 (UTC)</span></dd>

<p>Why are these new users posting on pages of people mentioned in the Artibration? And why does 999 leap in to defend them by using my edit summaries as instances of harassment as he did with Jefferson Anderson as described below. Is it because Jefferson Anderson posted on Rosencomets page? All this seem so interwoven to me.

<dd>Mattisse, you are involved in an arbitration in which both you and Jefferson Anderson are parties. You should not be posting this here, but rather on the arbitration pages. I'm here to defend Ekajati, who I think has been blocked unfairly. What are you here for? Also, I note that you have conveniently left out the fact that <b>you asked Jefferson Anderson to help you</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJefferson_Anderson&amp;diff=100264270&amp;oldid=100106078" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJefferson_Anderson&amp;diff=100264270&amp;oldid=100106078" rel="nofollow">here</a>! Somehow, I think this explains why he posted what he did on your talk page. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 16:34, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>999, I innocently thought that originally also. But that does not explain why, after I appologised three times for my mild replies that he took enormous offense to, that he posted his list of "rude editor" (consisting solely of me) nor the sockpuppet box on his user page with my name. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 18:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to discuss this any further with you here, because it doesn't belong here. Submit your evidence on the arbitration page and I will be happy to refute it. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 19:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I will first give J.A.'s advocate a chance to refute it. Are you posting here instead of in the arbitration to evade J.A.'s advocate? Because he is probably only watching the arbitration pages and since J.A. is blocked, he can't defend himself. Please take this to the arbitration you are both parties to so everyone involved can see and respond to your evidence. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 19:04, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As long as Mattisse has decided to comment here, I'll add my two cents. I think her comments have nothing at all to do with the issue of whether or not Ekatati has used sockpuppets. Mattisse is, of course, an expert in such usage, having at least 18 documented sockpuppets to her name. But her comments here are all of the "they've been mean to me, too" type, and that is not evidence that they are the same person. Several people are annoyed at her behavior, for the same reasons, and if the issues seems to be "interwoven" as she says, there's no surprise since SHE is the WEAVER! She has a history of playing one person against the other, creating fake articles and blaming them (and other actions of hers) on other people (including her grandchildren and visitors to her house), pretending to be people on BOTH sides of the same issue, claiming not to KNOW which sockpuppets are "really hers", and generally causing chaos. (She claims to be a psychlogist; perhaps she's gathering data for a book on instigating confrontations. I know of no other motivation for her bizzare behavior. :-))</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, may I remind everyone that Mattisse declared on the Arbitration page that she had withdrawn from the arbitration. I find it frankly AMAZING that she is engaged here in a discussion about blocking someone for the use of sockpuppets, and that the person being discussed ISN'T HER!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I think that the blocks that have been put on those accused of being Ekajati should be lifted if only to allow them to defend themselves more readily. Even if there WERE a sockpuppet use in there somewhere, there is no evidence that there was ban evasion, libel, or any other malicious purpose to it. I think this action was precipitous and hasty, and I wonder if it was partly done to prevent Ekajati from participating in the Starwood arbitration. (It's odd that Hanuman Das was driven away, and Ars Scriptor as well, and unfounded attacks have been made against Jefferson Anderson. Does anyone else see a pattern here?) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 19:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a user Avraham ben Avraham, who persists on placing unsubstantiated, improperly referenced, not to mention extremely POV edits on the page <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a>. See the history for examples. Having studied Talmud in the original Aramaic for over 25 years, I can affirm that his statements are NOT supported by the Talmud as is currently printed, and how it has been printed for around 200 years. There are commentaries which state that there are many statements, censored by medieval Christian priests, that do refer to Jesus in the Talmud, but that is not whom this user is quoting in the paragraph <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html#Jewish_objections" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic_Judaism#Jewish_objections</a>. I contend that this is patent WP:OR (Have anyone pull out a folio of Talmud in the Original Aramaic and check for themselves).</p>
<p>The next paragraph, <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html#Jesus_and_the_Talmud" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic_Judaism#Jesus and the Talmud</a> is also complete WP:OR. He is bringing disparate sections and "claiming" they refere to Jesus when no such mention is made. That is original synthesis at best, blatant POV at worst. Secondly, he brings statements about R' Eliezer which directly contradict the text of the Talmud itself, and I could go on.</p>
<p>I do not believe this is a content dispute (as ALL of the errors in his ostensible supporting posts are easily verified by someone who knows the Talmud, such as myself), but removal of edits against wikipedia policy. But before I take action, I wanted to ensure I was reading the situation correctly.</p>

I'd suggest that you just knock it off. (<a href="../../../i/b/a/User%7EIbaranoff24_bfad.html" title="User:Ibaranoff24">Ibaranoff24</a> 20:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li>Actually, I think he has a point; a lot of these articles have huge plot summaries with little to no real world application: see <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a>. I encourage you both to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, and to use each other's talk page to discuss, rather than just reverting each other. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 21:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
