<p>The could cause a problem in some cases. A user yesterday posted defamatory information in edit summaries. He had been doing so for days using anonymous IPs. Yesterday he created user accounts to continue posting claims (he accused Jimbo and George Bush, for example, of child sex abuse, as well as addresses and telephone numbers — ours as it happened, but that wasn't immediately apparent, so it could have been much worse —). I blocked him indefinitely, something jimbo and the armcom apparently later ruled should be the standard ban for him. What happens if a user doesn't know this and just bans the user for 24 hours, or worse 15 minutes? What happens if someone is banned by the arbcom for a specific timespan but someone either innocently or deliberately posts a shorter ban? It could cause all sorts of problems. The system should instead inform someone if a ban clashes with an already imposed ban, so that they can contact the original ban imposer and find out why the longer ban was imposed. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:04, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to rein in the edit warring on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and related articles. The subject is, unfortunately, a very controversial one among nationalist Greeks, many of whom are fundamentally opposed to that country using the name "Macedonia" in any way. Consequently the article gets a lot of hit-and-run vandalism from anonymous and new users (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>).</p>
<p>One of the main targets of the vandalism is the infobox, which lists the country's name for itself and the English translation (i.e. Република Македонија and Republic of Macedonia). Hit-and-run vandals repeatedly change this to things like "Republic of Vardar" and "Republic of Skopje", which I hardly need to say aren't recognised names). So I propose to try to deter vandals by adding a warning above the infobox: "NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT MODIFY THE NAMES USED IN THIS BOX WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING YOUR CHANGES ON THE DISCUSSION PAGE. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN YOUR EDITING PRIVILEGES BEING BLOCKED WITHOUT FURTHER WARNINGS."</p>
<p>I know putting up warnings in big capital letters probably seems a bit dramatic, but we really need to cut down on the edit warring and lower the temperature in general. If it means insta-banning hit-and-run vandals, I'm game. What do the rest of you think? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:03, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Worth a try, I suppose. I assume it'll be in html comments, not actually visible, of course. Might work better than the futile one at the top of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<dd>I don't quite like adding that message. Perhaps something to the effect of "The name of the country has been agreed by &lt;source&gt; and has been the subject of much discussion. Please do not change it without discussion at the talk page first. Thanks!" will accomplish the same thing (though HTML messages, as Geni points out, have had limited success in the past) without scaring off other editors.

Fadix has backed off completely, Karl Meier has to some extent, but Davenbelle has continued, well, (wiki)stalking Cool Cat. He has only been blocked for 24 hours, and I recommend longer blocks if he doesn't lay off. It's a big wiki, and the two should be able to keep their distance. He (as well as Karl Meier) even showed up to oppose CC's RFA. So, in short, 24 hours this time, longer next time. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle3_b4f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle3"><font color="gray">Attention Washingtonians!</font></a> 09:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

This was an unjustified block. First off, as others have already pointed out, this block is not "per arbcom".

<dd>It's rather hard to ignore him when he simply reverts me on articles you allow him to "police".

<dl>
<dd>There is nothing in the ArbCom's decision that indicated that I or Davenbelle should not edit specific articles. The block against Davenbelle for voting against a deletion of a page that he was editing anyway, doesn't make any sense. It is Cool Cat that is following me and Davenbelle around now, and reverting articles that he haven't touched for months, only hours after that Davenbelle made a reasonable edit to it. Apparently it's too difficult for Cool Cat to leave us alone, and end this conflict. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 09:39, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well when someone makes it obvious that they are the same returning user that was blocked, you can just apply the same block to the new IP, and extend it each time they repeat the vandalism as long as they are not shared IPs.

<p>As a very new admin (three days younger than <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a>), I might not have felt confident enough to do what he did, and also I haven't yet fully read all the instructions for <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Range_blocks" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Range_blocks" rel="nofollow">blocking range IPs</a>. But I do completely endorse his handling of the situation. I have no special interest in Hitler, but it's on my watchlist as a frequent target of vandalism, and so I was familiar with what was going on. ROHA had been making a nuisance of himself for some time, breaking 3RR, taunting other users, making personal attacks, and removing the photo of Hitler and replacing it with a link to another website – so obviously the alternative photo wasn't readable from the Hitler page. One thing on which I disagree with Nlu is that ROHA seems to be active in the daytime by German time. I'm in Ireland, one hour behind Germany, and I think he seems to work all through the night until late morning or early afternoon. Anyway, although I didn't carry out the block myself, I fully support it, and hope that the disruption will die down now. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suppose one of them vandalises and gets themselves blocked. Pretending to be one of the other users, they ask for it to be unblocked at which point they resume vandalising. Repeat once or twice until admins decline to unblock. Or suppose they are are a troll or two, how much of a mess will arbitration be with "it wasn't me, it was him, no it wasn't it was him" stories? Still worse when we go to 3RR; how does that apply to multi-user accounts? How would the account ever make it through RfA? How do we know tht they didn't publicise their password much <i>more</i> widely (Checkuser, presumably)? And why can't they just go get proper accounts anyway?

<dd>The 'no public accounts' policy exists to deal with accounts which are shared by a large number of unrelated individuals (usually strangers) and used for the purpose of trolling or vandalism. The last time it came up in a serious way was with the nonsense involving <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">User:Iasson</a> and User:Faethon (and all the other socks) back around the beginning of the year. Iasson was creating accounts and making the passwords public so that anyone could edit under those names.</dd>
<dd>In <i>this</i> case, it would seem that the users are willing to accept joint accountability and responsiblity for the actions of any of the users–has someone asked them about this?–and so there's nothing wrong with treating it as a regular account. As was asked earlier, has this account shown a propensity for vandalism? If the editors in question are willing to be treated as a single user for the purposes of policy enforcement, 3RR, etc., then why do we need to worry about it? We block editors when their continued free action seems likely to damage or disrupt Wikipedia—I don't see evidence to support that happening in this case. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:59, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This means that any sysop, in the exercise of their judgement for reasonable cause, documented in a section of this decision, may ban them from any article which relates to China which they disrupt by inappropriate editing. In doing so, the sysop must notify the banned user on their talk page, and a note must also placed on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. They may post suggestions on the talk page of any article from which they are banned from editing.

<p>The IP 169.139.224.10 is the Manatee County school district's HTTP proxy server. When it gets blocked for vandalism, I'm getting caught by this block. This has happened two or three times, the IP's been blocked for a month and I'm stuck behind the block. The only thing I could do was complain on IRC, which works, but I can't do it at school without getting in trouble for using IRC during class. Is there anything that can be done? Admins seem to be ignoring the "THIS IS AN EFFING PROXY" notice on the talk page and continue to block for a month.</p>
<p>Contacting network the administrator was suggested. I know who that is, but the only thing that would accomplish is getting Wikipedia blocked from OUR proxy server, since they're stupid enough to see this as a way to chat, and therefore cheat on things. They block a lot of sites for that same reason. I can't provide much help on this end of the IP. My RFA is most likely going to succeed and is 3 days away. Would there be a problem with unblocking myself if I get caught with the block again if/when it succeeds? Is there anything else that can be done to stop this IP from getting blocked? I have no idea who's doing the vandalism, or even if they're at my school. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">Luigi30</a> (<a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuigi30_5295.html" title="User talk:Luigi30">Ταλκ</a>) 17:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Collateral damage is a problem and a serious concern. It should be very easy for your school's system administrator to match time stamps of vandalism to outbound proxy traffic.

<p>Church of Reality was recently deleted after an ugly fight culminating in the author of that article, Mark Perkel, being blocked for a week and deleted page being protected. Perkel then userfied the CofR page. Now, there's a Marc Perkel article, which contains a wikilink to that userfied version. It's unclear how to deal with this. On the one hand, I guess a user has the right to put whatever they want on their user pages. On the other hand, this looks like it's really just a clever way to get around the deletion process.

<p>I am relatively a newbie and am hesitant to take this one on myself, so I'd appreciate it if someone with more experience would &amp; I'll just follow along this time and learn:</p>
<p>Looks like we have a deliberate &amp; determined vandal at <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> -- IP 216.124.166.2 -- you'll see several examples of his work in the history following "Revision as of 21:48, 29 November 2005", all of them reverted by various folks, but also somewhere along the way the entire core of this very good &amp; culturally-significant (Mongolia...) article got dumped and yes we do suspect the dumping was him too.</p>
<p>I'll revert to that revision and re-do my own edits, and try to fold in those of the others too if I can. But I'm not anxious to undertake that if our vandal just is going to cruise back in and mess it up. So how to handle it? Doesn't look like a "first give him a warning" necessity, to me.</p>

<p>OK thanks but would you pls look at my own copyedit of "23:18, 29 November 2005"? We're missing the entire middle of the article, since then, and it may have been something I did in my big edit altho I can't spot it myself. Appreciate your doing so for my own future reference... I'll revert the article to the prior edit, "21:48, 29 November 2005", and then leave it alone for a while, maybe try to replace the later edits done by others tho.</p>

<p>Hi, Kessler, sorry it took me so long to take a look at this. I've learned the hard way to look for unclosed HTML tags when text mysteriously disappears, and sure enough that was it.&#160;:-) The "entire core" was there the whole time, visible in edit mode, just not visible on the page. The unclosed tag was immediately below the "Uniting the Mongol tribes" heading, like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>&lt;!-- OK, only removing redundancies here to reduce size, i.e. not necessary to say "at this point", "united together", etc., it's just better English syntax... looks weird &amp; sounds ponderous otherwise...&gt;.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
See the final tag? It needs to be "--&gt;", not just "&gt;". When you went on, on December 1, to revert to an earlier version, according to your post above, you removed the whole comment, tags and all, and the text became visible again. Ahhh, that felt good, after all the unclosed tags of mine that other people have found! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Sherlock Homes</a> 10:19, 9 December 2005 (UTC).</p>

<p>I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, but an administrator <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">Alkivar</a> has blocked CapnCrack and an IP address 68...something even though they were not vandalizing. He then reverted a bunch of edits (even though they were not vandalism) and protected the page. Some of the stuff he reverted even had sources and he still reverted it. The revert notice says that the page will be protected until the dispute is resolved on the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_Christian_University_6100.html" title="Oklahoma Christian University">oklahoma Christian University</a> talk page. However, he has blocked several of the key people involved on one side of the argument.</p>
<p>When others tried to discuss the problem with him, he just removed their comments from his talk page. He has stifled the entire debate about this matter even though the side he has crushed has sources, encyclopedic-style writing, and has done no wrong. What can be done about this? I think the 68... address should be re-instated immediately, the page should be unprotected, or at the least, it should be reverted to include the documented material and then protected.</p>
<p>I don't think Alkivar should be punished or anything like that, but I think he should be asked to reconsider this undue abuse of his power. He has sided a guy <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanlovejoy_4999.html" title="User:Danlovejoy">danlovejoy</a> who frequently edits the page in a biased manner (he is the online marketing director for OC, doesn't get much more biased than that).</p>

<li>It's interesting to note that despite CapnCrack's "vandalesque" edit summaries (I especially like "motherfucker, you're the one (squeak, squeak)" and "more wikis, you little anal assassins"), his edits all seem to be on the up-and-up. Given the vandal whack-a-mole that anybody on RC duty is confronted with, it's easy to see why Alkivar would interpret these edits as vandalism. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 07:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure that two very minor acts of vandalism meant that a vandal should be permenantly blocked without warning. Maybe someone should have just told him/her that isn't what edit summaries are for. I'm also not sure an administrator should revert a page and then protect it since protection is not supposed to be endoresment of a certain version of a page. An administrator certainly shouldn't remove comments from his talk page when those comments are not abusive. <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">Alkivar</a> needs time to cool down.

<p>I realise that blocking a user for breach of civility is controversial. Could an administrator put a user, who is generally agreed to have regularly crossed the line of civility, on an informal parole (three strikes and you get a 24h block)?

<p>Hello. I should not have sysop rights, since I'm not an admin. However, whenever I visit user pages, I've begun to notice additional sysop-only links such as "Block Saravask" and "Unblock Saravask". I am seeing these links whenever I visit any userpage, as well as other pages. I don't want to end up blocking anyone else (or worse, myself!) accidentally. Could someone fix this?

<dd>So, when did I miss the announcement that Wikipedia was done &amp; finished, we can scrap all participation by anyone not in the cabal or an admin? I want to know why we are running scared of the media, making "concessions" like blocking anon page creation, and this pilot for freezing pages and letting only trusted users edit them. What are they going to do? Gnaw us to death? Regardless of the whims of the media, we can go on happily editing and improving articles. Why are we jeopardizing our system, which works well! for transient approval we aren't even getting? You realize that these restrictions are blood in the water? I think I've seen more articles battening onto our process changes as evidence that everything our critics say is true than I've actually seen articles on the original criticism! The process works, people! We have hundreds of thousands of articles, with many, many great articles, and only a very few are rotten apples. Don't make the cure worse than the disease here. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 22:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, they are not experiments. That's part of the problem. There is no control Wikipedia running with no restrictions on anons creating pages with which to compare. We cannot know how many people were scared off or for whom this barrier was a sufficient disincentive to not edit, or how many crap articles were <i>not</i> created (proving a negative, anyone?), so we cannot compare it to the more easily gathered data on how much editing time was freed up by fewer articles needing review. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 23:24, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Making a control for this "experiment" (maybe trial or test is a better word) is nearly impossible. Everyone seems to forget how many people there are in the world. We can't be worried about alienating small hypothetical sets of people, when basically any change we make alienates someone. The loss of one person submitting one article isn't so great. Eventual someone else will come along and do the same thing. Still I'm not convinced that the test should be made permanent. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 01:20, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Nobody ever said radical freedom was the main goal. Building an encyclopedia is. Linux is still free as in libre and always will be due to the license, but you can't edit it's source code. Only a few people can directly. I believe we are well past the point were viscious vandalism is a greater detriment to the project than radical freedom is an attractant. More talented, qualified people (read experts) refuse to participate because of the garbage we put up with here than appear to be attracted to it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:38, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a>. Wikipedia is now instituting new rules so that anonymous users can't create new pages. Personally, I wouldn't mind expanding that to anonymous users not being able to edit article. As long as users are easily able to sign up and take part, then Wikipedia will retain its best aspects. That said, I think it is great to do experiments like Jimbo is doing. That's how we learn.

<dd>I also agree. The goal is to create an encyclopedia, not to be open at any price.

<p>Highlighting one article and giving it special attention (viz. announcements here and on the mailing list) hardly reflects the reality that would result from making it an ongoing practice. (See <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorne_effect.html" title="Hawthorne effect">Hawthorne effect</a>.) The half-baked nature of evaluating these experiments is one reason I don't fully trust that a detrimental change would be immediately recognized and undone. On the other hand, the notion that administrators have no greater authority or editorial responsibility has been largely pretense—at least we may talk about such matters more honestly now. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 23:54, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two users are trying to change the spelling of the verb form of "license" to "licence", and claiming that anyone who reverts them is unnecessarily provoking conflict, stating that the <b>c</b> form is the preferred spelling in Britain. And yet, the British-based Oxford, the primary source for all things English, <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/betterwriting/spelling/" class="external text" title="http://www.askoxford.com/betterwriting/spelling/" rel="nofollow">makes it pretty clear</a>:</p>

<dd>"Do not confuse licence with license. Licence is a noun which means 'a permit to do something' (a driving licence), whereas license is a verb meaning 'give a permit to someone: allow something' (the loggers are licensed to cut mahogany trees).

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, I posted here on the noticeboard about <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcfly85_4985.html" title="User:Mcfly85">Mcfly85</a> (<a href="../../../m/c/f/User_talk%7EMcfly85_2936.html" title="User talk:Mcfly85">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mcfly85_4c83.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mcfly85">contribs</a>) creating sockpuppet accounts, namely IP addresses, for making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on users, mostly me. Now, just a few minutes ago a new user called <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESven66_f651.html" title="User:Sven66">Sven66</a> (<a href="../../../s/v/e/User_talk%7ESven66_db09.html" title="User talk:Sven66">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sven66_1c7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sven66">contribs</a>) wrote on my talk page and insulted me. Sven66 only made one edit and this case of vandalism is his one edit. See <a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316">My talk page</a>. The message was unsigned and it looked like the style of editing done by Mcfly85. I, at least, suggest we run a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser">CheckUser</a> on McFly85 this time around. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316">SWD316</a> 06:21, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would also like to note every time Mcfly85 attempts to insult me, he subsequently "retires" from editing as his user page says. Like he did before, when he "retired" then made insulting comments towards me, came back and now retired again. Doesn't anyone think there is something a little suspicious going on? <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316">SWD316</a> 06:26, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I honestly have not a clue as to what this is about. Please leave me alone. Yes, I am trying to stop editing here, but I use the encyclopedia a lot, and if I see a typo, I just have to fix it.

<dd>I guess I should clarify a bit. Since we generally block names that are say, similar to George W. Bush, should this name have been indefinitely blocked? What I meant was the following - the username is a well known political leader in China, but it was probably not blocked immediately while it came up in the user creation log because it was not recognized as such. Since this user has already made a few edits, I decided to leave a message on their userpage requesting that they reattribute their edits. Is this preferable to blocking immediately and then requesting the user to make a name change? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 03:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I suspect he also objects to this passage from the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Club_234a.html" title="Monday Club">Monday Club</a> article:</p>
<p>"The club has been described by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> as a "bastion on the Tory hard right"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1978846.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1978846.stm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>[INTERJECTION FROM ROBERT I] Without knowing who the two journalists in the Telegraph and the Times were I cannot comment. The Guardian and the Independent are established organs of The Left. You may decide for yourselves whether over 40 members of both Houses of Parlimanet might consider themselves "far right". But read Oleg Gordievsky's comment on the BBC: He had a letter published in the Daily Telegraph on the 3rd August 2005, accusing the BBC of being "The Red Service". He said: "Just listen with attention to the ideological nuances on Radio 4, BBC television, and the BBC World Service, and you will realise that communism is not a dying creed.".</li>
</ul>
<p>The playwright <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Edgar_de93.html" title="David Edgar">David Edgar</a> sarcastically described it in an academic essay as "proselytiz[ing] the ancient and venerable conservative traditions of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternalism.html" title="Paternalism">paternalism</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>." [cf.Levitas, p.60]* <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, also speaking sarcastically, described it as "the guardian of the Tory conscience"."</p>
<p>and does so despite the fact that one of his friends (or possibly 213. himself) added the Edgar quotation though in a misrepresented and distorted form.</p>
<p>Given that the statements are all direct quotations and that sources ranging from the Conservative <i>Telegraph</i> and <i>Times</i> to the neutral BBC to the liberal <i>Guardian</i> all describe the groups in similar terms, it should be clear that our anonymous friend is blowing smoke in the absence of any actual flames.

<p>In a related matter to the above, User:Robert I made a fraudulent edit of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Club_234a.html" title="Monday Club">Monday Club</a> by inserting a quotation, altering it, and completley misrepresenting it<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conservative_Monday_Club&amp;diff=30858692&amp;oldid=30856126" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conservative_Monday_Club&amp;diff=30858692&amp;oldid=30856126" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. The act was so flagrant and his response on being found out was so obnoxious (see <a href="../../../m/o/n/Talk%7EMonday_Club_82a5.html" title="Talk:Monday Club">Talk:Monday Club</a>) that I tempbanned him for two weeks for vandalism by means of deliberately making a fraudulent edit. Since I'm involved in the dispute and thus should probably not have acted myself I lifted the tempban after 18 hours. I'm wondering if other admins would like to review Robert's behaviour and see if a lonber tempban is justified. Just to note, he had also made veiled legal threats and vandalised other people's contributions to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGregory_Lauder-Frost_7f23.html" title="Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost">Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost</a>, in both cases I warned him over his behaviour but did not tempban him. Homey 19:37, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I did NOT falsify anything nor did I personally make any legal threats, nor did I vandalise anyone elses contributions. I resent very much how this matter is being turned against me by these characters as though they are perfect and unquestionable. It is a total disgrace. I wrote several articles which were systematically attacked by these people with a very clear left-wing agenda, attempting to hide behind a transparent veil of acting in the cause of 'neutrality' whilst at the same time blatantly altering entries which very clearly demonised individuals and groups and placed them in an unsavoury and generally accepted left-wing light. To cap matters they quoted journalists from two well-known left-wing newspapers which is hardly objective. At the same time they treated with absolute contempt the official description of these groups themselves, preferring to take as biblical the views of journalists. When I complained about their activities, they must have spent a very considerable amount of time ploughing through newspaper references until they found two more similar references in centrist papers. People with such agendas should have their wings clipped. This simply is not good enough. Anyone can see that by their relentless attacks and their very careful consistant, daily, and obvious editing of words, sentences etc that they have a clear agenda to demonise and smear people they perceive as being right-wingers. I have done my best to argue with them but have been treated with increasing amounts of bile and contempt and arguments which did not address the fundamental issues concerned: their vandalising of numerous subjects, removal of facts, even unediting words which had been mis-spelt and which I had corrected! They seem to think that they are above censure and ALWAYS right. Frankly this is a sad day for Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I see no similar attacks upon the home page for Karl Marx or a whole range of personalities of not just the left but the far left. It seem fanatical bias is OK only for those perceived to be on the Right. Well, thousands of people supported the groups and individuals in question and they were not all fascists or nazis but thoroughly decent people who were simply pleased that someone was enumerating their point of view when the politicians were refusing to hear. This entire business on Wikipedia is a scandal. Robert I 21:09, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(i) Actually, Robert I <b>did</b> falsify a quote (see <a href="../../../m/o/n/Talk%7EMonday_Club_82a5.html" title="Talk:Monday Club">Talk:Monday Club</a>). He can justify his actions however he wants, but there's no getting around the fact.</p>
<p>(ii) To favour criticial interpretations over official manifestos is usually regarded as a sign of objectivity. In any event, I quoted media sources from the left, right and centre.</p>
<p>(iii) Readers are directed to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGregory_Lauder-Frost_7f23.html" title="Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost">Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost</a> (a section marked "Observations") for my assessment of events. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 21:21, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I DID NOT falsify anything. These people have no remit to dictate how long or short a quote may be, a page, a line, a word. Let us be clear about this. This has been a campaign of denigration by user CJCurrie and his pal to smear people in the most malicious manner. These are the facts. He can dress them up as much as he likes but the clear evidence is not on talk pages but on the endless edits he and his pal have carried out right across a whole range of people and groups, most things changed to represent their sole opinions without any evidence to support the changes. It is revealing that CJCurrie is intent upon putting all his thoughts and opinions on Lauder-Frost's Talk page. This is a further deliberate effort against L-F and to make sure that his views go out on the internet. I think the entire business is an absolute disgrace. Robert I 21:35, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"I did NOT falsify anything"</p>
<p>Compare Robert's edit:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Conservative Monday Club is a right-wing pressure-group in Britain described as "an organisation which proselytized the more ancient and venerable conservative traditions of paternalism and imperialism" [cf.Levitas, p.60] [...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>with the actual quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"And there were groups -- like Aims of Industry (founded in 1942) and the Institute of Economic Affairs (1957) -- which advocated economic liberal ideas, and others (like the Monday Club, founded in 1960) which proselytized the more ancient and venerable conservative traditions of paternalism, imperialism and racism"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moreover, by taking the quote out of context, Robert was implying that it was a favourable comment on the Monday Club, wheras in reality he knew full well that the author, as he said later "Edgar is very left-wing" ie he was speaking sarcastically.</p>
<p>Robert's subterfuge was discovered when CJCurrie looked up the book by Levitas from which Robert extracted the quotation. His response when his subterfuge was discovered is telling by its absolute gall:</p>
<p>""Only someone on the left would have Ruth Levitas's book so you have revealed you true colours" (made at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGregory_Lauder-Frost_7f23.html" title="Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost">Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost</a></p>
<p>Homey 21:40, 11 December 2005 (UTC).</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact of the matter is that a writer decides upon how much of any quote he wants to use. Newspapers and the BBC take things out of context every single day of the week. The first two lines of the above-mentioned quote had no meaning regarding the Monday Club so it was not necessary to mention them at all. However, whether or not Edgar was being sarcastic or not (another debateable point of opinion only) the fact is that the Monday Club DID proselytize the more ancient and venerable conservative traditions of paternalism and imperialism, and that is a fact. Its that simple. Quoting the same does not necessarily mean that it was a "favourable comment" (doubtless in the eyes of the left it was not) but it was an accurate comment. As I have said before, these total nit-pickers have absolutely no right whatsoever to dictate to people what constitutes a quote. By raising this little item time and again they hope to obscure all the demonising exercises that they have been involved in for over a week. It is here that people should look, not at trivia like this. Robert I 21:57, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were in a university setting you'd be facing charges of academic dishonesty right now. No doubt you'd respond by calling it 'nit-picking' and accusing the faculty of being Communists. Homey 22:56, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to believe that someone can be as rude and offensive as you. Your very high opinion of yourself defies description. You have tried throughout to obfuscate readers on all the various talk pages. But your agenda is plain for anyone to see. Thank you for your email advising me that your pal CJCurrie is presently writing an article to do with the Communist Youth group and that he has a particular "interest" in fringe groups - right or left. I established that considerable time ago. It is this bias that I am attempting to have addressed. Robert I 09:57, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Guy, you are -- and I think I'm on fairly firm ground with this adverb -- literally fooling no one with your bluster.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for those helpful comments. It is clearly a matter of opinion. If you were quoting Cicero you might have some difficulty citing him if you did not lift a quote of your own choosing and size out of one of his endless speeches. By the rules laid down by CJCurrie etc., I would have to put in the entire speech. I lifed an accurate comment. Robert I 10:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It is truly galling that in a discussion accusing you of deliberately distorting comments in order to twist their meaning you would deliberately distort comments in order to twist your meaning. For the record, you sent me an email which said, in part:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>" I see he's writing an article for the Communist league of Canada. What a surprise."</p>
<p>My response was:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another example of your intellectual dishonesty. CJCurrie is not writing an article *for* the Communist League of Canada, he's editing an article *about* them. He has an academic interest in political fringe groups and candidates whether they are on the far right or the far left hence his interest in both the Communist League and the Monday Club.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Robert, your capacity for intellectual dishonesty is truly amazing. Homey 13:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I've done my duty by warning Wiki, and we will see what transpires in the future. Something you need to learn very quickly is that you cannot accuse people of something that they didn't do -- specifically, "trying to cause a bloodbath". Coincidentally, this very week Wikipedia found that out the hard way. If Tariana Turia contacted Wiki re your statement about her, your comments would be wiped quick smart, and you would be on your bike outta here.

<dd>The piece begins by seeking to establish some sort of imagined link between lobotomizers and Wikipedia (apparently the "front" of a globe is equivalent in the author's mind to the frontal lobes), and the author seems to have forgotten that her piece would be published on a page that includes the link to the Time's own disclaimer, which included this gem: "We make no representations or warranties about the accuracy, completeness or suitability for any purpose of the content published on the Websites.". She decries the lack of applicability of the Trade Descriptions Act to Wikipedia, as though Wikipedia had been deceptive in what it is offering, and as though it were conducting trade. Yup, Rosemary, somebody better get on the job of regulating speech, and quickly. Good plan. She doesn't seem the vandalistic type, more the "peasant with pitchfork" clamoring for the authorities to do something. But keeping an eye out is probably a good idea.- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:12, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I probably should have been clearer. What I meant to say is that the user page and talk page should be watched for vandalism. Even after her vitriolic screed, I don't expect her to do any inappropriate edits on the Wikipedia. On the other hand, I can easily imagine some of the more vocal Wikipedia partisans leaving inappropriate messages on those pages.

<p>One of the less pleasant things that I do on Wikipedia is work on issues related to the Holocaust. There is quite a bit of vandalism, as you might guess, but it is usually one-off stuff. Every once in awhile, an editor comes along pushing heavy Holocaust denial material, and decides to fight it out. The issue with Holocaust deniers is that they are often quite difficult to reason with, no matter what evidence you produce, it is part of the cover-up. Most recently, a new user User:Mark twain, who also posts as User:65.12.194.210, started putting Holocaust denial material in various articles, including links to one of the more over-the-top hate sites I have seen. When I reverted his change (and explained why in great detail on both his user page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mark_twain&amp;oldid=30990142" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mark_twain&amp;oldid=30990142" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> and on <a href="../../../t/r/e/Talk%7ETreblinka_extermination_camp_5694.html" title="Talk:Treblinka extermination camp">Talk:Treblinka extermination camp</a>), he immediately filed an RfC and an RfArb(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Goodoldpolonius2__and_Mark_Twain" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Goodoldpolonius2__and_Mark_Twain" rel="nofollow">here</a>). There is no doubt, as every other editor who has encountered this so-called "dispute" has agreed, that this guy is just pushing hate sites and denial material. I am not a big player on the Wikipedia meta discussions, so I don't know if there is any way to better deal with this sort of disruptive editor than the current approach (watch him, revert edits, ask others for help so I don't mess with 3RR, post info on why he is wrong, even though he won't read it, etc.). It is kind of tiring. Are there any other approaches that might help and be less exhausting? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 20:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you might have noticed from my copious reverts in Holocaust and Judaism related articles, I feel the same way you do. Unfortunately I don't know a better way than what you already mention, but I think that it's best not to engage with them since that only encourages them.

<dd>Alas. Well, if anyone has any ideas on how to address this issue more constructively, I would appreciate it. It is so tiring to keep fixing, but the most canonical example I hear of Wikipedia "upsetting" someone (Jimbo even gives it in his talks) is the parents of the kid who prints out Holocaust denial vandalism as part of a school project on the Holocaust.

<p>User:146.6.110.149, which tracks back to UT Austin, left a message on my talk page claiming to be Gary LaVergne, a UT employee and author of a book on Charles Whitman entitled <a href="http://www.garylavergne.com/book.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.garylavergne.com/book.htm" rel="nofollow">"Sniper in the Tower"</a>. He was complaining about some content about him, presumably at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Whitman_0e43.html" title="Charles Whitman">Charles Whitman</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sigenthaler's recent experience has encouraged me to send you this note. As you know, I have been the subject of some discussion in one of the pages you administer. Some of those comments I consider libelous. I strongly suggest that you, as the party responsible for this article and discussion, and/or Wiki executives take immediate action to purge such false and irresponsible statements, and block such from occurring in the future. Please forward this to Wiki executives. I look forward to your speedy response. Gary M. Lavergne</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a relative newcomer to the Charles Whitman page, having gone there a couple days ago after being asked to review some rather disruptive behavior and inappropriate editing by User:Subwayjack, who I blocked until this evening for 3RR, vandalism and disruption. I can only guess, but I assume that this person is referring to Subwayjack's rather convoluted assertion that Lavergne's book was biased and that he published it in collusion with the University of Texas somehow to support their position on Whitman (it was published by UT Press).</p>
<p>The article doesn't contain this speculative information currently, although at one time Subwayjack did insert it and it was summarily deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Whitman&amp;diff=30745179&amp;oldid=30739441" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Whitman&amp;diff=30745179&amp;oldid=30739441" rel="nofollow">inserting edit</a>. It does remain on the talk page, and I suppose in the article's page history. What's the general feeling about how to proceed? I don't think a person's comments on the talk page can be considered libellous, but maybe it's advisable to delete that edit from the article itself's revision history. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">mrp</a></small> 22:40, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IANAL, but I would suggest that, for starters, he be asked to identify what he considers libelous. It may be uncited crap, in which case it should be removed.

<dd>No, it wasn't sourced at all, just a rant. This is what he said: <i>LaVergne writes an intellectually appealing book 31 years later, omitting and editing to support his POV and the book is published by The University Press, who stands to garner public empathy and profits from a biased source (LaVernge now works for UT, was the book a factor to the job?)<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.187.194.251.html" title="User:68.187.194.251">68.187.194.251</a> 19:52, 9 December 2005 (UTC)Subwayjack</i> (inserted wholesale into the article, including the signature).

<p>Can someone put a leash on Bluemoose, please. I have been attempting to add the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Template%7ELifetime_8caf.html" title="Template:Lifetime">Template:Lifetime</a> to biographical articles for some time now, as I come across them, and I have found on occasion that Bluemoose has been around and removed them. Of late, he has been doing this more agressively, so I have had to go around those articles to which I have added the template to put it back. There has been no recent discussion on the talk page about deleting this template; and it has in fact survived a deletion attempt in the past. If Bluemoose wants to delete this template, he should go about it in the same way that everyone else does—by listing it on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>. (I have had occassion to have some conflict with the way that Bluemoose was running the Bluebot without full disclosure, before.) Until that time, it is extremely bad form to delete templates without any form of announcement on the talk page of the template. I will be reverting Bluemoose's deletions until he conforms to convention and announces his intentions in the appropriate place so that the community can decide on them. If you have comments on his behaviour, I would be very interested, and can I please ask you to keep an eye on him.

<p>The tone on Islam related pages is getting out of hand. I just came from <a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Sina_c99f.html" title="Talk:Ali Sina">Talk:Ali Sina</a> where I was told I should not attempt to resolve dispute because I cannot be impartial. The user then asked me what I would do, "Ban me? [him] By doing so you will confirm the fact that Muslims kill their opponents and where that is not possible censor them." This is not atypical of Islam related talk pages. I am not a Muslim but I imagine if I held Islamic beliefs dear that working on these pages would be rather intolerable. Such blatant incivility makes it more difficult for other users to remain civil. Many of the good long time editors have left because the situation on these articles is so bad. This is on many of the Islam related talk pages (<a href="../../../w/i/v/Template_talk%7EWivesMuhammad_5240.html" title="Template talk:WivesMuhammad">Template_talk:WivesMuhammad</a>). Something must be done to make working on these articles tolerable. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:40, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

In a related move I blocked <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">User:OceanSplash</a> for 24 hours for being repeatedly disruptive (see <a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Sina_c99f.html" title="Talk:Ali Sina">Talk:Ali Sina</a>) despite my telling him to cease antagonizing Muslims and making being a Muslim an accusation. I am more likely to see notice concerns about this issue on my talk page. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 04:59, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What would really be nice would be an API available to admins that would allow direct querying and interacting with the database. It would be nice to write a bot that checked every single recent change for, say, "Image:Human feces.jpg" but the bandwidth and server load would be prohibitive and it would be too slow to keep up with the pace of new recent changes (about 1 per second).

<p>An anon added a link for a vandal to check the expiry time of their block. That in itself indicates to me this is something the vandals want to have, hence we shouldn't give it to them.

<p>It is appreciated that you can remove yourself from such a situation, I just hope that you have more resolve than you did the first time you made such comments. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 06:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aolanonawanabe has recently made several edits to the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_Pain_e46e.html" title="Fetal Pain">Fetal Pain</a> page which I personally consider vandalism. The problem arrose when he added a POV tag without any discussion with other users, meaning he is trying to speak for the community. I didn't like this and tried to reason it out on the talk page, but he soon changed tatics and reworded the whole article changing the first sentence to something along the lines of "it's never debated due to it doesn't exist". My line before that was that it is heavily debated, which came from the original before I reworded it. I hope someone will help to stop this from escalating further. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 05:58, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He also is insisting life direct directly to Life magazine despite the fact that there are now two articles with life in their name which would require one of those joining page things that are used quite frequently. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 06:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now all can see that he has insulted me publicly. Which isn't a good debate strategy.

<dd>Oh boy. Let me make some comments which, unless I state otherwise, apply both of you:
<ol>
<li>Admins don't use their powers to intervene in content disputes.</li>
<li>Neither of you is a vandal, but you both push it sometimes.</li>
<li>Please review <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>! Carefully. What you're interested in writing about is one thing, but you shouln't write in a particular POV or remove material because you find it "offensive." (You can, of course, remove it if it's inaccurate.)</li>
<li>Don't bring your arguments to this page. Just the facts, please.</li>
<li>Aolanonawanabe, you should stop marking Chooserr's articles as non-notable or deletion-worthy because of the political views expressed by the subjects alone; many of them seem to be on notable, verifiable subjects.</li>
<li>Chooserr, we can find the block page ourselves if we need it, thanks.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Don't think me too much.
