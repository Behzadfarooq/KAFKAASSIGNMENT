<p>I've already blocked him, just reporting that fact here. This came to my attention because Emico requested that the article be protected on his version. When I determined that he was the only one in violation of the rule, I blocked him instead. I checked Emico's talk page to make sure he's been warned about the rule before, so he can't claim to have been unaware of it. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:24, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you review the recent behavior of Squeakbox, you will see he has stalked Rexjudicata on Wikipedia, and made changes to any page edited by Rexjudicata. He has claimed that Agwiii and Rexjudicata are the same person. They are not.</p>
<p>Squeakbox has written on the Parents Without Rights page that Grayson Walker has had his parental rights taken away by the court. This is not true. Beyond that, it would be impossible for Squeakbox -- in Honduras -- to have access to private records of a Florida family law case. The fact that he would write such a libel shows his intent is to harass and not contribute.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Squeakbox knows nothing of these topics, and the sole purpose of his changes have been to harass Rexjudicata. As Squeakbox is an "old" member of your clique (aka Wikipedia community), he rallied his friends for support and they joined him.</p>
<p>Your code of conduct notwithstanding, the fact remains that the behavior of Squeakbox is a violation of the Cyberstalking Laws of Florida, many other states, and a growing number of other countries. Your Wikipedia S.O.P. is in conflict with these laws, and that should give you pause. Why are your members allowed or even encouraged to break the laws in a growing area of International regulation?</p>
<p>If you can get past the fact that Squeakbox is "allowed" to make edits -- as are all Wikipedians -- and examine why and what he has been editing in his attack on Rexjudicata, you see that he has used your rules as a vehicle to harass Rexjudicata. The choice is yours -- ignore the stalking and harassing by claiming the rules permit Squeakbox's behavior -- or look at the unethical behavior of his stalking.</p>
<p>Consider what we call the ethics transparency test. Ask, "Could I give a clear explanation for the action, including an honest and transparent account of my motives, that would satisfy a fair and dispassionate moral judge?" Squeakbox's behavior fails this test.</p>
<p>Consider what we call the ethics Golden Rule test. Ask, "Would I like to be on the receiving end of this action and its potential consequences? Am I treating others the way I’d want to be treated?" Again, Squeakbox's behavior fails this test. If Rexjudicata had behaved as Squeakbox did, he would have gone to all of the substantive pages that Squeakbox edited, and made changes to them -- this did not happen. Instead, he posted his complaint about being cyberstalked and erased harassing comments made by Squeakbox on his page.</p>
<p>The choice is very clear. You may intervene and stop the unethical, stalking behavior of Squeakbox, or you can stand behind a technical interpretation of your rules, ignoring the fact that they permit unethical and illegal behavior. This is not about suggesting that Squeakbox or any other Wikipedian stalker be prosecuted, but about the fact that your rules are increasingly out of step with both ethics and laws. Philanthropists and investors are very careful about such issues.</p>

<p>The same thing goes for complaints about user conduct. That's what RFC is for. Produce the evidence and present it to the wikipedia comminity at large.

<li>Why not just block for a month or something. Give them some time to cool down. Maybe they will come back and do something constructive. I made a suggestion earlier that since they are so knowledgeable about cyberstalking laws, they should try to get the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalking</a> article up to FA status.

<li>I was planning to block him for a day or two at first, and ramp it up if he continued to make threats and be disruptive. I hate polls.

<li>It probably can, but I'm not sure it's a good idea. These votes are easy to discount at VfD-close time, and blocking them permanently just clogs up the block list.

<p>We should have a short boilerplate at the top of each VfD page which plainly states that votes from new users don't count - that might give some of these people pause. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:00, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Votes from new users are fine as long as they're not blank keep or delete votes, but have some reasoning which shows they know the policy.

<dd>No individual user apart from you has violated the 3RR.

<dd>Regardless of language, you Jews have incited it. I am frustrated that only you Jews get away with POV pushing on doubly ethnocentric and ethnoreligious bounds. I am not the only person that gets his edits to Jew topics reverted. It's all over the edit histories. You cannot disprove that you were there doing as I have said. Too bad buddy, you are way out of line and absolutely corrupt. You can't hide your trail of deception on the Wiki. Of course others have violated that rule. You're telling me that others who rv more than 3, 4, 5, 6 times probably even are not guilty of this wrongdoing? Nice spin doctoring, as I have already accused you of and it is right. Jews do this spin and get away with it. All the false politeness aka sugar coating won't save you from the flies attracted to you.

<p>My recommendation, for what it's worth, is to get a developer to compare what IP addresses that Enviroknot, ElKabong and KaintheScion used over a period of time. Let them make this decision. At the very least, it will give us some peace, and be as fair as possible to Enviroknot. I am always reluctant to accuse someone of sock-puppetry, because unless you are a developer there is no way of knowing for sure. Even developers must make a judgement call based on IP addresses. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:41, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've protected again. When Mel Etitis reinserted the sockpuppet notice, he gave a link here, but all I see that supports keeping the sockpuppet notice is Isomorphic's comment — nothing else. I personally favour keeping it, but this situation is getting ridiculous. I strongly recommend establishing more consensus supporting the tag before we reinsert it. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue">Ingoolemo</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 05:27, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)</p>

<li>David Gerard and Tim Starling have the same sockchecking options as the developers (who, generally, have more important things to do).

<p>Last night I was having trouble with <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">Rovoam</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/v/User_talk%7ERovoam_4655.html" title="User talk:Rovoam">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rovoam_92db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rovoam">contribs</a>) appearing under many proxy IPs and moving articles using cut and paste. When I warned him about it he must have misread my warning because he got very angry and said that I was endorsing an incorrect point of view over his own: when he continued to cut and paste I protected the pages. I was then treated to a barrage of vandalism on my talk page: 23 vandalisms in 10 hours, all apparently by the same user though using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000/Archive9&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000/Archive9&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">different IPs</a>.</p>
<p>Today I now have the other side of the battle lobbying me to change the content of the protected page (<span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx">Moses Kalankaytuk <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt>talk<tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Moses_Kalankaytuk_a986.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Moses_Kalankaytuk_a986.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/o/s/Moses_Kalankaytuk_f73a.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span>) to meet his own preferred edit. I have refused because I don't want to get involved in the debate and as the disclaimer says, the edit that is protected is not endorsement of that version of the page. However I readily admit that I know nothing about the subject or the apparent vandal in question. I am also at a point where I am ready to scream and punch something, due to some of the persistent personal problems that caused me to take a wikibreak recently and one or two other users who are just grinding me down a bit. If someone would like to take over at this point I would be very grateful. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> [[]] 15:41, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Noitall, to report a 3RR violation, you need to supply the diffs and times showing each change.

<dd>Also, if it's a partial revert, quote the sentence/passage he keeps reverting to, or if there's more than one, just pick one of them.

<p>I checked the diffs and there was a partial revert four times within three hours, so I've blocked him for 24 hours. First revert was to an 05:44 Jun 11 version of Anonymous Editor's. The sentence restored four times was: "All three religions regard him as the ancestor of the Jews, through Isaac, and the Arabs, through Ishmael."</p>

<dd>I've blocked him for 24 hours as he was blocked just a couple of days ago for 3RR on the same page. Schmucky and Mark, when you report violations in future, please include a diff clearly showing that the first revert was a revert, and not just an edit, and then also showing the diffs for, and times of, each of the subsequent four reverts. In this case, the earlier version Mimiian was reverting to (concentrating on the phrase that China is the oldest, or oldest continuing, civilization) was 21:25 Jun 16, and his reverts were 14:11, 14:40, 14:52, and 15:15 Jun 18. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:48, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What a strange thing to do. Oh well - to deal with it. I suppose it depends on how seriously you take it. The users are clearly sockpuppets, so I suppose you could label them as such under their votes so that people know to ignore them. Personally however I'd consider just letting it pass.

<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I'm placing this here because I've just searched a bunch of Wikipedia screens having to do with problems and administrators, and nowhere can I find a button for "Add New Message" or some such. (I'd appreciate being emailed a note as to how one in fact can do this; all I see is "Edit" buttons on existing messages like the one above to which I'm appending this.)</p>
<p>I a week or two ago I was on Wiki and edited an article (on the Baha'i Faith) slightly. Now, I suddenly not a notice that I have mail, and the mail is threatening me with banishment for supposedly doing something or other to an article about "Buuancy." I didn't access or edit any such article, and indeed wasn't even aware such an article existed!</p>
<p>I also got a note to stop harassing somebody or other whom I've never heard of and was not harassing.</p>
<p>PLEASE FORWARD OR REDIRECT THIS COMMENT TO THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATOR(S) since I can't seem to figure out how one is supposed to create a new message to them. Thank you.</p>
<p>And as I said, I'd very much appreciate being advised what's going on, that my account is now clear, and how exactly one does post a new problem message. (BTW, the list of "problems" to be brought to administrators needs to have an item added for administrative miscommunications such as the above as this doesn't seem to fit under any of the current problem categories.)</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

<p>Raul suddenly deleted the Everyking mentorship vote off the Requests for Arbitration page almost immediately after he got the 4th vote he was looking for to support his personally-encouraged mentorship program for Everyking without explaining to any admins what the results were. Unless you happened to have been watching the RfAr page, you had no idea this was even being discussed. So, what's the result? Admins aren't supposed to block Everyking when he makes an edit to Ashlee Simpson articles despite his parole? It would be nice if it were explained what we are supposed to or not supposed to do. It would also be nice if the section were kept on the RfAr page for more than a few seconds after it got the 4th vote. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:39, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How are we supposed to know that? It seems to me, that if there is a change to the arbcomm's parole ruling on a person, that the other admins should be notified of the change and not have it tucked away where nobody can find it. Especailly as I said, mere minutes after the 4th arbcomm vote was obtained, as if it were something shameful. My good faith is lacking considering the last two shameful arbcomm decisions (this one and jguk's). <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:46, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You aren't supposed to do anything. In the event that a conflict develops, it will be handled by the mentors. Otherwise I'm free to edit. That said, I think you have a lot to apologize for. You've been treating me unfairly for months about this. Even when we try to work out a fair deal you argue that I don't deserve a break. I wish you'd just let it go. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:49, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unless I happened to know that there was a change to the terms of your parole concerning editing Ashlee Simpson articles, I would have blocked you the first time you did so. Therefore, yes, I, and all other admins, needed to know that your parole had been changed. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:02, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But of course you did know that, because you were arguing on the Arbitration page. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:27, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. This should have been put on AN, like any other arbcom ruling. And I don't think demanding apologies from people is a terribly wise idea. It would be a grave mistake to take the declaration that you can't edit these articles without a team of three people to watch your every move as an endorsement that your behavior has been anything less than unacceptable. That sanctions and the explanations of well over a dozen other Wikipedians did not get through to you does not speak well to you or your behavior. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:29, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A <i>grave mistake</i>? What the? Is that supposed to be a threat? Anyway, Phil, this is just sour grapes. You know all the facts of the matter; I don't need to repeat them. Why don't you direct your passion for harassing other Wikipedians into editing some articles for a change? I'm curious: as an admin, you provoke controversy with nearly everything you do; if you were to engage in some actual editing, would you be equally controversial at that or less so? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:46, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Someone added a __NOEDITSECTION__ to <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_top_d7d6.html" title="Template:Vfd top">Template:vfd top</a>.

<li>Well done! I was wondering what was going on there. Would it be a good suggestion to protect the template? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:28, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it would be a good idea, since it's subst:'ed in a lot of pages, and vandalizing it means instant vandalism of all closed VfD discussions, which would need to be manually reverted on each one (but wait, first you have to <i>find</i> which of the 100+ per day was vandalized!). However, that wouldn't help much against a well-intentioned but ill-considered modification like that one (he might not be an admin, but he's on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> with twice the number of supports than the number of opposes... A few more days would have made the difference if the template was protected). That said, let's not be too hard on him... The intention (which I guess is to reduce the number of accidental edits of closed VfD discussions) was good, and even admins make mistakes. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 22:39, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly think it was just an honest mistake, I doubt very seriously that this was intended as vandalism. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:11, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I also think it's obvious it was an honest mistake. But just consider for an instant what vandalism on that template would cause... --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:13, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yup, it was an honest (if stupid) mistake by yours truly. I'm not sure it's <b>that</b> sensitive to vandalism though, the only reason this didn't get caught and fixed immediately was because it didn't directly shout "I've been vandalised" when you added it to a VfD. If someone added that goatsex picture to it or something the first person to subst it would notice, revert the vandalism and re-subst.</li>
<li>On the other hand, there's not much reason for not protecting it either as it doesn't need much editing. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 23:36, 2005 Jun 19 (UTC)</li>

<p>Several attempts to neutrally report serious internal debates within this party, from credible sources summarized at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreen_Party_of_Canada_ae42.html" title="Talk:Green Party of Canada">Talk:Green Party of Canada</a>, were reverted by Spinboy under several different transparent excuses. His fourth revert was marked a minor edit in bad faith, after a clear warning not to revert any further edits without discussing them and justifying his claims that they are somehow "inflammatory" or "POV" (words typically used by promoters of political parties as excuses to censor the truth about them). What's more, he self-righteously accuses those who wrote several different versions, in an attempt to satisfy his objections, of violating the three-revert rule, when none of the edits made by them were reverts. By contrast, all Spinboy's edits were actual reverts, and he's violated the rule deliberately. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.177.81.185 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.177.81.185.html" title="User talk:142.177.81.185">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.177.81.185_1ad1.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.177.81.185">contribs</a>) 04:05, 20 Jun 2005.</small></p>

<dd>Hello, I was asked why I unblocked Mr. Spinboy. Well, I thought the policy was, if you find an administrator to unblock you, then by all means do it. Plus, Im not a big fan of the 3 revert rule, and believe that instead of blocking people, we have them go to arbritration to settle their disputes. -- <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/20px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 16:22, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>that isn't wikipedia policy it is mearly wikipedia practice. As for the rest the comunity appears to want a 3 revert rule a juding by the size of this page it appears to want it inforced.

<dd>Fair enough. The optics of the situation just aren't very good when you block one party to a revert war and unblock the other. Hopefully Spinboy won't be back here again, but in future it might be best to ask for a second opinion from another admin to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.

<dd>Earl Andrew, you shouldn't unblock someone who's been blocked for 3RR unless there are some extenuating circumstances, such as they weren't warned or something similar. You can't simply unblock because you disagree with the policy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:04, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks like some institutional memory is called for here.

According to Jimbo Wales, edits by this user are supposed to be reverted on sight. This report should have been disregarded in the first place, although Spinboy would be well advised to request help if he doesn't know whether the three-revert rule applies. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:22, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Well, I thought the policy was, if you find an administrator to unblock you, then by all means do it."</p>
<p>No Earl Andrew, that's not the policy. 3RR blocks should be a no brainer and shouldn't be unblocked unless they were made in error (because one of the four reverts was misreported) or, perhaps, because the violator is a newbie who didn't know the rules. Reverting a block for no reason just because you're asked to is unprofessional. AndyL 21:28, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unblocked. I'm puzzled as to why Spinboy was reblocked, given that this was posted immediately below my explanation of why a block is not called for in this instance.

<dd>For what it's worth, Earl Andrew's block of User:142.177.81.185 doesn't seem entirely out of line. The anon IP stepped immediately into a revert war at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Canada_88c7.html" title="Green Party of Canada">Green Party of Canada</a>, and left some somewhat abusive edits and edit summaries there and on Spinboy's talk page.</dd>

<p>User:CoolCat inserted two copyright violations into the <a href="../../../g/a/p/GAP_Project_063a.html" title="GAP Project">GAP Project</a> article, and when the article was deleted, he brought it to VfU, then changed his mind and re-inserted the copyvio. I reverted him, at which point SPUI reverted to the copyvio without so much as a discussion. When I reverted again, leaving an edit summary that I was reverting a copyvio, SPUI reverted it again, again without discussion.

<dd>CoolCat has said several times on the wiki that he is the author of the content. Like I told you earlier, he also said this to me as soon as the trouble first started, on April 22. He told me this two hours after the very first copyvio notice was ever added to the page. Perhaps this is why SPUI was reverting without adding anything new to the discussion. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 04:56, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You have no idea what SPUI's motive is. Where did he and CoolCat ever communicate this non-copyright violation status?

<p>There's no proof of it being a copyvio, and that has been discussed to death. So let's assume a little good faith here.

<dd>Your past behavior would preclude good faith, and your failure to discuss the revert would enforce that. Silsor should not have taken it on himself to unblock you, but be warned, if you revert it again, I will block you again. Take it to the VfU page and discuss it. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:41, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And now Ugen64 has taken it upon himself to revert it as well, also without discussion. I must wonder why the need to violate not only VfU but continual reversion to a copyright violation. Is there a particular reason why nobody wants to discuss this before making such major actions?

<li>This isn't a dispute about differing opinions about content, it's a dispute about the copyright status of the material. If people are violating policy by inserting copyright material, I don't see why we can't treat a 3RR "violation" the same as if you had to break the 3RR to revert vandalism. I'm not sure this article should even exists as there is an open VfU on it. I'm going to unblock until we sort this all out. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 06:04, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Like it says under my user page, I won't perform the same admin action (like blocking) twice - but I don't think there's any sorting out to do. RickK flaunted the rules and received the same consequence he would have given anybody else in the same situation. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 06:15, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For the record, I would like to offer my opinion. If Rick genuinely believes that content is a copyright violation, then, in my opinion, he had every right to continue reverting it as if it was vandalism. Rick went out of bounds by blocking SPUI. Rick is right: SPUI was only reverting him to antagonise him. But antagonisation isn't a blockable offence. Still, though, Silsor really jumped the gun here. I haven't known Silsor to be overly impulsive and aggresive, but he has been here. He chose not to so much as give Rick, a long-time editor in good standing, so much as a <i>warning</i> before blocking him for the maximum time allowed. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 06:15, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Blankfaze, I agree. Yet another instance of the poison of the 3RR - it is carted out way too easily and often, without demanding any type of discussion. Page protection is usually a better alternative, and one that should always be tried first before the abrubtness of a user block. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 06:33, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If a suspected copyright violation is counted as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">simple vandalism</a> (which I think it could be, though that page doesn't say so) then the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">three-revert rule</a> doesn't apply since it (wrongly in my opinion) states that the rule "does not apply to self-reverts or correction of simple vandalism". Rick had reasons to disbelive Coolcat's story about it not being a copyvio, so its understandable he was treating it as a continued violation of policy. That's not to say he's not wrong for protecting the page or blocking SPUI, but I don't think this is a clear-cut case of 3RR. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:45, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

Removing copyvio material is not a violation of the 3RR, but was it really established to be copyvio?

<li>It's not like coolcat is a new user without a history. Coolcat's position was also being supported by an established user, SPUI. RickK demonstrated his unwillingness to come to agreement by blocking SPUI twice and by protecting an article he was involved in a dispute in... Normally I'd agree that we should be cautious about 3rring someone who is trying to remove something they claim is copyvio, but our obligation to assume good faith ends when its is clear that they are unwilling to communicate or comprimise.

<li>Blankfaze's statement was not an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>. Ad hominem refers to someone's argument not someone's behaviour.

<li>Coolcat has made the claim that he wrote the text (which is completely realistic considering his involvement with Turky), but rather than respond to that argument Blankfaze attacks coolcat's (and spui's) character. I'm not sure what other than <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> to call it. I suppose it's better than what Rickk did, as it seems he just pretended the claim was never made and reverted away. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 03:29, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no need for double standards for administrators. Wikipedia can live without RickK for a single day. There were three other editors that RickK was reverting, not just one. Since there was clear doubt about whether there was a copyright violation, (the 3 others reverting him) he should not have violated 3RR. He should have waited, or enlisted the assistance of others, perhaps by personal contact, or alternately, by starting an RfC regarding the article. Instead, he reverted a fourth time to his own preferred version, and then protected the page, enforcing his view regarding the copyright status without consensus. This indicates a dire need for a "cooling off period" provided by a 24 hour block. I understand the concern about copyright, but the fact he was reverting three others, not just one, is indication that this wasn't simple vandalism. RickK should receive the same treatment that anyone else who is fully aware of 3RR would receive. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 21:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're talking about this as if it were a dispute over POV content. It's not. He was attempting to implement policy on copyright violations.

<p>This is shameful - RickK was clearly acting in good faith. That it wasn't cut and dry is clear. That discussion would have helped is clear. But erring on the side of not having the Wikimedia foundation embroiled in a lawsuit it probably can't afford is NOT something to block over - particularly when the contributor is a longstanding and respected member of the community. SPUI should be ashamed that he could think of no other method of resolving this dispute beyond requesting a block. And as for Silsor, I hope he's intending to do a lot more RC patrol than he has been, because we're going to need the help without RickK. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:19, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please cool off a little bit. That accusation is nearly a personal attack. As shown by the active discussion here, it is <u>not</u> clear that Silsor's action was a bad decision. The block for violating 3RR has been nearly automatically applied to those who know the rule; suggesting Silsor did anything wrong is ignoring that well established precedent. It is also on the verge of creating a double standard for admins. No one forced RickK to leave. It is <i>still</i> his choice. For one so frequently harsh, I think he just had a "thin-skinned moment" and hope he'll be back.

<dd>Under no circumstance should an administrator refrain from blocking <i>any</i> user only from fear that the user will leave. If the block was unjustified and wrong it will be because RickK was reverting vandalism. If there was a breach of the 3RR, a block was justified. Silsor should not be blamed for RickK's departure.

<p>The argument advanced here, that RickK was acting in good faith because he was trying to protect us from legal liability would only make sense if that was normally how we responded to copyright violations. But it isn't... We play copyright very fast and lose and I've recieved substantial pushback from deleting media with less reason to believe it was copyvio than the material in question. I think we do need to become a bit more agressive, but as it stands we are not at all... What we see here is a fairly typical example of RickK playing it lose with the rules out of anger, distrust, and dislike for our editors. I however do not blame RickK for this, as his actions are useful and we often thank him for them, but rather I blame all of us... for failing to continually monitor his behavior. Quite simply, Rickk should have long been used to being told to cool it and that he isn't is a huge failing on our part. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 03:48, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I however do not blame RickK for this...but rather I blame all of us... for failing to continually monitor his behavior.</i> What I see is a fairly typical load of holier-than-thou codswallop. RickK did what copyright violation policy called for -- deleting the violating material immediately to minimize Wikipedia exposure to copyright infringement. CoolCat has hardly lifted a finger to dispute the violation, except to claim that he wrote the original text without offering a shred of proof. If Gmaxwell wants to dispute RickK's actions, fine, but spare everyone the passive-aggressive drive-by insults, okay? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:21, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>He made the claim, he was ignored by RickK. He reverted the in error removal, he was reverted. He solicited the help of other editors. I do not see what Coolcat failed to do. What proof were you expecting? There is no reason anyone should be insulted by my commentary. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 10:45, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>What proof were you expecting?</i> What Rick "ignored" was content-free handwaving. I was expecting, I dunno, maybe the teeny tiniest evidence that CoolCat actually wrote the text. Writing credit, job title, first use of text with his name attached, somthing, ANYTHING. You know, a speck of a ghost of a shred of evidence for his claim. Maybe for you the "indignant sputtering" standard is sufficient, but I prefer something a little more substantial -- hell, minimal -- especially for copyright violations. I mean, his self-contradicting <i>I know its nothing like www.adiyamanli.org. Even if it were I know its pd</i> statement might have been a tip-off: "Judge, I don't care what all those witnesses said, I didn't kill the guy. Besides, if I did, it was self-defense."</dd>
<dd><i>There is no reason anyone should be insulted by my commentary.</i> Except for your sanctimonious tone, question-begging "gosh, we all failed him" assertion disguised as a premise, misstatement of the situation, and ignorance of the underlying issues, no, not a thing. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:39, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>eh. Let me known when you actually have a material point to make against my statement rather than a bunch of rightious handwaving... and please stop pushing the weak argument that RickK's edits could possibly have reduced our copyright related liability here: The material was still just as available from Wikipedia as it is preserved in the history. Copyright law wouldn't look on it any differently, now a court might but they would cut us the same slack if we left it up while trying to understand coolcat's claim. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 12:59, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It should be noted that the hundreds of Wikipedia mirrors tend to only make available the most recent version of articles. Even though reverting the page only moves the questionable content to the history, it <i>does</i> prevent it from being reproduced on the hundreds of other sites across the Web who make the good-faith assumption that Wikipedia material is all genuinely GFDL.</dd>
<dd>Whether that materially affects the legal exposure of Wikipedia or the mirrors is, I dare say, a secondary concern. It affects Wikipedia's <i>reputation</i> if we regularly release material of questionable provenance. It also affects the real owner of the copyright, who at least deserves our consideration even if we don't fear a lawsuit. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:29, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I don't think that either. I think a good summary of my opinion is that copyright disputes don't merit edit warring. Protection may play a part in this but should not be done as a matter of course. Normal editing should be enough. Rick shouldn't have edit warred. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:31, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dc80.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Elizabeth II of Canada">VFD</a> for this page has been closed twice now, once by an anon, and once by the nominator (AndyL). I've re-opened the discussion both times. My reasoning is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VFD has only just had the 5 days <i>minimum</i> discussion - given the length of the debate and the heated arguments on both sides I think it would be best to let it rest a few days longer before fixing the decision;</li>
<li>The consensus is only just 2/3 for merge/redirect to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> - again, this is a <i>minimum</i> requirement to judge consensus, but is not necessarily sufficient to close the VFD at this stage;</li>
<li>VFDs should be closed by admins or other trusted users, not by anons (particularly one who seems to be involved in Canada-related edit wars himself), and they should preferably not be closed by the nominator or anybody else involved in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally think that the merge/redirect call is the Right Thing to do, but that the way this VFD has been processed was the Wrong Thing. If there's any rush to close vfds, it should be the several days of backlog that gets hit first. And as I said to AndyL - if he's so sure he's made the right call, then it'll still be the right call in a few more days time. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">→•←</a> 09:24, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I support your actions. VfDs may not be closed by anonymous users and should not be closed by anyone too closely associated with the debate. These procedural controls are increasingly important as Wikipedia gets larger. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could someone who has not already participated in the debate please take a look at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dc80.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Elizabeth II of Canada">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Elizabeth II of Canada</a> and determine whether or not there's a consensus? As far as I can determine, according to the consensus guideline at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> the criteria has been met since there's more than a 2/3 majority to merge/redirect but since I proposed the VfD in the first place it's apparently seen as objectionable for me to declare the now week old VfD closed and implement a redirect (the merge has already been done). I thought it was a "no-brainer" since the 2/3 threshold has been exceeded but I'm fine stepping aside. I'm just concerned that the VfD will be left to languish through admin neglect. AndyL 21:10, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I concur with AndyL, but since I voted m&amp;r in that VfD, how about a third opinion? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:27, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did not vote on this one. There is certainly consensus that most of the content should be kept. There is also a definite majority, but perhaps not a consensus, in favour of merging it with <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>; however, merging content should not, and does not, require the same high standards as deleting it.

<p>On <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsushima_Islands_da49.html" title="Tsushima Islands">Tsushima Islands</a> there's currently a debate concerning the article title: should it be plural or singular? <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENanshu_286a.html" title="User talk:Nanshu">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nanshu_d64e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nanshu">contribs</a>) tried to short-circuit the debate by placing the article on "requested moves" without mentioning this ion the Talk page, but failed. There's now a discussion and a poll on the move, but Nanshu insists on changing the <i>text</i> of the article to the singular. Aside from trying to sideline the discussion and ignore the attempt to reach consensus, this makes the text of the article conflict with the title. He has been warned a number of times, but continues to insist on his edit.</p>
<p>Now, it seems to me that this has gone beyond mere stubbornness, and is certainly not good-faith editing — but is it vandalism?

<dd>That was my first look at the article yesterday, and it's certainly a crazy talk page. I'd normally say protect until the vote is over, but Mr Tan would have a fit. Vandalism is a bad-faith edit, which would here suggest it would only be vandalism if he guessed he was going to lose the vote, for example, but was making the changes regardless. I'd put a note on his talk page saying his edits are going to be regarded as vandalism if he keeps on making them; or you could regard them as disruption of Wikipedia, which might make it blockable. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:29, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note our anons characteristic impolite lack of signature (this isn't because they are a newbie: check their edit list). Geni: can you amplify your comment? I too (like Pj) don't understand it: this appears to be a completely straight 3RR vio with no mitigating circumstances whatsoever. Just like 204's previous 3RR vio on Einstein, which for no obvious reason attracted no admin response whatsoever. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>the first revert involves the removal of the hidden text "This article (which is 36 kilobytes long; 15 Jun 2005) is split from the main article (which is 34 kilobytes long; 15 Jun 2005) because of size considerations of relevant information". The editor does however have a history of breaking the 3RR and the change is not significant (it is only visible to editors) I'm going to block for 24 hours. I hope this doesn't affect to many inocent users.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:08, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>User is repeatedly reverting an edit, despite lacking any relevant factual objection to the new text; IMO, this is being done in violation of NPOV, since the proposed text actually removes partisan comments rather than adds thereto. This is, in fact, his FIFTH infraction, but the previous revert falls outside of the 24 hour period required by 3RR. See article talk page for discussion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimon_Dodd_3e88.html" title="User talk:Simon Dodd">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simon_Dodd_ab0a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simon Dodd">contribs</a>) 20:37, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>I added a suspected sock puppet notice to user Bloghate.

<li>Bloghate is a bleedingly obvious role account. Why is it that we don't have a policy against role accounts in the first place, I'd say their very existence is strongly leaning towards <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 07:44, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definitely a role account, but my own feeling is that it's a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> one, that it is one of those sarcastic "you VfD'd my blog, so now I'll VfD all of them" things. All we can do is consider the blogs one at a time and ignore the fact that it is a role account. If it's a POINT gesture, then rationally voting to delete on the insignificant blogs and keep on the significant ones will starve the troll. If it's not a POINT account, then it will <i>still</i> starve the troll. Unless someone can dig up the IP and say that it is definitely X or Y regular user, I'd just ignore what he's doing and proceed as normal. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:01, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its not just that it is a blatantly obvious (t)role account, but it is one that is created for the sole purpose of being rude and disruptive. The username alone is offensive. By not banning the account, is this sort of activity being tolerated or condoned? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 22:29, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How is it offensive? I can hate baseball without hating a baseball player, or rap music without attacking a rap musician. The point is that what this person is doing is disruptive only if there are a lot of votes. The default action for VfD is to keep. Most of the things the user nominated have won "keep" votes. In the cases where they haven't, the things have needed to go. If the person were filing RfC's or going to VfU or multiplying votes, or insulting people, it would be disruptive. Also, he or she has nominated a lot of blogs, but the really disruptive trolls do something like nominate 50 articles in a row, which overloads the VfD vote for the day. Again, I'm not defending or denying that this person is trolling. I'm just saying that it's not bannable. The danger of feeding the troll is greater than the trouble of ignoring it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:44, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The problem with Bloghate is that his behavior is <i>disruptive</i>. He causes people to get angry, and causes people to vote 'keep' not for the merit of the article, but for the fact that Bloghate nominated it. The last time that happened, the user responsible was eventually banned from VFD by ArbCom. It wouldn't hurt to do something about this before it escalates. After all, the main thing Bloghate is doing is POV pushing. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:25, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I had a look. This user only ever seems to have carried out disruptive actitivies. I don't care about its motives; clearly it's a role account of some kind and absence of a policy on role accounts isn't a good excuse not to block it. I've blocked it indefinitely. Its owner is free to open other accounts and perform non-disruptive edits, or to do so without opening an account. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:10, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comments:</b> Page has been this way for some time. Simon Dodd comes in and wipes out a democratic opposition point of view, claiming his version represents the "facts". Some Democrats specifically opposed the Nuclear Option specifically because it would allow a Republican president to nominate a judge who can get confirmed by 50 Republican senators. Simon Dodd keeps removing the "Republican" in front of "Senators" under cries of "POV" and "facts". I don't argue that the nuclear option would change the confirmation process to require 50 Senators regardless of party affiliation, but the sentence is intended to represent the point of view of those who oppose the Nuclear option specifically because it would allow Republican-Only confirmation of judges. Simon Dodd's version erases that point of view. His version does NOT report this opposition point of view. I keep tryign to explain this on talk page but he keeps taking out this opposition point of view. I keep putting it in and he reports me for 3RR. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/e/User_talk%7EFuelWagon_11da.html" title="User talk:FuelWagon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FuelWagon_8d8f.html" title="Special:Contributions/FuelWagon">contribs</a>) 21:25, 20 Jun 2005.</small></p>
