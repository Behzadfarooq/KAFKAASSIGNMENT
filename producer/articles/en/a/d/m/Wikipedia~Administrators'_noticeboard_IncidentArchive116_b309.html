GLF is not protected by the rehabilitation of offenders act and besides, the content of his Wikipedia article included a blatent falsehood in that it suggested he had been cleared of all charges on appeal.

<p>Today, Ed Chilvers received a letter from Gregory Lauder-Frost's lawyers threatening him with legal action. Sussexman's "as you will soon discover" would be a reference to this and should be taken as a legal threat. If Sussexman is not Gregory Lauder-Frost then he is intimate enough with him to be able to pass on a legal threat. He should be banned from wikipedia until the matter is resolved and until GLF either concludes or agrees to withdraw any threat of legal action. Homey 18:35, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thats what you'd like us to believe because you are and have always been a major player against GLF, his article, and anyone remotely associate with him. Anyone breaking our laws <i>will</i> "soon find out" and that is very standard parlance. You cannot link Sussexman with this letter. That it may have arrived at the same time as these discussions were continuing is merely co-incidental, Sherlock. Do you honestly think that banning one, two, three, or more people unless they contact someone they havn't seen for years, possibly a decade or more, and tell him to withdraw a perfectly justificable private and personal legal action will work? Justice does not operate that way. 81.129.155.181 21:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>By googling "Ed Chilvers" or looking his name up in a British database. It seems from Ed Chilvers' web page that he has been the target of legal threats from Michael Keith Smith, a friend of Lauder-Frost's, in the past so it's possible Lauder-Frost already had Chilvers' contact info.

<dd>I support the block. Sussexman has been consistently disruptive over any attempt to include content not flattering to Lauder-Frost. William Pietri put in some tremendous work digging up newspaper reports and showed that Lauder-Frosts's conviction for theft was the single most widely reported fact about him; Sussexman and a couple of anonymous editors were determined to remove this or at least relegate it to euphemistic references. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sussexman is not Lauder-Frost. Preposterous. Sussexman has defended the vitriolic attacks made upon someone he knew years ago and liked and felt a great injustice was being done to. He was quite right to tell people crossing legal boundaries that they were doing this and quite right to tell people that by doing so they would soon find out the consequences. That <b>is not</b> a legal threat and banning everyone who points out simple facts is not the way forward for Wikipedia which should not be above the law. 81.131.37.101 07:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For values of vitriolic which include stating in terms of studied neutrality the fact that he was convicted of a substantial theft from the health authority where he worked. As far as I can the most of the vitriol has been directed against those who attempted to fix the inaccuracy of the article, by supporters of Lauder-Frost. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:33, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Here you go raving about the pre-1992 business as though it were last week and without the full knowledge of the matter. It was <b>illegal</b> to post details of this. Telling people this should be taken in good faith. Instead you ban people for it. 81.131.122.17 13:51, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I give my absolute support to Sussexman. I too posted information on how this cabal of smearers were breaking UK law. Any normal person would be pleased for the advice. But this lot knew what they were doing and were absolutely determined to smear GLF all over the world. Sussexman appears to be the third person they have blocked for "legal threats", yet none of them appear to actually be the person concerned and so were not in a position to threaten anyone! Is it Wikipedia policy to block out everyone whom you get sick of arguing with? 195.134.6.202 16:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are acting as a proxy for someone else's legal threats, I consider it substantially identical to making them yourself. Wikipedia can't prove the relationship between the Wikipedia username <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">User:Sussexman</a> and the real-world individual Gregory Lauder-Frost, but I believe it does not really matter. Conveying threats from another non-Wikipedia party when one is not merely a messenger but an associate and clearly involved in an on-Wikipedia effort to suppress the same information differs little in actual effect from explicitly making them yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I note also that GLF and/or friends and associates were quite happy to keep a lie on the page (that GLF was acquitted of theft on appeal) but are willing to sue on extremely flimsy grounds to hide the truth. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 19:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm sorry to have to inform you that I bear Gregory Lauder-Frost no personal ill will whatsoever. I don't know him, have never encountered him, and did not even know of his existence prior to your first postings on this page about it. I am, however, interested in keeping an honest historical record, concerned about an attempt to censor relevant truth, and opposed to those who seek to chill discussion and publication of facts by using dubious legal threats. A brief, half-sentence mention of Gregory Lauder-Frost's criminal conviction in 1992 - which could not be considered any kind of "youthful indiscretion" or to be prior to his public life - is not unfair to him. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 15:35, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just to update people on this, there've been further significant developments today.

<p>Since I must drudge up old conversation; Until there is conclusive proof that this was a reference to the legal threat/action, could we unblock?

<dl>
<dd>IMO, no chance. We don't operate in a realm of absolute 'conclusive proof' here - but Sussexman is either Gregory Lauder-Frost or closely related to him and passing on threats from him. Either is blockable. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 21:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> is clear that a block must be maintained until the legal dispute is resolved. It's worth pointing out also that there is essentially <i>no</i> content dispute - the facts are uncontested; the dispute is over whether certain of the facts (i.e. GLT's conviction) can be included in the article, under English and Scottish law. If the dispute is resolved satisfactorily then maybe we can think about unblocking Sussexman. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:33, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You have deliberately tried to rubbish someone all over the WWW. naturally you will receive legal threats. People have to get on with their lives, not commit suicide because of your smears. 195.194.75.209 17:26, 28 June 2006 (UTC).</li>
</ul>
<p>I support Sussexman, who appears not to be the first but the third User banned for these "legal threats". If ten people had come on and pointed out that you were all breaking the law with your reckless smears would you ban everyone? The question is, do you people think you can do anything and no-one can tell you you're wrong? I think you've got a bloody cheek. What's even worse is User:Homeontherange's current efforts to delete numerous UK biographies because he doesn't like Monday Club Tories or that Sussexman had some hand in writing them. What a bunch. 81.129.155.181 21:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I support Sussexman. There is a small team of anti-rightists at work here. I believe this blocking to be wrong. Tempers may fray sometimes but you cannot accuse everyone of <i>legal threats</i> because they state the obvious to other users who are clearly breaking the law. It appears that no less than three users have now been blocked for pointing out that Gregory Lauder-Frost was being defamed on Wikipedia. Had ten or twenty users argued like this would they all be blocked too? Are this gang above reproach? 86.139.185.202 11:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is not the issue here. Just because supporters of GLF say that UK law has been broken here does not mean to say that it is so. I refer people to the article on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Fry_d29b.html" title="Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a> which makes mention of his serving time in a Young Offenders Institution for cheque theft. If what the anonymous users are saying is true then this would also be illegal under UK law.And even if GLF does have a case then it is a civil as opposed to criminal matter. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 18:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The simple facts are that Humansdorpie spent a considerable amount of time goading and teasing Sussexman with a load of garbage. Eventually it clearly reached the stage where he had had enough and responded in kind. I can see from all those involved in this series of witch-hunts that it is perfectly all right for "the gang" to use snide and cynical remarks, to make absurd claims, and to delete articles that required a great deal of time and effort on the part of others. But it is entirely inappropriate to respond under this concerted pressure. One is then accused of being horrid. It must be hard being perfect. I'm not and doubtless Sussexman isn't either. 213.122.71.45 18:58, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not so. Humandorpie and myself was slandered as a 'red,' and a 'force of evil' on various extreme right wing forums all over the web. It was even suggested that the Wikipedia entries on our alleged 'heroes' Marx and Lenin should be vandalised in retaliation over the GLF article. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 09:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Cartoid sinus/fingernail conflation is never good. As to the broader question, having followed the recent BGC discussions here only cursorily, I wonder whether anyone attempted to ascertain the reasons for his recent devolution? I don't mean in any way to suggest that his behavior has been appropriate, but I always knew him to be a sincere, if sometimes abrasive, editor, one who surely favored logical debate over (largely incoherent) personal attack, and who would not, in any event, write in the fashion in which he now seems to write. Even for Wikipedia, where valuable contributors sometimes become disruptive with celerity, this change seems odd. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

That said, the problem is with Brian not with other people (except in as much as they engage in the addition of ludicrous sophomoric content which annoys people like Brian and me, not that I'm saying Badgerpatrol does this since I've not looked).

In hindsight, I regret that last comment, but I certainly don't think it was offensive or provocative, nor out of keeping with the normal back and forth associated with RfA discussions. I haven't ever been engaged in any previous disputes with Brian (except for good-natured and good faith discussion on AfD), and in the past I've actually tried to mitigate his abrasive behaviour (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FBrian_G._Crawford&amp;diff=54052874&amp;oldid=54048423" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FBrian_G._Crawford&amp;diff=54052874&amp;oldid=54048423" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrian_G._Crawford%2FArchive_2&amp;diff=59981282&amp;oldid=59794780" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrian_G._Crawford%2FArchive_2&amp;diff=59981282&amp;oldid=59794780" rel="nofollow">this</a>)). I'm not upset with Brian; if he's having problems he's having problems, everybody does stupid things sometimes in difficult circumstances, and the style of his comments (which admittedly was always robust and abrasive) has recently changed to such an extent that I frankly wonder whether his account has been hijacked by someone else, as seems to have happened in the past. If anything, I'm a bit more aggrieved at being accused of trolling- that just isn't the case, and it's all a bit disappointing. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'd better distribute it to some hundred (or preferable thousands) participants and let them indicate if they are diagnosed. Ideally, you should screen all particpants for ASDs with DSM. Then you can take it yourself and compare results. It's not as easy as you claim it is. I've spent many hundred hours on this project. Additionally, many participants in the autistic community and others have helped my by taking time to fill it out.

<p>I too agree entirely with the above points. Paul adams is repeatedly blanking sections of the <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazher_Mahmood_2e3e.html" title="Mazher Mahmood">Mazher Mahmood</a> article relating to the subject's exposure by British Member of Parliament <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Galloway_f81f.html" title="George Galloway">George Galloway</a>, falsely claiming the material, which is wholly factual and sourced, to be 'disputed'. He also constantly removes a photograph of Mahmood which has since April been deemed fit for publication after a ruling by the British courts. This user is in flagrant violation of several Wikipedia rules, and IMO should be blocked permanently, and a watch kept for possible use of sockpuppetry. (So far, there have also been a few instances of edits identical to those of the user in question being made from an anonymous IP address). <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Hatton_1007.html" title="User:Guy Hatton">Guy Hatton</a> 17:25, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Policy is policy. You guys want to include information that the subject of the article considers harmful to him - info that is related to his (non-notable) real-life career, not his (possibly notable) blogging career. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> says "do no harm"...and yet, Silensor et al. insist on including the information. The page was established as an attack page initially. It did it's job - he quit blogging because his identity became widely known (via the Wikipedia article). There's a campaign to include information about his his clients and the law firm he works for. The subject of the article considers it a threat to his job. I have no idea why certain editors are so hellbent on including that information. Either it's just raw abuse of power, or a concerted attempt to hurt the guy. And they seem to think that it's "insane" to expect them to adhere to Wikipedia policy.

<p>This user, who is apparently named "David Jason Silver", has decided that Wikipedia exists for his self-promotion. For the past month he's been writing articles about himself and his company, and inserting references to himself into many other articles, always inappropriately and sometimes fraudulently. He has been warned about this many times, but has barely acknowledged any warnings or used the talk pages. He has recreated deleted articles, removed Afd tags, engaged in repeated copyvios/plagiarism, and other inappropriate behavior. Each account has been blocked once for brief periods. I propose that the next time he inserts a self-reference, a copyvio, or other previously-warned behaviors, he get a one-week block on both accounts. Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, this guy's edits are bordering on the bizarre. At one point, in an article now deleted, he had listed the full name of his 16 year old daughter (not something I would do if I had a 16 year old daughter), and his home address. Not to mention the self-glorifying nature of the edits - he refers to himself as a "war hero" (he was a sailor in peace time on a ship off the Balkans - not exactly in the heat of battle, a "land baron" and "business magnate," a "famous amateur wrestler," a "business partner of Donald Trump," and a "future presidential candidate." Thanks to supplying us with his full name and address, I found out he has a weird trademark infringement lawsuit with Motorola, and equally bizarre "blog" and homepage <a href="http://silverkidd.spaces.msn.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://silverkidd.spaces.msn.com/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, and has refered to himself as a "war hero" on numerous forums <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/s/i/l/David-J-Silver/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/s/i/l/David-J-Silver/index.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (just one example). I'm starting to wonder what is going on - is this a delusional individual with aspirations of glory but without the, *ahem*, social skills or intellect to achieve it, or is it someone else intentionally smearing David Silver or trying to make him look foolish? --<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 04:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't seen, or don't recall, the edit which contains the girl's name. However I'm familiar with most of this editors work here on Wikipedia, and have looked at his personal blog. The style and focus are consistent, so I that this account really is Silver. I expect that he would have included his daughter's name due to vanity rather than ill-intent. I am more concerned with his energetic self-promotion, which is so unwarranted that it amounts to vandalism and which is sometimes outright fraudulent. I think that we should give him at least another chance, when his blocks expire, but that if the behavior doesn't change he'll eventually have to be blocked indefinitely. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:56, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't want to start a wheel war, especially since I'm not really around that much anymore, but am I the only one troubled by Malo's deletion of eon8 after he was the one who started the AfD? This is a site that's been linked to from lots of places, and been discussed all over the internet. The page was written in NPOV and acouple of my friends on myspace even referred to wikipedia's link on it. Thousands of people are curious to what this is. But the more important part is, the AfD was improperly closed. Thoughts? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">Redwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 05:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought the same. There was no consensus in the AfD to delete, even discounting new editors' comments. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 05:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, we need a sysop to reinstate this article, and pronto. The situation at eon8 (the eon8 experiment having drawn the attention of the DHS and CIA, specifically) is the first reason I've had to contribute outside of Wikipedia userspace in almost a year. Last I checked, defaulting your own VfD's to <i>any</i> decision was a "no-no" here. That there's no consensus on how to handle eon8 goes without saying right now, and at the very least, the eon8 article should resume regular editing while a new VfD is conducted. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShem_Daimwood_ae70.html" title="User:Shem Daimwood">Shem</a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShem_Daimwood_0bf4.html" title="User talk:Shem Daimwood">(talk)</a></sup> 05:41, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>While I know that another cases involving InShaneee has been brought here recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=60886283&amp;oldid=60885603" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=60886283&amp;oldid=60885603" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, I want some Admins to take a look at this one, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article talk page(and it is only a matter of time that the article will) is back to its spammed state after my announce of departure, which forced me to return. User:Neurobio is already calling to an 'invasion' of the genocide page using my departure. First by warning a user who is under probation, a probation which includes that article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cool_Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61179720" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cool_Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61179720" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, then contacting User:Lutherian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lutherian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61181605" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lutherian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61181605" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> asking the removal of a sourced information.</p>
<p>I request my talk page materials be undeleted and Administrators look over the rational behind InShaneee warnings for a block and finally the two blocks imposed against me by the same administrator.</p>
<p>The final warning for my first block was because for this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nakhichevan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57135157" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nakhichevan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57135157" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, and then I was first blocked for 24 hours because of my answer of that warning by this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57288107" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57288107" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.</p>
<p>For the second block (a block for 3 days), I recieved the warning after another user, Grandmaster, with who I was having a heated debate reported me because he was called POV pusher, so InShaneee warned me for a block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59669694" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59669694" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> which infuriated me and promped my answer. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59674618" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59674618" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, as a result, InShaneee blocked me for 3 days. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59675093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59675093" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Another administrator has found the rational behind the block shaky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=59812866&amp;oldid=59753118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=59812866&amp;oldid=59753118" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> (I was not blocked for 36 hours but 3 days). InShaneee answered that the rational was that I made threats of more. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda&amp;diff=59858960&amp;oldid=59844819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda&amp;diff=59858960&amp;oldid=59844819" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Which is not true as I have clarified in my update note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=60506758&amp;oldid=60394774" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=60506758&amp;oldid=60394774" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, a note which was later deleted by InShaneee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61033275&amp;oldid=60506758" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61033275&amp;oldid=60506758" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> under the pretext that IRC materials should only be posted after an explicit permission by those involved even though he deleted just more than the quotes from the IRC. He also removed his name from my Farewell message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61033439&amp;oldid=61033275" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61033439&amp;oldid=61033275" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, as well as warning again with a language which would have probably prompted a warning by himself had anyone used similar tone. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61034510&amp;oldid=61033439" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFadix&amp;diff=61034510&amp;oldid=61033439" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.</p>
<p>Also, just a quick search in both Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhichevan article (the articles in which I and Grandmaster interacted most) reveals that Grandmaster who reported me because of accusation of POV pushing, has in various occasion leveled similar accusations of POV pushing himself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=58008086&amp;oldid=58005648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=58008086&amp;oldid=58005648" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51095121&amp;oldid=51088926" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51095121&amp;oldid=51088926" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51184844&amp;oldid=51122584" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51184844&amp;oldid=51122584" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51248050&amp;oldid=51232048" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=51248050&amp;oldid=51232048" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=39849084&amp;oldid=39847669" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANakhichevan&amp;diff=39849084&amp;oldid=39847669" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40120215&amp;oldid=40118182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40120215&amp;oldid=40118182" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40277885&amp;oldid=40264430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40277885&amp;oldid=40264430" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40393226&amp;oldid=40392909" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40393226&amp;oldid=40392909" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40120215&amp;oldid=40118182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=40120215&amp;oldid=40118182" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, which I have never reported, since it is understandble that in some heated discussions few abrasive words are used and that any users are free to edit them rather than reporting even though as much to be blamed because the other happens to be someone with who you disagree. And also in an answer to InShaneee first blocking I reported similar edits made by Grandmaster. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57450366" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fadix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57450366" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> which InShaneee ignored.</p>
<p>Also, while InShaneee has edited a content of my userpage under the pretext that to post such materials it takes consent, I wonder under which Wikipedia policies this goes. Because I have specifically maintained who made what statment, while InShaneee may have ground for his consent request, so does, I in my opinion, have the right clarifying what InShaneee had been saying about me in my back, which is simply untrue. Every members should be permitted to defend themselves against what they percieve as false charges, more importantly charges leveled on media's not directly available to the concerned, and if InShaneee had found my clarification not proper to be posted on a members talk page, InShaneee was a concerned party and should have in my opinion reported such behavior to another Administrator rather than deleting the entire sentence. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:05, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have the right to report an incident, and there are no policies retricting me on the basis that it is an incident dating about a Week ago, you should stick to policies. As for the mailing list, as far as I am aware of, no administrator agreed to the block, the only who even pied attention to the cases disagreed with you. Also, going around the IRC and making up reasons for the Block isen't also the proper conduct of an Administrator. Neither deleting ones talk page content, where the member is answering to false charges. And no, what you removed was not only chat log, to the contrary, most were not. You mostly deleted things which I myself wrote answering to the charges which you leveled against me justifying the block, charges which both of us knew to be untrue. Also, the thing you call personal attack is an opinion posted in my talk page, it is neither a heatlist, neither anything of that sort. I severly question your ability to administer, and say it again, and this was about what I have said there. It is not like I am posting that in an articles namespace, neither in a talk page, but rather an answer. On the other hand, you have restricted me to edit for 72 hours, something which you should apologise for. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:20, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, warning someone not to call someone else a Neo-Nazi is more than justified, and I most certainly will continue warning, or blocking if neccisary, people who do so. You've been here repeatedly, the mailing list, your talk page, other people's talk page, and yet there is no wave of admins telling me that what I have been doing is wrong. If people don't like getting warned for being incivil, the answer is pretty simple: don't do it.

<p>The original block looks like it was warranted to me; from what I can see, InShaneee never edited your user page so I'm not clear what you're talking about (unless you're referring to your talk page); and the most recent "abuse" you've reported appears to be InShaneee telling you not to violate <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a> because it's rude, which seems sensible to me.

<dd>I hope you haven't looked at the cases the same way as you have looked at what I was talking about (neo-nazi). InShaneee 'warning' about neo-nazi was to Eupator and not to me. As for your opinion concerning the original block, it is much clear that blocks on personal attacks are justified in clear cases of personal attack, not just some accusation of POV edits or telling someone that he was not reading what you were writting. InShanee clearly doesn't make the distinction between empty slanders and some abrasive words in a heated discussion.Also, you haven't said anything about the second block. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Fadix that the blocks that was imposed on him by InShaneee might have been a bit harsh, eventhough he should indeed mind what he is saying, even when things get "hot" in discussions regarding controversial topics. It's <i>very</i> important always to be as polite as possible. I also agree that it's not nice that inaccurate reasons for blocking Fadix was mentioned on IRC, and I understand that Fadix is pretty upset about this. However, nothing good or constructive will come out of pursuing these issue anymore. As mentioned the block ended more than a week ago, and the best thing I believe would be for Fadix if he would just forget about the whole thing, and get back working on the articles where I and many other editors know that he makes a lot of much needed, very important and valuable contributions. Another thing is that I also believe it would help the situation if InShaneee would let other admins deal with any future issues involving Fadix. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 20:58, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The block has been lifted. However, such actions really need to be addressed.

<p>I lifted this earlier and informed InShaneee of the lift. I guess he'll tidy up and block the specific IPs that he wanted to block again. Rob Church has said that this shouldn't be technically possible, and I believe is looking into preventing Mediawiki from allowing such blocks in future. Moral of the story, I guess, is that you need to understand the implications of blocks before doing them, especially when involving ranges. <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsteffect_957d.html" title="User:Esteffect">Esteffect</a> 02:21, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, except that that has its own headache (and I say this as an "AOL user," even though I'm not on AOL).

<p>I am requesting the assistance of some other admin to help resolve a dispute with <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunholm_0a53.html" title="User:Sunholm">Sunholm</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunholm_4507.html" title="User talk:Sunholm">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sunholm_9cab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sunholm">contribs</a>). Recently, the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Image%7EStop_hand.svg_c10c.html" title="Image:Stop hand.svg">stop hand image</a> on {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} and related templates was changed to an <a href="../../../u/n/b/Image%7EUnbalanced_scales.png_53a2.html" title="Image:Unbalanced scales.png">unbalanced scales image</a>. On the <a href="../../../p/o/v/Template_talk%7EPOV_4249.html" title="Template talk:POV">talk page</a>, 11 users and one anon have expressed support for this change. Prior to this afternoon, 2 users had expressed opposition. Despite this Sunholm had reverted to the stop hand 3 times over 2 days. I told Sunholm that concensus existed at the talk page for changing the image and told him to quit edit warring. At which point he added a message to the talk page saying "Stop hand.svg is far better. It's a warning template, after all" and reverted again.</p>
<p>At this point, I blocked him for 3 hours for edit warring and POINT. (Keep in mind that the back and forth over the image was occuring across multiple POV oriented templates). Following the block expiry he immediately reverted again, with no further comment (this time also breaching 3RR).</p>
<p>This editor, previously known as Sunfazer (<a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunfazer_4745.html" title="User talk:Sunfazer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sunfazer_0553.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sunfazer">contribs</a>), seems to have a history of fighting over templates (see contribs in Template space). In addition, he is presently engaged in edit wars over {{<a href="../../../p/e/e/Template%7EPeerreview_4cf7.html" title="Template:Peerreview">peerreview</a>}} and {{Wikipedia is Communism}} that are unrelated to the stop hand issue.</p>
<p>However, I feel my neutrality is compromised by having expressed opinions favoring the scales image. Arguably, I should not have even issued the block that I did, though I feel Sunholm's behavior is out-of-bounds and is exacerbated by his unresponsiveness. I apologize for not seeking a neutral party sooner, and would appreciate it if someone else would take a look at this issue. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,I hope I am doing this correctly. I need help with a problem Jesster79 began building an episode list for In the Heat of the Night recently.I thought it was great until I recognized the material as being from tv.com (formerly TVTome). If it was a little I wouldn't complain, but it's a lot. This is the evidence, it is quite lengthy.Please pardon the sloppiness as I was pressed for time while doing it.</p>
<p>Our conversation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesster79" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesster79" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesster79</a></p>
<p>Note that while he says he is using his own words he has really just changed,re-arranged or added words to the material at tv.com(formerly tvtome)which has existed since 2000-1</p>
<p>This is a cut and paste comparing Jesster79's work (summaries and trivia) with that of tv.com.</p>
<p>This can be verified through the links for the episode list at both sites.</p>
<p>TV.COM Episode List - <a href="http://www.tv.com/in-the-heat-of-the-night/show/656/episode_listings.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tv.com/in-the-heat-of-the-night/show/656/episode_listings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/in-the-heat-of-the-night/show/656/episode_listings.html</a></p>

<p>Also please see Jesster's Contributions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jesster79" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jesster79" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jesster79</a></p>
<p>This really tells the story.Look how quickly the work was done.He just cut, pasted and slightly altered.</p>
<p>Note:At tv.com the notes and trivia appear below the summary.<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalifornia12_464a.html" title="User:California12">California12</a> 03:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't see anything wrong with <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_episodes_21ee.html" title="In the Heat of the Night episodes">In the Heat of the Night episodes</a> - theres not really a lot that can differ in a list of episodes, but the date formats in that article are different to the ones on tv.com. As for the episode articles theirselves, they don't look copied to me (although some might be based on the tv.com descriptions - it should probably be cited as a reference) but I'm no experienced copyvio spotter. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#336699">--<b>james</b></font></a> <sub><font color="green">// bornhj</font> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sub> 05:22, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote the synopsis at tv.com and in some cases he has barely changed anything.The date format is not what I'm talking about.Synopsis on episode guides are usually vary greatly.The story is the same but the wording is different.Please look at the comparison here titled Evidence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:California12" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:California12" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:California12</a><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalifornia12_464a.html" title="User:California12">California12</a> 05:34, 2 July 2006</p>

<dd>Uh, I don't have time to reply soon but I will leave a quick message since I'm on a trip. The edits on Gregory Goyle are not disruptive. There taken from what J.K Rowling says in the 6th Harry Potter book. I know GrasslandT- he and me both think were making correct edits here and I don't know the last time I made an attack on Daniel. I am going to tell him about Gregory Goyle edits. Have any of you read the book? Check one of the last chapters and see what I keep reverting? And how does GrasslandT edit in a disruptive way? All he does is edit Gregory Goyle in the correct way. I've had enough of this. This is a very stupid conversation to be having. My edits are correct, proof is in the book. And I haven't bothered Daniel since I talked with Bunchofgrapes. I've talked with Daniel about this and I'm going to talk with him more. Hopefully some one's read the Half-Blood Prince so they can see that I'm the right one and that this is a stupid conversation to be having. I'm going to leave a note on Daniel's page and Bunchofgrapes page.

<pre>
I feel like I was mistreated and humiliated by administrator ([User:InShaneee|InShaneee]])
</pre>
<p>He warned me not to use aggressive and uncivil language but he himself did it before blocking me. Such as:</p>
<p>`&#160;:::I will warn you one last time to keep your tone civil and not to make accusations. Also, you are not 'allowed' anything. If I see evidence that you are doing ANY blind reverts to circumvent consensus, no matter what the number, you will be blocked for purposeful disruption. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC) `</p>
<p>Please refer to my talk page to see it.</p>
<p>This message was posted after I , as a proud wikipedian as any of you , stated that according to Wiki Rules I can revert an article 3 times a day. And then he quoted&#160;: Also, you are not "allowed" anything.</p>
<p>Then for a discussion in the talk page I was blocked. It can be read from the link&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61433725" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61433725" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>
<p>I accept that my language is harsh and heated. However, if any of you regard to the discussed page, you can clearly reach more uncivil language ( even and especially in the Archives regarding user Fadix. ) so I feel that I was mistreated in this case.</p>
<p>Also, I did not clearly attack anyone, while I was blocked for personal attacks, what I did was to defend my point in a case which another user clearly (to my opinion) missed a point. If all of my posts are read, you will see that I am more or less a legal user. I may have crossed the line for a couple of times but this does not require a block or humiliation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I admit that I am a new user, but if you refer again to my talk page, you can see the post by the same admin&#160;:</p>
<p>"please do not add commentary and your personal analysis of an article into Wikipedia articles. Doing so violates Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy and breaches the formal tone expected in an encyclopedia. If you would like to experiment, use the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">sandbox</a>. Thank you. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 17:39, 30 June 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>This is the first warning I get. I know how to edit articles. I know how to use Wiki at that level. But he tries to humiliate me by referring to "sandbox". Also it is interesting to note that eventhough this was supposed to be my first warning, it is ferocious. It is angry, and the warning is not a friendly one.</p>
<p>Also , I thought before being blocked by this admin. I was allowed to be bold in editing, I learned that as a major principle of wikipeida. But now I see that principles work under the tyranny of some admins. Please do not ban me for this too. I am afraid now, I feel suppressed.</p>
<p>I checked the talk page of this admin to see that he is very infamous for his repeated blocking of others too.</p>
<p>If becoming an admin justifies this kind of power in Wikipedia, I do not consider Wiki as a communal organization, which favors its citizens rights.</p>
<p>I hope you wont tell me that I am not allowed anything too, like a prisoner guard.</p>
<p>You guys are not that kind of people right&#160;?</p>
<p>sincerely</p>
<p>ps&#160;: In case it gets archived I would like to post the te last two messages this admin has got&#160;:</p>
<p>Cculber007</p>
<p>Hi InShaneee!</p>
<p>I spoke with Cculber007 via email and he pledged not to make any threats or personal attacks on the wiki anymore if he is unblocked. I was thus thinking it would be a good idea to give him a second chance; he may very well one day become a valuable contributor. What do you think? -- Where 22:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC) [edit]</p>
<p>84.190.0.0/17</p>
<p>Hey. You blocked this last night. Now I nominated you for adminship so I know you're a good user, but please read up on blocking-related stuff. Your block was in good faith, but you actually blocked half of Germany.&#160;;) I've undone it, so you may want to look at the IPs you wanted to block with it.&#160;:p Esteffect 00:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That said, I think you inadvertently discovered a Mediawiki vulnerability. Some developers are saying your block shouldn't have even been possible due to the effects it can have. Esteffect 00:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think personally that the guy is a sock, but for the sake of assuming good faith, I will pretend he is not. And here, my opinion has nothing to do with me having something against InShaneee. Supposing that Sokrateskerem is a new user, he should have known for how long he was blocked(InShaneee should have told him), new users generally don't know how to check their block log to know for how long they have been blocked, InShaneee told him he was blocked, but not much more information as to when he could edit back again(unless I have missed something). We don't need 'administration' in the Armenian genocide page, for warning members for personal attacks, this in my opinion is unimportant, any users can edit a personal attack. Francis and other users were doing a great job editing them in the past. I will not go as far as to say that InShaneee decision to moderate the genocide page was to limit the damages after he realised what would happen if I am not there. For what we need administrator there, is to track possible socks (and they abound) and requesting checkusers, we need administrator to delete irrelevencies which have nothing to do with the article. We need administration to remind people what is NPOV. Those things directly affect the quality of the article. I don't think anyone was really offended by Sokrateskerem, of course before he posted the remark about InShaneee IQ, but this could have been prevented, by just removing personal attacks from the articles talk page. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree with you. However, I wasn't initially warning him as an administrator, obviously, since as you stated, this is not an action strictly relegated to administrators. Since I'd seen a lot of troublesome editing coming from there in the past, I simply wanted to step in and see if I could help stem the tide. It was only when he continued past being warned that I took action as an admin. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 18:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Either the watchlist function is malfunctioning or someone has been hacking into my account. There are a number of entries on my list which I did not put there. Most of them are gibberish: 111111111112222222222222, 545hj6jh5u67hu54h, 56666666666666jjjjjjjjjjjjjj, Gggggggggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnn55555555555, Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Jhjfgh, Jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjfuuuuurncvjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkks, Kikytmr, Yhjrnr584nbth5845jkfj48, and Yyyyyyyyyyyyy555555555. Another, Uuuuuuuuusssssssssssssseeeeeeeeerrrrrr, shows demonstrable intelligence. More suspicious is the fact that User:Beebeep and User:Unforgiving, who do not even exist, have shown up on my list, as well as User:Thames, who was created only today (July 2, 2006). If I appear to flip out or vandalize a bunch of articles, someone has simply taken over my account. Otherwise, they have only been able to access my watchlist functioning. I do not know who to ask about assistance in this matter. If you do, please inform me.

<dd>User pages are like any other page, and can be moved to and added to your watchlist the same way.

<dd>Also, why aren't there records of any of these moves, if that's what they were?

<p>User talk:Beebeep is a deleted redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">User talk:Bishonen</a> (a leftover from some pagemove vandalism), hence why that weird userpage name is in your watchlist.

<dd>Is it possible for you to see what move was relevant to User:Thames? It seems that he used to be a contributor, as his signature exists on a number of pages, but his contributions and logs are gone, as if merged to another user. The fact that this user was (re)created a matter of a couple hours ago is what mainly set my alarm bells off. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 16:24, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may have chatted with Thames many many months ago, hence it is on your watchlist. None of us remember everyone we have ever interacted with. If a user wants their page deleted, we shouldn't go about revealing all the details about who they are and so forth unless they want us to do so. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 17:43, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TJive, not to worry. Most of those entries are there due to your having my page and talk page on your watchlist. When vandals move them to new article titles they get added to your watchlist. I think you'll find most of the mystery entries in the edit histories, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Will_Beback&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Will_Beback&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Will_Beback&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Will_Beback&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>.
