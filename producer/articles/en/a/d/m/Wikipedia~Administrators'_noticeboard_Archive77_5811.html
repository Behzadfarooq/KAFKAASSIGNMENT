<p>I'm not sure where to go for this one. The RfC that was announced on Category:Cities in the UTC timezone was not properly formated so I removed it. Furthermore, there were issues in the past regarding the user of the {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_city_acf9.html" title="Template:Infobox city">template:infobox city</a>}} to auto-generate the categories. Personnally I find them very usefull as I sort through all the cities to see which one are cities and not and which ones need to be improved, changed or removed. I think some outside comments would be good but I didn't know where to go for that either because there is not real other place.

<p>Now, please ignore the premise of the text for purposes of <i>this</i> discussion; I just added this because I wanted to make a jocular "cleanup box" one day, express the confusion inherent in the system, and hopefully, in a subtle way, say that even when we have tons of policies and guidelines, one probably doesn't need to worry about them <i>too</i> much. If you feel this wording is too strong either way, please contact me separately.</p>
<p>However, in the light of this new situation with the concerns over admin conduct and misrepresenting oneself, I'm asking if I stepped out of the line with this box. After all, it says <i>"we wolves"</i>, referring to me. Apart of this comment, my user page does not (I think) contain any bits of information that could suggest that I am anything other than an ordinary human being, and to my knowledge, I have not publicly <i>denied</i> of <i>actually, really, truly</i> being an ordinary human being despite of occasional claims to contrary; Apart of this box it does not claim that I am in fact a cute, confused wolf, with a question mark hanging above its head. My Finnish Wikipedia user page <i>does</i>, however, say I'm "...this wolf-man (in Internet at least, but not in Real Life)...", a disclaimer that has (I think) persisted through the time I've been an user there.</p>
<p>Anyway, this box could <i>potentially</i> - and I say this merely as a theoretical conjecture, but knowing how real world works, it is an entirely plausible scenario - be viewed as a claim of me being something I clearly am not.</p>
<p>So do I need to include a disclaimer to my user page in this wiki too? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:29, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I’m an administrator of a computer lab in Dubai, UAE that monitored the escalation of a case involving a user called Husnock. The case drew in a lot of American/military personnel because someone unfortunately bookmarked it and then posted the mark to several newsgroups. We have removed all links to this case in an effort to keep it from flaring up again and I kindly ask that Wikipedia users do the same. It came to my attention that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Durin&amp;diff=112634845&amp;oldid=112634674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Durin&amp;diff=112634845&amp;oldid=112634674" rel="nofollow">this message</a> was posted to your pages, calling Husnock a name and saying he was dangerous to this site and deserves no respect. From what I can gather, Husnock has been off this site for months and hasn’t disrupted it in any way. He was also a military officer deployed to a combat zone and under a lot of stress and should be given at least some leeway (not that I'm defending anything he did or did not do). Clearly, calling him names and posting negative things about him, months after the fact, helps no one. I’m sure you’ll agree. Please let sleeping dogs lie, since comments like the one above can serve no useful purpose. Thank you. -38.119.112.187 05:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some very good feedback, thank you for the good information. Removing the “diff” is not a major issue, rather the concern was for all parties involved to simple avoid repeatedly referring to that user and his case. One of the most frustrating things about all of this is that anyone posting any kind of support of Husnock is usually immediately said to be an alternate account of him. This in turn naturally upsets whoever is really making the post, who then makes further posts, and so on. Indeed, of my own post, two people stated it was really Husnock and then an ip trace was conducted against our facility (I will post a further note further down). I would establish an account, as some have suggested, but then that account too would be accused of being Husnock and probably blocked from this site. What direction do we go then? Probably to just avoid bringing any of this up and avoid antagonizing people on both sides of the conflict. I still ask that the original user who posted that Husnock is a “troll” either retract the statement or it be removed from the edit history, for no other purpose than to keep things from flaring up again and maintaining peace on both sides. Thanks again. -38.119.112.187 04:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

In this particular case information is also changing too rapidly to make a rush decision (e.g. NYT article<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?ex=1330750800&amp;en=3bfde7644e8fbc5c&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?ex=1330750800&amp;en=3bfde7644e8fbc5c&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-03-05 12:27Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd>If someone closes a discussion early, they have to resist the temptation to reply to every single post criticising it (as do those who agree that it was a good decision). Obviously valid concerns should be addressed, but only once, and preferably on one forum. Then, once those who want to voice their opinion for the sake of voicing it have done so and those who've turned up looking for a fight have realised there isn't going to be one, it will peter out and net time-wastage will have been successfully minimised, and the only people who wasted their time will be the ones who were determined on doing so. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:34, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's nothing to do with the balance of opinion (which I agree wouldn't have changed, much if at all) - it's to do with the appearance of propriety. It would not have killed anyone to keep it open for the full five days, and closing it early only helps perpetuate all the accusations of high-handedness and elitism amongst admins. It needs to be done exactly to standard procedure, no special case rules applied. It doesn't matter what the end result will be, as the end result is pretty clear. It's the means we reach that end that matter. Normally, I am dead set against process wonkery, but we need to recognise that this must go by the book. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 13:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course it would not have killed us toi keep it open, on the other hand it does not kill us to close it. What is there is a lengthy debate with extensive input. It's run for several days. There is no appearance of impropriety, it is clear that the Wikipeida community spent time debating it and the evidence, and several options were considered. It's equally clear that nobody's mind is changing now, most, if not all, interested parties have said their piece, and we need to get on with something a bit more productive. I would not have closed it, but neither do I see any pressing need to re-open it. It's certainly not "diabolical". It qualifies for an official "so what" as far as I'm concerned. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Okay, I'm joking, as "diabolical" was too strong a word, but I was miffed as I'd even made a big bold note saying "please do not close this early", a request echoed by many other users, and El_C promptly ignored it because "he knew better". <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 14:29, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) Last weekend as soon as I heard about the AFD I rushed over to it to express my neutrality about the article and my strong desire to see the discussion run its full course. Why? I anticipated that the story would grow (as the <i>New York Times</i> article demonstrates) and I anticipated that some sysop would invoke IAR to close the discussion. Bad move: people want to discuss this issue. It looks like hushing things up to act too soon. And of course the tussle will continue on deletion review. I want this to be over as much as anybody, but early discussion closure isn't the way to achieve that end.

To prove what I’m saying is true, I have used a local server to post this address and will post from the computer lab servers one minute after. I trust that will clear it up. Please remove the ip address information since it serves no purpose on Wikipedia and could potentially be used against us by computer hackers, vandals, etc. Thank you, -<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.229.242.84.html" title="User:195.229.242.84">195.229.242.84</a> 04:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place. Admin KhoiKhoi continues to revert an article to its incorrect version despite the consensus on the talk page being in opposition to his edits. If you look at the talk page for the reggaeton article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reggaeton" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reggaeton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reggaeton</a> You will see that there are 3-1 contributors in favor of keeping the first word of the article and its spelling consistent with the actual title of the article, with an accented version of the word as an alternate. Despite pointing this out to KhoiKhoi through messages and through the talk page as well as the edit history for the reggaeton page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton</a> He continues to revert the page back to the incorrect version and the one noncompliant with the talk page consensus, and he gives no explanation whatsoever for his actions. Now he's saying that I'm going to be blocked, because I reverted him, even though I point out repeatedly that I'm editing as per the consensus on the talk page. I need an Admin to take 1 minute to look at the reggaeton article and its talk page to see that he's simply vandalising the page and not explaining his edits. 68.155.70.91 02:26, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since KhoiKhoi is not using his admin tools, it's not truly admin abuse, just a content dispute.

KhoiKhoi has already warned him about the 3-revert rule. I see no evidence that this anon has attempted to contact KhoiKhoi directly. Normal practice suggests that a longer conversation should take place at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Talk%7EReggaeton_8d2c.html" title="Talk:Reggaeton">Talk:Reggaeton</a>, in which both KhoiKhoi and 68.155.70.91 should participate. Although it seems un-wiki, something like a 'vote' might be suggested, since even the alternatives in the debate are quite unclear.

<dd>I've attempted multiple times to contact KhoiKhoi on his talk page in the past with no personal attacks of any nature, and rather than respond with discussion, he immediately deleted my questions/comments and then blocked my IP address (despite me not breaking any rules), forcing me to use another computer. My comments about disregarding the 3RR on my page were the result of knowing that he has blocked users (including myself) in the past for making edits that he didn't agree with. He seems to be engaged in other edit wars on wikipedia right now that he isn't willing to offer discussion on, either. If I make a comment on his talk page five minutes from now, he's just going to delete it and block me as he has in the past.

<p>If there's really a consensus and he "keeps reverting", then surely he's in violation of 3RR himself? But anyway, an edit war not involving tools (i.e. he hasn't protected his version) is not generally (as far as I know) grounds for desysoping. If he violates 3RR, he should be blocked, and if he unblocks himself _that_ is the point at which it becomes admin abuse. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">Random832</a> 13:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TedFrank stated here a couple of weeks ago that he would be taking a few days off Wikipedia after the prior situation referred to. I haven't seen a case for a block at this time (if there is one, some diffs/links would be good), but if/when he returns, I will try to keep an eye on things including watching out for any POV editing, as he edits mostly in areas I know something about. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

This falsely implies academic dishonesty, and would arguably violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> if it were included in a biographical article. (Indeed, I see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CN#Indefinite_block_of_User:BabyDweezil" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CN#Indefinite_block_of_User:BabyDweezil" rel="nofollow">note on the community noticeboard</a> citing precisely this accusation made against someone else as evidence of lack of civility.) Nor am I paid to "promote things," as another administrator accused me in an email. I hold an academic position at a nonpartisan nonprofit thinktank, and am forbidden by law from lobbying or taking partisan positions on behalf of the thinktank. (And as for pay, I make far less money than I would make if I were willing to sacrifice my academic independence for paying clients; whatever motivation I have for my current job, it's not a paycheck a third of my AGI the last full calendar year I was in private practice.) I do not edit Wikipedia on behalf of my employer, or even on behalf of myself, given that I have made edits adding cites to articles or academics I disagree with, such as Charles Silver or Sam Issacharoff. I'm not making edits any differently than I would make them if I took a position at a law school instead of one that didn't require me to grade papers; in either case, I would seek WP:NPOV compliance. I just want to see NPOV adhered to in the civil-justice-related articles, and again, would appreciate guidance on how that can best be achieved, given that there was a systematic POV-pushing campaign of thousands of edits in the past year that has slanted numerous articles in the area.</dd>

I didn't ask to be attacked by her on multiple pages or off of Wikipedia, and hope that her harassment doesn't achieve the hecklers' veto she sought. I would hope that Wikipedia views an editor with aspirations to NPOV who is trying to act in good faith to comply with Wikipedia policies differently than an editor who hid her affiliations and edit-warred with and otherwise harassed anyone who contradicted her preferred view of the world; it would seem to be counterproductive to the Wikipedia mission if the latter can have more influence on Wikipedia pages than the former.</dd>

The fact that he has written widely on Lyndon Larouche for an organization that opposes Larouche has not prevented him from providing NPOV edits to Larouche-related articles or other articles within his expertise, nor should it, even as he has been hounded and harassed by Wikipedia editors who disagree with him (and with at least one indefinitely banned precisely for, inter alia, accusing him of being a "paid propagandist"). I don't have the time to devote to Wikipedia that Chip has devoted; but I hope that Wikipedia administrators will act fairly, apply its COI policy evenly, and work with someone who is trying to comply with NPOV and COI in good faith and improve Wikipedia articles. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 23:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just over at the German Wikipedia, looking at <i>Letzte änderungen</i> (Recent Changes). I hid edits from users with accounts, leaving only anonymous edits visible. The last <i>fifty</i> anonymous edits on the German Wikipedia took place over a period of <i>one hour and sixteen minutes.</i> By comparison, the same number of anonymous edits on the English Wikipedia took place in about 90 seconds. It would appear that the English Wikipedia is the only place where RC patrol is a viable career... This isn't really a message for admins, but I was floored by this difference in activity. It's not like it's a ridiculous time in Germany, at the moment, it's a quarter past eight in the morning on a Tuesday. I know that's hardly an active wiki-time, but for the German Wikipedia, which is one third our size, to be forty times less active (at least in this one measure) seems very strange to me.

<dd>An other possible explanation: English Wikipedia is more active. the ratio above seems to show that we have approx. 2 1/4 times as many anon edits as they do.

<dd>It's roughly proportional to the number of articles, which was RyanGerbil10's original assumption. The number of edits (to about 14:20 CET) by registered editors is in about the same proportion, 14 minutes for 500 edits on de and 5 minutes here. I don't think there's anything mysterious about the number of edits being in some way related to the number of articles. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, some definite division on the issue right on through. It's understandable, as it isn't an entirely clear issue. Are questions in a RfA supposed to be limited to those factually based and supportable, or do they include addressing community questions and concerns (even those that do not have direct factual or verifiable support)? Does it matter if the question doesn't assert questionable information or is meant to dispel an untrue concern? And at what point is the distinction made between a genuine concern and someone just bringing up baseless mud? I am unsure that there exist easy to find cut-and-dry answers to those questions. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 15:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Copying a GFDL work, among other things, requires that you attach a copy of the licence (see <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">WP:GFDL</a> section 2), and considering the length of the licence that would be somewhat impractical for a newspaper. If you copy a GFDL work in <i>quantity</i>, you also have to provide a machine-readable version (maybe less impractical, as it can be hosted on their website, I think, but still annoying for the newspaper; see section 3 of the GFDL). GFDL isn't a very good licence to use if you want newspapers to be able to copy your work (this is one of the reasons why dual-licencing with CC-by-sa is encouraged for images on Commons). --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 10:05, 5 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<dd>The same pattern holds even if you compare admins as a fraction of active accounts (e.g. those with at least 5 edits per month). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is still very low activity. Users that make 5 edits a month do not contribute to any problems or backlogs that require administrative intervention, and that low activity still includes some vandal throwaway accounts.

<dd>Pattern is the same for &gt; 100 edits per month. As for when it becomes linear, maybe never. Over time, the number of users with at least X edits need not be linearly related to the number of admins for any number of reasons. The easiest being that adminship requirements could change significantly over time. Really trying to see if it does become linear for some X is a question not easily answered with existing statistics. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>guys, these statistics need a lot of work before they become meaninful. Admin load is related to the number of <i>disruptive</i> editors, not the number of editors. Experienced non-admin editors <i>reduce</i> admin workload, inactive accounts do not affect it. Thus, we might need to tally the number of admins wrt the number of account <i>creations</i>. Admins sit at the first derivative of WP as it were. It is interesting, still, how the number of accounts fits the number of edits, while the number of admins fits the number of articles. Now establish how well the number of admins fits the <i>increase</i> in the number of edits. Another thing I'd like to see would be the incidence of <i>anonymous</i> edits wrt admin population, and wrt to rollback edits. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 12:19, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These statistics are useful but it would also help to know something about administrative backlogs -- how often they occur, how long they last, and so on. If those statistics aren't available then maybe a reasonable proxy could be the average time from a report requiring admin action to its resolution. An example could be average time from a report to AIV until its clearance. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 13:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My original solution to the problem was to volunteer myself. Both PAIN and RFI were backlogged when I applied for adminship, so I promised to spend time there. The reaction was puzzlement: RFA voters appeared to be so used to sysopping people based on RC patrol and AFD participation that this sort of priority didn't appear on their radar screen. I got through anyway, but I had waited longer than most before asking for a mop. Fact is, I couldn't keep those boards running. Those pages had a few very dedicated people but just not enough to keep up with the inflow. So now I'm devoting more time to admin coaching and mentoring good editors who have an interest in complex investigations. My belief is that disputes and complex vandalism increase at roughly the same rate as the site grows so we really need to make a priority of mopifying sleuths. Early intervention with follow through can defuse situations that would otherwise fester until ArbCom has to handle them.</dd>

<dd>Not many admins specialize in this work and there's been a high burnout rate among the ones who do - anyone who's a regular at this board knows the history.

<p>If this notice is inappropriate for this board, feel free to remove it. I placed this here as it concerns an action that only admins would know how to do. I am an admin at the <a href="../../../../simple/m/a/i/Main_page.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Main_page">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, and I have a couple of selective restorations that I need to do. My question is this: is it possible to select all of the checkboxes except one or two with a single click, or do I have to click every box individually?

<p>A user, User:REdmondson, vandalised <a href="../../../h/e/s/Heswall.html" title="Heswall">Heswall</a> on a number of occasions this morning with the same kind of vandaklism: making a,personal attack on some named person. The user had also vandalised other articles, was reported as being a vandal-only account, and was indefinitely suspended. Now, a different user has suddenlty appeared: <a href="../../../b/3/n/User%7EB3nj1b01_cdff.html" title="User:B3nj1b01">User:B3nj1b01</a>, who only has one adit, to <a href="../../../h/e/s/Heswall.html" title="Heswall">Heswall</a> which vandalises it in an identical way to the now indefinitely banned User:REdmondson. Whilst this new user has only one edit to their name, it seems to me taht they have responded to the ban by creating a new user account so that they can continue the same kind of vandalism. It seems to me that they should be treated as if they were simply the same as User:REdmondson, and that they are attempting to evade the indefinite ban. Since the vandalism is of a potentially libellous nature towards some named individual, it seems that prompt action may be required here. What should be done about this? <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 15:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My reading of the situation is as follows: This is not really a banning situation yet. At issue is how to characterise Condoleeza Rice's popularity based on opinion polls (which raises obvious <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problems). Ohioan1 has been slowly editwarring about this, but consensus on the talk page appears to favour the opinion of Mgunn and others. Also, Ohioan1 is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>, editing that article only. I'd support a brief block of Ohioan1 to stop him editwarring and make him re-engage in discussion on the talk page.

<p>A few points of clarification. It is clear that short attacks are effective in creating confusion.</p>
<p>Mgunn asserts that I have edited nothing but edit the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleeza_Rice_ea1f.html" title="Condoleeza Rice">Condoleeza Rice</a> page. This is false, I have reviewed many others and edited one other.</p>
<p>Mgunn’s assertion that I have attempted to place information in the lead that does not belong there is not the whole story. I have attempted to move the poll details to a separate section and this has been blocked repeatedly; others have commented that the lead does not summarize what is in the article and the proposed move would rectify that. Mgunn has stated that he does not have a problem with the finding, but that it should not be in the lead. So, the lead continues to carry many detailed statements, footnotes and all, and Mgunn blocks addition of pertinent, new, information. So it is a Catch 22: the lead contains many detailed statements and Mgunn blocks an updated statement on the basis that it is detailed. The result is the lead statements are unbalanced and POV.</p>
<p>Mgunn asserts that “You are obviously not a new editor to Wikipedia” and that “This user is extremely familiar with Wikipedia rules.” These assertions are false, and also at odds with Mgunn’s assertion that I might be a random Middle School student. If I were extremely familiar with Wikipedia rules, I would have been able to find this ANI page earlier—Mgunn kindly referred to it but did not provide a link; I found the link only when I searched his talk page. Further, I would not have made some new-be judgement errors that I made in my earlier edits.</p>
<p>Mgunn criticizes my focus on the Rice page as evidence of wrongdoing. However, I understand that technical writers focus add value by studying a topic in depth and adding relevant content. If you research my history, you will see that I have added several well documented and accepted contributions to the page. I do not cruise a collection of political pages as some others have, with the principal edits being blocks.</p>
<p>Mgunn asserts that I have not used the talk pages. This is odd, because Mgunn has not responded to recent discussion I posted regarding the very statements to which Mgunn objects.</p>

<p>Is it acceptable to remove a section on another editor's userpage if it's a personal attack? Touching other people's userspace is sort of taboo...but then again, it's fine to remove personal attacks from talk pages.</p>
<p>If it's fine, can someone please go do something about the "Wikipedians who suck" section on <a href="../../../u/n/k/User%7EUnknown_Dragon_ef15.html" title="User:Unknown Dragon">User:Unknown Dragon</a>'s userpage? I don't really want to touch it myself, i'm really not all that keen to deal with this editor again, but i really would like his personal attack against me removed.</p>
<p>Also, is having song lyrics on userpages fine? I would have thought it's a copyright problem (like having copyrighted/fair use pictures on userpages). If it isn't, then the "Theme Song(s)" section on his userpage needs to go as well.</p>

<dd>The personal attack section is not good; I've removed it, and let the user know why. The song lyrics are fine, he is only using an excerpt, not the full lyrics, and there are many many Wikipedians do so (quotes, lyrics, poems, etc). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 10:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a fairly minor footnote to the Essjay saga, but I'd like the opinions of administrators on whether something would be an appropriate use of admin tools. Looking at <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_controversy.html" title="Essjay controversy">Essjay controversy</a> last night, I noticed that there was a gallery of four screenshots of the Google cache of the now-deleted User:Essjay/History1. (These images can be seen at <a href="../../../e/s/s/Image%7EEssjay_History1_-_1_of_4.jpg_ff6d.html" title="Image:Essjay History1 - 1 of 4.jpg">Image:Essjay History1 - 1 of 4.jpg</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Image%7EEssjay_History1_-_2_of_4.jpg_2efe.html" title="Image:Essjay History1 - 2 of 4.jpg">Image:Essjay History1 - 2 of 4.jpg</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Image%7EEssjay_History1_-_3_of_4.jpg_5100.html" title="Image:Essjay History1 - 3 of 4.jpg">Image:Essjay History1 - 3 of 4.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/s/Image%7EEssjay_History1_-_4_of_4.jpg_ba6f.html" title="Image:Essjay History1 - 4 of 4.jpg">Image:Essjay History1 - 4 of 4.jpg</a>.) I have a little application called <a href="http://www.braintickling.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.braintickling.com/" rel="nofollow">SnapWeb</a>, which can take a single image of a web page, so I used that to create a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser-Essjay-History1.png_a066.html" title="Image:User-Essjay-History1.png">single image</a> of the Google cache to replace the four split images. However, the Google cache is of a vandalized version of the page (it has a caption saying "Yes, I'm not a professor"). It occurred to me that I <i>could</i> make a screenshot of an unvandalized version of the page, using my admin ability to view deleted pages. But I was decidedly unsure of whether this would be appropriate or not.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, it's up to the editors at <a href="../../../e/s/s/Talk%7EEssjay_controversy_f020.html" title="Talk:Essjay controversy">Talk:Essjay controversy</a> to determine whether it's appropriate to have a screenshot or not, and there's a discussion going on there about that. The question I'd like to hear from my fellow admins address is whether it would be appropriate for me, as an admin, to create an image of a deleted Wikipedia user page for editors to use in an encyclopedia article? Was the issue of an image of a deleted page addressed in the Seigenthaler incident? (I see that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a> has no image of the page — is this due to a deliberate decision, or did it just not come up?) I don't want to provide an image if it would be a violation of my duties as an admin, but I do think that <i>if</i> the article is going to have a screenshot of the page, it might be better for that screenshot to reflect Essjay's actual page, as opposed to one that was vandalised. What do other folks think? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:31, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From one point of view, I would say that the images, coming from google and possibly altered, are unreliable. That articles should not be self-referential and that Wikipedia itself is an unreliable source. That Essjay's user page was made by transcluding a dozen or more subpages so they would all have to be undeleted to get an accurate image. And that if an external reliable source is found that says "Essjay's page used to claim that he was German shepherd" then you cite the source. There is no need to see the actual page. From another point of view, I am past caring. There has not been even a hint that Essjay used his false credentials to insert false information into articles, which is after all our core purpose here (and yet that is apparently what at least one British tabloid is claiming--reliable my ass). This is a 9-days' wonder at best, yet we will now have to live with <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_controversy.html" title="Essjay controversy">Essjay controversy</a> forever because a majority of editors cares more about following meta-policies than being humane. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I agree, this is merely semantics.

<dd>Starting to feel rather sick at the moment... so excuse me if I'm not giving a perfect example here (I know it isn't): but imagine you took a photo of a McD's building. The photo wouldn't automatically be owned by McD's, obviously. Likewise this has smilarities, which hopefully you can see the gist of. Though I really should have came up with a better example than that. Oh, might be more a "problem" (which if you think about it, is not there at all) with being a copy of google than related to GFDL. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 09:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that technically speaking the image wouldn't fulfil the GFDL (history isn't available), but if it were deemed sufficiently important for the article and there was a decent fair-use rationale it would be acceptable as fair use per the <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>.

<dd>(Undent) Honestly, taking a moment to divorce the question from the article's subject, I have no idea how a cached Google version of a Wikipedia page can possibly be said to even come close to the minimum standards of attribution and verification in order to warrant inclusion. Such a source so grossly fails to even approach the threshold for inclusion that I'm actually surprised that it even got beyond that to the questions of licensing, self-reference and appropriateness. A screenshot of a Google cache of a Wikipedia page is so flagrantly unreliable that it would make an excellent textbook example of <i>Things to Never Use in Any Wikipedia Article Ever</i>.</dd>

<dd>If you do <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">honestly believe</a> that the information benefits the article, I would suggest trying to find a reliable source or a summary that can be supported with citations. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 15:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have to disagree with the other users here. Images are not subject to nearly the same level of verification as article content. That's why for example, users can upload pictures they've taken of animals and locations and the only say so needed is that the uploader says that it is what they say it is. I'm not convinced these images add much to the article, but there isn't any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issue. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, you can't get around attribution by uploading an image of a paragraph. In fact, if you read the above, the picture would in fact include misattributable vandalism. While you could add a caption stating that the article of vandalism was not posted by the user in question, that caption itself would be unverifiable. I could, though I certainly <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">won't</a>, edit another user's page such that "they" admit to killing Abraham Lincoln and time it such that I grab an image of a Google cache. Even if they were notable enough to have an article (say for vandalizing the hall of presidents), my posting of this image would be inherently problematic for the same reasons. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 16:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, thanks! Well the reason I'm here is an editor has asked me to look into a minor ongoing problem.

<dd>Would you mind taking a look over the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Opuscalgary_05ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Opuscalgary">edit history here</a> going back to March 1 and commenting? There's what appears to be a case of wikistalking going on; all of the talk pages being hit are ones that the other editor worked on some time in the past. There's accusations of sockpuppettry flying, odd images being posted about trolls, and continuing minor name calling (including mine).</dd>
<dd>In the past I have avoided all but the most obvious admin duites (rving vandalism, blocks on obvious vandal accounts, etc) and I can't say I really understand what admining, if any, to apply when the issue is not so black and white. This isn't a content dispute really (only peripherally, regardless of the claims otherwise), so I'm out of my depth. I have to say, it all seems pretty minor to me, but it might not to the other people involved.

I believe this is the case because Bzuk and I have worked on several articles in the past, so these are active in my watchlist along with the talk pages and some users in common. I saw a continuous dribble of posts onto these pages, and that's when I got the message from Bzuk asking for help. I looked over Opus' edit list and found many more examples, ones I would normally not see because I had not had dealings with those articles/users. But this is not actually my main concern (nor Bzuk's it seems), my primary concern is the constant stream of "abusive" messages -- but <i>are</i> they abusive? And if they are, abusive enough to do something? And if so, what? Like I said, I'm pretty new to this particular shade of grey, and I'm really just curious about whether or not this sort of behavior is considered bad, or just par for the wiki course? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 13:22, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's still pretty vague. You want a link to a specific edit diff, or series of diffs. Otherwise, just by directing someone to a whole contribution history, you will get people -- like me -- finding things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Opuscalgary&amp;diff=112968156&amp;oldid=112965236" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Opuscalgary&amp;diff=112968156&amp;oldid=112965236" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which implies that Opuscalgary and Bzuk had a fine relationship just 2 days ago. In general, for an admin to make actual blocks due to personal attacks, they need to be pretty blatant. (Unfortunately, that's not rare&#160;:-( ) Otherwise just general advice and encouragement to civility is usually better. Remind them they are all in this to write an encyclopedia, surely they can come to a peaceful compromise. It also seems the issue is an article about <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-105_Arrow_983c.html" title="CF-105 Arrow">a Canadian aircraft</a>? Not abortion rights, or the Arab-Israeli wars or something as heated as that? Then this shouldn't be impossible to find a compromise on.

<p>I guess I'm explaining my question poorly. The issue isn't about the article. Its about what happened after the article was RVed, namely a series of hundreds of posts to people all over the wiki. There's been over 50 posts to over a dozen pages since I posted about it here a day ago, and it shows no signs of slowing. Thus my question: is lots of posts to lots of people a problem in of itself?</p>
<p>I take your point about the specifics though, so I guess a little cut-n-paste is in order. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Maury_Markowitz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112360545" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Maury_Markowitz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112360545" rel="nofollow">It starts on my page</a> where he tells me to "get professional help" (like I said, its <i>mild</i>).

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to completely overhaul, enhance, rewritte an existing article. As a result, when my work is done, I would like to propose the newly written page as an "article of quality" or something like that.</p>
<p>What is the regular procedure to do that&#160;? I've already seen some templates on pages which are redefined and rewritten. My problem is that I would prefer an "agreement" from the previous authors of the page: I will not destroy their work, or I don't want to appear as doing so, but I would rather insert it into a much more general and profound setting.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<dd>If you plan on completely rewriting an article, a good way to start is to begin writing the article on your own userspace. So, for instance, you could start writing the article at User:TwoHorned/Rewrite and then you can build it up there and take your time without it interfering with the existing article. When you believe your rewrite is finished you can make other editors aware that you have rewritten the article and you could allow them to read it before you copy it over the existing article. As far as "article of quality" goes, we have two things I believe you are referring to. There is <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured Article</a> with the latter being the more stringent one. Featured articles are profiled on the main page. I hope this helps. If you have any future questions, rather than posting them here, try the <a href="../../../h/d/_/WP%7EHD_6530.html" title="WP:HD">help desk</a>.↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 14:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This user placed the pregnancy tag on thier page awhile back. Then about two months ago, another user removed this tag based on their speculation that this user wasn't pregnant any more. I reverted that edit this saying we should let the user edit their own page. Now the page has been reverted again and protected. I tried to ask the person who blanked the history why they did that and they said it was a privacy matter. What gives?

<dd>That user was getting some very rude messages, as well as congratulations. I agree with the protection of the page.

<dd>This really isn't a matter suitable for public discussion. It pertains to the possibly very personal affairs of an editor who has vanished, not to the content of an article or a project page. Everybody has a right to vanish; in this case Sharon's friends have partly exercised that right on her behalf by reverting her page, removing speculative and insulting edits, and protecting it. If anybody can present any reason as to why this should <i>not</i> have been done, or any valid reason why they need to leave a message for a long-departed user, let's hear it. Otherwise, let's give the girl a break and hope she's back one day - and not bombarded by a huge backlog of messages, speculation, insults and other crap when she returns. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC) (edit conflict)

The best way to do so is to support those that have the buttons already, and try to make life as easy as possible on them. I'm sure the clerks for the various processes don't mind new helpers.

Under the circumstances, I felt that its deletion just now — and especially the fact that, to a casual user visiting the site, it seems to have "vanished without a trace of ever existing" — may create an impression, however inaccurate, of a "cover-up" in the minds of at least some people stumbling upon links to it.</p>

I'd appreciate feedback on whether this was the appropriate thing to do, and will attempt to contact Essjay himself to ask whether he actually intended his request to apply to that specific page and what <i>he</i> would like us to do with it.</p>
<p>This is a complicated issue, and I certainly have no wish to hurt Essjay any more than he has been hurt already, nor to override his personal wishes willy-nilly for no good reason. Even so, I just don't think simple deletion is the right decision here. In particular, if the page <i>is</i> deleted, and perhaps even if it isn't, I believe placing some sort of notice there with a link to Essjay's request would be appropriate, and would alleviate any potential concerns that we are trying to make the page "disappear". —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 16:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The right to vanish applies to user space. If Essjay had put this letter into project space, on a noticeboard or an article talk page, it would be here forever. But it's in his space, let it go.

<p>The Fisheaters site owner is bitching <i>again</i> about her site being blacklisted (she really <i>really</i> wants those inbound links - and has demanded them often enough that I'm almost inclined to consider that justification enough for blacklisting on its own). Apparently she finds it very stressful being blacklisted. She emailed Jimbo and told him so. Again. One might suggest not keep coming back and reopening the argument as a way of managing that stress, but there you go. Sordid details, as ever, at <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_Fisheaters_f6e8.html" title="User:JzG/Fisheaters">User:JzG/Fisheaters</a> and at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:Spam_blacklist">m:Talk:Spam blacklist</a> and several of its archives.</p>
<p>Her recurrent theme these days is the chabad.org website.

<p>This image is under constant vandal attack. They either blank the image description or add sexual comments or reverting the image to older versions and back again. Would it be possible to protect the image to at least Semi-block? (to get rid of vandalizing IP and newly created vandal-only accounts).

<dd>I've replaced the listing I had before with a version that lacks the comments I've added next to the names. I'm a pretty good humored guy and I don't have any actual mailce towards anyone here (or anyone that I meet on the internet) and I'm sorry if I've caused offense. Sometimes I forget that tone doesn't tranlate well on the internet. I was quite irritated when Moe came over and removed the listing (instead of just removing anything that he deemed to be a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> but I'll continue with assuming good faith and not jumping to the conclusion that he took such offense only because on my list I called him out on pretending to be in the military.</dd>

It looks very much like a static address, but as this is my first long block (and one of my first blocks anyway), I thought it would be better to get some feedback. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Over the last few days I've seen a bunch of users spamming talk pages of other users asking them to come sign autograph pages. Look at the contributions for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smartie960_ae00.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smartie960">Special:Contributions/Smartie960</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ANNAfoxlover_4036.html" title="Special:Contributions/ANNAfoxlover">Special:Contributions/ANNAfoxlover</a>. In addition, many users are starting to include "SIGN MY BOOK!" type links within their signature. It feels like this is starting to get out of hand. What's the opinion on such actions? The signature aspect doesn't bother me as much as the spamming of user talk pages does. A bunch of users are complaining about being spammed, especially when they don't know the user doing the spamming. Also see discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EANNAfoxlover_5212.html#Please_do_not_spam_others.27_talk_pages" title="User talk:ANNAfoxlover">ANNAfoxlover's talk page</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 23:27, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've warned both users. There's nothing wrong with maintaining signature book, but the spamming is absurd and getting completely out of hand. Also note that Smartie960 has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Smartie960&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Smartie960&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=0" rel="nofollow">only 3 edits in mainspace</a>.

<dd>I agree with the above.

<dd>I've come across many users with autograph books, and wondered at the purpose. I realize that obtaining someone's real signature might have some value, perhaps only as memorabilia, but digital signatures? No handwriting, just wikicode. I don't see the point, and I would just as soon that all the users canvassing for signatures stop doing so (a small link in their signature should be fine, like my "Review me!" link; same idea); spamming talk pages is kind of like spamming email. It's useless information. I'm surprised at the number of solicitations you've found, alphachimp.

<p><i>A user, <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EANNAfoxlover_150b.html" title="User:ANNAfoxlover">ANNAfoxlover</a>, has been mass-spamming users to get them to sign the user's own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ANNAfoxlover/Autographs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ANNAfoxlover/Autographs" rel="nofollow">autograph page</a>.

<dd>Moe: I would personally vote delete; they are very annoying. Many users complain that it is not harming Wikipedia; I feel that it does since it wastes users time by deleting the "spam" from their talk pages, it also encourages the "prettiness" of sigs. And all of these new user accounts are bothersome.

<dd>WP:LAME might deter some people from engaging in edit warring. But the biggest difference between pages like BJADON and DOF and DAFT is that you don't have to participate. When users are actively spamming links to their autograph books, including harassment of one user (AnnaFOX repeatedly asked HighinBC to aign her book after he refused), <i>then</i> it becomes a major problem, and one better gone. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 02:33, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, well, look at it this way. There are only <b>two</b> users that have ever spammed talk pages because of these books. The solution, in my opinion, is not to delete them, is to inform them, and everyone else, that use of autograph books should be very <b>limited</b>, so spamming does not occur. Just look at most of these users' contribs, mine for example. You will see that most of them not only involve themselves in activities other than signatures, but even make constructive edits to <i>mainspace</i>. For most users, the books are not the centre of their edits. If they centralize it too much, all they need is a warning against spamming and nonencyclopedic edits, and that they should help improving wikipedia more than their books. They should not be deleted,thisproblem iseasily solved. Simply make them promise they will stop spamming. This has been done for one user already. We need to remember that this is a community, and the books are just a minor part of the community. It's about saying hello, so if anyone is making way too many edits about the books, they should be simply told to stop, and to work on improving the wiki for a while. This way, we wouldn't have to delete everything, so we could encourage users to make constructive edits. How about making a rule on WP:USER so that these books are allowed as long as there is no spamming, and that the edits involving these booksare kept minimal compared to constructive edits.

<dd>I think a middle path is best for this issue: allow autograph subpages, provided the user actually contributes to the encyclopedia in some way (writing, vandal fighting, spellchecking, whatever) and refrains from spamming anyone. The desire for social networking and other forms of humanity seems really understandable, considering how easy it is to get lost among the thousands of active users. But spamming in anyway is unacceptable, and having an account solely for the purpose of having an autograph book falls under the category of using Wikipedia as a social networking site or free web host, IMO. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 02:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Just a comment on the nature of these autograph books. Looking over some of these, you find that many are somewhat incestous - the editors who sign these are those with autograph books, and they leave links to their own books.

<p>In response to above comment (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>): it's very true that Wikipedia is not a social networking site. But obviously some level of social networking is allowed, since we have userpages and we can post personal information/interests/etc on said pages. Some of the intention of userpages is to humanize us contributors, since without them we are all just faceless names. Personally, I would read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as "Wikipedia does not exist <i>primarily</i> as a social networking site, but social networking in the course of building the encyclopedia is fine."

<p>I feel that autograph books are fine, as long as people don't spam requests across the site. If they advertise the autograph subpage on their actual userpage, that's fine. But this is NOT a social networking site (except as a means to the end of creating an encyclopedia); user talkpages are meant primarily for the improvement of the encyclopedia and all issues as a means to that end. But autograph books themselves are perfectly fine and a great way to lighten up the atmosphere, as long as it does not get carried away. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 20:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's the handy "permanent link" in the toolbox. It'll lead you to the revision you prefer each time. Other than that, I agree with the childish vandalism and the articles it will obviously attract might merit a kind of permanent semi-protection on the formed articles subject to such crap. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">Vagina</a>, for example, are vandalized all day every day with little new information to put in the article that can't be hashed out for four days on the talk page or simply having to wait for autoconfirm. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 23:34, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's something by that changed my mind somewhat about stable versions:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>The greatest joy of Wikipedia for many people, and I think what draws many, many new users in, is that this is a dynamic, collaborative body of work in which your contributions are instantly visible. It gives somebody like me a chance to be a published author, in a very real way (since this is such a high traffic website and most people with computers use it as a reference at some time or another). To relegate anyone's contributions to the realm of "something that may be added to the article at some point, if your edits combined with everybody else's since the article attained 'stability' are deemed by who the hell knows who to be a 'significant improvement'" seems almost humorously counterproductive. --Tractorkingsfan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can still see a place for some sort of delayed publishing of 'untrusted' contributions, but I'm convinced that contributions should be considered innocent until proven suspicious.

<dl>
<dd>Certain article areas may be useful for it. I don't know how far along it all is, but I believe when this was first floated a while ago it was roughly outlined that it would only be a candidate to be used in a few article areas. Ones that immediately spring to mind are quite a few of the ones that are under permanent SP (G Bush etc). The vast majority of wikipedia articles are backwaters, out of the 1.6 million I would guess a few thousand get hit by vandals very regularly (10+ times per day) - the other 1.55 million can go months without any new content, and when that new content does come it has a decent chance of coming from an IP address or a new user. Creating stable/live versions of these pages is a bit counter-productive - all it is likely to do is create large backlogs of pages needing reviewed and updated by the "keyholder" editors who can edit the stable page. Frankly it might be an idea to reverse the process on these backwater pages - we have stable "1.0" pages held behind the live front page. A reader going to these pages would be presented with the live page just as now, but there would be a stable version in a tab available if they wished to double check against something that had a few more guarantees against it. The pressure to review any content submissions would be lower, because ultimately they are immediately viewable just as they are now - but we would have a more stable backup page in reserve. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 13:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, the heavily vandalised pages are often the popular ones. But I agree, applied on a case by case basis, like full and semi protection, it sounds good. I raised a similar proposal at the village pump many moons ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85443172#Stable_pages" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85443172#Stable_pages" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. One concern people raised was that we would be feeding Google different text to what we would be showing people, which might be considered cloaking, which is a bad thing to do. My investigations suggested this <i>probably</i> wouldn't be a problem, though I could say for sure that it wouldn't, and it's anyone's guess if Google would be prepared to adjust their algoritims for us if it turned out to be one.

<p>Hey, I was wondering if it would be inappropriate at this point to file an RFC against <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">User:Philwelch</a>. I believe this user has been warned before, and failed to improve his behavior. He has a very long history of using his adminship to block editors with whom he has an edit dispute: see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive191_c56d.html#Werdna.27s_RfA" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive191">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive156_ce2e.html#Unblock_request_pending_review" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive156">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive63_a3a3.html#Leaving_mesages_on_protected_talk_pages.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive63">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive163_34df.html#Admin.27s_unblock_request_pending_review" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive163">here</a> <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive130_2e94.html#User:Philwelch" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive130">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive40_6717.html#Admin_harassment_block" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive40">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive71_762c.html#Elonka_.22refactoring.22_pages_and_Phil_Welch_threatening_to_block_anyone_who_stops_her" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive71">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive26_ef45.html#Template:Sprotected" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive26">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive99_8b59.html#Comments_invited" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive99">here</a>.

<li>To address to the first claim, I have not pushed any particular POV at Wikipedia other than that of consensus, if any at all (notwithstanding talk page discussions, of course). An overwhelming of my edits to that article have been to address sloppiness, style, grammar, spelling, etcetera. My mission here is for the betterment of Wikipedia articles. Let it be known that I support the consensus view on global warming, as presented by the IPCC. In fact, despite what might appear as undue support for the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_variation.html" title="Solar variation">solar variation theory</a>, my purpose is an attempt to bring balance and a NPOV to the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> article, where a number of POV-pushers patrol and police the article.</li>

<li>To address the second claim, modeling doesn't constitute expertise. Second, there is a colossal difference in "accusation" and "suspicion," hence the name "suspected sock puppets." And it is true that I have a suspicion. How can you say it is wrong for me to have a suspicion? That's nonsensical. So, on behalf of <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a>, an abettor of mine, I filed that suspicion, "so as to retire any further suspicion of sockpuppetry of this user." Third, I will keep in mind now to keep comments that specifically relate to an issue (in terms of previous occurrences), but may be considered "trolling" by Raul654 and his cronies, to the talk page of the originator. My apologies. Fourth, my notice of 3RR was merited on the basis of his three reversion on that particular page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=110687672&amp;oldid=110657890" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=110687672&amp;oldid=110657890" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> I felt it necessary to advise him, because he often reverts content on that particular article, as well as related articles. There's isn't much to that. Fifth, my template of notability on that particular article was well merited. I've attempted to discuss the issue, but users, along with Raul654, digressed terribly from the issue. The particular <i>ad hominem</i> attacks/arguments abound when such issues arise.</li>

<li>To address the third claim, it would be wholly inappropriate to label this as a "hit list." It serves as a notice board that "will serve as a notice board that will be updated when necessary. The evidence gathering process is ongoing and, along with other users, I have begun this process." I've been consumed with the vexation of particular administrators who consider themselves above Wikipedia's policies. This is the sort of desecration up with which I will not put. It serves as a watch list, as it is titled, to my abettors and other users who wish to be cautious and watchful of such activities that I have observed and begun to document. It serves to no other purpose. Banefully, it is without proper evidence/references at the current moment, for which I apologize (and quite frankly, may abet in the appearance of personal attacks). Real life activities detract my availability on Wikipedia, but my "watchdog" activities will continue, and, with further aid, the notice board shall be complete with references, etcetera. The goal is not to detract the editor, but rather the particular edits by that user that have been contrary to Wikipedia policies.

These articles are highly controversial and continuously raise heated debates. It's easy to come here like <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> just did and throw accusations of trolling or POV pushing, but it seems to me that this has little or no merit. Besides, I have seen many users complain of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_M._Connolley_4511.html" title="William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>'s POV or behaviour regarding climate articles, and I have witnessed myself at least one disregard of WP policies by him so far.

<li>It should be noted that Childhoodsend (along with a few others - Roncram, Rameses, and the above-mentioned Brittainia) are, like Uber, POV pushers attempting to weaken or otherwise degrade the global warming and related articles.

<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy has an "undue weight" provision, but the sceptics keep pushing for equal coverage of the GW sceptic position. We attract an awful lot of sceptics, so we hear the same complaints over and over. But this isn't about the sceptic POV-pushing, this is about Uber's (and Brittainia's) disruptive activities - laughable accusations of sockpuppetry, trolling William's talk page, trolling <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_Connolley_b14c.html" title="Talk:William Connolley">Talk:William Connolley</a>, setting up attack pages, etc. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 02:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Guettarda, you are not representing my actions fairly. If nothing else, the solar variation theory is probably the most debated topic <b>within</b> the scientific community. This theory holds water. Many scientists have researched the effects solar variation has the Earth, and there shouldn't be anything stopping these substantiated scientists' research from being discussed in relationship to how it affects Earth's climate. I've added nothing to the global warming article that was either against the consensus or POV in nature. For all intents and purposes, your claims are unfounded. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 03:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry if my comment wasn't quite clear. Brittainia talked about "all the other people" who have had similar problems with William. Not only is that a misrepresentation (since, after all, it isnt just William), it's also expected, since there's always been a movement to give equal weight to a minority position. As I said, <i>this isn't about...POV-pushing</i>, this is about behaviour. I think I've represented your <i>behaviour</i> fairly - your continued repost of a 3RR warning, your sockpuppetry accusations, etc., your creation of attack pages...this behaviour is unacceptable. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry then, I misunderstood. But I still disagree with your assessment. The overwhelming amount of dissent is that in the direct of William M. Connolley. This isn't about skepticism. You have misunderstood that idea. Second, how am I supposed to address my concerns with this particular user? Shall I go to to his user page? Of course not, that's trolling! Well then, shall I go to some committee or report it to some official noticeboard? Of course not, that's silly and nonsense! Forgive me for not <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">assuming the assumption of good faith</a>, but what else can I do when there is a particular administrator who has been elected to be given a large amount of power, who, based on his personal feelings that he hasn't been able to subdue, can only categorize my every action as unwarranted, when, in fact, this is solely biased and unfounded! If anything, this is nonsensical. I've made by rebuttal above, and the author of these claims continuously avoids the facts, but rather simply attacks some unrelated point of view, and has yet to substantiate anything he has said. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 18:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Raul654 has labeled me a "contrarian POV pusher trying to put bias into the article". But all I was doing was defending the words: <b>"However, there remain respected scientists who hold differing opinions."</b> which had been deleted from the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> article. Surely these words do not constitute <i>pushing a biased POV</i>, as alleged? The control group will not even tolerate this tiny amount of NPOV in this important article. UBeR is a good person who has been the subject of these bully tactics for too long.

<li>This is a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_hunt.html" title="Witch hunt">witch hunt</a>. Most of the edits UBeR has made have been reasonable as far as I have seen. He's been fighting what many of us believe to be a systemic <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias</a> on many global warming related articles to shut down and revert edits that are anti-GW.

<li>This situation is extremely complicated and something that anyone who is not a regular participant in global warming related articles will be hard pressed to untangle. In terms of disclosure I should state that I am a climate scientist, and am taken by some as one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSolar_system_warming&amp;diff=111339859&amp;oldid=111336653" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSolar_system_warming&amp;diff=111339859&amp;oldid=111336653" rel="nofollow">villains</a> in the affair. Discussions on the topic sometimes get heated, and even those who are acting in good faith sometimes make remarks that could have been put more tactfully -- certainly I have. Consider all this however you will.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The global change articles see a steady stream of editors who wish to promote a point of view that gives undue weight to the skeptical viewpoint. Some simply make gratuitously provocative edits in order to stir up trouble; others have an agenda and are fact-averse. Representatives of each of those groups already have responded here. But I don't think UBeR belongs in those categories. He genuinely believes that the skeptical side is not being given fair play. In other words, while I think he wrong on the facts, I think his position is held in good faith. He also is an excellent copyeditor. The problem is, the same single-mindedness and persistence (some might say obsessiveness) that well serves a copyeditor is less helpful when dealing with other individuals. One has to learn to be flexible and that some battles are not worth fighting. I have tried to warn UBeR against personalizing the situation but unfortunately to no avail. To make a long story short, if any sanctions are meted out they should recognize that unlike some others, UBeR can make and has made constructive contributions to the articles themselves. The problems mostly lie in his actions outside article space as outlined in Rau654's point 2. I hope that the situation can be resolved in such a way that he can continue to make constructive contributions.</dd>

<dd>Raul, this is getting absurd. Until that last post, I thought you were doing this is good faith, but that's obviously not the case. You're right. I came to this page because of a notice placed on my talk page. Have you thought (*gasp*) that maybe not everyone checks the administrators' noticeboard on a regular basis? So because Uber or one of his supporters solicited my opionion, I'm immediately non-credible? I think I've contributed enough to WP at this point that I'm obviously not a troll. My opinion should be worth just as much as the opinions of people that disagree with you. Can I discount anyone that's posted on your or WMC's talk page as "non-credible" as well? Give me a break. You're just trying to discount 8 editors' opinions because they disagree with you.

<p>Raul654, in a perfect world the next step would be an investigation into why Uber is behaving in this manner (because I think there is fault on "both" sides). Unfortunately, this is not a perfect world, most people are here because they are willingly contributing their time. This is a really difficult call, you ought to enforce the rules, but by enforcing the rules you probably are doing an injustice because some are using the rules to bully others. You ought to investigate the bullying but that would take too much time (as I found out) and I'm sure there is fault on both sides. Probably the best solution would be to ban anyone who has contributed to this debate from editing any of the various global warming/climate change/mars heating up/etc. articles again! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Raul654 - I think the next step is to thank those administrators who do give up their own time to read all this argy-bargy. To do a good job moderating these disputes must take an awful lot of time and effort. Well done and thanks. Having read the israel-palestian and global warming, perhaps it might be worth considering creating new pages which can only be edited by one "side" which are linked to the main page (the main should not be edited by those taking a "side"). By asking people to decide whether they wish to be "neutral", "pro" or "anti" it would allow them to contribute to the article which best suits their own background. But more importantly it would allow the articles to include contentious information often repressed by one group. The "pro" group would be balanced by the "anti" group obtaining an overall NPOV within wikipedia (but not within those articles). Just an idea! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 15:44, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Everyone should know that this group are currently being investigated and exposed by a radio show for their hijacking of global warming articles as this group already knows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> - thus they are bringing Wikipedia into disrepute. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a> 06:02, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stephan, this post by William M. Connolley on a user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raul654#Where_next.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raul654#Where_next.3F" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, is clearly designed to appear innocent and is a pointer to the next post on another user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, where the actual conspiring and planning of your group's next move is clearly discussed. WMC was obviously attempting to hide this discussion otherwise why would he say <i>"Where next? - I have (reluctantly) started a discussion of this at User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC? William M. Connolley 09:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)"</i> and give a pointer to another user talk page before starting the actual planning session? The "where next" comment makes me question "where was it before?". Your self-serving mischaracterization of user talk pages as "public" is false as the public rarely (or never) visits them for "general browsing". Now that your group has been exposed, I hope that the Wikipedia community takes this seriously and considers permanently banning your control and POV pushing on all GW pages. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a> 06:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, there is nothing unseemly about either [1] my message informing WMC as to the existance of this thread (after all, Uber's persistent harassment of him was one of the three primary complaints here; obviously a de facto part of that is to inform the person being harassed), or [2] the fact that WMC asked me to participate in a discussion about how to follow up this thread. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 06:16, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although a conspiracy is not proved only by the discussions that Brittainia unearted, circumstances are of concern. I was perhaphs naive, but I must say that until now, I did not understand how it could be that these three editors are on the same line 99% of the time in GW related articles and always backing up each other. I mean, in normal circumstances, the odds are that they will disagree here and there on occasion no? This being said, the "monkey-off-your-back" post by Raul654 as well as the one where WMC gives an awkward pointer to his friends do not seem to be within normal Wikipedia behaviour. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 18:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um...maybe our usual (though by no means universal) agreement has something to do with the fact that all of us can recognize and read scientific papers, and distinguish them from political pseudo-science. Moreover, 99% of the time, Raul is not even there. As of the end of January 2007, he has <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Global+warming&amp;namespace=Talk&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Global+warming&amp;namespace=Talk&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">8</a> edits on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_warming_d6c7.html" title="Talk:Global warming">talk:global warming</a> (as opposed to William's about 700 and my 400). And, of course, the secret conspiracy on our talk pages is open for all to see. My <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephan_Schulz_91b9.html" title="User talk:Stephan Schulz">talk page</a> has never been archived. According to the article contribution counter, William has 11 edits there, Raul has 1 (and that is the official notification about the closing of William's ArbCom case that I reopened). Given that <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">User:Brittainia</a> herself has indeed widely canvased support (even on pages of users who have been inactive for a long time), this conspiracy theory is laughable.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 20:34, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stephan, you sound like the accused in the accused box who is yelling that the accusations against him are laughable. Although you can of course have your say in this new affair, you should stick to facts, not rant. Let the discussion go and see how the case unfolds. As a party to the "conspiracy theory", your testimony (since you chose to testify) must be flawless. It is true that your talk pages are public, but you also know just like us that they're not widely read, far from that.</dd>
<dd>Besides, we can all read scientific papers. It's just that we can also elect to be critical rather than elect for blind belief.

<dd>There is so much nonsense in this that I probably miss some of it...
<ol>
<li>I'm not an <s>accused</s> accused in any way that remotely resembles the situation in a court of law and warrants such a comparison.</li>
<li>There is no "new affair".</li>
<li>I'm not yelling (but admit to some ranting, which seems like an adequate tool in this situation).</li>
<li>I'm sticking to the facts.</li>
<li>I'm not a party to any conspiracy theory, neither with not without quotes.</li>
<li>My testimony certainly does not have to be "flawless" (why should it have to be?) and, in fact, I'm not giving "testimony". At most I'm presenting evidence.</li>
<li>In fact, I have no idea about how many people read my talk pages. Certainly most people I have interacted with have my talk page on their watch list.</li>
<li>I have no idea if you are able to read (as in "read and understand") scientific papers. Certainly, "we all" cannot read scientific papers - its extremely hard to read and <i>understand</i> a scientific paper that is not in your field of expertise. Most people (and most Wikipedians) have no approriate scientific training at all. William and Raymond are actually specialists in the field.</li>
<li>Indeed, there is no absolute certainty in science. None of us has ever claimed there is. But that does not stop us from using scientific results to calculate the statics of a bridge, to determine the ballistics of a weapon to put someone into jail (or, in more barbaric countries, onto death row), to develop a new vaccine, or for thousands of other tasks daily. Demanding "absolute proof" is at best a self-serving delaying tactic.</li>

I don't really have a problem with the ongoing pattern of new editors arriving on these pages etc. I agree that UBer seems to be trying to improve Wikipedia in good faith. However, I find the pattern of personalising discussion on this topic by attacking other longer standing editors totally unacceptable, both on and off wiki. It violates <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> and a pile of other policies. If those who seek feel NPOV is in a different place (however good faith they are) throw tantrums and engage in personal attacks on other editors than we should warn and ultimately reluctantly exclude them.

As a pretty straightforward demonstration of this I was recently elected as an Administrator here by a very marginal majority (76% versus the 75% required) but none of the editors with whom I am assumed to be "grouped" voted for me. What better demonstration is there of a lack of conspiracy? As for this radio show ("race to the right"?), as far as I can tell it is a couple of guys who have a very strong POV and are trying to make a story about people not accepting their views. But they are both contributing to Wikipedia and writing a website apparently attacking editors here alleging conspiracy just because anyone with a reasonable scientific background is reverting low quality contributions.

But they aren't the only people complaining about a conspiracy - there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who have been complaining about the cabal controlling (and pushing their POV on) the global warming articles. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_M._Connolley_4511.html" title="William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> has already had three complaints against him - which two members of his group have admitted that they helped him to get out of (their admissions are right here on this page). After this latest complaint, he and his group conspired to launch this diversionary complaint which we are now involved in against UBeR (I am not sure why, if they had nothing to hide?). It is now time to begin a formal investigation of their tactics and the allegations against them from so many sources (including the bored DJ's). -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a> 04:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, this looks like an unfounded allegation. Personally I have complained several times on AN/I about UBer and others engaged in personal attacks ref the content of the page. This seems to me to be the substance of the current complaint: if he and the 3-4 others in the "conspiracy theory" gang were a bit more civil we would not be here (and that group have a lot of cross comments planning on each others talk pages, and abusing other editors). This is not in appearance a diversionary complaint AFAICT and unless "having a monkey on your back" has a vastly different meaning in other countries there is nothing I have read above to make this claim substantial. I think it is time to go to the ArbCom and ask for a community ban for the disruptive editors. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 08:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

They're clearly the same person. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 04:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this not a separate issue? As I'm sure you have checked many a times, I have no relation to these editors in terms of location / computer use, etc. If your intent is to distract from issue at hand, please do so elsewhere.

<dd>I would like to note that, beyond your self-serving denial, we have no evidence at all that you, Brittainia, and Persianne are in fact different people. Moreover, the fact that your similar editing patterns were, on their own, enough to tip Raymond off strongly suggests otherwise. I have no intention of apologizing for following up on an (apparently correct) sockpuppeting suspicion. If that doesn't suit you, you can complain to <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">user:UninvitedCompany</a>, the checkuser ombudsman. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 05:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Though this is pointless to respond to, I'll say it anyway for brevity's sake. Where is the breach of privacy? Raul654 has been entrusted with checkuser access to identify socks, meatpuppetts, and other uses of contributions to evade bans/blocks or misuse Wikipedia content or process. We are not all entrusted with such access for the very privacy reasons you are concerned with. Raul654 confirmed the IPs, and not a single shred of personal identity was posted. Only checkusers can view their logs. I don't know your gender, location either city or continent, editing patterns that aren't public or marital/tax/health status from the checkuser confirmation. So what exactly is your beef with a checkuser that would invite such a riled defense? This question is rhetorical, I do not request a response. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 06:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to point out, for the sake of clarity, continent, state, city, and even ISP can be determined with an IP. So you're not 100% correct in that aspect. On another note, I believe the very problem was that <u>Raul654</u> WAS the one who did the check, as opposed to a more trustworthy and uninvolved person. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 00:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ryulong and all of you others, I must say that I am also truly disappointed by your continually dragging a child into this unseemly character assassination (it reminds me of Shakespeare's "the stabbing of Julius Caesar" scene). Persianne has certainly not <i>"pushed the same point of view disruptively"</i> (apart from one vote to save her dad's article from a similar assassination) and if you can show any evidence at all - do so. If you cannot, kindly retract your ugly smear and apologise.

<p>I have had the misfortune to try and edit the various global warming articles. Although I do not personally agree with Uber's point of view, I am firmly convinced that the faction that opposes Uber's views try is ganging up on contributors they don't like in an attempt to silent contributions informing readers of alternative &amp; notable view points to the pro global warming lobbyists. I really do feal sorry for people who are trying to document the alternative view to the pro global warming lobby because they are up against some very nasty characters who quite clearly want to stop people like Uber using any means possible. This whole situation doesn't do Wikipedia's reputation any good. There is unquestionably a majority (of scientists) who are of the view that the minority should not be heard at all. The majority appear to be able to edit Wikipedia at all times of day and night, the minority seems to be "normal" people with an interest as they edit intermittently.</p>
<p>From what I have seen this is not at all a fair fight, this is the Wikipedia equivalent of the overwhelming force of the Nazis attacking the minority jews (with the same vicious belief they are right). The "Nazis" may be technically operating within the law, and the "jews" may be behaving in ways that in other cases would be acceptable, but until Wikipedia finds a way to redress the balance and in particular starts to enforce NPOV, I'm with the underdogs and would urge you to see their actions as extremely restrained given the intolerable position they are under. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 11:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been away dealing with my own server issues lately. I have had the horrid experience of attempting to edit/balance the Global Warming pages. My own research of edit histories, etc. has shown some extremely disturbing things about Wikipedia, its administrators and its policies. The short of the whole issue is this: there are a number of admins (the group being discussed here are not the only ones) who flex their power over any other editor that dare disagree with them. The tactics used are vague references to policies to 'prove' the other editors are out-of-line; carefully crafted cheap shots in the article edits summaries &amp; talk pages to 'push buttons' of the 'bad editors'; talk down to them as being too inexperienced to understand how to properly edit Wikipedia; revert edits wholesale and in tandem (when one's rv is undone another will re-revert for the admin. The harder the resistance to the will of the abusive admins the more destructive the admins use/abuse of policies become. People talk about the blue veil of protection for police officers and a perfect example of that in Wikipedia can be found in reading the past 2 years of action, complaints, activity, etc from the admins and their colleagues in this particular complaint.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This entire RfC is a part of the constant efforts to chase away editors who do not comply with the viewpoints of various admins. To some degree it worked with me personally...I have chosen to not edit Wikipedia until I talk with certain key people in Wikipedia about this problem. Their actions are so intrusive I have recently received messages from some of these people attempting to dictate content on my own personal webspaces. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 18:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
