&gt;Well Kurita, enviroknott obviously lives near you. Because he's been

<p>note that enviroknot exhibited <i>exactly</i> the same behaviour of claiming innocence while carefully avoiding to recognize or comment on the sockpuppet evidence, such as signing with the wrong username, on the wrong talk pages etc. A new user with the same IP who appears within minutes of Enviroknot's block, and starts quoting Enviroknot's statements on Talk:Jihad immediately is just not credible, sorry, neighbors or no neighbors.

<p>I was wondering if I could get some advice for the following problem. On June 19th, Category:Anti-gay rights legislation came up for CfD (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2005_June_19_cbcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 June 19">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 June 19</a> for the archived discussion). It seems that there was some discussion on the category, mostly between Users Dave and Noitall. After two days, they commented out almost all of the discussion and deemed there was a consensus to rename the category. After the required seven days, I un-commented out the discussion (I take care of archiving CfD these days), determined there was in fact no consensus, and marked it as such.</p>
<p>Noitall then modified the archive to say there was a consensus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_deletion%2FLog%2F2005_June_19&amp;diff=17783969&amp;oldid=17773880" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_deletion%2FLog%2F2005_June_19&amp;diff=17783969&amp;oldid=17773880" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which I reverted.

<dd>4 Renames (of which 2 are rename/keep) and 3 deletes. I fail to see any consensus here unless CfD operates with extremely broad percentage of what is deemed so. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a>\<sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInter_a37b.html" title="User talk:Inter"><font color="green">Echo</font></a></sup> 30 June 2005 21:06 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Technically the only thing that requires a substantial consensus is deletion. The problem here is that a vote-to-rename is mixed up with a vote-to-delete. What I'd propose is that if there exists a naming convention in the MOS, this should be renamed accordingly. If not, leave it be, and interested parties can take it to RFC if they want to form a naming convention. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> June 30, 2005 23:40 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a heads-up: I do not intend on unblocking this user. If someone else wants to, that's fine, but he sent me three emails. Look here.</p>
<pre>
I was joking it wasn't a personal attack, if you type Zod 
in the search it will tell you I am a satirist and you should 
know that I am too afraid to beat some one down (that's a lie). 
But I was just unblocked can't you just unblock me, I've gotten 
a website now and any "personal attacks" will be discontinued, 
so will you please unblock me.
From,
Ronnie DeYoung

I was never warned before not to "personal attack" people. But 
once again I don't consider saying something that is meant to 
be somewhat humorous to be a "personal attack". I've actually 
talked about this before. What I said wasn't offensive, it was 
a fact. I said "watch yourself" as a joke, I'm too lazy to actually 
do anything. So Linuxbeak, do you think you're special that you 
blocked someone that can anal rape you with his massive intellegence? 
Well you don't have to unblock me if you want because I know your 
kind. Just because you're are a rich little dipshit that can afford 
to go to the University of Rhode Island, doesn't mean that you can 
be a dick to Zod. For Zod will anal rape you with his massive 
intellegence. The crappy joke "I can break diamonds with my voice" 
its just a sickening cliche joke. Remove that joke from your profile, 
or I will have to anal rape you with my massive intellegence. Oh 
and one last thing Protestant-Baptist thing, my SAT score was 
1380 boo ya
 h!
</pre>
<pre>
Okay I wish to update something and it's really bothering me, so you 
dumbass cocksucking 18 year old, I want you to unblock me, or I will 
anal rape you with my massive intellegence. Listen I've done it before 
and I'll do it to you unless you unblock me, for the good of the 
"wikipedian" community.
Thank you for your time Ass Master.

<p>I've unblocked them, because, well, I can't find anything to justify their blocks other than that they are GNAA members; they didn't do anything more disruptive than vote, and I have no reason to believe they are anyone's sockpuppets, just a group of people with too much time on their hands. Since 1) VfD is not a democracy and their votes would likely be discounted anyway, 2) the VfD has been locked now, 3) blocking them is entirely ineffective and only encourages actual disruption, and 4) Radiant!, who originally blocked them, doesn't seem to be around and responding to the comment left on his talk page, I've unblocked. I trust that they will be reblocked if they do abuse their reinstated editing privileges. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 1 July 2005 20:12 (UTC)</p>

<li>Okay, I was away for a couple of hours... perhaps this was overkill but these accounts seemed rather suspicious to me. I did look over their edit histories and found that these accounts either had nearly no edits other than to VFD, or had been absent for a very long time and suddely returned to answer one VFD. Timecop being one of them - he has 51 edits, the vast majority of which either to the GNAA article or to VFD votes. Those accounts that had a bunch of nontrivial edits, I didn't block. I haven't checked for GNAA membership (partially because I don't quite see how to do that) but these doesn't strike me as regular editors. You're probably right though that blocking them would not particularly accomplish anything, though. One exception though for User:Lysol, since he's been changing other people's votes. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 1, 2005 22:56 (UTC)

<li>Interestingly enough you unblocked Convene as a GNAA member, but he probably isn't since he's the one who nominated the article for deletion in the first place. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 1, 2005 22:58 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The mass descent of "new editors" stretches my ability to assume good faith, as well, but I think they cause more fuss blocked than unblocked. Changing votes is another story, of course... As for Convene, well, the debate has been locked now; s/he failed to get what s/he wanted except for some momentary attention; I don't suppose it hurts to unblock now. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 1 July 2005 23:06 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It may be notable that Timecop showed up on IRC complaining about unfair blocks and cursing "some Jew" who blocked him.

<li>You are overreacting. Just because someone doesn't agree with your opinion doesn't mean they are abusing anything.

<p>All the evidence points to <b>bad faith</b>. If you were not friendly with this editor, you would agree. Also, it is entirely irrelant if an Administrator has lots of good work and then steps off the deep end to abuse his authority. All those previous edits did not stop me from being victimized. In addition to my statements above, here is more: I was <b>blocked for 55 hours</b> at one location (not certain how he did it) and it did not end until <b>58 hours after my edit</b> that he disputed. And I never violated any policy, including the 3RR that he accused me of. Here is the evidence:</p>

<li>Very well, if you insist. In response to your points on policy,</li>
<li>1.people can be blocked for the <i>spirit</i> of the 3RR even if they do keep to the <i>letter</i> of it. The 3RR does not give anyone the inalienable right to three reverts per day.</li>
<li>2.KBdank's edits there are not vandalism. See <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> for the definition.</li>
<li>3.This is not a content dispute.</li>
<li>4.Logged-in users with a lot of valid contributions are not exempt from being blocked. Nor, in fact, are admins, ArbCom members or even Jimbo.</li>
<li>From your second list of points, #4: You <i>suspect would be acceptable to the other editors if asked</i>. However, since you haven't asked, you cannot be sure. I'm glad that you and Dave worked out your differences, but you cannot assume from everybody else's silence that they agreed with you. If you want people to reconsider their votes, ask them.</li>
<li>Therefore, #7 and #8 are also assumptions. Since they are opinion rather than fact, it is not unreasonable that someone else may make other assumptions and reach a different conclusion. That doesn't make it bad faith for anyone. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 3, 2005 21:13 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>And my take, on Wiki policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Your assertion is not supported by Wiki policy or by the facts, certainly as applied here. <a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> had no knowledge of the facts on this issue, then disagreed with me, then reverted 3 times first. Then I reverted his, and he blocked me. A clear abuse of power, and now that I can reflect, it was simply a childish act.</li>
<li>2. Ok, I'll accept it his actions were not vandalism, but neither were mine. We did exactly the same things, only he did them first (with the exception of the blocking, which was within his power).</li>
<li>3. See 1 above.</li>
<li>4. Well, he should have blocked himself then first, but as this was an abuse of power issue, that does not make much sense, does it?</li>
<li>5. I don't need to ask, as it was a hypothetical that I am aware is not true, you are sticking up for him. It does not matter. I am over it. But it should not happen again.</li>

<p>Look, can we drop this already? The issue at hand is over, you've renominated the category for renaming, and now you continue to try and spread blatant lies about me. If you have a true gripe and can back it up with facts, try an RFC. Otherwise, let's get on with building an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 6 July 2005 13:08 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've clearly let him know about the 3RR, and that his edits (and edit summaries) are contrary to the talk page discussion (<b>which he has not been involved with at all</b>), and he is freely reverting.

<li>Listen: The process is: Go to the talk page, discuss it with everyone else, come to a consensus on the proper wording, add it to the article page. The process is NOT: Ignore the talk page completely, add in your own personal version that talk page discussion has been against adding, keep reverting and not discussing at all. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 2 July 2005 15:26 (UTC)</li>

<p>Question from RossNixon: Aren't I allowed to remove vandalism from my own User Talk page? (Brian had been leaving messages implying that my article edits were "sandbox testing" errors). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossnixon_c5b8.html" title="User:Rossnixon">RossNixon</a> 2 July 2005 08:46 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As I stated on your talk page the 2nd time you reverted, you can edit your user page all you want, but you can't just delete other user's comments on your talk page. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 2 July 2005 15:29 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's extraordinarily incivil and close to vandalism to accuse someone on their userpage of making a test in this way when this was clearly not the case. In my opinion, justified removal. Please refrain from treating RossNixon and others in this way. Rossnixon is guilty of a less major offence. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendanconway_b9d7.html" title="User:Brendanconway">User:Brendanconway</a>
<ul>
<li>I didn't want to be harsh, but wanted to let him know that I considered the edit vandalism: without any edit summary or any other comment, he added <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> to the list at <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a>. Maybe someone needs to make a more appropriate template, rather than {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}}, but it doesn't change the fact that he kept deleting my comment on his talk page (not his user page), rather than doing the civil thing and replying to it. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 5 July 2005 17:25 (UTC)</li>

<li>He has completely ignored my comments to him about the proper methods of having controversial content added to an article. He has completely ignored the talk page of the article, including not discussing at all, and ignoring all the discussion already there, which is completely against adding his view. This isn't wikinfo. You don't explain every minority view in every random article. He is now trying to play dumb, despite my constant notices to him on his talk page (he kept deleting the notices: see his other 3RR violation above). Expect him to continue re-adding this content without any discussion. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 2 July 2005 15:39 (UTC)</li>

<p>Chuck F, prolific edit warrior and problem user, has returned. Despite <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Chuck_F_1e1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Chuck F">an ArbCom decision</a> specifically banning him "from editing any article related to libertarianism, socialism, or political ideology", he has returned to his favorite haunts: <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Paul_339f.html" title="Ron Paul">Ron Paul</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">Libertarian socialism</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Australia_6443.html" title="Liberal Democratic Party of Australia">Liberal Democratic Party of Australia</a>. A significant block, as authorized by the ArbCom, would seem to be in order. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 2 July 2005 18:32 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ruling says he can be blocked for up to one week for that. On the other hand it doesn't specify an expiry time for that penalty, which was instated in February, but I guess we can assume it's one year, so he's still subject to it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 2 July 2005 18:43 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Seeing as the ArbCom specifically set expiry times for every other remedy, I think it's safe to assume this one was indefinite. And for what it's worth, he's also in violation of the "removal of content" and "required edit summaries" provisions of the decision. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 2 July 2005 20:45 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mmm. Indefinite usually means a year, on the principle that a year is just about forever in Internet time - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 4 July 2005 07:00 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>I was under the impression that one year was the maximum penalty the ArbCom would (or could?) impose. A year isn't really very long in my opinion, but it's good to limit it to that because then people can at least get second chances. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 07:12 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a "would", not a "could", but it is the convention. Note cases where someone racked up an over 1-year ban - the actual ban is then one year - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 5 July 2005 06:56 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't understand. The user accompanied every single edit (revert) with a comment begining either with "rm" or "remove," as seen in the diffs. The user blindly reverted all new edits, as I was making them. For each edit I made (in a particular section of the article, the user made a corresponding revert undoing my edits. Perhaps I have some misunderstanding of the term "revert." --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 4 July 2005 03:45 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I understand it, it's more than 3 reverts of the SAME material.

<dd>No, <i>any</i> three reverts. If I add four different things to an article, and you remove each one in turn, then you're in breach of 3RR. But if you wait until I've added all four, then you revert them all at once, that's only one revert and legal (if not always nice). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkalexander100_f98a.html" title="User talk:Markalexander100"><sup>1</sup></a> 4 July 2005 05:26 (UTC)</dd>

His user page is a clear example of LaRouche thinking: Aristotle is "possibly the greatest evil in distant times," John Locke "depraved," Adam Smith "systematically insane," Kant "pathological liar," Hitler "put into power by London bankers," Bertrand Russell an "evil" advocate of "genocide," and "Lunatic Isaac Newton."</p>
<p>Background for those not familiar with the LaRouche situation in Wikipedia: there have already been two arbcom cases that ruled LaRouche supporters must not use Wikipedia to promote LaRouche, and may not insert material originating with the LaRouche movement unless the articles are closely related to LaRouche. The arbcom has ruled that material published by the LaRouche movement amounts to original research.

<p>Some of the disruptive edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an image to insert a POV: his first edit was to remove the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> picture and replace it with one that made Kant look ugly. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immanuel_Kant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=17802294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immanuel_Kant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=17802294" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Kant's a LaRouche bogeyman and Cognition's user page calls Kant an "avowedly pathological liar."</li>

<li>Bad-faith VfD nomination: he nominated <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a> for a VfD.

<dd>It's certainly possible that it's HK. There are elements of him in some of the posts on talk pages, and in some of the edit summaries. But there are also quite a few spelling mistakes, which HK didn't make, though that might be deliberate. It would be good to get an IP check, but apparently the check-user facility isn't available to David yet under 1.5. We could ask a developer.

<p>You know, I was thinking, what if a LaRouche editor didn't revert war but talked things over and reached compromises on what to include? Would that be acceptable even though it would violate the ArbCom ruling, which says no LaRouche material can be included? I would like it if the LaRouchites would discuss and reach compromises, but the ArbCom ruling seems, if I'm reading it correctly, to make that useless. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 3 July 2005 14:41 (UTC)</p>

His supporters won't compromise. If you believe that Bertrand Russell (a well-known pacifist) was evil and genocidal, that the Queen is involved in the drugs trade, and that the British royal household wants to assassinate LaRouche, it's kind of hard to find a middle ground.

<dd>Everyking, you're more than welcome to try when he returns after the block. The only things you have to bear in mind is that LaRouche publications are regarded as original research, because they're not in the slightest bit credible and are never confirmed by reliable publications, and the inclusion in articles of LaRouche's tiny-minority views violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. But if you can find a way to work within those limits, by all means give it a go.

<dd>You're missing the point. The question I raised was whether someone with views you consider "crazy" can be a legitimate contributor at the same time, and work positively. You're dodging the issue by making the assumption that everyone you disagree with is automatically a bad contributor. If a LaRouchite <i>was</i> a good and well-behaved contributor, then would we have an obligation to work things out in a standard way according to consensus with the LaRouchite? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 3 July 2005 21:36 (UTC)

<dd>I'll thank you not to put words in my mouth. The suggestion that I believe everyone I disagree with is a bad contributor is preposterous and unproductive. If Congnition wants to be a good contribitor, then all he has to do is actually be one, and I'll gladly cut him some slack if he shows any sign of this. But I'm not going to succumb to the naive illusion that everybody from the lunatic fringe can be rehabilitated by patience and wikilove. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 3 July 2005 22:32 (UTC)

<dd>If a LaRouchie was a good and well-behaved contributor, we wouldn't notice s/he was a LaRouchie. It's the expression of the LaRouche POV that makes the contributions poor, and the strident insistence on their truth that makes the behavior bad. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> July 3, 2005 23:46 (UTC)

<dd>But the contributor could openly state it, and argue in a pro-LaRouche way, without actually behaving poorly. It seems to me the same thing could go for any political POV. I don't get it. It seems like the argument here isn't considering the full scope. It isn't just the LaRouchites; how do you handle people from any POV that you consider marginal? Can you put all those people in the same box? My view is, let people talk things over, reach agreements, regardless of where they're coming from, and in the most intractable cases we ought to have a content committee to make recommendations for solutions. I worry that this is a kind of test case for locking people out based on their views, rather than their behavior. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 02:12 (UTC)

<dd>I listed the behavioral problems above: a bad-faith VfD, bad-faith objections to FACs, personal attacks, abusive edit summaries, deletion of posts from his talk page, revert warring. It's not a question of marginal views: the views are insane. Several of us (Adam Carr, John Kenney, Andy L, Snowspinner, Willmcw, Cberlet, and myself, among others) spent months seeking compromise with Herschelkrustofsky: all that happened was we ended up with 186,000 words on talk pages, and some of us ended up being woven into their conspiracy theories, including that I had a connection with the British royal family and had been placed in Wikipedia to protect them from LaRouche POV.</dd>
<dd>Bear in mind that there are no sources for any of these views other than LaRouche publications, or a handful of other similarly crazy ones that parrot whatever LaRouche says, and they're not even slightly credible, so putting the material in Wikipedia would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> July 4, 2005 02:25 (UTC)

<dd>The last thing I want is LaRouche POV infesting our articles. What I'm saying is that we shouldn't lock people out simply according to their views. That's the wrong road to go down. The last time we had a LaRouchite around he was banned by Snowspinner on a baseless charge of sockpuppetry. Clearly that was just a pretext to get rid of him, because he would have done the same to any LaRouchite. And of course the same thing is happening here. Let's get solid majority opinions against these LaRouchites to keep them from POVing the articles, instead of locking them out of the project altogether. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 02:41 (UTC)

<dd>As I've said many times, no one is being locked out because of their views, but because of disruption. We do have solid majority opinion against LaRouche POV being inserted, but there's no reason that any editor's time should be tied up having to deal with it. However, as you seem to want to do it, you're welcome to volunteer; what you can't do is volunteer on behalf of anyone else. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> July 4, 2005 02:55 (UTC)

<dd>So much useless talk. Everyking, I think I speak for everyone listening, when I say "If this place is being actively destroyed, you're playing one of the most noteworthy rôles." I never saw this page before today, but good God in Heaven. Never have I seen so much pointless unproductive sniveling and whining as by you. Dealing with the anonymous vandal whose activities brought me here today is at least a worthwhile way of spending my time on wikipedia, but your sole purpose here seems to be sassing the driver. You sound like a broken (and very bad) record. "You guys are being mean to the bad guy!" "You scraped his elbow when you threw the vandal out the window! You should go to jail!" You remind me of a lawyer who defends a burglar who happens to get cut on a knife while breaking in through a kitchen skylight (cf. <i><a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%2C_Liar_fe27.html" title="Liar, Liar">Liar, Liar</a></i>). Do you SERIOUSLY have nothing better to do with your time than sit around and make plaintive and pathetically friviolous claims in favor of every abusive would-be wikipedian? So you got sanctioned by ArbCom, and now, based on your incessant whining reaction, apparently thereto and for no other reason, I'm beginning to think their actions didn't go nearly far enough. Yes, I've never interacted with you, and I should say, "Yes, I've never had the utter displeasure of having to interact with you, thank the good Lord."... but seriously.

<dd>Your comment here, Tomer, shows that you haven't really seen Everyking in action. If you take a look at the RC patrol you will see Everyking diligently reverting vandalism and pursuing vandals. He, like almost all the others here are working to prevent damage to Wikipedia. I don't agree with Everyking's mild stance on blocks and bans, he is typically willing to let troublemakers go much further than I would. But his stance is good faith and one of tolerance of other opinions (a bit too tolerant IMO, but that is beside the point), not one of actively wanting to help troublemakers pursue their agenda. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 6 July 2005 10:01 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I ever say about this kind of thing is that I think people should be handled intelligently, and that controversial cases should ideally not be dealt with by one person, but through a consensus of serious editors. I consider myself fairly moderate (not particularly mild, except in some limited ways) when it comes to punitive measures. We would fall apart without them. On the other hand if you apply them wrongly you can exacerbate problems by turning a potential good contributor (sometimes an already existing good contributor) into a very bad contributor. We have some users who believe in the "too bad" approach to solving these problems, you know, spray gunfire all around and maybe you'll hit a few innocents, but you'll (probably) hit the targets too. And if the target wears glasses, shoot everybody wearing glasses. I suppose I'm exaggerating, but the point is that it's a simplistic (and perhaps opportunistic, in a way) approach. And it's not even inclusive, because usually a hardline admin will act individually, without consulting the rest of us—Snowspinner would call that the common sense approach (does he believe that <i>I</i> should handle these things according to <i>my</i> common sense? If not, perhaps he can see why I don't think he should handle them according to his). So I'd say I prefer intelligent and flexible penalties that have some kind of broad agreement behind them. (For this reason, I remain a big proponent of quickpolls.) <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 6 July 2005 12:16 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came across this user when I was doing new page patrol. His only article contribution was to create <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayko_Nguyen_ef6a.html" title="Mayko Nguyen">Mayko Nguyen</a> with the text "Hot Canadian chick who shows her tits in some movie." I have tagged this for speedy deletion. Looking at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TonyTony_a1f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/TonyTony">his other contributions</a>, he has uploaded 10 photographs, all purportedly of female celebrities, with a certain exposure theme. These images don't appear to have been used in any articles. I'm posting this here because I'm not sure what further action to take. If a user is uploading photos without linking them into articles, is Wikipedia being used as a free webhost? Would Wikipedia benefit even if these images were linked to? Should they be deleted? <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 2005-07-04 06:17:02 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am having difficulty with an editor whom I believe to be harassing another in an insidious way by making continuing accusations of misbehaviour at an old RFC.

<li><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> is of the extremely fringe opinion that Ancient Greek is not an extinct language, but merely an earlier stage of one single Greek language, which is still spoken.

<dd><a href="../../../o/d/y/Odysseas_Elytis_5c12.html" title="Odysseas Elytis">Elytis</a> was a great poet.

<dd>He evidently did, as he stated it in the most official way possible. His intimate relationship with the Greek literary heritage was such, that I would take his opinion over any non-Greek-speaking linguist: the latter remind me of a virgin sexologist. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 4 July 2005 23:35 (UTC)

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>1) User Miskin is under the impression (or, to put it in other words, is firmly convinced) that the region of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> comprises only <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Macedonia_f584.html" title="Greek Macedonia">Greek Macedonia</a> whereas the other parts of the region (the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirin_Macedonia_251f.html" title="Pirin Macedonia">Pirin Macedonia</a> in Bulgaria) do not have the right to be included in the region. Consequently, he insists that the article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographic_history_of_Macedonia_e8ec.html" title="Demographic history of Macedonia">Demographic history of Macedonia</a> should include only information about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Macedonia_f584.html" title="Greek Macedonia">Greek Macedonia</a> and generally about the Greeks in Macedonia and wants to drop most of the material about other nationalities in the region. Again consequently, the settlement of Slavs and a branch of the Bulgars in Macedonia in the 6th and the 7th century, the descendants of which are the modern Macedonian Slavs and the Bulgarians, is not a settlement but only a "temporary invasion". He has quoted sources only about one of the changes he has made - the statistics of Hilmi Pasha, Amadore Virgilli and Golts - whereas the other ones are substantiated by statements that Macedonia is only the territory of Ancient <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> (i.e. Greek Macedonia) and by allusions to football matches. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> July 5, 2005 07:06 (UTC)</p>

Miskin claims that he was blocked unfairly (i.e. unilaterally), and that after 30 hours his block is still in effect. Can somebody check this out? see <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html#Abuse" title="User talk:Dbachmann">User_talk:Dbachmann#Abuse</a>. For the purposes of 3RR, it doesn't matter if he is a "jingoist fantastic".

<li>Welcome to Wikipedia! Thanks for reporting this. Vandalism to articles is a common occurence. If you spot it, the best thing to do is to access an earlier version through the "history" tab, click "edit this page" and save. That will revert the vandalized version to an earlier version. If the vandalism to an article is <i>really</i> out of hand (constant, and repeated), you can request that it be protected at <a href="../../../r/p/p/WP%7ERPP_5127.html" title="WP:RPP">WP:RPP</a>, but for articles regarding a current event, such as this one, protection is unlikely to be granted for more than a few minutes. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 5 July 2005 13:22 (UTC)</li>

<p>This user, who has used many different IPs and userids, has spent a couple of months trying to force some text into the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> article against a strong consensus. Having not gotten his way there, he has targetted me and a couple of other editors, making many personal comments about their alleged ethnicities and political beliefs. He is now reverting me apparently solely for the purpose of reverting me, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashkenazi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18196095" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashkenazi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18196095" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<p>I guess we can see where your POV is. However, a NPOV editor is not "first and foremost" anything, and definitely not "trolling" or an "idiot" (unless you say so?).

<p>Yes, it's the same editor. He uses Ameritech Electronic Commerce in the 69.xxx range, where xxx is a number between 209 and 222.

<dd>I was just going through my talk-page history to find some of the comments. I remember he got pretty abusive, and I think I blocked him for it, as did several others, and he did eventually get fed up and stayed away for awhile. The arbcom could ban him, but he'll still be able to come back. I wonder whether it would make more sense just to keep blocking him until he gets bored again. He's made no useful edits that I'm aware of.

<dd>Yah. The mostly-now-archived discussion started back on May 2, when I removed a change the anon had made and explained why. From the very start, many editors have tried to get this guy to understand both the correctness of my deletion of his edit (which, certainly, is a fair subject for discussion), as well as the consensus nature of article development on Wikipedia. The anon seems to believe that pointing out that he's on the short side of an overwhelming majority of editors (some long-time editors of the article, others brought in through <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>) is a personal attack; that he's right and everyone else is wrong and therefore his change must go in; etc, etc. We've done all the recommended conflict resolution steps; a survey is running right now at <a href="../../../a/p/a/Talk%7EApartheid_4806.html" title="Talk:Apartheid">Talk:Apartheid</a>, but it's pretty clear that the anon will not abide by the findings of the survey. Everyking is wrong here; we've given this guy lots of opportunity, many of us have tried to explain our positions -- but he explicitly discards any arguments he disagrees with, and states his own position over and over again. Someone else referred to it as crapflooding; I don't think it's really that -- I don't get a sense that the guy is trolling. But we're pretty frustrated. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 5 July 2005 22:32 (UTC)

None of his (I'm going to now go ahead and assume the anon is a guy, henceforth, because without wanting to sound too incredibly sexist, I've never met a woman who's so pig-headed as this anon, when it comes to this kind of issue) arguments have changed from day one of the discussion, even after (literally) dozens of refutations of each and every single point he tries to make to back the purported legitimacy of his edit. This has long since spread from <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> to other articles, mostly related to Israel, where he has engaged in the same unproductive activities: making unsupportable claims and additions to articles that clearly back some POV, then making personal attacks and wild accusations on the talk pages.

<dd>This is a serious and ongoing problem. Everyking's comments are useless. It is he who, his claims to the contrary notwithstanding, is jumping to utterly unsupportable conclusions. My conclusion: Everyking monitors this page all day long, which is why he has so little time to investigate the problems he so flagrantly and uninformedly comments on, all day long. Nothing he has said thus far in this discussion (nor in any other in which I've seen him involved today) is even remotely relevant, and not worthy of a split second's regard. If he thinks he doesn't jump to conclusions, then I have to jump to the conclusion that he simply doesn't think at all. That said, David Gerard is correct. If Everyking's silly suggestion that this should be brought to ArbCom were actually followed, ArbCom would probably ban everyone for a week. This is a clearcut case of violation of at least a dozen WP policies. This troll's edits need to be reverted on sight. Jayjg and SlimVirgin both blocked him today, Jayjg did so on, I believe he said 19 IP addresses and sockpuppets before Jay believed he'd quit for the night, after he'd told him that he was going to take 24 hours "off" whether he liked it or not.

<dd>There's trolling and trolling. And I'm sure some admins would be quite willing to ban you, if it weren't for the predictable backlash that would follow. If you want a ban, you know how to get it.</dd>
<dd>Bottom line: you can't have an account named "involved in trolling" and go troll. If you can't do anything productive (defined in the narrow, boring, representing-the-sum-of-all-human-knowledge sense), you've got no place being on Wikipedia, and we're not required to accommodate you. If you <i>can</i> do something productive, you've got a ton of slack right there. Despite moans to the contrary and admittedly some notable and regretful exceptions, Wikipedia is still a very accommodating place. Especially if you take the size of its user base into account. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 6 July 2005 22:22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but keep in mind that Wikipedia is not (primarily) a social experiment. Is someone with a username of "involved in trolling" supposed to become a productive Wikipedian? Is using "involved in trolling" as your primary handle something that should be taken in good faith? I'm not saying blocking the account was necessary, but I find it rather hard to argue it's principally wrong too. (Except for the IP autoblocker; I wish we could turn that on and off as necessary. I'd like this <i>account name</i> to be banned, but not the user behind it.) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 6 July 2005 22:55 (UTC)

<dd>I think a case can be made that it's best to let a troll edit under a "troll" name, so we know what we're dealing with. Furthermore I'm skeptical of the idea that a troll can't be a productive Wikipedian; SPUI seems productive, after all. I don't know a lot about trolling as a phenomenon, but I see two different kinds: the really obnoxious kinds, with the "shock" images, and the ones who like to edit policy pages and act as voices of dissent. I'm all for booting the former out the door but I think the latter can have a useful role to play, provided they keep it moderate. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 6 July 2005 23:05 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As with regards to SPUI, be careful to distinguish trolling as an activity and trolling as a vocation, or primary purpose. I think many experienced Wikipedians can be said to have trolled, however moderate and minor; every bit of irony you secretly hope some dim-witted person to take literally and embarrass themselves over is technically a troll. Playing <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a> honestly (the way you often do, for example) is something you can still do more productively under a non-flammable account name. I'll admit there is often a thin line between clever criticism, deliberately provocative statements intended to zenslap people, and outright looking for trouble in all the wrong places, but any way you cut it, getting off on a good start by establishing you at least share the goals of Wikipedians seems to be a good idea. I don't think anyone expects a brand new account named "involved in trolling" to do that; even if it's just going to "offend those people who should be offended", to paraphrase John Cleese, it's still time wasted. Really, if your sole intent is really to troll and nothing but, you shouldn't be doing it here, whether you're being honest about it or not. The only reason I can think of to pick a username like that is to meta-troll: make the administrators look foolish by being so anal over an account name when they should only be evaluating edits. It's a nice idea, but it's been done, and it doesn't work. Or alternatively: anyone you want to make that point to has been convinced one way or the other, so go find a more useful way of expressing yourself. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 6 July 2005 23:33 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, to be fair, it still works. All the troll needs to do to get someone in a froth (and to generate discussion) is use troll in their username. You'd think we'd learn to simply ignore it and, as you say, judge the edits, but there's always someone who thinks that it's of vital importance to creating an encyclopaedia that they aren't confronted with the word "troll". -- Grace Note</dd>

How does this fit in with Neto's ArbCom restriction? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 5, 2005 21:43 (UTC)</p>

<p>While Radiant's "admin abuses" are not extensive, he has made a few questionable decisions in the past few days, including editing a protected page to participate in the dispute for which it was protected, using sysop rollback in a content dispute, and blocking Netoholic, his adversary in the dispute, without discussing the matter with his mentors. (See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Merge&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Merge&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">Template:Merge</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html#.22Merge.22_template_voting" title="User talk:Radiant!">my notes</a> on his talk page.) He was kind enough to explain to me his reasoning in the matter (see <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html#.22Merge.22_template_voting" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">here</a>), though I can't really see where Netoholic's arbitration injunctions give administrators license to violate both the protection and blocking policies in such an egregious manner. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 5 July 2005 23:34 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Based on the comments Rdsmith4 linked to, assuming Radiant is factually correct that netiher Raul nor Grunt have been active as mentors, I think Radiant is outside of policy but inside of sanity. The fact that Netoholic drove off the one mentor who was actually doing anything and the other two are too busy to deal with him does not actually give him the right to behave in the manner that got him into trouble in the first place. If Radiant is dealing with a clear and present issue, I'm at least inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt on the policy questions. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> July 6, 2005 00:46 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>In explanation... around June 21st, I asked on Grunt's and Raul's talk pages whether Neto's mentorship was still ongoing. They never responded to that (Kim did, though). Some issues came up during that time, and they didn't respond to that either; and Kim claims (on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_945d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration</a>) that he has been mentoring mostly on his own for the past couple of months. I felt somewhat uncomfortable taking only Neto's word for it that the mentorship was in function. If they have become active once more, that would be a good thing.</li>
<li>Regarding the block/protect issue Dan mentioned above - the content dispute is actually between Netoholic and Lifeisunfair, who have been revert warring about a number of templates. Consensus seems to lie on LIU's side, as indicated on the talk pages. I do believe revert warring is considered harmful even if people technically stay below the 3RR level. What I did at the time was 1) revert from Neto's version to what I perceived to be the consensual version, and 2) block him. I was unaware at the time that, out of the three templates involved in the edit war, one had been protected by Violetriga. I suppose that reverting <i>or</i> blocking would have been appropriate, but doing both is a bit too harsh.</li>
<li>Neto is taking it personal, but it really isn't. It is simply that I perceive him acting in precisely the manner that got him RFAred in the first place (e.g. disruption to prove a point, incivility, and revert warring over templates) - even after repeatedly asked not to by several people, and an earlier block by Kim. It would be preferable if the mentors had stepped in, but since I had informed them and they hadn't responded, I didn't see the point of being more lenient to a user under mentorship than to any other user. I should also point out that revert warring on e.g. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">Template:Mergeto</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/l/Template%7ESplit_40bf.html" title="Template:Split">Template:Split</a> seems to be ongoing. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 6, 2005 09:39 (UTC)</li>
