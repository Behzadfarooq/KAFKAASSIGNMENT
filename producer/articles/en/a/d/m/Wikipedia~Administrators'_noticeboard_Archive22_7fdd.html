<p>These sort of questoins should be directed to the talk page of the article in question.... and were, and were answered there... the things you listed above are unverified, original research and biased. You can;t just assume rural people will shoot people and then try to justify that as a rationalization for why you think nobody hoaxes Bigfoot sightings, as that's a non-sequitar and wholly inappropriate. It's bad enough that you ignored explanations on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBigfoot_ef17.html" title="Talk:Bigfoot">Talk:Bigfoot</a> and also my talk page (until I had to tell you to stop posting there for filling it up with the same questions and comments you already put on Talk:Bigfoot), but you shouldn;t be putting that kind of stuff here also. Stop wasting everyone's time with the same questions you didn;t pay attention to the answers to the first time around on. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:53, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not certain why this was removed. According to the guidelines, significant deaths should be included. This is an <i>extremely</i> significant death in Australia.

<dd>OK, that was a pretty stupid thing for me to say. However, the whole rule that notable people who die should not be listed is pretty stupid, really.

<dd>It <i>does</i> look, in this specific instance, to be a good faith "no obit" revert. That said, I agree with what you struck out — that is, I agree with what you said, and I also think it was pretty petulant and you were right to strike it out&#160;:-). I wasn't aware of any "no obit" rule (given that I don't pay much attention to ITN, except to complain occasionally), but it's quite reasonable to have one. However, we've all seen extremely minor incidents in the USA given "airplay" while events of great importance elsewhere in the world were kept off the front page, and at first blush this looked like yet another case.

<p>I cannot find how to go about deleting a particular edit of an article, though I believe I've seen policy that says it's justified in this case; an anonymous editor posted what is purported to be a celebrity's personal cellphone number. It's been reverted but should not stay in the database and edit history, IMHO. Even if it's not really the number of the person it purports to be – it could be a prank to harass a third party with a lot of calls. If it's agreed here that it is justified to remove the edit, and if this is something that an admin can do instead of needing a bureaucrat or higher, I'll do it if pointed to the procedure; I'd just as soon not publicize the page and therefore the phone number here. —&#160;<a href="../../../k/b/h/User%7EKbh3rd_5810.html" title="User:Kbh3rd">Kbh3<sup>rd</sup></a><a href="../../../k/b/h/User_talk%7EKbh3rd_3576.html" title="User talk:Kbh3rd"><font style="font-size:.7em;">talk</font></a> 20:04, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, as Ulster includes the entire Northern Ireland. Historically, though, there were unionists in the rest of Ireland, though they are now a tiny tiny minority. However, the point is that "Ulster Unionist" is a name of a political party, and is never used as the name of the generic movement, and DUP supporters would find the term strongly objectionable.

<p>Not sure if this is the right place to put this, but an administrator may want to take a look at this page. There have been several edits to this page blanking it or requesting it be taken down by the supposed parent of the child/the the person themseves saying Wikipedia doesn't have the right to have a page on her because she is a minor. I am no expert in law (yet), but as far as I know the info on her page qualifies her as a public figure which means it is perfectly acceptable to have a page on it, but someone should look at it nonetheless. An example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julianna_Rose_Mauriello&amp;oldid=32836922" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julianna_Rose_Mauriello&amp;oldid=32836922" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julianna_Rose_Mauriello&amp;oldid=24698349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julianna_Rose_Mauriello&amp;oldid=24698349" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. I think the second link is probably vandalism but the first looks like the user has made some helpful contributions which is the only reason that makes me think they might be serious. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:25, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, I didn't notice that. I don't know if she qualifies as notable enough for an article either, I wouldn't be opposed to it being deleted via NN. I'd say it's borderline.

<dd>I'd like to see a comment from anyone at Wikimedia Foundation as to whether they have indeed received any legal documents regarding this, or comment from one of our lawyer admins as to their interpretation (assuming there are indeed such laws). The page can be rewritten to avoid copyvio, if consensus holds that it is a notable subject (if brought to afd), but until we have someone from either of my two cases above commenting I'd say the article stays...and that blankings should be treated as vandalism. I'd put a note on the talk page though reminding blankers not to blank. My armchair interpretation is that a minor who has starred in broadway plays and on tv is a public figure. Her name obviously appears on playbills for the play, and a name is quite different than personal information like address, SSN, or whatever. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 14:17, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">User:Bobblewik</a> has spent the last few days engaging in a rather prodigious one-$GENDER_SIGNIFIER crusade against years (and related items) which are wikilinked. I noticed this this morning when he/she edited <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">Beer</a> to remove all the wikilinking from years (and related items) in the article, e.g [[1067]] → 1067; [[800s]] → 800s; [[18th century]] → 18th century; etc. This change (a rather extensive one for an article the size of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">Beer</a>) was flagged as a "minor" edit, and was accompanied by the wholly misleading edit summary "AWB Assisted cleanup". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beer&amp;diff=32824308&amp;oldid=32687345" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beer&amp;diff=32824308&amp;oldid=32687345" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

As near as I can tell, a significant chunk (and possibly even a majority) of the last 5000 edits (at least — I stopped counting after clicking "Next 500" 10 or so times) from this user involves imposing his/her particular view of what constitutes "overlinking" onto a plethora of articles.</p>
<p>The user is a long-term contributor, so I'm pretty firmly convinced that a block of any kind would be unreasonable, especially for such a nebulous infraction. But, on the other hand, this crusade to de-link years (and months and days) from articles seems to be a very close cousin to similar style crusades we've seen elsewhere, e.g. the ongoing footnote format shitfest between SEWilco and William McConnelly, or the ongoing BCE/CE vs. BC/AD contretemps.

<dd>It's a tricky question, and surely one that it would be "better" to have policy on than to arbitrarily change articles over. That being said, some of our articles <i>are</i> overly wikilinked, particularly to dates. The style rule I remember reading, which seems to be not honored, generally, is that one should only wikilink a year if it would be appropriate (and encyclopedic) for the given article to appear in the list of events that happened in that year. So it would make sense for <a href="../../../1/0/6/1066.html" title="1066">1066</a> to be wikilinked in the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> article, but not to link it in the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">Beer</a> article in a sentence like "...and in 1066, William the Conqueror drank a pint of beer to celebrate his victory." <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One problem is that editors tend to overlink single years in an article. This leads to clutter and makes the relevant links stand out less. I agree with the Manual of Style, which states (about single years) "<i>Generally, do not link, unless they will clearly help the reader to understand the topic.</i>" <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I note that when you reverted his changes User:ClockworkSoul reverted back to him, which you then promptly reverted again, and as he is following guidlines, in my book that makes you the style crusader. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:07, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Linking single years was standard style for a long time, well before user date-preferences appeared, and in fact was one argument for keeping "number" articles as referring to years (rather than the numbers themselves). The idea was probably to evenually allow the collection of some kind of meta-data /year indexing. I've no idea when the changes to the MoS were made that depreciated this, but I for one didn't know the changes were made, and have been following the old style. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBob_cf29.html" title="User:DrBob">Bob Mellish</a> 16:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I remember seeing someone put in the dates into the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_2000.html" title="Windows 2000">Windows 2000</a> article, and they looked bloody awful, and almost killed the flow of text. IMO, it is worse to put in the user defined dates than it is to wikilinks dates! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:11, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I also support the removal of linked stand-alone months and years, because they're pointless (like wikifying <a href="../../../t/h/e/The.html" title="The">the</a>), and the overwikification makes pages hard to read. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:18, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a few things to clean up here. Firstly, Bobblewik is not actually removing them himself, he's using a bot to do it. And because it's an automated procedure, it removes wikilinked dates which are in useful places, such as in image captions, and in list tables. The dates there are highly relevant to the section and shouldn't be removed. I fail to see how it compares at all to wikifying the word "the". That is absolutely a straw man. No one's arguing to wikify every single word in a sentence, so please don't try and pidgeonhole people's comments in a box that small.</p>
<p>I'm also interested how overwikification makes pages hard to read. As far as I can tell links appear in blue rather than black if they are linked. This is a contextual encyclopedia taking advantage of the entire point of the web - links! If you don't like the way the links appear, maybe you should change your preferences. It's better to overlink than underlink in a website like this. I hate it when I'm reading a paragraph which is expanding on a point mentioned earlier and nothing is linked because someone has argued that it's "already been linked" a couple of screens up, so I can't go and get context about a concept. Remember, this is an encyclopedia for the readers' benefit - if we provide context, it helps more than if we don't.</p>
<p>Removing excess wikilinks from overlinked text is fine. But it's not something which should be automated, and I can't imagine that Bobblewik is spending time making sure that the bot he's using is not removing links where having it is useful at the rate his edits are being made. Spending time "enforcing" the Manual of Style's suggestions on date linking seems to me to be a complete waste with little benefit and there are lots more important things to help out with. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 03:53, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have read some of the above and with the differing of opinions I think he should be asked to stop for the time being at least. I am worried about removing links from succession boxes, the ( ) containing a person's birth, image captions and other offset places like those. Those places don't ruin the flow of the article and the links have use. If we can assure that those won't be removed I'd be happy but I think before anyone starts wholesale change it needs more discussion. Like with British English vs. American English words an article should stay as it was originally created until a fully explanatory policy is made. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 04:35, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well there is a policy which bobblewik is following, but it is fair enough to re-affirm it I suppose. If you see <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#Bot_permission_please.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia_talk:Bots#Bot_permission_please?</a> where bobblewik has asked for a bot to do the job, there is strong support for the task to be automated, and all but a couple who opposed this (including myself) only did so on the basis that it should not be totally automated. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 11:09, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I suggested before, it might be useful to divide complaints into those about:
<ul>
<li>Manual of Style guidance</li>
<li>edits consistent with the Manual of Style.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>For example, Talrias complained about the removal of spaces in headings. He also suggested that dates in captions must have links. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> suggests that links are required in succession boxes and birthdates. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a> describes a scenario involving the euro and "1999" although it is not clear if this was relevant to the article, perhaps the suggestion is that there is insufficient understanding of the term 'relevance' in the Manual. These are all plausible criticisms of conventions used and promoted by the Manual of Style. There are many editors that act in accordance with the Manual of Style. If the Manual is changed, I am sure their actions would change accordingly. The talk page of the Manual of Style is the place to debate such things. I don't know why we are debating it here. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 18:51, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose, then, that you're saying the mere fact of the dispute indicts both participants equally.

<dd>I'm saying you're wasting our time pursuing this, and that it doesn't matter who started it. Equal penalties exist for equal offenses, and unequal penalties for unequal offenses. This in no way implies that ignoring who started what automatically makes the offenses commited in the exchange equal.

<p>I have received a number of messages from Admins and legal experts on the German Wikipedia warning me that the English Wikipedia is potentially violating German copyright laws with a number of its images and photographs. We have an automatically inserted Template (Template:GermanGov) that is currently undergoing a minor revert war about its language. The German users also argue that any images that do not clearly fall into the public domain should be probably be deleted. Many of these images come from the Nazi era and have some important utility however -- Nazi propaganda, WW2 photographs, and there may be different interpretations about the legal use of these materials in the United States and other countries. This seems like an important long-term issue that should be resolved (and perhaps a precedent has already been made and forgotten). <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 20:16, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

If this is a question of policy, I don't think we on the en wikipedia need to comply with the very specific restrictions in gernan law. Many of the images described above probably qualify for fair-use under US law, some may be PD. Of courxe, this must be considered case-by-case. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:25, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's why it needs to be established that each work is actually public domain in the United States. This hasn't been done in this case. This is different from some of the exceptions and issues we are familiar with regarding written work because many of these photos are only 60 years old. And no one is suggesting that every work by the German government is public domain in the United States if it is not in Germany. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 22:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's the point. You can't treat the rights of german people by using US-law on that.

<p>The template says that there are pictures which are Public Domain according German Law. Right? We deny that there is really a single picture which falls under this exception.

<dd>I second that. If you want to keep the pictures because they are PD or fair use according to US law, then tag them accordingly, but don't claim they are PD according to German law, because they are not. The current text in the template is a travesty - first it says this is a copyrighted picture, then it goes on to cite § 5 (2) UrhG, which says that Amtliche Werke (official works) are not copyrighted, but gemeinfrei (in the Public Domain). --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 09:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apologies if this is the wrong page for this. I'd been having a fairly heated discussion on the France:talk page with this guy (about whether or not France won WWII), only to find that he'd gone to a page I've contributed heavily to (Kosovo) and reverted a whole load of revisions, referring to them as vandalism (check out the Kosovo:history page). The discussion section on his user page seems to sum up his approach. Thanks for listening! JDancer 00:46, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

As long as their are people like yourself, their will always be genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. I have no respect for you and your ilk. None.

If a user makes a PA or an uncivil comment, then you give him/her a level 1 warning. If he/she makes another then he/she is given a level 2 warning and so on. If he/she makes PAs or uncivil comments after the fourth warning, then he/she can be blocked for up to, say, 12 hours. The problem is how to define a PA or an uncivil comment.

<dd>Test templates are fine for edits that only affect an article. If someone add "<i>Bush is a idiot!</i>" to an article, a warning is entirely appropriate. However, when edits are aimed at <i>editors</i>, this is far more serious and requires immediate attention. Personal attacks are disruptive and may lead to blocks without warning. Depending on the severity of the personal attack, a block ranging from 3 - 72 hours might be warranted. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:37, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personal attacks are almost always disruptive and thus have policy basis for blocking. Most of the time an attack is mild enough that a warning will suffice, but some personal attacks are so offensive that the user is blocked immediately (as in the case of TravB). With 700+ admins, abuse of the blocking policy will be noticed very quickly. Should any admin believe that the block shouldn't have been placed, they can unblock (although it's usually polite to discuss with the blocking admin first). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:51, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As above, I did it mainly because they were high-profile pages.

<li>I think preemptively protecting them is a good idea. Most editorial templates (as opposed to series boxen, for instance) do not require a lot of editing ever. Protecting them prevents 1) server load whenever someone modifies them, and 2) the possibility that we get a <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">template vandal</a> at some point. The Wiki standard that everything must be mutable applies primarily to <i>articles</i>, and less so to meta-pages. I believe most templates aren't watchlisted very much, judged by the fact that the average template <i>talk page</i> never yields a response to queries. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:09, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As above... no, this isn't contemplated under semi-protection policy. However, it isn't contemplated under protection policy either. I can't imagine that people who are skittish about 'restriction of editing' would prefer the current 'admins only' situation to 'admins and users who have been registered a few days'. I'm not advocating switching the main page from protection to semi-protection, but there are plenty of other pages where this would be appropriate. Unprotecting them in full might also be appropriate for many. On meta-templates... I'd actually like to see alot of these unprotected so they can be worked on. We've got a directive to reduce the usage of them, but now they are protected... which prevents 99.99% of the people who might make the necessary adjustments from doing so. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I fully agree with Radiant, this is a good idea and I've actually protected a number of high visibility templates myself (mainly the "test" templates). If a template rarely changes and is present on hundreds or thousands of pages, it's quite reasonable and prudent to limit editing. Even protected templates can still being edited by 700+ admins, so it's not as if they can't be updated when necessary. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:25, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If posible Protection should never be used unless absolutely necesary, lots of protected pages snould be semi protected so they are editable. There is nothing wrong with that. Furthermore we should semi-protect pages such as language templates as its not like they are going to change. Templates are not subject to change, much --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 13:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You should never fully protect an article or template except in extreme circumstances. I think it would be much better to, if some form of permanent protection is desired, semi-protect these pages. This at least allows non-admins to work on them, and only rejects the group most likely to vandalize (anonymous users and new users). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 13:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>For an article, it's true that protection shouldn't be used unless necessary. However, we're talking about templates here, especially highly visible ones. Vandalism on one article only affects that article. Vandalism on a template can affect thousands of pages. This type of vandalism can also be much more difficult to identify. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:38, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Templates that were likely created by non-admins, and that now fully protected, can only be improved upon by full admins. I think semi-protection of these high visibility templates makes a lot more sense; it forces a would-be vandal to sign up, and then makes it easier to block them (no issues with dynamic IP's unless the vandal wants to sign up a new account).

<li>No one is suggesting that we protect <i>all</i> templates, just ones that are highly visible and seldom changed. Anything that can affect thousands of other pages should only be edited by trusted users (ie. admins). Any changes to these templates should be discussed, so there's no reason why a non-admin would need to make the actual edit. Semi-protection is insufficient because it allows non-trusted users to edit what are essentially "system administration" pages. I'm just having a hard time seeing <i>why</i> some users think these templates need to be open to editing by almost everyone. The "open" part of the tagline refers to the actual encyclopedia (article namespace), not every single mechanism that's used to keep Wikipedia running. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 14:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Changes to high profile templates should <i>always</i> be discussed first, so it is really academic whether a non admin can make any changes that are agreed upon. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 14:27, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is the key point to me, so I'm fine with protecting all high profile (by any reasonable definition) templates so they can't be used to cause problems.

<p>(pulling back all the levels of indent) While I think it is academic really (like WHK said, these templates have mostly been untouched), I don't see why this cannot be covered using existing watchlists (after all, you don't often see a template appear on the recent changes list, I'm sure people would inspect it pretty quickly). <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 14:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>High profile templates should be on watchlists and should be protected so that users can see discussions on the template talk pages. Since all changes should be discussed and there over 700 admins, there's really no reason why <i>all</i> users need to be able to edit high profile templates. On the other hand, there's several reason why these templates <i>should</i> be protected. It eliminates vandalism, prevents inexperienced users from making a harmful (but well intentioned) edits and encourages discussion (non-admins <i>have</i> to discuss and admins get the "protected page" warning). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 14:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm of the opinion that, especially for templates with a high rate of use, any changes should follow the path <i>sandbox → talk page → actual edit</i>. Thus I'd support semi-protection of templates used on more than <i>N</i> pages, and full-protection for all meta-templates. This would considerably reduce the incidence of edit warring, database locks, and "broken" coding. I don't agree with the statement "permanantly protected = should be deleted". Meta-templates like {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/w/i/Template%7ESwitch_9056.html" title="Template:Switch">switch</a>}} for example, would ideally be built-in features. Perhaps &lt;noinclude&gt; and &lt;includeonly&gt; could, in some distant future, be expanded to &lt;includeif ...&gt; etc. or maybe I'm just dreaming. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>09:33, Jan. 1, 2006</small></dd>

<p>In the case of meta-templates, this should be seen as a stopgap measure while we deprecate them. Vandalizing these templates - and by vandalizing I mean changing in any way - is likely to cause a brief database lock. For this reason, they ought be protected. Because they ought be protected, they ought be deleted, because the nature of Wikipedia is that we don't like creating pages that we absolutely have to permanantly protect. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:15, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Frankly, I think a lot of these comments miss the point. Perhaps it's okay to protect meta-templates preemptively, but look at the list. These are stub templates and cleanup templates. Honestly, I was kind of irritated when I saw that huge accmulation of protected templates a while ago too, but I didn't realize they had all been protected so recently in one go. That's senseless. Most vandals wouldn't know how to find them, and if they could, the chances of them finding a particular one of out of 100+ is so slim. Let's say I look at the histories of 4 random templates there, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cleanup-date&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cleanup-date&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Promophoto&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Promophoto&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Corp-stub&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Corp-stub&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Deathyr&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Deathyr&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, (this is true, these are the first ones I randomly picked), I find that the last edit before protection in each of them was a productive <i>non-admin</i> one. And I see almost no vandalism in those for histories at all. The fact that {{<a href="../../../o/p/e/Template%7EOpentask_f2ed.html" title="Template:Opentask">opentask</a>}} was protected, which is regularly updated by non-admins (I used to do it before I was one, too), makes me think this was done blindly. I'm all for unprotection of most of them. Not that I'm saying we should unprotect blindly either, because some of them should surely remain protected, but not most of them. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:37, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly. Stub templates and cleanup templates are (1) frequently used, and (2) hardly ever changed. Any changes, as indicated before, should (1) be discussed first, and (2) if implemented will invalidate a large amount of page cache. I'm glad to hear we haven't had a template vandal <i>yet</i>, but nobody ever thought of large-scale page move vandalism either before we met Willy. And template vandalism would be less annoying to clean up, but far more straining on the server. Even a well-meaning newbie that changes the layout on a bunch of templates causes database strain. Hence, it makes perfect sense to protect just about any template that is <i>editorial</i> (e.g. "cleanup") rather than <i>content</i> (e.g. series boxen). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe something of a precedent, although not exactly the same thing: In <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template_talk%7EUser_en_5257.html#Protected" title="Template talk:User en">this discussion</a>, we talked about protecting the highly-visible templates of the Babel project. Obviously, we were faced with the same dilemma of whether or not to protect anything preemptively on Wikipedia. We settled for the compromise of protecting immediately the en templates, which were by far the most visible and which had already been vandalized before. As for the others, they were to be protected only when/if they were attacked at least once. On this particular instance, my vote would be for semi-protection. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:34, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you and many editors seem to be forgetting is that thanks to the extremist editors involved in the project, the useful semi-protection feature can only be used temporarily and never as a preventive measure. So you should simply disregard the existance of this feature 99% of time. Would it be a good solution to this issue? Yes. Are we able to use it in this manner without having desysop motions started against us? Not really. --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 02:03, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps I've gone a bit paranoid, but I've been thinking about the relationship between the accounts PeterZed (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeterZed_af4e.html" title="User talk:PeterZed">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PeterZed_e8a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/PeterZed">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelebritySecurity_36b2.html" title="User talk:CelebritySecurity">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CelebritySecurity_9830.html" title="Special:Contributions/CelebritySecurity">contribs</a>). This is what I noticed so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both accounts use the userbox {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_HigherStandards_feb6.html" title="Template:User HigherStandards">User HigherStandards</a>}}. This alone means nothing, but is what made me start looking.</li>
<li>The PeterZed account first edited at 21 August 2005, and after three edits (that I can find, Kate's tool seems to be broken again) on that day disappeared until recently.</li>
<li>CelebritySecurity started editing at 1 December 2005 and edited somewhat irregularly from then on. There is a four-day gap starting at 23:36, 26 December 2005.</li>
<li>PeterZed started editing again at 28 December 2005, in the middle of the four-day gap of CelebritySecurity's editing.</li>
<li>There's a little less than three hour gap on PeterZed's editing, from 00:10, 30 December 2005 to 02:56, 30 December 2005. Fitting <i>exactly</i> within that gap, CelebritySecurity edited once more (from 00:18, 30 December 2005 to 02:13, 30 December 2005). These are the <i>only</i> edits from CelebritySecurity since PeterZed started editing again on the 28th.</li>
<li>Both accounts use identical edit summaries when creating new templates ("creation").</li>
<li>Both accounts have somewhat similar interests (as can be seen by their wikiprojects).</li>
</ul>
<p>I know it is a <i>very</i> weak set of evidence (if it can even be called that), but I would like for more experienced admins to take a look. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:35, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's my opinion (I'm copy and pasting this everywhere...)</dd>
<dd>SlimVirgin asked me to look into this issue as an uninvolved party and offer my opinion. Without getting in to the specific merits of whether or not I personally think the page "should" have been renamed, I think this is a case of biting the oldies. Page moves are typically doable by anyone, and the 60% guideline on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> is phrased somewhat loosely. The whole point is that if you end up on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, the move is controversial. The stakes are, frankly, low here — the substance of the article is unchanged — and getting worked up over a few percent one way or the other seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees. It seems wrong to me that we should give an admin less discretion in deciding how to close a page move discussion than we do when closing an article deletion discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think Marudubshinki should be encouraged to close out the discussion however he thinks appropriate, and people should be encouraged to redirect their energy into improving the article and making sure it stays properly focused, rather than fretting over the semiotics of whether or not a parenthesized word appears in the article title.</dd>

<dd>No, it's not a mirror image. For instance, blocks last as long as was specified by the admin, autoblocks last always 24 hours. Usually, when an admin unblocks a user, he also looks for associated autoblocks and remove them. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 20:47, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>edit conflict - It is an automated process. When we block a user, we don't have to do anything further to unblock them when the time is up. I assume its something as simple as checking whether the current time is later than the block flag in the user database. So... I don't have an explanation as to why it didn't autounblock the ip when the user went off block. Perhaps someone with more understanding of the software can explain better how it could happen, and/or point out where we can document this for investigation by the developers in case it is a bug. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reason probably was because the autoblock is always for 24 hours, even if the user only has 5 minutes left on his block. It's a known "feature". --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 20:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Those rules don't really account for the level of fraud that was occurring here, though, and so I've decided to be bold. If the consensus here is that I've overstepped my bounds, I won't object to it being put back the way it was. But I would claim that when fraud like this happens, we have a duty to act swiftly to make things right. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:14, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Talk pages are being used to make jokes about and poke fun at and make sarcastic little quips about Christians, Creationists, and people who believe in Intelligent design. All that is needed is an enforcement of policy, particularily with respect to <a href="../../../e/q/_/WP%7EEQ_4006.html" title="WP:EQ">WP:EQ</a>, <a href="../../../t/p/_/WP%7ETP_b480.html" title="WP:TP">WP:TP</a>, <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">WP:TPG</a>, <a href="../../../r/h/e/Wikipedia%7ERhetoric_98b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Rhetoric">Wikipedia:Rhetoric</a>. No need to get involved in the discussion. I have tried to do it myself, but have been faced with accusations I'm "playing wiki-cop" and absurd rationalizations of their behaviour. I also think some people there are <i>really</i> bending the truth when confronted with their antagonism and passive-aggressive attacks and insults.</p>
<p>For example, a comment about one pro-ID editor which noted how he frequently edited the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicles_of_Narnia_1131.html" title="Chronicles of Narnia">Chronicles of Narnia</a> page (on the Internet it is a hot-point in cultural religious controversy), was met with another user's sarcastic response "Onward Christian Soldiers." When I pointed out that this was inappropriate, another user explained how "The 'onward christian soldiers' comment, to me, was a general call to action, though I understand that you could feel it was pejorative and over the line." and "In my frame of reference, 'onward christian soldiers' has never had any specific connotations. I have never heard the phrase to mean anything negative or offensive, and have always seen it as a cute way to edge people on. Onward .. Charge .. Arriba arriba .. So forgive if I am that naive <i>[ed. note I called him naive for his first comment]</i>, but when I initially read the comment I didn't see anything wrong with it, and didn't respond." Now, a very small number of you may not get the joke if you are unfamiliar with religious controversy, though its use as a pejorative is pretty obvious in the context, which even this user admitted. It is an extremely common joke to call pro-ID people, and indeed the entire "religious right," "Christian Soldiers" as a pejorative <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=site%3Aforums.fark.com+%22christian+soldiers%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=site%3Aforums.fark.com+%22christian+soldiers%22" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, and anyone familiar with the controversy knows this (See the first result in a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22onward+christian+soldiers%22+%22intelligent+design%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22onward+christian+soldiers%22+%22intelligent+design%22" rel="nofollow">"onward Christian soldiers" "intelligent design"</a>). This is the sort of thing that goes on on that page.</p>
<p>There are 4 admins who frequent the talk pages, Duncharris, RoyBoy, FeloniousMonk, Guettarda, and occassionally a 5th, SlimVirgin. None so much as mentions anything to these people. In fact, these admins are actually quite frequently the perpetrators. The editor who was called a "Christian Soldier" said the ID article had an atheistic slant. He was immediately pounced upon by these admins as making a "religious attack" and was threatened with a block.</p>
<p>The caustic sarcasm, jokes, and insults and attacks are getting out of control, and the users frequently "play dumb" and pretend they did not mean any offense. Granted, communication in a text-medium can be dodgy at times, but anyone remotely familiar with this style of flamewar/USENET discourse will know <i>exactly</i> what these users are up to when they say things like "Onward Christian Soldiers" or start a discussion on whether or not one can "Sue God" (currently on the Talk Page). If you think you can help, please just jump right in, but I hope you have a law degree or something because these people are extremely good at hiding their intentions--as indicated recently in an RFC against Duncharris for constantly telling editors to "Fuck off" which was explained away by most of these same editors as "Simply telling them to leave, but using profanity. It is not a personal attack and the only thing that should happen is that he should "not get a cookie tonight." (Of course, Jimbo Wales disagreed and said he "should be de-sysopped immediately." One user on the RFC even said he thought was Jimbo was just being sarcastic when he said that.)</p>
<p>One last thing, since sadly I have come to expect this: Please do not tell me why I am wrong. If you agree, please help out. If you disagree do not tell me. I do not want to hear about it. Discuss my concerns with other admins if necessary, but not with me. I will not respond, and your only audience will be the one in front of your soapbox. Also note that one of the above admins will probably bring up my history in which I got frustrated and started simply calling these people assholes instead of playing their games and being subjected to their insults, accusations and complaints that I want to introduce bias into the article, and sarcastic remarks. I am only making a request for someone to help, I do not want to make my arguments about <i>why</i> I want someone to help the issue. Help or don't help. The only thing you need to do is fairly enforce the guidelines, policies, and help Wikipedia spirit by reminding these users when their actions are inappropriate.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 22:50, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I slogged through this rather quick and while Ben is clearly ranting, he does have legitimate concern, as the ID article is a place full of subtle and not so subtle jabs at people of various beliefs. That having been said, this is in fact a rant, and I think the vast majority of his personal accusations are off the mark.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 22:57, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems as though every time I turn around <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">User:Chooserr</a> is throwing his weight, such as it is, around, trying to browbeat editors into supporting his worldview. Spirited debate is one thing. But leaving insults about people's religion on their talk page is, for me, the straw that breaks the camel's back. It is rude, it is incivil, it is disruptive, it is absolutely unacceptable, and by God I have had enough of it. I have blocked <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">User:Chooserr</a> for a week for this edit, as part of his continuing and ongoing pattern of disruptive and incivil behavior. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 23:49, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One week seems excessive. I know he edit wars and doesn't conform to NPOV, but he wasn't aggressive or obscene. I have seen far worse comments from other people that have been left completely unrebuked. And I have noticed for some time that people are following him around Wikipedia, reverting him unnecessarily, with snide remarks,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cow_tipping&amp;diff=32335049&amp;oldid=32334886" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cow_tipping&amp;diff=32335049&amp;oldid=32334886" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, sneering at him<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32314400" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32314400" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> etc. On three occasions, when he left a message on my talk page, other people who would certainly not have had my talk page on their watchlists followed him with comments. It's late at night in Ireland, so I'm not going to hunt out diffs; I'll just say that I've noticed this going on for quite some time. I can understand that people have to revert some of his extremely POV edits, but they don't have to revert edits about cow tipping; they don't have to sneer; they don't have to be insulting; they don't have to harass him – and he has definitely been harassed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to his remark on Endomion's talk page, I don't condone it at all. It was ignorant, and unnecessary. I have already commented on it at Chooserr's talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;curid=2896746&amp;diff=32820097&amp;oldid=32819369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;curid=2896746&amp;diff=32820097&amp;oldid=32819369" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. However, to claim that it was an insult is to claim that it is bad not to be a devout Catholic. Chooserr didn't tell her she was a bad person or a horrible person; he (rudely) suggested that she was not a devout Catholic. Now, since she openly has information on her user page (that she has a girlfriend, and that she identifies herself as a "lipstick lesbian") which implies a contradiction with the teachings of the Catholic Church,<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> then she left herself open to such an opinion, though it was still completely out of line (and stupid, in my view) to voice that opinion on her talk page. But it wasn't an appalling insult, unless, as I say, we take it that not to be a devout Catholic is a very bad thing. (I'm sure lots of excellent Wikipedians are not devout Catholics.) If I had put a user box on my page saying, "this user is a vegetarian" and another saying, "this user eats meat", and someone made the comment that I hardly qualified as a committed vegetarian <i><b>but did not say that I was a bad person for eating meat</b></i>, I doubt if that person would get blocked for a week.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to make it absolutely clear that I don't condone Chooserr's remark. However, in my time on Wikipedia I have seen far worse attacks that either did not incur blocks, or got shorter ones. I have seen a lot of harassment of Chooserr, which must make it very difficult for him to contribute calmly and constructively. I don't think that leaving him blocked for a week is going to help him to be less extreme in the way he edits and interacts with others. Nandesuka, I'm not going to overrule you and unblock, but I'd like you to consider shortening the block on the grounds that Chooserr has been the target of some very nasty comments and that when people are bullied and harassed they tend to hit back, or even to hit at others. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think your analysis is not quite right: specifically, "to claim that it was an insult" is <b>not</b> "to claim that it is bad not to be a devout Catholic". The insult is to tell <i>a Catholic</i> that she <i>hardly qualifies as a devout catholic</i> on the basis of her sexuality. That's not only an insult, it's a very personal insult. ChoosErr may have the point of view that being gay is incompatible with being a devout Catholic, but he's not entitled to push that point of view by insulting Wikipedia users. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>1 week is to little, the person hasn't learnt what he/she has done is wrong.

<p>As I've mentioned on Chooserr's talk page, while I agreed to unblock him under date-range parole a bit ago, this block is quite fair. He needs to take some time out from the edit button to think about his editing style and the way he interacts with other editors, because, in the long run, what he's doing is not going to get him anywhere but the ArbCom or a consensus ban. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 11:27, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's quite clear from messages that I have left on Chooserr's talk page that I <i>agree</i> with the fact that he was blocked, but consider that one week is too harsh (even taking into account the fact that people get longer blocks if they have a history of being disruptive).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nunh-huh. I'm not sure whether by "sexuality" you mean sexual <i>behaviour</i> or sexual <i>preference</i>. Since the Catholic Church forbids homosexual activity, it is simply not possible to be an obedient Catholic and to be homosexually active. To say that the Catholic Church forbids such acts is not expressing a POV; it is stating a fact. If you don't believe me, please click on the link to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church_82ad.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> which I supply <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (scroll down to Section 2357). To say that the Catholic Church is right or wrong to forbid such acts <i><b>is</b></i>, of course, to express a POV, and is also an misuse of Wikipedia server space. I would very much like to avoid such a discussion. But I repeat that the severity of the insult does depend on whether "not being a devout Catholic" is seen as a very bad thing. I would like you to consider the following: If a hypothetical user put two user boxes on her page, one saying "This user is a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>", and another saying "This user eats <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork.html" title="Pork">pork</a>", people might think that she didn't qualify as a devout muslim. If someone pointed that out, would you say, "The insult is to tell a <i>Muslim</i> that she <i>hardly qualifies as a devout Muslim</i> on the basis of her taste buds?" I don't want to dwell on this, because I think that Endomion could quite reasonably feel indignant to discover that her sexuality is being discussed at the Administrator's Noticeboard. Chooserr had absolutely no right to make the remark he did, but I think that part of the reason we're shocked is that sexuality and religion in many cultures are very private, personal things. Most Wikipedians do not put such information on their user pages. If they do (as Endomion does), then they are implicitly stating that these things are <i>not</i> completely private, though of course they still shouldn't be treated to the kind of comments that Chooserr made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I may be wrong on this, but as far as I can tell, the only administrators, other than myself, to have expressed concern at the fact that Chooserr was being harassed by other users are <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused/asdf&amp;diff=32423539&amp;oldid=32419676" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused/asdf&amp;diff=32423539&amp;oldid=32419676" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and GTBacchus<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=32820957&amp;oldid=32646516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;diff=32820957&amp;oldid=32646516" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. I would like to see some sign that those who criticize Chooserr do not condone it when other users sneer at him, revert him when it isn't necessary (and I know it often <i>is</i> necessary!), call him a "mindless troll", etc. He seems to be rather naive (note how he self-nominated for adminship when he was new and had about a hundred edits, presumably in controversial articles). I really don't think that blocking him again and again and leaving unrebuked those who make snide remarks about him will help him to become a better Wikipedian. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:27, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

Reversing bad edits one comes across is not "stalking" and having to explain -- more than once -- why they are bad (POV, original research, unverifed, and plain illogical) is not "sneering", it's frustration.

<dd>Musical Linguist, thanks for clarifying that you share ChoosErr's point of view on homosexuality and Catholicism. While you argue your point less offensively than ChoosErr did, you are arguing <i>your</i> points, not the ones <i>he</i> actually made, and it's those that are pertinent. ChoosErr made no practice/orientation distinction, btw, and would in any case have no basis for presuming the former rather than the latter. Regardless, as far as I can tell, while there is Catholic doctrine specifying certain sexual acts as sinful, there is no Catholic doctrine that specifies that devout Catholics do not sin. There is no Catholic who does not sin. Even the devout ones. No, putting information on one's user page does not invite insults based upon it. Yes, I think unsolicited opinions on one's devoutness are improper, and that Wikipedia is right in forcefully letting those who make such comments aware of their unacceptability. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 17:25, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nunh-huh I don't think I <i>ever</i> said that I shared Chooserr's point of view on homosexuality and Catholicism. For the record, I accept all the teachings of the Catholic Church. Chooserr may well hold to more extreme views; I have not examined all his contributions. However, I see no reason to discuss my beliefs (or his) here. You are quite correct in saying that there is no Catholic doctrine specifying that devout Catholics do not sin. Catholic doctrine, however, <i>does</i> distinguish between <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venial_sin.html" title="Venial sin">venial sins</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">mortal sins</a>, and also between those committed out of frailty and repented of, and those that one has no intention of giving up. That's why the Church does not allow respectable, law-abiding, divorced-and-remarried Catholic to receive <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Communion_f177.html" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a>, unless they either separate or agree to live as brother and sister — since it <i>is</i> impossible to be a "devout Catholic" while having no intention of giving up something that the Catholic Church considers (rightly or wrongly) to be <i>gravely</i> sinful. However, this is rather straying from the purpose of the Administrators' Noticeboard, in my view. If you have further comments, my talk page would be a better place. I came here to discuss the possible harm done by a severe punishment for Chooserr combined with what must seem to him like a condoning of the behaviour of those who follow him around with snide remarks. Please do not say that I share his POV. First of all, it's unlikely that I do, and secondly, I have tried to keep my POV out of this. And while I agree with <i>you</i> that putting information on one's user page does not invite insults based upon it, and that unsolicited opinions on one's devoutness are improper, you have not given any indication of agreeing with <i>me</i> that Wikipedia should discourage users from following other users around and calling them "mindless trolls". Isn't there <i>any</i> administrator who agrees with me that people can start behaving worse when they are treated abusively, and that we are failing such users if we do nothing to help them? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:36, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, one way to avoid having your beliefs discussed is to avoid discussing them&lt;g&gt;. So I shan't elaborate on venial and mortal sins and the nature of automatic excommunication, except to note that none of them are germaine to ChoosErr's comments. I <i>do</i> agree with you that people can start behaving worse when abused, or even when simply disciplined. And I agree with your implicit statement that abusive epithets are inappropriate. There are, I believe, mentoring options available for ChoosErr, should he either [1] wish to make use of them upon his return, or [2] act so badly that he is required to make use of them. As for following users around, unfortunately some users make that necessary, and it would be good if they learned to comport themselves in such a way as to make it unnecessary. Our mission here is to build an accurate encyclopedia. If rehabilitation of abusive users can achieve that, that's fine, but the primary objective is the encyclopedia, not "helping users". It seems clear that (besides being abusive of users and process) ChoosErr was not helping build an accurate encyclopedia, but rather distorting its content to suit his point of view. I would hope any mentoring would also address this facet of his behavior. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 18:48, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Punishment/corrective action should be tailored to be effective, proportional the offense and mitigating circumstances and definatly not make the situation worse</li>

<p>Now... I just accidentally closed a tab and lost an hour's worth of work here, so I'll try to recall and summarize. In fact, I'll just answer <a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a>'s questions. Some little bit of background first - I've been watching Chooserr closely for about 2 months, and observed <i>most</i> of his edits and interactions here. Also, in the interest of putting my bias on the table up front - I vehemently disagree with Chooserr on <i>almost every</i> issue about which he's expressed a POV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did Chooserr commit sufficient breaches of Civility to warrant a block?
<dl>
<dd>Yes. He's been warned before about <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, and although I really don't think he thought he was being rude, this is a good way for him to learn something about how <b>not</b> to talk to people about their religion.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Does the harassment of Chooserr exist?
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely. Ann provided some good examples above, in the form of remarks by <a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAolanaonwaswronglyaccused_b400.html" title="User:Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused">Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a>. The former user in particular (whom I've also been observing) has been on a sort of crusade against Chooserr since December 5, it seems. His history here spans two different accounts - check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Aolanonawanabe&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Aolanonawanabe&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">this edit history</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. Spend some time going through those edits, and you'll find a pattern of behavior that includes following Chooserr around Wikipedia, telling Chooserr to stop welcoming new users and reporting him for "spamming" when he didn't, edit warring with Chooserr on many articles, gaming the 3 revert rule in those edit wars, characterizing Chooserr's good-faith edits as "vandalism", nominating Chooserr's new articles and templates for deletion (sometimes warranted, sometimes not), writing insulting messages to Chooserr in his edit summaries, and leaving rude and imperious messages on Chooserr's talk page. He seems to have taken it upon himself to make Chooserr's experience here difficult, with very little regard for whether he attacks fairly or not.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Does the said harassment constsiute mitigating circumstances for the length of the block?
<dl>
<dd>Yes, see next question.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Have those who have harassed Chooerr been properly punished/corrected?
<dl>
<dd>No. Aolanonawanabe/Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused has been repeatedly warned to stop riding Chooserr's back, and when he's failed to heed those warnings, and continued to violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> with Chooserr, he's never been blocked for this behavior. This selective application of the rules sends a terrible message to Chooserr, and I think we need to stop sending that message. I think that Chooserr's block should be reduced from a week to 4 days, and that Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused should receive a comparable block if he attacks Chooserr again. More generally, those who are uncivil to Chooserr should be warned, and if they continue, blocked. (Surely that should go without saying?)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is any and all of the previously mentioned corrective action likley to exacerbate the situation?
<dl>
<dd>Well, the message that we're currently sending to Chooserr: "You get the book thrown at you, while those who attack you get winked at" is very <i>unlikely</i> to result in much improvement. If a system seems blatantly unfair to you, what motivation is there to follow its "rules"? Why shouldn't he game the system, when it works so well for those who disagree with him?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What is the long term solution?
<dl>
<dd>Per the previous couple of answers, I'd have to say that a more equitable application of rules would be a start. Something like a restraining order between Chooserr and Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused might be a good idea, too. The fact remains that Chooserr has some learning to do about how Wikipedia works. He's made some progress already, but he's likely to make much more in an environment that he can see is fair. Once that's established, or perhaps as that's established, I think something like mentoring might be a good idea. I think that Chooserr has shown that he's willing and able to learn to work within Wikipedia's guidelines, but that he's not all that quick about understanding how this place is supposed to work. Given the behavior that he's had a chance to observe from others, I'm not all that surprised. I am confident that a combination of more interactions with fair-minded and civil Wikipedians, and fewer interactions with hot-headed and antagonistic Wikipedians will bring out a much more productive side of Chooserr, and that Wikipedia will benefit from that. This opinion is based on interactions I've observed (and sometimes participated in) in which he's reacted much better to polite, patient explanations than he's reacted to insults, bullying and sarcasm. Kind of like... any of us would. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 10:19, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, GTBacchus for those very thoughtful answers to Tznkai's questions, which must have cost you some time to produce. (Excellent questions, by the way, Tznkai!) I agree with all your points, especially that Chooserr has reacted better to polite explanations than to insults and sarcasm, and that a more equitable application of rules would be better. I would strongly support reducing Chooserr's block to four days (and of course, re-blocking if he violates <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> again). I would also support blocking Aolanonawanabe/ Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused if he taunts Chooserr again, and I think a note to his talk page warning him of this <i>before it happens</i> would be in order. I have promised Chooserr to watch out for people attacking <i>him</i>, and since I am on a wiki-reduction (gradually turning into a wiki-break) until the middle of January, I would request that other administrators would watch for that as well. Although I'm not British, I've always been deeply impressed by the British idea of not kicking a dog when he's down. If we have a <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> page, maybe we should also have one for <a href="../../../d/o/g/WP%7EDOG_c75f.html" title="WP:DOG">WP:DOG</a>! <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:41, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once I've had a chance to discuss the current situation with Chooserr (and assuming no further issues arise here), I think I'll feel good about removing his block a few days early - I don't expect that to happen tonight, as I'm off to bed in a minute, but within a day or two. Naturally, I (and certainly several other admins) will continue to keep an eye on the situation, and will be perfectly willing to block either Chooserr or Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> violations. Thanks to everyone who's taken the time to wade through any fraction of the backlog and weigh in with opinions and suggestions.

<p>Personally, if one person told me that I hardly qualified as a devout Catholic, and another person called me a "mindless, incoherent troll" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused/cow_wars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32335968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused/cow_wars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32335968" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, I would find the second person far more insulting. GTBacchus has said that we're sending a terrible message to Chooserr by blocking him for attacks and not blocking those who attack him. I'll go further than that and suggest that we've been sending a terrible message to Chooserr <b>and</b> to Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused, which is why, this evening, I sent a message to the latter warning him that I'll start blocking him if his pattern of abuse continues. Chooserr, while blocked, has posted a few messages to his talk page, allowing me to remove from his user page a list of users he was watching, admitting that what he said may have been a personal attack, and probably wasn't nice, but stating that he didn't mean it in a grave evil way, and that he might agree with someone who said that he wasn't a good Catholic. He has also said that he will try to be more careful in what he posts on people's talk pages, and that if he does post anything "controversial" he'll be sure to do so respectfully.</p>
<p>Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused has not contributed in the last few days, and may be on a wiki-break. I hope that some admins will find time to check this situation from time to time, as I'm already reducing my time here, and may be taking a complete wiki-break for the first two weeks in January. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:17, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aolanon, I'm the guy who blocked Chooserr for a week because of his personal attacks. Consider this notice that I'll be more than willing to block you also if you don't back way off. Wikipedia is not a web forum for children to squabble on. If the two of you can't be civil to each other, then either learn to ignore each other completely and get on with editing the encyclopedia, or find some other place to have your willy-wagging contest. For the record, I still think that the block was appropriate, and I note that Chooserr has shown no sign of acknowledging how deeply offensive and disruptive his behavior has been. I have said before, and I'll say again, that I think that cutting slack to someone who has been blocked this many times in less than a month sends exactly the wrong message. But if another admin wants to reduce the block, I won't stand in their way. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 05:21, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Aolanon, hi. I would just like to add this to what others have said. Please carefully read <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. It turns out that word does <i>not</i> refer to edits that you disagree with, even to extremely misguided POV edits. Chooserr has some ideas about what an encyclopedia should say that you and I and others disagree with, but that does not make him a vandal, and I consider your calling him a vandal, or a troll, to be not only incorrect, but an insult and a borderline personal attack. Neither of the two of you is in a position to be making remarks anywhere close to that borderline. Several people are watching Chooserr who are capable of doing so with maturity - policing his edits is <b>not</b> your job. I suggest you give Chooserr a wide berth if you can't consistently apply basic courtesy to your interactions with him.</dd>
<dd>Nandesuka, as far as reducing Chooserr's block, I'm willing to take responsibility for my actions, and if this turns out to be a mistake, then I'll be the first to say you were right. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following was composed while GTBacchus was posting his message, which I have just seen. I'm going to go ahead and post what I had written, regardless, as I think it's relevant to the whole discussion, but what I wrote about unblocking Chooserr won't be valid, as I assume GTBacchus will have done so.</p>
<p>Thanks, Nandesuka. I realize that I'm treading on very thin ice in defending him, as he did say something that was offensive. However, I think (and GTBacchus and Tznkai agree) that there are some mitigating circumstances. Also, while he's not as contrite as we might wish, he's not completely unrepentant. Note that he said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=32936436&amp;oldid=32931312" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=32936436&amp;oldid=32931312" rel="nofollow">here</a>: "I guess I deserved this block", and "Maybe it was a personal attack, it probably wasn't nice any way, but I didn't mean it in that grave evil fashion you seem to think I did. If someone said I am not a good Catholic I might even agree with them to some extent." Now, if that's not enough, it's still something. It's more than he acknowledged immediately after the block, and I doubt if he will become more contrite by being blocked for an extra three days. As I understand it, Wikipedia blocks are not meant to be punitive — your offence was so serious that you <i>must</i> be punished by serving a <i>full</i> week — they're intended more as a cooling-off period. GTBacchus suggested shortening it to four days. Now if the three extra days are necessary because "he's not as repentant as he should be", there'd be no grounds for unblocking him after a week either, or after a month, or after six months. I have explained to him that it will be very embarrassing for me if he gets into trouble again straightaway after I unblock him or persuade someone else to do so, and he has promised to do his best not to embarrass me. It <i>will</i> be very embarrassing for me if he re-offends, because every time I try to defend him, I am laying myself open to suspicions, or even insinuations, of condoning his remark.</p>
<p>I warned Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused last night of the possibility of a block for <i>him</i> if he continued his pattern of harassment, which included false accusations of vandalism. One of his first acts after that warning was to write (here) that Chooserr "has yet to make a non-vandalistic edit". I think we all know that that is not true, whatever we may think of Chooserr's POV. I consider that such a remark is in violation of the warning, and increases the injustice we have allowed in constantly blocking Chooserr while simply <i>asking</i> Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused to leave him alone. I'm not going to block Aolanaonwaswronglyaccused now, but I think it will be quite good for him to realize that his behaviour has contributed towards the shortening of Chooserr's block.</p>
<p>I hope this reduction in Chooserr's block will not cause any bad feeling. I fully respect Nandesuka's right to block for that remark, and I know that he does not agree with the reduction of the block but will not oppose it. (Indeed, I would not unblock if he were vehemently opposed, because it was not an <i>undeserved</i> block.) I know also that GTBacchus and Tznkai support a reduction. I know I'll come out of this very badly if he does something to get himself reblocked, but I'm hoping that after four days of reflection he won't. And he has promised me, "I'll try to be more careful in what I post on peoples talk pages, and if I do post anything "controversial" I'll be sure to do so respectfully."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=33164057&amp;oldid=33162902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chooserr&amp;diff=33164057&amp;oldid=33162902" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:42, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to reiterate my support based on mitigating circumstance. The fact is, if we're wrong, its not like its hard to block somebody again. If we're right, we've given Wikipedia three more days to get a better editor. I think its worth the risk of minor disruption. Allow me to reiterate as well, that open season on Chooserr, should it ever have existed, is over. People are now watching over him like a hawk, but we're also watching for people targeting him unfairly.

<p><b>Comment</b> I do not see anything insulting in that statement. I how on the otherhand have seen truly insulting statements regarding peoples religion thrown around and I notice that these people are not blocked. Lies, accusations and insults have been thrown my way too. I feel that Chooserr is being singled out because some people don't like his beliefs. Which is wrong. Dwain 12-30-2005</p>

<dd>Perhaps you and Ann would not feel insulted. But I think its patently obviously that its easy to interpret that as a personal attack, even while assuming good faith.
