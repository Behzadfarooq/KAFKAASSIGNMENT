<p>I (Willy on Wheels) am here to apologize for my actions in the recent past. I have been vandalizing simply due to the fact that I was a previous user here, and I was quite bitter about the permanent block that caused me to have an early exit. I now realize that my actions have not solved anything, and I hope everyone here can accept my apology. Most important of all, I promise to stop vandalizing the Willypedia.</p>

<p>Can I wonder aloud at the purpose of deleting and restoring the browser-breakingly massive history of this article twice in one hour? All it does is move the Jimbo stuff to the deletion log, where it remains visible by virtue of being in edit summaries. I do not know, but I presume that the 26,000 (yes, really) revisions cause strain on the servers in both the deletion, Special:Undelete view and in the restoration, for little actual purpose. We should leave such massive operations to the devs. (Plus, it might encourage them to nobble the underlying IP if it is not dynamic.) If people are going to do this, might they at least leave a note on a protected version of the page, rather than a rather unfortunate editable redlink? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:39, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently had a conversation with a fellow admin who seems to have overzealously blocked a new user. In the course of the conversation with him/her, it became clear to me that (s)he did not understand some core policies, like <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, and the definition of vandalism from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. The user also seems to misunderstand the role of administrators itself, in particular in regard to making exceptions to such policies because of personal views on how vandalism should be handled. I would like to know what I ought to do about the situation, aside from suggesting those policies be reviewed, which I have already done.

<dd>Yes, it's true that it's impossible to hide things from people who want to look, by the very design of Wikipedia; I thought it would still be nice not to name Freestylefrappe explicitly on this page if people thought no further action was necessary. As it is, well, hopefully some good will come of this RfC; I genuinely don't think any action is necessary except for Freestylefrappe to take criticisms to heart, educate himself on policy, and agree to change how he does things in the future. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the problem is that that page's mission statement is hopelessly tangled. At the top, it mentions voting (and even gives a suggested percentage needed to close a move!) I think it's fair to say that that is out of line with effective policy; the votes rarely occur, and aside from the occasional local straw poll or when it comes up as an option on AfD I don't think we normally vote on moves anyway. The page doesn't really distinguish whether it's supposed to be a place to discuss potential moves, or a place to request deletion to make way for a move... Probably the original intent was to have it be both, but just as clearly it has failed on both counts. Honestly, is that page even needed any more? I suggest eliminating <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> entirely, replacing it with an instruction telling people to (1) get consensus for the move on the page being moved (and the target page if one exists and requires deletion), and then (2) tag the target with an A9 speedy if necessary. There's no need to have another page in the broken AfD style to handle something that can be easily handled on a page-by-page basis under the existing rules; <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> is entirely obsolete and should be phased out, starting with a notice at the top telling people not to add requests to it anymore. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 00:50, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So Brookie has decided to ignore me. Great. Who can help me figure this out? When admins go and vandalise my user page (something nobody is supposed to do) and I ask why, they end up ignoring me. I don't mean to generalize all admins and I apoligize for doing so (I'll try not to do so in the future), but it's happened twice now. Shouldn't admins be leaders and show us how to properly act on wiki? The guidelines say you should warn people of deletion of content, this has not happened on my user page. All these questions go unanswered, that's why I wrote what I did further up, and certain people ignore me. I've included the rest of the conversation between him and I since brookie has deleted it from his talk page.</p>

<p>Why do admins ignore simple questions? Delete and run is the only thing I've seen them do. Maybe they're talking amongst eachother to figure out the best plan of attack. Or maybe they're re-writing policy as we act. I know they have a tough job of weeding out unnecessary content, but I have had much more productive talks with users regarding wiki policy than the admins, the people chosen to do the job, have. Please return my original content from my user page as you so gratefully offer on your user page.

<p>It also says, "Note that using the text to recreate the deleted content is speedyable, and using it to keep it hanging around in your userspace has gotten editors penalized before. But that's your problem." - as it has been speedied twice already it's best it stays that way.

<p>I read that.

Where is the appropriate place to talk about admins who ignore genuine debate, or make personal attacks, or who delete content from my user page? This wiki thing is relatively new to me and I think it's unfair to label me a troll when you can see I am genuinely interested in getting straight answers or understandable actions. Please help me out with some facts as to why my chosen user page was deleted, why people choose to ignore me, and why I have to hear personal attacks from an admin. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaviddec_1a85.html" title="User:Daviddec">Daviddec</a> 21:24, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

This article has nearly 26,000 edits to date.</p>
<p>Additionally, over 10,600 edits were by anonymous users, leaving 15400 for registered users.</p>

<p>Yes, you read it right. Don't faint, and don't adjust your TV/monitor.</p>
<p>I just got off the phone with Daniel Brandt. After thinking about this, this entire thing with his article and with his Hivemind thing has become nothing more than a slugfest that neither Wikipedia nor Mr. Brandt should be proud of. I personally said some things to Brandt on his user page that were not becoming of an administrator or of my own personal character. I apologized for some nasty things that I said to him in retaliation.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandt and I had a conversation for about an hour (or so). On the phone, Mr. Brandt was, to my amazement, very reasonable and civil. He presented his side to me in a very clear, concise and polite matter. The fact that he and I talked on the phone as fellow human beings and not as robots made things oh so much better.</p>
<p>Brandt and I have worked out what I think is a very reasonable compromise. Let's face it: Daniel Brandt really is not that notable. Yes, he should be mentioned for what has happened with the entire Seigenthaler controversy, and he should be mentioned with NameBase and/or Google Watch. People know of Google Watch but not of Daniel Brandt. Instead of deleting the article <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, we can instead <i>redirect</i> it to either NameBase, Google Watch or whatever, and have a relevant bio on Brandt there. In return/for the sake of repairing relations, Brandt is willing to take down the "Hivemind" page that he has put up.

He expressed his concerns about the probability of my success of being able to make this happen, but personally, I think we can make this come true.</p>
<p>Please, Wikipedia. This can be big for us. Let's be willing to make a compromise and put an end to a rather hostile and controversial feud. If <i><b>I</b></i>, an administrator who has been put on Brandt's page, am willing to talk to Brandt over the phone, have an hour-long conversation, and end hostilities towards each other (not to mention I have declared myself in the past to be a sworn enemy), then so can we all.</p>

<p>To be honest, I've never heard of negotiating a compromise, however well-intentioned (or, as ExtremeUnction has it, unintentioned) with someone about what appears in "their" article. There's a good argument that neither PIR or Brandt are that notable, or at least, that all the picayune detail that appeared in his article is. However, I don't like the idea that if someone causes us enough heartburn, they get their way: in particular, I think it's reasonable to have a biographical article on Brandt, with some of the information that's been erased. However, as we discuss this here (and I'm sure there will be more to come) let's not play silly buggers with the article. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 02:29, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You know, this really makes my day. <b>No one said ANYTHING about deleting info</b>... I was in the middle of <b>merging</b> Brandt's bio into the new location... I wasn't holding Wikipedia hostage... I happen to apologize to Brandt for being a dick to him and we happen to work something out... something that would STILL contain a bio of Brandt's, just under a different effing article, and what happens? I get called a villian. A rogue admin. An abusive, power hungry puppet of Daniel Brandt. Well, <b>excuse me</b> for trying to make a compromise that would still have everyone happy. Everyone would still have Mr. Brandt's bio under a different name. No, I guess that wasn't good enough. We're out for blood, aren't we? Daniel Brandt IS notable enough to have an article just because Wikipedia says so, apparently. For as much time and dedication I have given to the project, this has been one of the bold moves I have made, and people think that what I was doing was criminal. Well, I'm sorry, Wikipedia. I'm sorry for trying to come up with something that any sane person would realize would not affect them at all. Everyone thinks that Daniel Brandt is the Darth Vader of Wikipedia or something. The sheer amount of controversy that this has caused proves that people spend way too much time on old grudges instead of working on the actual ARTICLES at hand.</p>
<p>If any noticed, Brandt had put ME on his little hivemind thing. Brandt himself offered to take it down, but I said that that was up to him. This isn't about the f***ing hivemind page. This is about merging material into an article and making everyone's life better.</p>

<p>Alright, it's not "tomorrow", but I've stepped away from the situation.</p>
<p>I had no right to just *do* that. It was a bold move, and perhaps way too bold. I thought I was doing something that was for the greater good of Wikipedia... but I did not expect to be met with such hostility.</p>
<p>What I did had no personal "what's in it for me" attributes. I thought what I was doing would be for the greater good of the community. It had nothing to do with Brandt's hivemind page. Brandt himself offered to remove the page... I didn't request it.</p>
<p>I hope this didn't shake people's faith in me too much. This project means so much to me, and to see people come to my support means a lot to me. It also means a lot to me to gain the trust and support of the rest of the community...</p>
<p>What I did with apologizing to Brandt was the right thing to do. What I did with his article was not. It needs to be community-run, not administrator run. I apologize.</p>

<li>Firstly, I noticed you've vandalised <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a>'s user page. I've just rolled that back, don't do it again. Secondly, if you're going to make claims of vandalism, please provide diffs (and provide them on the pages for reporting vandalism, not here).

<li>But, but, <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> declared that user page vandalism is just a content dispute. While I didn't provide diffs, I provided enough information for any non-lazy administrator to be able to easily find what I was talking about. Regarding the link vandalism, I mentioned that it was right before I gave him the test2 (which he removed), and I put the warning in the edit summary for a reason. Regarding the abuse of tags, I gave the exact page it happened on. Regarding the user page vandalism, I again gave the exact page it happened on. If administrators are too lazy to spend more than three seconds investigating vandals, they should say so. I would put the diffs up there now (although I've never seen anyone have to do that, including me when reporting other vandals), but what's the use, they'll probably say they're too old now (now that half a day has been pissed away because of administrator laziness) and there was already enough information there anyway if anyone cared about the vandalism. Apparently, all you have to do to get away with vandalism is also make non-vandalism edits, and/or just get into an argument with someone.

<ul>
<li>OK then, let's look at this a little more closely (as I did, before writing my previous comment, but obviously you need things spelling out). You claimed putting an AfD template on Category:Criticism on Jehovah's Witnesses was "vandalism" - I'd assume it was a mistake in good faith. In any case, it should be "Criticism <b>of</b>". You claimed that the message on <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.158.232.37.html" title="User:66.158.232.37">User:66.158.232.37</a> was "vandalism" - it was certainly a personal attack, but you had already replaced it with a message accusing <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a> of vandalism. He blanked the page, you reverted it to the accusatory message. I've just blanked it again, can we just leave it blank, please? The third thing you claim is that just prior to your inserting a test2a message on his talk page, he had been engaging in "link vandalism" on some unspecified page. Well, he had certainly been removing links from <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, but he had been providing justification and I think in at least a couple of those cases they were valid removals. That isn't vandalism, that's a content dispute. You removed a lot of links from the page at around the same time. Go and read <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> and see what is actually considered vandalism here. In particular, look at what "link vandalism" actually means. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:59, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding your making excuses for vandals and calling their actions 'mistakes,' such excuses can be made for anyone. Note, however, that this particular user was throwing tags all over the place and even put his name down as a member of the Association of Members' Advocates almost from the moment they registered (the reason for knowing all about all this stuff the moment he registered turned out to be that he was a sockpuppet, apparently with little intent other than to vandalize and piss people off and get whatever he wanted), so he should have known better. I fail to see how trying to get the entire category criticizing your religion, and only said category, deleted is a "good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia," but apparently you do. You're right that the correct title of the category should have "Criticism of," not "Criticism on," but I didn't name it. In fact, I think that at one point I tried to fix it on some page, but a Jehovah's Witness changed it back. Talk to him. Maybe he's trying to make critics look illiterate or something. Regarding his user page vandalism, well, you never actually said why it wasn't vandalism, so there's not much to defend. Regarding the link vandalism, look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_and_child_sex_abuse&amp;diff=31448271&amp;oldid=31446688" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_and_child_sex_abuse&amp;diff=31448271&amp;oldid=31446688" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_and_child_sex_abuse&amp;diff=31448271&amp;oldid=31446688</a>, which is a diff from his vandalized version to the fixed version. In particular, look at the references beginning "Tubbs, Sharon" and "U.S. Department of Justice" in the correct version, and then look at what he was doing. Apparently, your in-depth, close look completely missed this. The first time, I agree(d) that it could have been a mistake, and didn't give a warning or anything. It was the second time that got him a warning. Upon further consideration, I'm not sure that it's not "Sneaky vandalism" instead, but it is something (I started calling it link vandalism before I even knew that that was an actual recognized name for a type of vandalism). Do I have to spell things out for you again more slowly now?<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 02:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm wondering what should be done about this case. Please take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trapped_%28album%29&amp;diff=26877676&amp;oldid=26605680" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trapped_%28album%29&amp;diff=26877676&amp;oldid=26605680" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>. As you will notice, <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgy_9a43.html" title="User:Borgy">Borgy</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgy_fb23.html" title="User talk:Borgy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Borgy_d635.html" title="Special:Contributions/Borgy">contribs</a>), wanting to write an article about a CD named "Trapped", found an article about a 2002 movie at the location (then, now it's a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trapped.html" title="Trapped">disambig page</a>). He then proceded to blank the article about the movie to write in the CD information. You might think: <cite>newbie mistake</cite>, but by his list of contributions, you see that he wasn't really all that green when he did it. And then, the final coup: he proceeded to the image page of the DVD cover for said movie and uploaded, over it, the image of the CD cover. I can't wrap around my brain an explanation of "distraction", or "newbie mistake", this just strikes me as utmost selfishness, with complete disregard for the content and, why not, other people's work. In the case of the image, specifically, it's unbelievable that he couldn't just have uploaded it with a slightly different title, as everybody does, all the time around here. It strikes me as: he just wanted the image to be at "Trapped.jpg", just like he wanted the article about the CD to be precisely at "Trapped", and didn't hesitate to obliterate content in order to get his way. Problem is, I had just returned from a Wikibreak when he pulled that stuff, and only now did I catch up with it. It happened on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, which makes it somewhat "old". Still, it seems to be clear vandalism to me and I do belive this guy should be blocked for it, even now. But I thought I'd get some insight on this, especially given the passage of time. And plus, if he is to be blocked, I'd request that someone else does it, since I'm the author of the article he blanked and the uploader of the image he wrote over.<br />
Incidentally, I've fixed everything, restoring the content for the movie at the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trapped_%28film%29.html" title="Trapped (film)">new location</a> and restoring the image for the DVD cover (without writing over the CD image, btw).

<li>Has behavior of this sort persisted since then? We shouldn't block anyone for something that happened a month and a half ago unless they have kept doing it. Blocks are preventative, not punitive. See how he responds to your comments on his talk page before doing anything else, I would say. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 15:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Naturally, I would not have blocked him myself for this particular one, because I'm directly involved with the article/image he vandalised — and the thing about too much time having passed, does make it inappropriate to block him for it now. Still, something like this... a user who shows a disposition for this kind of action... it just gets me on yellow alert, you know? Jimbo has said it himself: we tend to put up with far more than we're supposed to. As I said, this was no honest mistake, at least I don't think so. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 17:58, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Our policies aren't exactly clear...if the user was new, perhaps he wasn't sure how to upload a new pic, clicked the existing one, and it said "upload a new version", so he figured that was how... <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 20:59, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify on Nlu's idea: If Gibraltarian's IPs are to be blocked completely, then it should cover all IPs between 212.120.226.0 and 212.120.231.255, since all IPs he has used so far belong to this range. If he starts using IPs in the 212.120.224.* and/or the 212.120.225.* ranges (based on the IP range of his ISP), then these may be blocked as well. --<a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETML1988_e998.html" title="User:TML1988">TML1988</a> 14:32, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As one of the editors who raised the issue, <i>meatpuppetry</i> doesn't seem to be the right term. The participants are all regular members of the Wikipedia community. It's more of a <i>push voting</i> drive by a couple of editors with a political agenda who canvass talk pages of people likely to share their opinions. On the CfD page it appears the people who responded to the canvass acted in good faith. The AfD incident is somewhat more serious: probable bad faith nomination, several users making false claims about the article's content. I realize these are discussions and not votes. I also realize legitimate users have a right to be heard. Those who canvass this way are gaming the system to create a false impression of consensus. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, what separates the legitimate act of notifying editors that we know would feel strongly affected by a decision, so that the decision isn't made without them, and illegitimate "push voting"?

<p>Am I allowed to post here? Anyway, this seemed as good a place as any.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVilerage_770c.html" title="User:Vilerage">User:Vilerage</a> has admitted to launching a Denial of Service attack against <a href="http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/</a> using the page http//www.brandt-watch.org/ and his home page <a href="http://www.geocities.com/visualrage/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/visualrage/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/visualrage/</a>. This has been detailed on <a href="http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/perp.html" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/perp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/perp.html</a> . I have sent to him a message on his talk page asking him to prove that it was not him, and he has failed to respond, and wiped my message unread, which I believe is sufficient to constitute an admission of guilt.</p>
<p>Vilerage has done this in the name of Wikipedia, and has given Wikipedia a bad name in doing this. What he has done amounts to the crime of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_hacking.html" title="Computer hacking">computer hacking</a>. As such, I request that his admin powers be revoked as soon as possible and he be banned from Wikipedia. I feel that if this is not done, then it could expose Wikipedia not only to bad public press, but also to criminal charges in relation to his admitted illegal activities. I am not sure of what the processes are to go about this, but I thought that this was the correct forum to mention this. Do you have to go through ArbCom first?</p>
<p>I don't really want to get too involved in this personally, so will leave it up to other administrators to deal with this properly. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 20:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's totally irrelevant to his admin. privileges and to Wikipedia in general. As long as the Wikimedia Foundation did not encourage it, it has nothing to do with it. What about his (hypothetical) Yahoo! e-mail account? Are they going to cancel it because of independent activity? It's none of our business what Vilerage does in private. As long as he hasn't abused his admin. privileges or violated any policies (which he hasn't), IMO this discussion has no place here and is not our concern.

<p>The only immediate problem I see with Vilerage's contributions is his 477 characters long sig which makes it really hard to read the comments in between all the links and HTML. He says he did not launch a DOS attack on Brandt and I have no reason not to believe him.</p>
<p>However, if it is proven that Vilerage (or another user) has taken a petty interpersonal dispute off-site and then implicated or associated Wikipedia with criminal activities, I will personally block their account indefinitely. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 07:58, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I consider this very serious indeed. Vilerage has made some positive contributions to the encyclopedia, but if he has indeed done this, then in so doing he has defamed the entire Wikipedia community. I have no love for Mr. Brandt, but we cannot tolerate this at all, any more than we would if someone had popped Brandt's car tires or some other criminal, puerile prank. If this is proven (and it seems to be so, though I am no technical expert), an indefinite block is required.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:41, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>To assume good faith of people in an online community is in itself an act of extreme foolishness. Experience shows time and again that the average person is much less saintly than idealists would have you believe. I have no belief in the statements made by either party over this alleged attack. If Mr Brandt can produce evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of any individual person, he should take the matter up with that person's ISP. --<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgamemnon2_ee6b.html" title="User:Agamemnon2">Agamemnon2</a> 10:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe people need a reminder of what Wikipedia is and is not? Actions like this add nothing to the writing of the encyclopedia, on the contrary, they are damaging to the public perception of the project, to the community and ultimately to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 10:50, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am strongly opposed to any form of block on User:Vilerage, accusations are flying: the <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#Users_engaging_in_criminal_activity_in_the_name_of_Wikipedia" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">recent note</a> left on Jimbo's talk page by Zordrac is (imho) plainly wrong, no proof that "Users" <b>are</b> "engaged in criminal activity in the name of Wikipedia" is given and a further groundless assumption and accusation is made about perpetrating a hoax. Enough now. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 12:24, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the interest of not making Zordrac unfairly appear as a ranting looney, it should be noted that there was a hoax perpetrated on Brandt by somebody with a Wikipedia account (<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallum_Derbyshire_0787.html" title="User:Callum Derbyshire">User:Callum Derbyshire</a>), discussed at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a>, and now archived at <a href="../../../p/u/b/Talk%7EPublic_Information_Research_Archive_2_522a.html#Daniel_Brandt_hoaxed" title="Talk:Public Information Research/Archive 2">Talk:Public Information Research/Archive 2#Daniel Brandt hoaxed</a>. The whole thing was considered funny by some editors. When Zordrac informed Jimbo about it, Jimbo clearly stated on that talk page that such behaviour is unacceptable. Yet, people continued to bait Brandt, and then Vilerage came up with a brilliant idea of setting up brandt-watch.org, which seems to have featured a "tricky" script as the site said earlier today. The site has now been taken down and I don't know how I could confirm how it looked before and how Wikipedia was mentioned on the page with the "tricky script". If there was conclusive proof that he did in fact implicate Wikipedia in his actions, I would have had blocked him immediately.</p>
<p>The whole Brandt affair is getting out of hand. There is a group of editors who have shown extreme lack of judgment in dealing with the article and the man and who seem to think that defending Wikipedia from criticism requires and allows them to engage in crusades, bullying and other childish behaviour. While that is their prerogative, they should not be allowed to do that on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 12:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zocky is 100% correct in all this. We are Wikipedians. To me that means something. We should conduct ourselves with the highest degree of honor and maturity at all points. Editing Wikipedia is not a right, it is a privelege bestowed by the community of good people who care about writing a high quality encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 15:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is what happened: Vilerage, on <a href="http://brandt-watch.org" class="external free" title="http://brandt-watch.org" rel="nofollow">http://brandt-watch.org</a>, had a link labeled 'Brandt image gallery', or something of the sort. When launching this page, it used JavaScript to load images hosted on Brandt's image server at a high rate of speed. I talked to Vilerage on IRC, and he agreed to remove the page. That's good enough for me. But it's also another important note: As Jimbo said above, Wikipedians should hold themselves to a high standard always. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 22:14, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hope and trust that <i>hold themselves to a high standard always</i> refers to activities relating to wikipedia, whether online or offline, as other behaviour outside wikipedia is really not wikipedia's concern. Some argue that if you work for wages it is reasonable for the company to expect certain offsite standards, eg no taking drugs, etc, but wikipedia should not go down that line, IMO, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 22:22, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody is talking about checking people for drugs. We are talking about Wikipedians who engage in real-life attacks on critics of Wikipedia, and in some cases, like the hoax mentioned above, directly involve Wikipedia, and even get support from other Wikipedians (see <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECallum_Derbyshire_eb1d.html" title="User talk:Callum Derbyshire">User talk:Callum Derbyshire</a>), including old hands from whom I would have expected more.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia does not and can not engage in campaigns to silence or bully its critics. Again, I haven't seen proof that Vilerage directly implicated Wikipedia in his actions, and he has so far not been blocked, at least by me. His actions were in any case highly irresponsable, as the obvious connection between brandt-watch.org and Vilerage's work on Wikipedia implicates Wikipedia anyway. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 23:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was some discussion on <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_3e6f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005</a> regarding the upcoming election. Those involved in the discussion agreed on some (rather commonsensical) suggestions, I thought I'd list them here for additional feedback. Of course the above are only suggestions, and if there are other suggestions please mention them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting should be done on subpages like on RFA, a useful format would be "statement - votes - questions" like on RFA. It would be easiest on the Candidate Question subpages (e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Candidate_statements_172_ee4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements/172">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements/172</a>) - just paste in the candidate's nomination statement and add a voting section.</li>
<li>To avoid a Disendorsement Disaster, people should be discouraged to add any comments whatsoever to their votes. Of course, they are free to ask the candidates questions, but not in the voting section.</li>
<li>The election should be in January to avoid interference with Christmas. Suggested timeframe is Jan 9th - Jan 22nd (which is two weeks, same as last year).</li>
<li>Suffrage: only those accounts can vote that have been registered at least three months before the election starts (same as last year).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have suggested that one person be formally in charge of the process. E Pluribus Anthony suggested Anthere and/or Angela; Kelly Martin suggested Mark Ryan. Other people such as myself believe this isn't necessary. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:43, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps a few bureaucrats who aren't running? We ought to have someone- Bureaucrats close RFAs for two reasons. The first, obviously, is that they have access to <a href="../../../m/a/k/Special%7EMakesysop_f398.html" title="Special:Makesysop">Special:Makesysop</a>. But also, they do so because they're trusted to make decisions on whether a voter is a sockpuppet, etc. It might not be a bad idea to have somebody "watching" the elections. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 23:00, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course. However that appears to be par for the course so far so far. If you get someone trying to do something they don't really have time for a sub optimum result is to be expected. It should be interesting to see how it plays out. Will wikipedia's more caperble wikipoliticians decide to vote only for safe candidates or not to vote at all. The first as the risk of highlighting potential conflicts with those who may end up in a position of power. The second looks too calculateing. Then you have the fun of when they vote. Go in early and try and appear as king maker, try and tip the balance at the end or try and stay out of the issue by hideing in the middle. Interesting all round.

<dd>Personally, I have to favor the idea of a secret ballot. With Admins and even Bureaucrats, individual interpersonal feelings, bad blood and the like don't matter so much; there are 700-some-odd admins, all free to challenge each other's decisions, and other than closing (rarely-controversal) RfA votes Bureaucrats tend to stay out of things. With ArbCom members, though, you have most or all of them regularly forced to pass judgement on individuals and their entire history with Wikipedia, ending in binding decisions with few places left to appeal. I don't think any of the likely candidates are people who would seriously say "YOU VOTE AGAINST ME, THEREFORE I <i>DESTROY</i> YOU!!!1" or anything like that, but it seems fair to me for people to be reluctant to elect a group that is essentially judge, jury, and executioner in an open vote... nobody, for instance, should ever have to be in the uncomfortable position of knowing that everyone on one side of a controversal RfAr voted for the current ArbCom slate, and everyone on the other side didn't. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 00:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm not sure I like the discouraging comments bit, the comments on RFA, especially the opposes, are often very helpful making up one's mind about a candidate.

<p>If a secret ballot is not possible - or is not preferable - why not just have only support votes. And require a minimum number of support votes (like 75, 100, 150 or something), as well as endorsement by Jimbo. Same for Jimbo proposed candidates - require a min. number of support votes. That way abstentions or opposes don't have to identify themselves, and hopefully the system wouldn't get as ugly as some of the RfA votes. I see Kelly's point - good people will withdraw rather than have to bear the indignity. Voting isn't a very good way to choose arbitrators, but I don't see a better way yet. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 03:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand how we would determine a 50% support threshold from this scheme. Based on lsat years elections, we'd elect a single Arbitrator if the 50% were measured across all votes.

<li>While I would prefer a secret ballot, I don't believe that an open ballot (as Jimbo suggested) would be anywhere nearly as ugly as some people here suggest. If you look at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, you'll see that nearly all RFAs are neat and civil. Practically all ArbCom candidates are known and trusted members of the community. There may be a bit of nastiness from a personal enemy or two, but they should be mature enough to deal with that (if not, they shouldn't become Arbs in the first place). If a candidate would really give raise to significant violent opposition, then I would suggest that he is too controversial to become an Arb, and that the voting results would reflect that no matter <i>how</i> we vote on it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:24, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's odd: it's a non-portable IP. His IP address may have gotten autoblocked when another user on that IP was blocked, in which case, there's no way to know to unblock it without knowing which user it was (unless somebody with user IP lookup access can check it). I'm not sure, but I think that he still should be able to edit from an account if that account hadn't been specifically blocked. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 05:41, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>63.19.128.0/17 is the range used by the "North Carolina vandal" (aka Regara, Jake Remington/Rattlesnakes, Luxembourg, per-capita, etc etc etc). It's occasionally range-blocked to deal with him.

<p>To preemptively answer the question, "Was that range block necessary?" – The North Carolina Vandal is one of our more prolific vandals, creating numerous sockpuppets that begin by making legitimate edits, but then return to the same edit wars on the same articles, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">Elitism</a>, for example. He sometimes even <i>argues with himself</i> through sockpuppets that take opposing views. It's all very odd, and since he has access to so many IPs, the range block is really the best way to deal with him, as long as it doesn't cause collateral damage, as it did in this case. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 14:36, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I say this because nearly 2/3 of <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:justforasecond</a>'s total edits on Wikipedia are against <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a>, either on talk pages, in an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Deeceevoice_158a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Deeceevoice">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deeceevoice</a>, or in a new <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Deeceevoice_Civility" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Deeceevoice_Civility</a> the user just created. The RfC was stopped early because of personal attacks and b/c it was not achieving consensus or compromise. I'm also bothered by the fact that justforasecond is bringing this new RfA even though this justforasecond has had no new conflict with Deeceevoice. I'm aware that Deeceevoice can cause personal conflict with some of her comments to other users but I feel she is a good editor with a track record of quality edits to articles. Is there anything I can do as an admin to stop this harrassment (aside from pointing out that the new RfA is not valid because the RfC failed to achieve consensus and was ended early due to personal attacks?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 16:21, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe there is some legitimate complaint against Deeceevoice (who is, as I need to point out, otherwise a good, valuable and competent editor, who has to put up with a lot of nasty racist nonsense from trolls and vandals). I do not know what <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:justforasecond</a>'s motives are, and whether an RfAr is the best way forward is debatable, but the fact that Deeceevoice refuses to take any part in dispute resolution reduces the available options. You ask what you can do as an admin to stop harrassment. I would suggest you encourage Deeceevoice to discuss the issue with others, and to otherwise abide by the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> policies. If she did, I suspect you'd find that a lot of the complaints against Deeceevoice would die down. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I strongly disagree that filing an RfAr was necessary, I would like to point out that an RfC is not a prerequisite for filing a case. There's no requirement for consensus to be achieved in an RfC, nor can an RfC directly result in punitive measures (for any of the involved parties). An RfC is basically a more formal forum for discussion. In this instance, I believe that the RfC was well-intentioned and could have proven to be very helpful. For several reasons (including the fact that Deeceevoice declined to participate) the RfC was closed once it was clear that it could no longer be productive. As for justforasecond's behavior, a good next step would be to provide some diffs of harassing edits for review by other admins (<a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> might be the best place). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:41, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the RfA states "Confirmation that other steps in dispute resolution have been tried." While the RfC was started, it failed due to personal attacks and such. In my opinion, if the personal attacks had been left out the RfC could have been useful (as you say) even without Deeceevoice taking part. However, since it failed that is an issue. What really troubles me is that justforasecond is pushing this RfA b/c his edit history is showing a serious pattern of going after Deeceevoice, a pattern that appears to violate <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> policy, especially the no Wikistalking section. justforasecond's lack of edits outside of Deeceevoice have me wondering if this is another user's sockpuppet. Is there a way to check this? Bringing in other admins on this issue (as you suggest) would also be welcomed. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 17:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've started leaving notes on the user pages of IPs from which I edit through a connection that I regularly use (like my home ISP account) when I'm inadvertently logged out or when I forget to login. The key is to edit the user page when you're logged in as you to state something like "this IP address is known to be used by __USER__" (substituting the appropriate username and link to your real user page for __USER__). I haven't seen others do this yet, but after thinking about {{<a href="../../../d/o/p/Template%7EDoppelganger_b705.html" title="Template:Doppelganger">doppelganger</a>}} and collateral damage from IP blocks, it makes sense to me (perhaps we should make up a template to say something like "The following established editors are known to edit from this IP address..."). <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> <small><a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlambo_46ea.html" title="User talk:Slambo"><font color="black">(Speak)</font></a></small> 20:24, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Upfront: I filed an RfAr against deeceevoice a week ago, so am not an unbiased party, but could someone please take a look at her user page -- it is the most offensive page I've seen on wikipedia. There are sexually explicit images, racist images, profanity, a call for editors to abandon wikipedia, etc. I'll skip the details, just go take a look please. I'm not sure what (or if *any*) policies are in question here, but it seems well beyond the norms of a user page. -<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 23:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>I am now officially on holiday break.</b> I tried to enter my user page to post a notice to this effect, but -- once again -- I've been blocked. Collateral damage as a result of Radiant's block of someone calling themselves Poporopo (or something). I'm not terribly familiar -- not at all, really -- with wiki procedures and timeframes and such, but, presumably, whatever action, if any, with regard to my user page will wait until I return. It is, after all, hardly an urgent matter. Peace. And happy holidays to all (except, of course, my stalkers)&#160;:p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:18, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Forgive me for jumping the line, so to speak, but I've only just seen this action a few minutes ago. (They never <i>stop</i>, do they?&#160;:p) When collateral-damage blocks have expired long enough to me to make edits on this website (there have been at least four or five I've encountered over the last two days on various pages -- and that's a conservative estimate; and even more if I count the last four days), I've been making changes here and there to those pages -- my user page among them and not -- I repeat NOT -- in response to whatever various complains may be here. (Yes, I was blocked from editing my own user page. I had to store the text in my computer so as not to lose it.) I haven't read everything, and I don't intend to. I'm preparing to leave town for the holidays and don't have the time or the patience. Since when did Wikipedia begin censoring valid commentary on user pages? When did it become a police state? Such images are appropriate for article use -- but suddenly inappropriate and unpardonably offensive when used elsewhere to illustrate a point? Comes off like hypocrisy to me! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:33, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I find it curious/somewhat amusing that the poster Radiant (and others, as well) objects to the swastikas, but says absolutely nothing about the lynching photo. So, a symbol is more offensive than the photo of a murdered human being? One is somehow more offensive than the next? I guess it depends on who's looking at it -- right? &#160;:p Clearly, my point is not to endorse either image -- or the image of the pierced sexual organ, or the naked, seemingly frightened woman in bondage. It is about what I perceive as the incongruity/ridiculousness of certain aspects of wiki etiquette, and the pervasive racism and systemic bias on this website. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>There's a very simple reason for that. I have images disabled in my browser (for the reason that I have a slow connection). The content of the swastika image is obvious from its title, this is less so for the lynching photo. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:19, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I agree with BrianSmithson. I know very little about deeceevoice, but it's her user page, and the images and words are put there as protest about how the user feels they have been treated. This is a very different senerio from the racist who had anti-muslim images and statements on his user page the other day, and who was quite rightly blanked and blocked. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 00:43, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of course I read the page.

<li>No. I've placed the images there because they are illustrative and instructive in their offensiveness. They serve a purpose. Further, let me point out again that these images are available elsewhere on this website. (How else could I have incorporated them on my user page?) So, you're saying only some people can use certain images to illustrate a point and others can't? No offense intended, but that sounds rather a bit like fascist control to me.

<p>For what it's worth, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> has been engaging in a massive pattern of harassment about Deeceevoice (as evidenced by the fact that well over half of his total edits on Wikipedia have been related to Deeceevoice and having her sanctioned). I can attest to the fact that for as long as I've been on Wikipedia Deeceevoice has had a policy of using her talk page to showcase racist vandalism that other users have left there. Personally, I wouldn't leave this on my talk or user pages but she is making a valid point of showing others the racist vandalism that can happen to Wikipedia users. That said, this RfA against Deeceevoice is stirring up major problems between users here. I'm also not alone in believing that racism is at the core of those pushing this RfA.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 02:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It doesn't affect only blacks. If you're e.g. white they just call you other bad names, e.g. nazi. And yes, that can also include swastikas.

<p>Pushing a POV causes reactions that are then explained away as being anti the POV pusher. How is anyone to know if you are short, black or jewish unless that's the POV you're pushing.

<p>I believe Deeceevoice is entitled to keep her user page as it is. However, I feel the arguments she makes are quite flawed and unhelpful. She confuses Wikipedians and vandals, essentially saying "look at this shocking racist vandalism; therefore, Wikipedia is full of racist bias". That's somewhat disingenuous: it means only that <i>vandals</i> are racist — not particularly surprising or, ultimately, a huge problem. Vandals are not tolerated on Wikipedia, and the racist attacks on DCV would have been reverted long ago if she had not made it quite clear that she wants them left as they are (for whatever reason). Another argument on DCV's page is that Wikipedia contains "shocking" offensive images (bondage, genital piercings); therefore, Wikipedians are hypocritical when they try to enforce Civility or No Personal Attacks policies — an unconvincing non sequitur, presumably to somehow justify Deeceevoice's violations of policy.</p>
<p>Let me state that there is almost certainly racist bias within Wikipedia articles, and we should recognise and deal with it. However, Deeceevoice's inflammatory user page (and her combatative editing style) is hardly the best way to fix it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 15:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As long as she isn't breaking any rules (i.e. attacking users by name, etc.), her userpage should be hers to do with as she pleases, IMHO. While the images on her userpage are offensive, they were retained there to prove a point; beyond which, Wikipedia isn't censored, and as she observed, the images are all available elsewhere on this site. Given that the images can be found elsewhere on Wikipedia, there's really no argument against her placing them on her userpage -- it's the context in which they're presented that makes her userpage offensive to people. Which is precisely the point she's trying to make. I can understand how and why people would disagree with me here -- I was shocked too when I first looked at it. But as I read through it and realized what she was trying to do, I was more dismayed at the how's and why's of how the information got there than that it was there at all. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">mrp</a></small> 16:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">Wikipedia:Profanity</a>: <i>Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.</i> So while those some of those images (the bondage image for example isn't linked to from any article) are allowed in the context of some articles, here they are not appropriate, and break WP:Profanity IMO. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane">Jacoplane</a> 17:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that it boils down to whether the point she's making violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Basically, is her user page disruptive to Wikipedia? I'm really on the fence on this issue. I don't think user pages should be treated like personal web pages where "anything goes". However, I also don't think offensive necessarily equals disruptive. In this specific instance, if Deeceevoice is truly leaving Wikipedia, it might make sense to blank her user page until/unless she returns. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 16:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Another thing we have to keep in mind is that most (if not all) of the offensive content was placed on her own user page (or talk page) by other users... leaving it in would be bad if it were in the main articlespace, but it's in her own user page, so it's not disruptive. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:10, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think that if this was in the article namespace (or almost any namespace other than user), we wouldn't even be having this discussion; the images would have been removed instantly. It's only because it's user space that this is even being debated. It takes a lot to violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in user space, but the guideline does still apply there. User pages are viewable by everyone and they're intended for assisting the user in their work on the project, not for use as personal web space. I think the material on Deecee's page is borderline disruptive, though I won't go so far as to say it should be removed against her wishes. I do realize that the offensive material was <i>not</i> added by Deecee and she's rightfully angered that the images and text were placed there. I just can't agree that it makes sense to offend others to prove a point. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Deecee's been up against a lot lately and should get the maximum slack possible here. See for example <a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeceevoice_888b.html#Go_to_stormfront" title="User talk:Deeceevoice">this unfortunate exchange</a> on her talk page. An anon suggested that she visit white supremacist websites, referred to her "tribal mentality," and accused blacks of wanting to commit genocide against the white race; when Deecee responded by calling Stormfront a crew of "inbred, sleazoid, mental-cretin, hatemongers" (pretty near a scientific description, if you ask me), administrator <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> threatened to block <b>her</b> for incivility while taking no action on the anon account. I think Friday's a great user and a great admin generally, but on the other hand, if I had gotten that note, I'd be feeling pretty disillusioned about Wikipedia, too. Let's give her a break for a bit, no?</p>
<p>What's most disturbing to me about all these conversations, though, is... where's the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">Wikilove</a>, folks????

On the contrary, I find it funny in a certain twisted way. She is wearing the slings and arrows of her persecutors proudly, like any red-blooded American individualist. If some of you find it offensive, <i>maybe because it hits a little too close to home</i> for you, by all means <i>don't go to her page</i>. No one is forcing you to go to her page, you're doing it voluntarily. You all are putting yourselves in the position of "nannies", trying to impose your views on other people.

<dd>A month or two ago, when some vandals were creating accounts with the password in them (i.e. creating user names like "Thisaccountspasswordisa" or something like that), I logged in to them and changed the passwords because I had read earlier that indef blocking could contribute to server strain (which, it seems, is false). What I did notice, though, is that the emails were enabled, and though I can't remember the exact email, they were something like "wikipediareallysucksishouldruletheworld @ yahoo . com" or some rant like that. Didn't try emailing, but I highly suspect a false email. Then again, the email may have just been entered because the vandal suspected someone would log-in to that account.

<p>I would like to suggest a feature that, if used correctly, saves clicks when using Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The key combination Ctrl-Tab takes the user of a browser to the address field. When focus is on this field and the page browsed is Wikipedia, I feel that pressing the Tab key should move the focus to the search field. This has to do with the fact that I use the search field most frequently, but I guess that is only natural since I am looking up meanings of words in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>If this feature is no good, please explain why?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't quite the place to post this, but I'll quickly explain something. Ctrl-Tab is a little problematic because in tabbed browsers like <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, that key combination changes tabs. In general, Tab moves you around an interface, but because you can tab around the web page, one needs a separate key combination to get out of the browser control in IE, and I guess they chose Ctrl+Tab. So, Ctrl+Tab doesn't specifically focus on the address bar - the address bar just happens to be the only other focusable control in IE. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 13:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That may be so but you did write</p>
<pre>
    "In general, Tab moves you around an interface..."
</pre>
<p>and I think that the first component focused in that interface should be the search field.</p>
