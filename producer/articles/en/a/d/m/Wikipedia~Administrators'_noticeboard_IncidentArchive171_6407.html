<dd>Do you not think it would be "appropriate" to let me know you've written about me here? I don't have this page on my (very short) watchlist and I only know you wrote here because I suspected you would, rather than just let a minor issue go, seek to extend a conflict as far as possible. Why you think that is a better course than just letting the article stand is a mystery to me. There is nothing inappropriate about my defending the edit. I think it is useful. I don't know what went on with Zephram Stark. I know that editors I trust were opposed to him and I have some idea that he was pushing a POV. I had some idea of an ongoing engagement because he edited pages I have edited or looked at, but I don't usually read these long unfocused narratives that some people on those pages indulge in. I don't really have any awareness of his goodness or badness, or take any sides in the conflict, except, as I noted, that I know he was opposed by editors I trust. That is all.</dd>
<dd>But the article seems interesting to me. I think it can and should be allowed to live, regardless its provenance. Destroying interesting articles because of who wrote them doesn't seem a good idea. If Will has a problem with the content, he could perhaps focus on that. Otherwise, we seem just to have an extension of personal conflict that doesn't serve the encyclopaedia. As I say, I don't watch this page, and frankly, the days in which I <i>was</i> interested in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Talk%7EClitoris_d134.html" title="Talk:Clitoris">pointless fighting over issues that neither I nor the other combatants are particularly interested in</a> are long gone, so this is all I have to say about it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but in these two citations you will find most of what has been written in the Wiki article. I just didn't see the point of putting the two exact same citations at various points in the article. The article was probably written by the guy who invented the process to be honest, yet the fact that it may have started out as original research does not deter from the actuality of it having garnered quite a large following since--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 04:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a repost from 2 days ago, with addendum. The previous post didn't really receive any attention.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraslet_47a7.html" title="User:Fraslet">Fraslet</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFraslet_cd36.html" title="User talk:Fraslet">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fraslet_4e92.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fraslet">contribs</a>) recently brought my attention to the fact that <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJohnJohnJohn_13cc.html" title="User:JohnJohnJohnJohn">JohnJohnJohnJohn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnJohnJohnJohn_09c8.html" title="User talk:JohnJohnJohnJohn">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnJohnJohnJohn_5229.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnJohnJohnJohn">contribs</a>), whose editing has certainly raised a few eyebrows, was possibly operating <a href="../../../o/r/c/User%7EOrchardbank_9a21.html" title="User:Orchardbank">Orchardbank</a> (<a href="../../../o/r/c/User_talk%7EOrchardbank_992e.html" title="User talk:Orchardbank">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orchardbank_001a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orchardbank">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnowenlangham_56c8.html" title="User:Johnowenlangham">Johnowenlangham</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnowenlangham_db03.html" title="User talk:Johnowenlangham">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnowenlangham_24b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnowenlangham">contribs</a>) as sockpuppets. John has now asserted that Orchardbank is in fact Malcolm Nicol, a Conservative Party councillor from Polmont, a town in Scotland which John comes from and has repeatedly made disruptive and bizarre edits in connection with. John also claims that, were that the case, Image:MalcolmNicol.jpg could be legimately licensed as GFDL-self by Orchardbank.

<p>I would like to request administrator review over a situation I am having with an anonymous editor on three articles. The problems first occurring on Christmas weekend when the anonymous editor inserted a wikilink to Anime South onto <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">List of anime conventions</a>. I removed the link because it didn't meat the criteria listed at the top of the talk and summarized in the lead of the article. The anonymous editor kept inserting the link back in and made several excuses on the talk page as to why this convention should receive an exception before finally saying that the criteria is irrelevant.</p>
<p>During the same time, I also tagged several anime convention articles with the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} or similar tags, one of which was on Anime South.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97337378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97337378" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Later the anonymous editor changed the wording in a sentence that made it clearly speculative,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97349474" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97349474" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> which I then removed.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98020799" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98020799" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> After that, the anonymous editor restored the speculative statement and removed the referenced tag, which I reverted.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98078272" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98078272" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98105112" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98105112" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98156859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98156859" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98200182" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98200182" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98297397" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98297397" rel="nofollow">[12]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98300943" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98300943" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98365552" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_South&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98365552" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>

<dd>To Barberio: my response to him was to thank him kindly for self-reporting his legal threat and express the hope that this indicated he would not repeat the offence. I thought that was a long way from harsh. It's only when he demonstrated that he both understood the message and <i>didn't ave any intention whatsoever of heeding it</i> that I got firm. It is much easier to deal with disputes if you don't have random people pitching into the middle of them, of course, especially when those people appear to be looking for excuses to oppose you rather than taking a dispassionate view of the case at issue. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your threat of a block against the complaining editor was clearly escalating the issue, and your following this up with personal attacks of your own by telling the editor he was "b****ing* over it was further escalation, moving on to directly block the editor is an action I simply don't understand. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 19:22, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>[EC x several] HighInBC, SlamDiego characterised comments made against him by another editor as being "libel" while at the same time making equally aggressive and hostile comments about that user. I was in discussion with him about this and he made it perfectly clear that in his mind only attacks against him are libel. Full-on legal threats are grounds for immediate banning, in this case he was merely being aggressive and <i>deeply</i> uncool so I gave him a short block to calm down, with a comment to that effect on his Talk. Unfortunately Barberio chose to wade in and add further heat, for reasons known only to himself. I can't see any evidence that <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> was on his watchlist for any reason, although of course it could have been. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:09, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, this is why I brought this here. In many situations, I would have gone Merope's route: given one final warning. However, it was the lack of contributions outside of the images that led me to this block.

<li>Yes. It's pretty hopeless, actually - it's not patrolled enough to be really effective, most of the attacks come here anyway, and it is a magnet for childish tit-for-tat. Plus it requires you to bring a {{<a href="../../../s/h/r/Template%7EShrubbery_e450.html" title="Template:Shrubbery">shrubbery</a>}} which is a problem in cases of genuine personal attacks requiring speedy intervention. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. PAIN is simply counter productive - and is often being used as a tactical weapon. The object of 'intervention' with an uncivil user must be to calm them down and get them to play nice. You do that by speaking to them nicely, not by boilerplate and wikibylaws. Sure, in some cases we'll need to block trolls - but we can do that by an exercise of common sense.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 17:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>FYI, did anyone review these <i>books</i>. They are all archived studies and publications from the California Fish and Game that date as far back as early 1900s. They were digitized and organized as part of a project that is managed by <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">plbman</a> under a federal grant. In most cases they are being added to articles that have no or few External links and in many cases the relevance is questionable. My question is would anyone add these links on their own based on the merit of each of these archived documents? Would any of these links have been added by this user if it were not a part of his project? For each article that was linked, there are probably many other pages on the web that may be equally or better suited as an external link. Each document requires a download and some are 20 - 80MB each to view the actual document. These very same articles are located here under a much better online viewing format <a href="http://ceo.ucsd.edu/fishbull/" class="external text" title="http://ceo.ucsd.edu/fishbull/" rel="nofollow">California Explores the Ocean</a>. Perhaps a different approach would have been to add a new article (California Explores the Ocean) under WP with a link to this page rather than adding all 178 archived documents under different WP articles. There appears to be a COI here and adding 100 links in a day is spam. IMHO. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalltech_9c69.html" title="User:Calltech">Calltech</a> 21:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I disagree that this was spamming.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, the existence of "other pages on the web that may be equally or better suited as an external link" is irrelevant because <b>no one has added them</b>. We don't remove good content from articles based on the theory that "better" content might be possible. Unless and until such "better" links are added, how does Wikipedia benefit by losing <i>these</i> links (leaving most of the articles in question with "no or few external links")?</dd>
<dd>If some of the links are of questionable relevance, perhaps they should be removed or relocated to different articles. Indiscriminately purging all of them en masse was an ill-advised overreaction on your part, and labeling obvious good-faith contributions as "link spam" was needless <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">newbie-biting</a>. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 23:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I don't see a conflict of interest here -- the user does not stand to gain from the inclusion of these links in any way. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 23:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether or not the additions of the external links were <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">SPAM</a>, I think everyone needs to take a good look at <a href="../../../p/l/b/User_talk%7EPlbman_7310.html#Editing_concerns" title="User talk:Plbman">User talk:plbman#Editing concerns</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/b/User_talk%7EPlbman_7310.html#Reply_to_your_request" title="User talk:Plbman">User talk:plbman#Reply to your request</a>. Here was somone who was <i>very clearly</i> a well-intentioned <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a>, but the response from the Wikipedia was, in my opinion, a clear case of not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting the newbie</a>.</p>
<p>Were the links spam?

<dd>The methodology taken by this vandal (if it is the same one) is alarming, insidious and highly damaging to WP. The fact that most of us (me included) know nothing (and probably don't give a stuff) about Australian wrestling only makes it more dangerous, as it catches well-intentioned editors off-guard. It certainly caught me on the Billy Blaze AfD. It's very clever, deleting all the notability from the article before Afd tagging.

<dd>The user has made 3 edits in the past 48 hours, all of which were pure vandalism (one adding nonsense, two modifying biographies of living people). S/he has also been blocked four times before for vandalism, and has over 100 edits, a vast majority of which are vandalism cases. I'm guessing s/he would continue if given the chance, so I think a block is necessary.

<dd>In general, deletion of the prod template means that it's contested so it would go to AFD.

<dd>That wasn't the article I had in mind. In this instance an anon went through a number of articles and removed prod template but did not vandalise those articles in any other way. I've nominate 2 for AfD in response, other editors have restored the prod templates. In retrospect the latter solution seems better given the pattern of behaviour which doesn't suggest real reasons for deleting the template, so maybe we can presume vandalism (though <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is at the back of my mind). <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 01:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was speaking generically. I didn't go through the anon's edits as by the time I looked, they appeared to all be handled. However, I just looked at the one you mentioned (2006 Terrier Football). Restoring the prod2 template on that article doesn't mean much as there was never a prod template to start. It had an incomplete afd nomination instead.

<p>I have been dealing with the article on adolesescence, namely the part on adolescent sexuality and neogitiating the removal of data of HIGHLY dubious viability and which is obviously opinionated (Lot's of the data is from a single book by leonard sax which is not easily accessible by the average person) And i have placed in more accurate and backed up Center for disease control data on adolescent rates of std transmission/pregnancy rates which have been CONSISTENTLY deleted along with the references DESPITE my asking for proof of sax's 'studies' and 'facts' to be given in an internet reference and for possible other sources on this controversial subject to be used that aren't obviously against it.</p>
<p>What concerns me the most is that it is FILLED with data from just ONE book by a supposed guru on adolescence who claims to have all the facts on teen sexuality and it's dangers and how while my attempts to make the article more nuetral and at least input data from both sides of the debate are overwritten...</p>
<p>There's the fact that some teen or parent might go to the article on adolesence and after reading a few paragraphs on the topic of teen sexuality (Which despite my best efforts is somehow constantly returned back to it's highly biased and non nuetral state by trolls) would declare it horribly dangerous and thus likely cause A LOT of worries, suppression, etc. etc. and EVEN MORE fear about the horrors of teen sex, WITHOUT even allowing for opinions to prove that STD transmission rates and pregnancies have gone down among teens in the last few years without being waaaayyy at the bottom behind the MASSES of Leonard Sax and exclusively right wing opninions, I'm requesting that the topic is locked until a consensus can be reached and if no proof of the dubious (at best) claims about teenage emotional shallowness can be brough out that someone helps me to stop this constant trolling....</p>
<p>The anti vandalism bot reverted my correction where i moved up the CDC data to the top and added teen sexuality based on country to the almost original super biased state...</p>
<p>help in resolving this matter is desperately needed....</p>

<p>I recently had a run-in with something called the <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiVandalBot_aa84.html" title="User:AntiVandalBot">User:AntiVandalBot</a>. The particular issue was fixed and the bot's creator was very considerate. I have no complaint about the bot's creator. However, I'm not sure a bot is the best approach to reverting vandalism. It has too much opportunity for making a mistake, which is tantamount to accusing an innocent editor of vandalism. Just the accusation alone can hurt an editor's reputation (even though in my case I choose to edit using an IP instead of a user account.) Also, it takes the "editor" out of editing. Wikipedia is supposed to be self-correcting because <i>editors</i> are reviewing edits. Even though it takes more time, the Wikipedia way is for other editors to review edits. I'm also concerned that this puts the burden of proof on the wrong person. The bot doesn't ask before reverting edits. It takes a "guilty until proven innocent" approach. Even though an editor can "appeal" a revert by using the bot's talk page, editors shouldn't have to defend their good faith edits in such a manner. It should be up to the editor making the revert to do so only when edits are clearly vandalism. Perhaps a method of automatically flagging pages for review by other editors would be a kinder, gentler approach instead of automatic reverts. A review by a real editor prior to making a revert would improve accuracy and fairness. Bot's are good for making tedious changes in mass, but using bots to replace an editor's judgement is a different matter. In the long run, accuracy and fairness are more important than the time saved by using a bot. 24.214.57.91 01:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ridiculous nonsense. Many established editors have been mistakenly reverted before. A bot is the most efficient way we can track all vandalism, otherwsie we might have it languising in a minor article for weeks or months. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 01:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bot rarely makes mistakes in my experience of recent changes patrol. An "accusation" from a bot counts for nothing. Any accusation of vandalism will be followed up by a real life human who will easily see if the bot was wrong. I think the bot does far more good than harm. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 01:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That lovely and gorgeous bot has well over 100,000 edits, reverting nonsense, vandalism, crud, and a torrent of obscenities and filth all of which would have to have wasted the time of a human being, had it never been created.

<dd>On balance, this bot does an excellent job of dealing with vandalism issues and reverts <i><b>far</b></i> more bad than good edits. The amount of time human editors would need to revert all the bad edits is very high, and before they got to them, a lot of vandalism, sometimes pretty gross vandalism, would remain on pages for a long time.</dd>
<dd>I don't think the user's comments should be characterized as "ridiculous nonsense", however. The user has legitimate points as to some negative aspects of this bot. It's just that they are, in the judgment of most of us, outweighed by the positive aspects.

<li>In a lot of time on RCP I have seen AVBot revert huge numbers of page blankings and replacements of text with garbage. I have also seen it revert <b>one</b> legitimate edit, where an author had removed a Prod and also significantly edited the article, removing about half the content. I restored the edit and left the editor a note with an explanation (also warning him that the article would likely go to AFD, where it is now). In my opinion, the very rare mistake is easily tolerable based on the huge amount of vandalism reverts that get handled by this very valuable tool. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Editor <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> recently went through a wide variety of articles, primarily sex related articles removing content. Also many articles were nominated for deletion. User has expressed a desire to eliminate many articles not deemed desirable by claiming that the articles did not have valid references, or that references did not meet appropriate standards. These actions are disruptive, and I believe an intentional attempt to disrupt editing and improving of these articles. Perhaps actions were veiled type of censorship, perhaps not.

<p>Naturally, the editor claimes that a given article should be deleted, or removes any content perceived as unsavory, and not cited.

<dd>Most readers would have no idea if <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend_experience.html" title="Girlfriend experience">Girlfriend experience</a> is "reasonably accurate". Most will have never heard of the term! Shall we take the editor-author's word for it, or require notability and verifiability be established? If I had removed the long-in-place un-sourced material in that page, the only thing left would have been the slang term's entry in the <i>The Double-Tongued Word Wrester Dictionary</i>.<a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/gfe/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/gfe/" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. Thus, since only a slang dicdef from a dubious source was in the article, and for the reasons I cited on its AfD page, particularly <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, I brought it to AfD. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 06:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If a reasonable person's never even heard of the term, citation is not the issue. The topic is probably either non-notable or a hoax. Both of these are grounds for deletion, and only citation can prove them invalid. However, clearly real (and probably notable) topics like Martin Perreault should not be deleted solely because they are uncited. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 08:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the record, quite a few of his AfDs have succeeded so far, so I'm not sure a block is appropriate. I don't agree with the mass AfD noms, and the reason behind the noms could be a religious thing, but if they correctly apply policy and the articles should be deleted, I don't really know what we can or should do. For the record, I chimed in on a few of them, with different votes. The one I voted keep got deleted (which appeared to me to be against consensus), but such is life. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 04:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clearly, Jimbo is qualifying only his third paragraph, <i>"I think a fair number of people need to be kicked out of the project just for being lousy writers,"</i> as "a statement of attitude and frustration". Otherwise, he would have not used "this" but "the above" or "this all", and not broken paragraphs. The second paragraph is not modified as "a statement of attitude and frustration". Of course, that is why the second paragraph has become part of policy but the third has not.</dd>

<dd>From my perspective, <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a>'s choice of targets raises concern that the nominations are an effort to remove objectionable subject matter from the project. Further, the nominations made in the AfDs for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bean_queen_533f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bean queen">bean queen</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rice_queen_7991.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rice queen">rice queen</a> consist only of lists of policies without specification as to how they are violated. In my analysis, each of the policyvios claimed either doesn't have a discernible rational basis or the policy itself doesn't call for deletion. We're trying to write an encyclopedia, and I'm convinced that improving the content will be more beneficial than removing content based on qualitative or moral objections. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 07:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have a look at the policies I listed and determine it yourself. Most AfDs only list policies. If you have a question, ask on the AfD page. I always explain in more detail if asked. Also, go through the list for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sexual_slang" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sexual_slang" rel="nofollow">Category:Sexual_slang</a> and have a look at all of the ones I did not touch because they met WP policies. If I had just a vendetta against sex, which I do not (believe me, I enjoy sex a whole lot), then I would have listed all of them or done so indiscriminately. BTW, if had gone through the category for bands, internet sites, or companies and started a string of AfDs on them, would you still be objecting? Probably not! But don't worry. They are next. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 07:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's good advice. Luckily, I already did that. That's how I reached the conclusion about the noms that I mentioned above. Regardless, it still takes more than a list of policy links to state a rationale for deletion. Stating in what way policy is violated is part of laying out a rationale to delete. As to your next point, whenever the focus of a concerted effort toward deletion is a controversial subject area prone to being censored, it raises the question of motivation. If you were doing the same to articles on bands, it wouldn't raise the same issues because there aren't many attempts to censor writing about bands. Perhaps it's best handled directly: why do you tend to choose articles related to human sexuality for your content deletions and AfDs? --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 07:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This user has taken sourcing to an unfortunate extreme. We should not be proposing for deletion all articles that do not have sources. That would eliminate most stubs completely.</dd>
<dd>Another example of an sexually-related article targeted in this manner today was <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile_High_club_2138.html" title="Mile High club">Mile High club</a>. This is a short, reasonably well-written article which contains 5 distinct in-line sources. Very few short articles have this many in-line sources.</dd>
<dd>We should not be removing from articles every unsourced statement. That would wipe out much valuable content.</dd>
<dd>For instance - <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmose_I_3a5d.html" title="Ahmose I">Ahmose I</a> - today's <b>Featured Article</b> contains several sentences with no source:
<dl>
<dd>"There was no distinct break in the line of the royal family between the 17th and 18th dynasties."</dd>
<dd>"The Thera eruption in the Aegean has been implicated by some scholars as the source of this damage, but similar claims are common in the propaganda of other pharaohs, to show them overcoming the powers of darkness. Due to the lack of evidence, no definitive conclusion can be reached."</dd>
<dd>"Although the pyramid interior has not been explored since 1902, work in 2006 uncovered portions of a massive mudbrick construction ramp built against its face."</dd>
<dd>etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>CyberAnth needs to be warned against this kind of behavior and the policy statement should be immediately clarified to remove any implication that all unsourced sentences are to be removed on sight. That is surely not our intent. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is quite a surprising (and somewhat disturbing) read. Despite the long touted value of <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Being bold</a></b>, it seems that when an editor actually takes that directive they are quickly jumped on and their <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> questioned. I have been watching and conversing with CyberAnth on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpeedy_deletion_criterion_for_unsourced_articles_2336.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Speedy deletion criterion for unsourced articles">Wikipedia talk:Speedy deletion criterion for unsourced articles</a> and while I don't agree with the level of zeal that he has for academic standards, I nonetheless understand and appreciate his respect for Wikipedia's policies. The only motivation I see in his contribution is an ardent desire to see the project flourish and improve by paying more attention to such fundamental policies as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>I think that the concern expressed here is borne out of history being the supreme arbiter. In massive nominations within a narrow subset of articles such as this in the past, it has, at certain times, been an instance of POV warring rather than good-faith nominations with the project's interests at heart. Note that I am not saying that is the case here, I am simply presenting to you that that is a possible cause for increased attention and discussion. Neither caution nor discussion should ever be considered "bad things", and if they ever are, then we've lost our way. Caution is not the antithesis of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a>. I have commented above that since some to most of the articles inevitably do not meet our policies or guidelines, I personally don't see any of this as being actionable, nor should it be. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 08:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Understood and I will note that there is stark contrast in the sentiment that you have expressed here and the sentiment that a few other editors have espoused in questioning CA's good faith. The fact that this matter was taking to AN/I is troublesome. It is quite apparent in looking at CA's contribution that he is an established editor with a history of constructive contribution to the project. It would have been more prudent for this issue to be approached on his talk page (as a few editors did) rather then bringing it immediately here for <i>admin intervention</i>. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 08:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To further clarify my comments and position: I have been talking specifically about the AfD nominations. Edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mile_High_club&amp;diff=98784557&amp;oldid=98107170" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mile_High_club&amp;diff=98784557&amp;oldid=98107170" rel="nofollow">this one</a> do concern me; that edit made the article completely unintelligible. If there really is a large issue with sourcing, then stub it and work to expand it (and ask others to help you if you can). I contend that in articles other than <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">biographies of living persons</a>, lack of sourcing is not so urgent that it requires wholesale deletions without attempts to improve the text. The gist of what I'm saying is this: if something is unsourced, {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}. If you don't have the time to fix it, hold of on gutting the article until you have the time to fix it. If edits such as the one above have happened multiple times in this case then it might need to be addressed. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 08:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I learned in College Writing 101 that this is the normative style for citations. You only change cites when the source changes.

<li>OK, thank you for the explanation - but even removal of the content was too drastic. You should have simply flagged the article with one of the many templates we have for that purpose, such as {{tl:unsourced}} and {{tl:fact}}. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 08:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your point about FAs is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>.

<li>That WP would allow a featured article with {{citation needed}} is utterly pathetic. Again, has it never concerned you greatly that most high school teachers and nearly all college instructors and--mygod--many elementary schools (!) by written policy do not allow their students to use WP as a source?

<li>I will thank you to take a deep breath and watch your tone. There is no need for profanity here. There is no need for condescending remarks such as "...has it never concerned you..." We are all working to improve the encyclopedia.

<li>I do not mean to offend with profanity or tone, only to make my point strongly. Let me put it another way: if we have all been trying to write an encyclopedia that has gained a reputation such that most high school teachers and nearly all college instructors and--mygod--many elementary schools (!) by written policy do not allow their students to use as a source, then what kind of product is it that we have actually been producing? <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, as found by the journal <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> and by other third parties, we are approximately as accurate as the E.B. As Bbatsell pointed out already, we are a tertiary source and as a rule, teriary sources are really not the best sources to cite. Instead, one should use the tertiary source to get an overview and then use it to locate the better sources to cite.</dd>
<dd>I share your interest in improving the referencing of our articles, I assure you. I've probably added 50 or more sources to Wikipedia today. Some of the articles I'm working on, such as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Texas_Longhorn_football_team_923f.html" title="2006 Texas Longhorn football team">2006 Texas Longhorn football team</a>, have over 100 in-line references. In fact, I belong to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check</a> which has the goal of multiple in-line sources for each factual statement in Wikipedia. We'll get there someday. You might consider joining.</dd>
<dd>Until we get there though, removing every unsourced statement is not the way to go. As I have demonstrated, even our featured articles would fall apart if held to that test. For you to apply such a standard to a set of articles is simply wrong.</dd>
<dd>It's not all your fault. The policy is badly worded. I haven't checked the history to see who or when, but someone took Jimbo's mailing-list comment far too seriously. We should nto be making policy based upon something Jimbo once said on the mailing list. People who are inclined to dwell on every word Jimbo has ever spoken would do well to remember another Jimbo quote:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>...as a general rule, I think that almost any argument, on any topic, which has premises beginning with "Jimbo said..." is a pretty weak argument. Surely the merits of the proposal should be primary, not what I happen to think."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62743946" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62743946" rel="nofollow">[47]</a></p>

<p>I don't really want to get involved in a large-scale dispute, but I spend a lot of time on AFD, and the number of these pre-formed nominations caught my eye. A few links later, I found myself here. I can only conclude that there were good intentions behind this. I know that I'm frustrated with the limited citations some articles possess as well. But I have to agree with some of the commenters above me: <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">This is not the way to do it.</a></p>
<p>I know linking to specific diffs is the norm here, but the general degredation of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Erotic_spanking_49a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erotic spanking">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erotic spanking</a> from discussion to accusations and arguments should be read in full. "If you have the book, place the page numbers and reference them to specific portions of the text. That way I can (and will) verify (or falsify) it." I don't know, maybe I'm wrong ... but I know that I would never try to work out differences on sourcing or establish consensus this way.</p>
<p>But, speaking of diffs, the gutting of articles is extreme, including even removal of disambiguation headers (presumably because they didn't have an inline citation?). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Felching&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Felching&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783809" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dyke_tyke&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783451" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dyke_tyke&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783451" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Douche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Douche&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98783223" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, and particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barebacking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98781900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barebacking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98781900" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> which gutted an article so severely as to remove any context whatsoever. Had the result been posted as a new article, I would probably have tagged it as suitable for speedy deletion.</p>
<p>I'm also somewhat disturbed by <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberAnth_ce13.html#Ass_to_pussy" title="User talk:CyberAnth">this exchange</a> (and part of the one above it).

Its possible for new accounts to dive right into AfDs. he may be a long time IP contributor who has just signed up for an account (this happens quite frequently). Unless there is more evidence of sockpuppetry I'd let this drop. Thanks, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 05:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>1-7 should be obvious. I'm establishing 8 based on the contrib history compared to infomanager's and the fact that its a single purpose account for the article that seems to be the focus of all this.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want to make the following notes: given the similarities in contribution, 1-7 seem like reasonable assumptions. However, I ask that my IP is checked so that I can be cleared of this. Second, only two of them contributed to the deletion review. The strength of the argument came from others. They also contributed to the other deletion reviews for Dec 30 to Jan 1. Third, yes they all contributed to my article's AfD but they <i>all</i> also contributed to every other gaming AfD. It would make the most sense to simply strike their votes and not point fingers. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 07:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>a check user isn't a get out of jail free card. It just means there is no conclusive proof its coming from the same computer. The instructions for beating it are right here on wikipedia. They all contributed to a variety of other AfDs, but all exhibited the same behaviour which you yourself have done, namely bluelinking your userpage immediately on account creation, and not all of them have participated in all the same AfDs, except for the pgnx one. They've all participated in that. As well thinkjose's contribution history seems to fit rather nicely around your own, he stops editing, you start, then you both happen to edit again in october, then nothing again until this whole deal with PGN flares up again, and he also commented on the drv, which makes 3.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are you serious? All six of them may not share <i>one AfD</i> besides PGNx Media, but this is coincidence given that a number of them seem to have gone to everyone videogames AfD and voted, before moving on to the next one on the list! This looks really bad, I admit, but it isn't without explanation.</dd>

<dd>I'm quite serious. It wouldn't be the first time wikipedia has dealt with complex sock puppets or sock puppets used to try and influence an AfD or two. It also wouldn't be the first time someone tried to use their edit history to try and introduce doubt into it either. Name a strategy to cover it up and I'm sure you could find a hundred people here who've seen it. One thing with sockpuppets is there is always a master, and when it comes to AfDs, the master always has something to gain. Usually in removing or keeping a specific article. They've all focused on one article and given varying opinions on other articles, and there are two users who seem to be rather tied into that one article and who's edit histories seem to go rather nicely together. Where I come from thats far too coincidental.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The side articles are mostly immaterial here. Account creation time, general editing habits, and account creation habits (which mimic your own and thinkjose) combined with their one common attention show the true purpose of them. Most sock puppets who are made have some sort of weak attempt at masking their purpose by editing a few other articles, but become rather easy to spot when you find the motivation.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 08:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I do not agree that they are immaterial. You have not accounted for the fact that some accounts were created <i>before</i> the deletion review ended and did not participate. You are not accounting for the fact that the sockpuppets voted <i>one after the other</i> in <i>multiple</i> AfDs. By saying, "I have motivation, now let me find the evidence" (you claim this when you say it is easy to spot once you have the motivation") you fall victim to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimenter%27s_bias.html" title="Experimenter's bias">Experimenter's bias</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 08:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't have to account for that. As I've stated before, its common for someone using sockpuppets to try and introduce inconsistencies in their edit history to throw people off. The point of using them is often to try and get away with it. And if someone were responsible for creating them they'd know exactly the points to try and raise to try and throw the heat off themselves. Step 1 - use a proxy server, then insist on an IP check the moment its questioned. Step 2 - introduce inconsistencies in the edit history then question them. We'll see what step 3 and 4 are. The problem is, regardless of the little inconsistencies in the side articles they participated in, they all have a common interest, and that draws the picture for us.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 08:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No I'm not. Nor have you said anything that would explain it otherwise. You claimed there was an explanation for it all yet I haven't seen it. Instead you gave a few of the comments they made on some side articles, but didn't explain why the PGNx article is the only article they all commented on, not the DRV, but the AfD. We already know that sockpuppet use has a purpose. Disruption of some process, whether its disruption through vandalism or attempts to coerce consensus to your "side" there is always a purpose. Since we know then that the sock puppets must have a purpose, what is the one purpose all the puppets were used for? You yourself admitted that 1-7 were quite obvious, so then what is the explanation? If its not to try and get the PGNx article kept, what is it? We know that vandalism obviously wasn't the purpose here. None of the puppets did that.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 09:25, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
