<dd>Arguably a good idea, but that assumes Adnan Hajj won't do anything else interesting in the future. I think this controversy stands on its own as a Wikipedia article. Also, his article is pretty slim on the bio side. Perhaps instead of merging the two, we should focus on developing his independently. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Aquila_9d4c.html" title="User:Stephen Aquila">Stephen Aquila</a></dd>

<p>Can we find the original F-16 image? The one being used is actually the photoshopped version showing 3 flares instead of 1. Perhaps a side by side similar to the smoke alteration?--Skwurlled 20:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Mr. Arromdee's edit that the images of the woman are useful. If we are going to include allegations of Reuters bias (I believe we should, but there has been reasonable debate on that issue), potentially staged images should be at least as relevant as potentially-photoshopped ones. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Aquila_9d4c.html" title="User:Stephen Aquila">Stephen Aquila</a> 04:12, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article makes a use of blogs as sources.

<dd>As it says "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources." and "Reports by anonymous individuals, or those without a track record of publication to judge their reliability, do not warrant citation at all, until such time as it is clear that the report has gained cachet, in which case it can be noted as a POV.". Yes, blogs may be used as sources, but "Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves <i>in articles about themselves</i>" (emphasis added). If it is newsworthy you should be able to find a reliable source saying the same thing. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<dd>In this situation, Chris has it right... the blogs are being used as PRIMARY sources for what the blogs themselves say, and not as secondary sources used to support statements of fact.

<p>I have several points to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note well: "messages left on blogs" means 'comments' written by <i>readers</i> (and spambots!), not 'posts' written by the bloggers themselves. There are many situations where linking to blog posts is appropriate, but linking to blog comments is <i>...shudder...</i> very rarely acceptable.</li>
<li>Note also that <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a> is a guideline, not a rigid policy.</li>
<li>Since much of this article is "about [certain blogs] themselves", <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a> explicitly allows to link to the relevant posts. In fact, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> but pretty much requires us to do so!</li>
<li>In the version that Liftarn reverted, I tried to use blogs as sources only for statements about the blogs themselves. Pointing out any where I might have failed would have been a lot less disruptive than blindly reverting several hours of hard work along with some important new links.</li>
<li>In any event, I have now done a further, smaller rewrite which (I think) ensures that every statements for which we cite a blog post is about that blog post. As always, further edits are welcome. (But <i>please</i> avoid massive reverts for a while, heh? Just sayin').</li>
<li>In the edit summaries, Liftarn claims I made a personal attack (on him); I don't believe I did. See <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html#Alleged_Personal_Attack" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">User talk:Chris Chittleborough#Alleged_Personal_Attack</a>.</li>
<li>Liftarn has written lots of stuff about this article and about me today. It's a pity he never bothered to address the very first point I made in this section:</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would be rather silly to write an article about a scandal which was uncovered by blogs without linking to those blog posts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I am glad that Liftarn thinks that "something good" happened here today. Please note that my big rewrite was <i>not</i> prompted by anything he did, was not helped in any way by anything he did and was in fact made harder by something<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy&amp;diff=74860740&amp;oldid=72159252" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy&amp;diff=74860740&amp;oldid=72159252" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> he did. Having spent several hours doing that rewrite, I have now spent several more hours dealing with Liftarn's reversions of that edit, reversions on this page, false allegations, misstatements about <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, etc, etc. If he is claiming any credit for recent improvements to this article, he is quite wrong. I have asked him to clarify his strange and infuriating remark.</li>
</ul>

<p>I firmly beleive that if I hadnät pinted out then the statements on blogs would have been taken as reliable sources. Now at least the article says that it is not fact, but something the blog says. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>

<dd>Liftarn, where did you get the strange idea that everyone else but you violates our Reliable Sources policy as a matter of routine? Your firm belief is quite wrong and completely unjustified. Please be less condescending in future. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 16:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have that idea, but I know there are many POV-pushers around and many of them do violate the Reliable Sources policy as a matter of routine. How else would you explain that so much unsourced statements could be included in the article without anybody noticing? Or even worse, revert changes asking for reliable sources. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<p>I've just spent several hours reorganising, rewording and adding links to the article. I tried to retain all the previous content; I hope I succeeded. Corrections, improvements and comments are all welcome.</p>
<p>One thing that should be fixed is that we're using two different styles for references:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lightweight format ("[<i>url</i> <i>title</i>] <i>website</i>, <i>date</i>") <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 18:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>the more complex {{cite web ...}} format</li>
</ul>
<p>I find the "cite web" template quite inappropriate for posts by bloggers who follow the rules about clearly indicating updates. What do other editors think?

<p>The article currently has only one "citation needed" marker, on the assertion that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>... shortly after this, the altered image appeared on the 7 August 2006 edition of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</dd>
</dl>
<p>(referring to the cloned smoke picture). Could someone with some spare time and a good internet connection watch the first three segments of <i>The News Hour with Jim Lehrer</i> for Monday, August 7, 2006 (available <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/past_programs/2006/august.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/past_programs/2006/august.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and edit the article accordingly?

<dd>I was the one who added the assertion, and I kept it in after watching the Internet feed and noting that the altered image was not there. I did this because segments from the show are typically missing due to copyright reasons. If someone has access to the actual show — someone who taped it or who works at PBS, for example — it would be good to double-check. Otherwise, I suppose the statement should be removed as per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>. (By the way, I agree with many of your points above; see <a href="../../../a/d/n/Talk%7EAdnan_Hajj_e1d1.html#Blogs_as_sources" title="Talk:Adnan Hajj">Talk:Adnan_Hajj#Blogs_as_sources</a> for similar comments I made a couple of hours prior to yours.) <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 18:33, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one has come forward yet, so I've cut that sentence and pasted it here:
<dl>
<dd>However, shortly after this, the altered image appeared on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> edition of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_NewsHour_with_Jim_Lehrer_003c.html" title="The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer">The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</a></i>.</dd>

<dd>If someone produces a cite, we'll put it back, but it seems unlikely at this stage.

<p>I propose to merge this article into <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_photographs_controversies_a28a.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict photographs controversies">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict photographs controversies</a> to avoid excessive fragmentation. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosmopolis_4924.html" title="User:Kosmopolis">Kosmopolis</a> 12:14, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think they are two distinct things and that that's excessive merging (since <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_5628.html" title="Adnan Hajj">Adnan Hajj</a> was already merged with this). I think that we run the danger of over-merging: This might eventually be merged with <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" title="Pallywood">Pallywood</a> and/or <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_coverage_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_4cba.html" title="Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, diluting the article and making it seem either more biased or less controversial, depending on how the merge takes place. Of course, future merges would have to be dealt with separately, but my point is that the <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy_15e4.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs controversy">Adnan Hajj photographs controversy</a> is more focused and less open to interpretation than <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_photographs_controversies_a28a.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict photographs controversies">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict photographs controversies</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 20:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You would have thought if someone was going to digitally alter their photos (for whatever reason) they would at least make it look semi-realistic. Did anyone (including Reuter's editors) actually believe that the photos were real? With the one of smoke above Beirut in particular it is just so immediately obvious that it has been edited its silly and the F-16 is obviously firing flares not missiles, regardless of how many it actually fired; anyone with any aircraft knowledge could tell you missiles don't look like that. Oh well, gave me a good laugh. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 16:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
