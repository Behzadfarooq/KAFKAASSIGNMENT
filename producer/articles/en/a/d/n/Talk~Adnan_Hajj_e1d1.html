<dd>re. staged.</dd>
<dd>Don't know if it's worth a mention, but there's definitively speculation in that direction and when he already has been caught with a hoax once, perhaps it's mandated. Here's a few cites:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The passage from the Reuters cite:</dd>
<dd>“He was among several photographers from the main international news agencies whose images of a dead child being held up by a rescuer in the village of Qana, south Lebanon, after an Israeli air strike on July 30 have been challenged by blogs critical of the mainstream media's coverage of the Middle East conflict.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And further:</dd>
<dd>“A number of web logs in the United States and Britain have claimed that a man who appeared in much of the international press's coverage of the Qana bombing lifting children's bodies may have been a Hizbullah agent who staged photo-ops for the international media.”</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I made the <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_b0ca.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs">Adnan Hajj photographs</a> article in order to combine the stuff on here with the stuff in the <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> article and to nudge this page towards having more biographical information, similar to how <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Mapes_3881.html" title="Mary Mapes">Mary Mapes</a> has more biographical information than <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a>. However, no other biographical information has yet become known. Some suspect <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/014912.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/014912.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/184242.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/184242.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that photographs attributed to "Adnan Hajj" are not necessarily all taken by a man named "Adnan Hajj." (And, in fact, Reuters has admitted that there was some misattribution involved.) This might be a one-time mistake, Hajj might be one of many photographers, or "Hajj" might be a mere alias. (Both words are very common as Arab names, yet more distinctive to Western ears than something like "Mohammad Abdullah.") If this is the case, it certainly would affect how or if a merge is done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of this, and since none of the other players in the scandal have yet become known, the two articles are currently very similar, and someone looking up one might not notice the other without using the links. However, I'd hold off on a merge until it's clear whether this scandal looks more like the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Glass_ad05.html" title="Stephen Glass">Stephen Glass</a> scandal (where the person and scandal pretty much remained equivalent) or more like the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a> scandal. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 17:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, dear. That's a lot of articles.

<dd>I vote 'no' on the merge. While the article today still has too much biographical info on AH, I believe the Wikipedia article on Fauxtography shoul, and will, broaden over time to include much more about the fauxtography phenomena in general, the Lebanon/AH photos will be just one case, and will of course be an important historical footnote to the begining of the use of the term. Google hits on the word are now at 425,000, whereas they were just over 800 last week on 2006-08-09 at about 11 pm Central European time. The term is bigger than the incident.

<dd>I'll remove the merge tag, since no one (other than <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DDG</a>) seems to think this and Hajj should be merged. As far as other potential merges, I still say hold out for more information. What started as "Reutergate" has turned into a plethora of allegations of misleading reporting, many having no connection to Hajj. Time will tell whether or not they should be merged. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 18:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Coming from the Lebanon articles, I can tell you that there are currently far to many subarticles, and efforts to consolidate would be much appreciated. Personally, I think this should be merged to the "Adnan Hajj photographs controversy" as that is his primary notability, and despite your concerns (or perhaps because of them if you explore the Sock possibility), I don't see anything else justifying this page. But whichever you choose, try to turn these two pages into one.

<p>Considering this biography of a living person deals in speculation and attacks him in every paragraph, does not mention any of his work aside from the two photographs and reuters work, it is fair to say it suffers from a POV bias, and so a tag of that nature has been added. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 10:31, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, firstly, this is a Biog of a living person, yet all thats in it is an attack piece regarding the images. Secondly, not all the claims are cited.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>Adnan Hajj is reportedly a Lebanese Islamist</i> - Is this a self description or is this someones opinion of him? Its unsourced, despite the link to <a href="http://www.salam.sy/query.php?name=&amp;job=&amp;country=&amp;city=&amp;family=&amp;page=105&amp;fpage=100" class="external text" title="http://www.salam.sy/query.php?name=&amp;job=&amp;country=&amp;city=&amp;family=&amp;page=105&amp;fpage=100" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

<dd>Is it unsourced, or can you just not read Arabic? Either the citation is relevant or it isn't. We're trying to figure that out right now. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Aquila_9d4c.html" title="User:Stephen Aquila">Stephen Aquila</a> 16:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I suppose it is the “Islamist” you object to. And I agree. I suspect it is a nonsense word used in the same manner as “Zionist” which is often brandished about. However there is a cite, which I cannot read. So I think the correct thing would be to wait a little while for the person providing the cite come back and give some information. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune_X2_d1ac.html" title="User:Rune X2">Rune X2</a> 17:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think someone anonymous (84.99.23.206) first posited the Jihad/Islamist claim and pointed to the links, then Nhaqueoi added "reportedly." Unless and until we get a translator (maybe try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translators_available#Arabic-to-English" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translators_available#Arabic-to-English" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>?), it might be safe to remove the claims. Especially since, as I said before, Adnan Hajj is a pretty generic name, and it could always be a case of mistaken identity. It's pretty tacky to have the "citation needed" next to a citation already there, especially in the head of the article. I'll move the section to the talk page; if someone objects, it can be moved back. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 17:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes the Arab-Israeli conflict. That in itself doesn’t imply that he has taken photos of everything. But if you want to change it to 2006 Israeli Lebanese conflict, that’d be fine with me.

<p>This article makes a lot of use of blogs as sources. Please read up on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> where it says "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources." and "self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Reread the above in context. Blogs <i>are</i> okay; <i>comments</i> on blogs by random, anonymous people are not. Similarly, blogs may not be <i>largely</i> acceptable as sources, but they <i>can</i> be acceptable. Finally, considering the role the blog in question played in this controversy, it is only right that the blog itself be referenced. I'm reverting the changes based on this and reverting the unilateral merge. A merge may well be warranted at this point (since Hajj still hasn't made himself public, if he exists at all), but it should be discussed before being done. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 19:41, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems that the discussion above set certain criteria for merging. Most importantly, no new biographical (or other) info has emerged about him, so that everything here is duplicated at <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy_15e4.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs controversy">Adnan Hajj photographs controversy</a>. I understand your concern about the merge; what other issues do you feel may still exist?

<dl>
<dd>Well, my main concern was that the discussion above seemed to agree that a merge would be premature. I'd like a discussion (or at least a merge request) to occur prior to a merge. If all information is duplicated, it might be best to start out excising such information, relabeling as a stub, pointing to the other article, and then asking for a merge. Clearly it would be a stronger case at that point. Although I personally think a stub for Hajj would be appropriate, especially one that ended with, "No other personal information has emerged about Hajj, nor has he talked with any media outlets other than Reuters." <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 18:40, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As the only information we have is in the context of the controversy, it seems that once you follow that procedure, you would end up with a solitary line: <i>Adnan Hajj was a freelancer in Lebanon responsible for the <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy_15e4.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs controversy">Adnan Hajj photographs controversy</a>.</i> I just don't understand what the point of such an article would be, especially as this type of case seems to be exactly what <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a> have in mind. But perhaps I misunderstand you - what alternative outcome do you think will be achieved?

<dl>
<dd>I'm just arguing for the process, not a specific outcome. By the way, if a merge does occur, a pointer to this talk page might be appropriate. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 22:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a perfect place to apply <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">WP:Bold</a>. There is no controversy surrounding this merge, and all of the conditions set in the discussion above point to merging as being the next step. While process is certainly important, there is no reason to let bureaucratic procedure stifle encyclopedia writing (also per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>). <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 17:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">WP:Bold</a> clearly states not to ignore discussion and unilaterally make your own decision.
