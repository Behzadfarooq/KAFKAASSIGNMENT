<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi there, how you doing? Let me start off by saying that I'm very impressed with your interest and participation in Wiki. Images can be cut and posted, there is no problem with that. The image of Ari came from the wallpaper section of the the website. Wallpapers or screensavers are free to the public and it is assumed that the owner of the site is offering them on good faith. Our concern is to post the source and it's copyright status. The original wallpaper site does not state that the image is copyrighted (other wise it wouldn't be a free wallpaper) therefore, there is no copyright violation on our behave and it is assumed in good faith that the image is public domain. Anyway, besides that consider me your friend if I can ever assist you in anyway please do not hesitate to drop me a line.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow"><i>Hi Tony! I've voted to keep the image. I'm sorry this newbie has done this - there's nothing unencyclopedic about the image, it's in good taste, and it's PD. If that doesn't make it suitable for Wikipedia, I don't know what does. Anyway, have a great Christmas! David Cannon 04:46, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</i></font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hello. This means that the copyright holder for the image is willing to let Wikipedia use the image for free, but if some other site copies Wikipedia's content, that other site does <i>not</i> have permission to use the image. But there's a problem with that. Wikipedia is a "free" Encyclopedia, meaning other sites (like Answers.com and Infopedia.com) copy all Wikipedia's content, and that's okay, so long as their sites are also free. So if only Wikipedia has permission to use it, then ironically, Wikipedia <i>won't</i> use it, because we want Wikipedia to stay free and non-exclusive. That's why any images tagged this way get deleted after 7 days, unless the copyright holder agrees to release the image under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. (Then it gets tagged {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} instead.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">How are you? Thanks for writing. You know, even though 8 administrator (including myself) voted to keep the old image, I kept my promise that I would upload a new image regardless of the results and I kept my word. Images that are either movie or TV screens qualify as fair use according to Wiki policy. Even though the copyright holder is the film company, these screen images are put into PD for promotional purposes. Hey, remember, dispite the old issue involved, I'm here for you as a Wiki friend.

<p>(aka: Rms125a@hotmail.com)</p>
<p>As I told Arwel Perry, the only reason there were so many changes on Convy and others since is because I had a LOT of trouble with the parameters, columns, spaceing, etc. I couldn't leave it messed up, so I had to fix it by trying every way I could, and unfortunately, that creates continuous reproductions that appear as multiple edits on the same subject, which Hywel Perry told me was what aroused his suspicions.</p>
<p>I really hope I can get the hang of the spacing, parameters and columns so I don't have to keep going back and fiddling with it to make it perfect. I assure you I don;t find that fun.</p>
<p>Somebody changed my Username Signature, so I went from Rms125a@hotmail.com (although I still register that way) to "Robbie". I contacted a mediator, Theresa Knott, about this matter.

<p>You informed me and I quote: <i>You're continuing to make problematic edits, including removing the date of death from Marilyn Monroe, and claiming the edit was minor when it wasn't. Please edit in accordance with our content policies. Many thanks, SlimVirgin (talk) 04:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I therefore assumed that you took issue with that one thing; I didn't realize all of my edits were unacceptable; if so, why, as most of them are factual or issues of minor syntax. I didn't put anything inflammatory or untrue. <a href="../../../r/m/s/User%7ERms125a%40hotmail.com_3ce9.html" title="User:Rms125a@hotmail.com">Rms125a@hotmail.com</a> 05:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why did you revert date changes to the Sean T O'Kelly and Douglas Hyde articles? It has long been Wikipedia policy to use the local date usage for British, Irish and American articles. All Irish articles are supposed to be written in the international format dd/mm/yyyy not the US format mm/dd/yyyy. All that happened was the some users, perhaps innocently, added in some US format dates to articles originally written, and supposed to be written as per policy in dd/mm/yyyy. The user in question then corrected them both to match the format we are supposed to use and the form of dates already used elsewhere in the article. If someone is changing UK, US or Irish articles to their localised date form all they are doing is following WP policy and removing breaks in policy. Please do not revert such changes. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:02, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
