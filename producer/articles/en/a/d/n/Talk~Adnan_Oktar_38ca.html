<p>"An Illusion of Harmony: Science And Religion in Islam (Hardcover)" by Taner Edis should have extensive discussion of Yahya. Due out in January, though much might be available online if you ask the author.</p>
<p>I think that there are far too many 'Harun Yahya' books for 'Harun Yahya' to be simply a pen name for Adnan Oktar - rather 'Harun Yahya' is the flag of convenience behind the entire Turkish creationist movement...</p>

<p>I believe that at least parts of many of the Harun Yahya creationist books are plagiarized translations of works by U.S.-based young-earth creationists, e.g., from the Institute for Creation Research. (Taner Edis may have documented this in one of his articles on Turkish creationism.) <a href="../../../l/i/p/User%7ELippard_a81c.html" title="User:Lippard">Lippard</a> 19:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just for the record, Harun Yahya is vastly popular throughout Asia and is acclaimed throughout the world by people of different religions, be they Muslims, Christians, Jews, or others. The article, which calls him an anti-this, anti-that, and a Holocaust denier, is therefore completely biased. Also for the record, Harun Yahya is not a Holocaust denier: he has referred to it in many of his books. Please, be neutral. Konstable and Jeff5102 are shooting their mouths off, and so are people like Darashala and Zahid. Zahid, I personally agree with most of what you're saying, but please don't be so vociferous about it. State it calmly and neutrally.</p>
<p>At the moment the article is written very much from the point of view of the subject; it needs to be edited into a more neutral style. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:24, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I thought the changes i made were self -expanatory: on each item i put in what each side thought, which seems to be the only plausible approach for this article since adnan oktar and his sect is highly controversial, very much like scientology in the US. A lot of the stuff that I deleted was his propaganda in any case, Mel, can you point to any part of the article which you thought was unfairly deleted?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to justify your removal of text, especially such a large amount of text. You claim that you deleted propaganda, but you need to back up that claim. I also don't understand the wholesale removal of the bibliography (nor the insistence on changing the headings to non-Wikipedia style). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:33, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I cannot understand what "a lot of text" means if it doesnot say anything. I mean i can put a lot of stuff there which says nothing, right? For the biography, it is not essential info, it is also listed in his web page. Do you think it adds a lot to our knowledge of him? About the controversiality of the issue, do you have anybody around you that knows turkish? he can verify the controversiality of the person, here is one news article about him that just came out today, mentioning he want to jail for cocain use in 1985, then went out by getting a mental illness report, he and his supporters were again jailed in 1999 for blackmailing Istanbul DYP deputy Celal Adan, stayed in jail for another tem months and so on. <a href="http://www.gecce.com/pages/haber_detay.asp?haber=44514" class="external free" title="http://www.gecce.com/pages/haber_detay.asp?haber=44514" rel="nofollow">http://www.gecce.com/pages/haber_detay.asp?haber=44514</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't follow all of this, but it seems to boil down to a repeated claim that your edits are justified, with no attempt to provide the justification, and the argument that, because the bibliography appears elsewhere it shouldn't appear in Wikipdia. That implies that you've misunderstood what Wikipedia is; it's an encyclopædia that doesn't allow original research — so <i>everything</i> here appears somewhere else. Look at other articles on writers, artists, musicians, composers, etc., and you'll see lists of works, all of which will appear elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>As for newspaper reports, it's fine to say that a newspaper has made a claim, but not to repeat the claim as simple fact. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
TO be hoonest i think you are being naive and turning wikipedia propaganda for a particular sect. As for the legal allegations on him, not even the sect memebers would deny, becuase they are common knowledge. I do not know how to make them more solid; perphaps go to turkish courts and scan the the court documents and post them? If I have time later I will try to do that, but for the momemnt i guess ill have to let you have your way and make this article a propaganda device for a controversial sect.</p>

<p>Zahid, I did not write those claims, but it seems to be that the language is as neutral as it can be. It does not present those accusations as facts, rather it presents them as allegations against him. And even says that he denies them. If you think that they are POV, please do not delete them before discussing them here first. If you feel that this article is not neutral or factually accurate, you can flag it with the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallyDisputed_5b5d.html" title="Template:TotallyDisputed">{{totallydisputed}}</a> tag.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 04:30, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This person is clearly documented to suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia by the military hospitals in Turkey where he has many followers and is oficially criminally insane. Upon all that and understanding his remaining rights to be respected, I have difficulty seeing Wikipedia claiming him to be the leader cited in his website. I see most of the text cited here are from his website and needs to be marked clearly that this person is not sane enough to hold responsibility for what he says or writes.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.225.95.229 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.225.95.229.html" title="User talk:24.225.95.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.225.95.229_8b46.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.225.95.229">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Unfortunately this article has very serious POV problems. I also suggest the contributors of the article to read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. What gives an article its quality is the quality of the sources, you can always find some obscure, self-serving source to cite. I even wonder whether he is worth for a wikipedia article at all, after all what is his contribution? From reading the article -if you never heard of him before- you can easily get the wrong idea that he is an intelectual or an important person in Turkey, which is not the case. The article doesn't mention his sect, his nicely dressed-up,upper class followers, his sex scandals, allegations etc,his ability to avoid judicial persecution, well the Turkish public forgot about all these events. There is also no evidence that he wrote all these books, if I remember correctly, in the court he even denied the authorship for some of them. It was also shown that for example his anti-Darwinist book is full of copy-paste material from American creationist books from 1950s. His books on Freemasonry are just list of names of Freemasons currently in Turkey and not call him an antisemite is really POV. It is sad that many articles in wikipedia about Turkey become propaganda material with very low quality. -<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgonit_5237.html" title="User:Argonit">Argonit</a> 23:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have watched some of his documentaries, and the factual accuracy is pretty bad. And the facts and evidence that he does have are often used to mislead irrelevant.

When talking about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Realism_dc84.html" title="Social Realism">Social Realism</a> he shows old people in an art class and talks about how true art is impossible in "materialistic" regimes.

<p>I know, he says he cannot be refuted, but I read through several of his books and noticed quote-mining and lies almost straight away. He is either very ingnorant or very deceitful. He also seems to think that the stone age never happened, even though I've been to Stonehenge and many other stone-age sites. (217.17.112.173 14:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC))</p>

A part of my ‘Oktar falsely quotes Orwell’-contribution to this article is deleted, because it is ´personal research’.</p>
<p>Well I did research on what Oktar said Orwell meant, and I did research on what Orwell meant, and there was a big difference between the two meanings.</p>
<p>And yes, this was a personal research. But what do the guidelines say about ‘original research’?</p>
<p>It includes unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, and ideas; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that appears to advance a position or, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation.”</p>
<p>As well Oktars text as Orwells text are published. That Oktar uses <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misquote.html" title="Misquote">misquotes</a> is already known. And looking for sources is allowed, and I did not do anything else.</p>
<p>So my question to the fellow wikipedians is: was my contribution according to the guidelines, or not?<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff5102_c075.html" title="User:Jeff5102">Jeff5102</a> 13:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one is "rejecting" anything. A link to the main HY site which talks about his activities in a positive light is okay. Another link to justify a statment that "Some parties allege that he is sufferring from paranoid schizophrenia" is also okay. To censor any criticism of the man is to make the article one sided. It's a fact that atleast some people (for whatever agenda) consider him a paranoid schizophrenic (I can't read Turkish but I assume that's the point that the turkish links support).

And yet you believe that those who are sceptical about Oktars work are prejudiced. Please give me the proofs that Oktar is not making up his Pompeii-story. If I am prejudiced, and you are not, you can prove this by answering my questions. If not, my guess is that you are overestimating yourself.

<p>Orwell part consists a lot of percentage of this article. Is this relevant in a boigraphy? Jeff5102 is very keen to publish his research here and he doesn't have any other related place to publish it! He gave a link of Orwell's lablablab. Maybe that will work. But, don't put a lot of lablablab in the article. I think, maybe, Adnan Oktar will find this page and write a lot of argument against this (He has a habit of writing a lot)(just joking).

<p>This article is about a living person -thus a biography about a living person. I strongly suggest we discuss the notability issues. Reading <a href="../../../n/n/o/WP%7ENNOT_83a0.html" title="WP:NNOT">WP:NNOT</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> could be useful. I can understand the motives of the creator of this article and but after reading those relevant wikipedia passages, i dont think Oktar article would pass the test. He is just not important enough. Maybe his name and contributions could be mentioned, if there were articles on Muslim creationism or Turkish anti-darwinism or Turkish sects etc. But he is just a controversial and mediatic figure, without prominence in either right-wing or Islamist circles. I saw much better articles with a POV or bias sign? Why not this one, are we afraid of the facts? <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgonit_5237.html" title="User:Argonit">Argonit</a> 00:26, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears that paragraphs that show Adnan Oktar in a not-so-flattering light are being removed. Gentlemen: if we want this article to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> we have to show his faults as well! He wasn't perfect.

<p>The only reason I can see for the existence of an wikipedia article about him is propaganda. Unfortunately, the content of the article reflects this. The article cannot be improved very easily because most people know very little about him. There is only his books, his sect and the foundation. Currently he is more engaged in evolution-Darwin-creationism issues. However, there is no public discussion about it. The article, in its current form with self-references is very weak. To improve it, one has to remove self-referential internet links and perhaps write more about the sect and its past activities. His books are many and some of them were distributed in universities for free! As mentioned in one of the links in the article, we are dealing here with a person with a lot of connections and criminal activity. I still don't understand why there is no <s>NPOV</s>{{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} sign -<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgonit_5237.html" title="User:Argonit">Argonit</a> 20:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. I have a feeling the people who have been removing his criticism section are either members of his cult or just his supporters.

<p>I also suupport the {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag. Because, some people are so much against him that they even don't want a page about him. They are removing contents (that show good signs of Adnan Oktar) for their resemblance with the official harun Yahya site. Though I am not a member of his sect/followers/cult (I didn't know about their existence. Maybe Darwin have a sect/followers/cult! Just joking.), I can't support it. I support truth. Please, just admit that, he is not a messenger of God. He surely have some mistakes and faults. He also have done something which caused a wide publicity. I am writing from thosands of miles away. I read his books and seen the videos. I just make the decision from the contents of the books.<a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitt_61e3.html" title="User:Jitt">Jitt</a> 08:05, 6 August 2006 (UTC) Just follow the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons</a> and read it.<a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitt_61e3.html" title="User:Jitt">Jitt</a> 08:12, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that whether people are for or against him is the issue here. I couldn't care less about him, but I just want that the quality of the article gets better. But how this is possible, when people constantly will erase the nasty facts about him. After all, he had 7 independent medical reports about his mental health since 1983 and he himself used these reports not to get convicted. He himself wrote a book called "Holocause Lie". He and his groups threatened some politicians and journalists. These are all facts. Even if they will get constantly erased, you cannot change the facts. If he is not a Holocaust Denier, why then you(Oktar) spend your time for writing such a book? Therefore i cannot see the reason for recent edits of erasing all these facts, except being highly biased about him and not being able to accept these facts. How you can say that people are removing good things about him, when currently the article looks like his website? It is much more difficult to write a biography about a living person especially about such a contraversial figure with a lot of scandals. -<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgonit_5237.html" title="User:Argonit">Argonit</a> 12:37, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The peoples of the occupied countries were subjected to terrible cruelty, especially those in the category of "inferior races" such as the Jews, Slavs and Gypsies. Millions of people were sent to camps to be used as slave labor. Soon, these camps turned into extermination camps according to the "Final Solution" adapted at the notorious Wannsee Conference by Hitler and his associates. The gas chambers specially designed to kill humans first used carbon monoxide and then Zyklon B. In the gas chambers and other methods of mass extermination, a total of 5.5 million Jews, 3 million Poles, almost 1 million Gypsies and hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war from various nations were brutally murdered.</i> Btw.

<p>As I painfully experienced, quoting original sources (like you do) is considered here as "original research", and that is not allowed on wikioedia. Howevever, according to the reports on the “Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today”-site, he really is credited as a Holocaust denier.</p>

<p><i>“As in previous years, the Islamist organization Bilim Arastirma Vakfi (Foundation for Scientific Research), led by Adnan Oktar (better known as Adnan Hodja), continued to slander Jews. It draws support from educated and wealthy young men and women but, unlike RP, most of its followers do not adopt Muslim dress or attend mosques regularly. Oktar is notorious for his virulent attacks on Israel, Jews and Freemasons.</i></p>
<p><i>In 1996 the foundation distributed two books entitled the "Holocaust Lie The Inside Story of the Secret History of the Zionist-Nazi Co-operation and the Lie About Jewish Genocide" (originally published in 1995) and the "New Masonic Order”.</i></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><i>The publication in December 1995 of "Holocaust Lie The Inside Story of the Secret History of the Zionist-Nazi Co-operation and the Lie About Jewish Genocide" sparked much public debate throughout 1996.</i></p>
<p><i>In March 1996 a leading Turkish painter and intellectual, Bedri Baykam, published a strongly worded critique in the Ankara daily newspaper Siyah-Beyaz (Black and White). A legal suit for slander was subsequently brought against Baykam by Nuri Özbudak, who claimed to have written the book under the pseudonym of Harun Yahya. During the trial in September, Baykam exposed the real author of the book as Adnan Oktar, leader of Bilim Arastirma Vakfi ...</i></p>
<p><i>Baykam also stated in court that genocide against the Jews was an indisputable historical fact. He condemned the book and proclaimed that all Turks who upheld human rights and democracy should react strongly against it too. By the end of the year the trial had not yet been concluded, but it appeared that Özbudak would drop the case</i>.”</p>

<p>Maybe. Let me state this in case of the Orwell-part:<br /></p>
<p>According to wikipedia-rules, in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> this all is excluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution;</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I do not introduce that.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces original ideas;</li>
</ul>
<p><i>It is already known that Oktar uses <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misquote.html" title="Misquote">misquotes</a>: nothing original here.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>It defines new terms;</li>

<p><i>I do not define new terms</i></p>

<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</li>

<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I cited the two main sources: both writers.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>

<p><i>And this I did not do either.</i></p>

<dd>The Orwell 'refutation' looks like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to me. It refers directly to primary material (the Orwell book) and doesn't identify who has decided that Oktar is misquoting in this instance. Just because someone has said that Oktar misquotes, doesn't mean an editor can carte-blanche add 'evidence' of anything that appears to be a misquote to them.</dd>

<p>Why the Orwell refutation is on the article at all? I think the article will definitely benefit from its removal. About the alleged schizophrenia, I see no reason to put it in the article.

<p>Schizophrenia is a medical pathology with serious symptoms. The diagnosis was established on several occasions by different and well-known Turkish hospitals since 1983.

<p><br />
Harun yahya is far from being an author. Now, I am sure you are asking me to prove it.</p>
<p>Here is the proof: Look at all his webpages, and find 1 single indication that he graduated from any type of college or university. His followers combine the info from other authors, and gather them to make it look like Harun Yahya wrote it. Any ex-follower is ready to testify it in ant court. They basiucally steal from other authors and make it look like they are his.</p>

<p>Adnan Oktar (or Harun Yahya) was previously sentenced and served a time in jail for using cocaine. Later on, to not serve mendatory military service in Turkey; he claimed himself to be "crazy". He was approved by Bakırköy Ruh ve Sinir Hastalıkları Hospital that he was actually insane and did not serve in the military.</p>
<p>He once claimed himself to be the "mehdi", (the guy that will come previously from Christ), and later on the mass sex scandals were in the media quite for a while. ( Link&#160;: <a href="http://www.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=haberdetay&amp;tarih=17.10.2005&amp;Newsid=62568&amp;Categoryid=1" class="external free" title="http://www.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=haberdetay&amp;tarih=17.10.2005&amp;Newsid=62568&amp;Categoryid=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=haberdetay&amp;tarih=17.10.2005&amp;Newsid=62568&amp;Categoryid=1</a> ) or just make a google search on news. Use "Adnan Hoca" or "Adnan Oktar" instead of Harun Yahya. He tries this name, so once you make a google search you won't discover who he really is.</p>
<p>His followers were known as being extremly wealth, living extreme high quality life standards for Turkey. (Current minimum wage is 300 dollars in Turkey, back then it was about 90 dollars) His followers drives Range Rovers, Mercedeses and Ferraris. Many video tapes were caught, their followers catching new potentials by offering sex with prostitutes was always in the news in Turkey.</p>
<p>Currently he is backed up by Fethullah Güven; and he spends over one hundred million dollars a year to turn Turkey into an islamic regime.</p>
<p>Yet nothing "against" can be written about this insane human being&#160;? (He is officially insane with an hospital report, and I'm allowed to call him this way)</p>
<p>Come on Wikipedia, don't be this low. You're the creation of the free mind, make some research&#160;!</p>
<p>He does have 7 reports from various hospitals that tells you he is mentally sick</p>

<p>I am sorry to be sound very harsh on my first post but people here do not seem to have the ability to argue. If you have something to say against Harun Yahya's articles then go publish a book. If people have tried to argue against him then he is very quick to reply.</p>
<p>The military terrorrist junta of Turkey had ideological reasons to degrade Harun Yahya as much as possible. Thus, they tried to label him as mentally degenerate and one who deals with cocaine. Excellent reasoning behind the people who because of their narrow mindedness pick up on it.</p>

<p>thank you, and here is more:</p>
<p>I am shocked to see when I came here "(wiki). I always heard incredible things about wikipedia, finally today I had time to join. I looked up a lot of thing i was interested. When I saw a criminal, mentaly sick person portrayed as leader, thinker, educated person, I WAS SHOCKED.</p>
<p>adnan oktar is not only criminal, he has 7 or more mentally il reports from different institutions. Look at his life story, and you will see that he absolutely has not enought education to write 250 books (like he or his followers claim).</p>
<p>I hope someone wipe this terrible person off of here!</p>
<p>What I don't understand here is: If I am from Indonesia and put some rapist/serial killer's name here and write wonderful things and lies about him, everyone who reads it believes it? Or are they suppose to believe it? That's exactly what happened about adnan oktar here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Greatmuslim (<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreatmuslim_643d.html" title="User talk:Greatmuslim">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Greatmuslim_a4ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Greatmuslim">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi Jeff, no problem. I am glad you are also pleased with my recent edits... Assuming you were actually being sarcastic you would do well to remember that Wikipedia is a collaborative effort. As someone independant to the article, I tried to edit it to improve it in good faith - not to damage the work of others. Where I've asked for citations I think they would be useful, this isnt something I did for fun - but to improve the article. Edit comments like "this is silly but if Midgely (sic) wants it" are unhelpful. Enjoy the rest of your day. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgleyDJ_85d5.html" title="User:MidgleyDJ">MidgleyDJ</a> 02:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How did people approve this adnan oktar page? Did they do an investigation? Did they ask around? Do they have any idea about how many family lifes shattered? Do they have any idea about how many lawsuits are still going on against him?</p>
<p>Who gave them right to publish this criminal as a hero and thinker? Who gave them right to make decision for this clown to be introduced to public via wikipedia? I am just curious, not mad yet..</p>
<p>Thank you(look below)</p>
<p>1980s, while he was alredy in trouble with government for radical Islam propoganda, he formed a group of young, rich, famous people. With his special mental abilities, he discovered that he can easily manipulate young brains. So, he started picking more bright, and rich people.</p>

<p>Wikipedia policy is not transforming a rapist into an hero, it is to conserve an objective and neutral point of view on the event (whatever emotional content they may have), let's his deeds speeks for themselves.

Adnan Oktar (pen name: Harun Yahya) is claimed on his web page to be a 'world renown and respected scholar' who has devoted himself to writing about scientific and faith-related subjects such as the theory of evolution and miracles of God. He is further described by supporters as a respected 'scientist' who has publications in incredibly diverse areas of interest (actually he is not a university graduate).</p>
<p>The fact is that, his publications and his foundation (Science Research Foundation) have recently been banned in Turkey, and most members of his "sect" have been sent to court. This was not due to their Islamic and scientific activities, but due to crimes such as blackmail, extortion, possession of unlicensed weapons and sexual intercourse with minors.</p>
<p>About three years ago, upon complaints of victims and many years of suspicion, Turkish police raided residences of this group. The discoveries at the houses and testimony of the group members were shocking.</p>
<p>Under the mask of promoting Islam and scientific facts, the group members had been found to engage in extensive criminal activity. These crimes included blackmail, possession of unlicensed weapons and sexual intercourse with individuals under age 18.</p>
<p>The head of the group, Adnan Oktar (recorded by police cameras, leaked and shown on Turkish TV channels such as Kanal D, ATV, Star) confessed to blackmailing people who they regarded as an obstacle to their enterprises. These people included the reporters for the newspaper Hurriyet, Emin Colasan, and Fatih Altayli, after they questioned some of Harun Yahya's activities such as bribing the municipality of Ankara.</p>
<p>Also politicians such as Celal Adan (Member of the Parliament) and Mesut Yilmaz (former Prime Minister of Turkey) have been victims of this group. Oktar's group arranged fake (photomontage) photos of Mesut Yilmaz in Freemason clothes and ceremonies, and forged a fake certificate of Freemasonary for him. This fake was taken seriously and published in several pro-Islamic newspapers (without knowing it was a fraud). The PM was seriously damaged politically as a result during the remainder of his government.</p>
<p>Also coming forth, a fashion model named Ebru Simsek was blackmailed, and then slandered as a "prostitute" in fax messages sent to hundreds of different newspapers, TV channels, major business companies, foreign consulates, government offices etc. The reason for the slander? She refused to have sex with Adnan Oktar.</p>
<p>But the most shocking activities of Oktar's and his followers were not the above. In the sudden raid, 20 women and 2 other men were found at his residence. Most of the females (girls really) were under the age 18, (Oktar is his middle 40's) and they claimed that they had been having sexual intercourse with Oktar and members of his sect.</p>
<p>In his testimony, Oktar claimed that he had committed no crime as the intercourse was consensual, allowed under Turkish law. Further, Oktar insisted that this intercourse was also religiously permissible under Islam because he and his followers did not have a 'real sexual intercourse with these girls'.</p>
<p>He and his followers claimed that they had only engaged in 'anal and oral' sex. They preferred this kinds of sexual intercourse since according to Koran, he claimed, these acts are not impermissible outside of marriage. According to their interpretation 'vaginal' intercourse was 'haram' but 'anal and oral intercourse' was 'halal' when not married.</p>
<p>So you wonder what happened in the end?</p>
<p>Science Research Foundation was closed. Adnan Oktar (aka Harun Yahya), and about 40 of his sect members were taken to the court and judged. Once there, they denied the truth of their original confessions, claiming that they were extracted under torture.</p>
<p>The judicial process lasted over 2 years, during which most of the complainants' retracted their claims because of threats or bribes from sect members. As a result most of the cases against these people were dismissed, with only two of them jail for 1 year each.</p>
<p>That said, coverage of the arrests and trials were so extensive in Turkey that the reputation (and money making opportunities) of the group were permanently destroyed. It is now taken seriously only in foreign countries where their legal troubles received little or no press coverage. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/s/u/User%7EEsurnir_e6cd.html" title="User:Esurnir">Esurnir</a> (<a href="../../../e/s/u/User_talk%7EEsurnir_d3f4.html" title="User talk:Esurnir">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Esurnir_b001.html" title="Special:Contributions/Esurnir">contribs</a>) 21:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Ok the first thing that strike me as a man who never heard of that guy before is that there is a huge lack of date in that article (both the article and that *cough* contribution), because I really lack of sources about Adnan Oktar and most of them are written in a language that I can't understand nor read ^^' could you fill some date on the event (like when was he emprisoned, the date when he published his book... for the bio, not the list, the list will be handled in due time, and most certainly shortened). I will add a to do list on the top of the article so we can work more properly. -- <a href="../../../e/s/u/User%7EEsurnir_e6cd.html" title="User:Esurnir">Esurnir</a> 22:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't believe this! I know this guy, he is a criminal, he had many charges, how can I make it happen? How can I put the REAL stuff about this guy at front page?</p>
<p>I am excited, someone let me know please .....</p>
<p>Also, where is it written or shown who created this wiki adnan oktar page? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.220.18.41_9cc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.220.18.41">68.220.18.41</a> (talk) 00:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>It is not about "making people look good" it is about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>, wich is a wikipedia official content policy, to quote the best part&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<p>"<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> offered the following advice in the context of the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>You won't even <i>need</i> to say he was evil. That is why the article on <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> does not start with "Hitler was a bad man" — we don't need to, his deeds convict him a thousand times over. We just list the facts of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> dispassionately, and the voices of the dead cry out afresh in a way that makes name-calling both pointless and unnecessary. Please do the same: list Saddam's crimes, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite your sources</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Remember that readers will probably not take kindly to moralising. If you do not allow the facts to speak for themselves you may alienate readers and turn them against your position."</p>
<p>If you would like to add the <b>fact</b> about Adnan Hoca criminal views/life/whatever, that's ok, but don't add "He was a bastard" or weasel word or irony like "and guess what". You take your bio, rework it a litle, add the <b>fact</b> cite your sources (and if you see something else that you doubt Adnan Oktar never did or is overdone. You are free to report it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia policy is not transforming a rapist into an hero, it is to conserve an objective and neutral point of view on the event (whatever emotional content they may have), let's his deeds speeks for themselves. And btw, one of the wikipedia policy is not to give an undue weight to a viewpoint. So if you think that the guy is too much revered in this article, we incitate you to review the fact about the guy to make the bias more even. So please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>Oh btw, I'm currently (as you can see just on the previous section) working to get this unbiased. But if you got unbiased fact with source, feel free to add them (and without ironny). -- <a href="../../../e/s/u/User%7EEsurnir_e6cd.html" title="User:Esurnir">Esurnir</a> 01:44, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
