<p><a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumposition.html" title="Circumposition">Circumposition</a> redirects here, but this article says nothing about circumpositions. I can only imagine that they must be two-part adpositions, with part before and part after: such as <i>of __'s</i>, perhaps? Someone care to add information on them? <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a> 06:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there is as far as I know no such thing as a circumposition in grammar and I can't find it in any of my general linguistic literature. The examples given in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumposition&amp;oldid=24283454" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumposition&amp;oldid=24283454" rel="nofollow">original article</a> were in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushtu.html" title="Pushtu">Pushtu</a> (Pashto?). The German example used was of a verb (<i>fahren</i>) with a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verb_particle.html" title="Verb particle">verb particle</a> (<i>herum</i>) combined with a preposition (<i>um</i>), which isn't the least bit relevant. I can't comment the Pushtu example, but I would like some confirmation from good sources.</dd>

<dd>Interesting. The term gets 666 Google hits, of which about a third seem to be linguistic, of which most seem to be about a kind of adposition. So, I guess there are probably about 200 relevant Google hits. <a href="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/KURDICA/2002/2/Zaza.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/KURDICA/2002/2/Zaza.html" rel="nofollow">This one</a> suggests that circumpositions exist in Kurdish, but a Google-search for circumposition+Kurdish doesn't seem to pull up too much of worth.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I think maybe the article should just mention what "circumposition" is supposed to mean, and mention that it's much less common than pre- and postpositions, without giving any examples? <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a> 21:43, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Kurdish example seems to be questioned by some of the reviewers in the link. If it's to be included, I think it should have stronger support than something refered to by a third party (with good arguments) as "a relic of Kurdish linguistics".</dd>

<dd>My interpretation is thus: the third party is saying that Selcan is making a mistake in applying the term "circumposition" (or its German equivalent) to structures in the Zazaki language. He's further inferring that the reason Selcan makes this mistake is that circumpositions are known to exist in Kurdish (a distinct, but neighboring and not-traditionally-recognized-as-distinct, language - at least, according to that page), and hence applying "circumposition" to Zazaki is "a relic of Kurdish linguistics." Still not the best reference ever, though . . . <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a> 03:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is too smart for its own good. For the linguist, the extra information I'm sure is nice, but when all I want is a simple-language definition for Preposition I don't want to have to learn new words. (This was the third site I went to.) Sorry, I'm not logged in and don't know how to insert my reference, but here's this - 2006, October, 20, 9:07 EST. And I'm either Colonel Kernel or Bill.</p>

<dd>Have you tried the Wiktionary entry for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preposition" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:preposition">preposition</a>? --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettR_cce0.html" title="User:BrettR">BrettR</a> 15:34, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hadn't, no. But to contradict my above comment, I guess I wanted more than a simple definition. I wanted something inbetween, which now makes me wonder where dictionaries end and encyclopedias begin. Regardless, one should lead into the other. I went backwards.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But still, as as an open, general encyclopedia, it should be open to all, by starting general, assuming ZERO knowledge of the specific topic or related topics. THEN, the technical stuff could and should follow for those who want it. It's much easier for knowledgeable people to skip over general information than vice-versa.</dd>

<dd>The Colonel is absolutely right. This page is more or less unreadable by now. After it was merged from the articles <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postposition.html" title="Postposition">postposition</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preposition.html" title="Preposition">preposition</a>, it was fairly short, but still had a reasonable amount of detail.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adposition&amp;oldid=32939606" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adposition&amp;oldid=32939606" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The article as it stands is a messy concoction and a mix of high and low as well as outright falsehoods or dubious claims. It seems that a lot of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verb_particle.html" title="Verb particle">verb particles</a> are included in the definition and there are what appears to be spurious claims of circumpositions in several European languages. Someone even tried to provide examples in both Chinese and Japanese without actually knowing enough about the languages and in the process managed to produce incorrect sentences.</dd>
<dd>I'm very tempted to revert it all to one of the shorter and simpler versions, keep some of the sources and dump the current version in a sub-page where all the hobby linguists can tinker around with excessive details until they manage to produce something that is actually readable to most audiences.</dd>

<p>AB:-I feel like my head is going to explode. I've always found grammar inaccessible. The writer of this article has obviously devoted considerable amounts of time and effort, for which I am grateful. But I find myself so envious that I cannot access your knowledge. The referenced technical terms fly at me like bullets from a howitzer. Please do not take this personally. Your attempt is valient, and I am yet to find a book on grammar that doesn't leave me feeling bewildered. Examples, lots of examples help. And trying to minimize the use of other technical terms, or introducing them in a graded fassion. Assume that you are attempting to teach at stroke victem. I am not the smartest man in the world...but I am your audience, I want to possess the information you offer me, I want the benefit of your knowledge.</p>
<p>Thankyou for your endeavours and goodluck. I look forward to reading your reviewed article.</p>

<p>I came across this article looking for information on the common prohibition against ending sentences with a preposition, but this article just perplexed me. Having completed several courses on technical writing and editing, even I'm having trouble understanding this article. People who are less familiar with grammar are going to throw up their hands and leave. This article is too inaccessible to non-linguistics majors. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Carson_2138.html" title="User:Erik Carson">blahpers</a> 16:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel exactly the same way, and I am a relatively learned person. Honestly, this article looks like it was run through one of those computer filters that complicates the text to the point of absurdity. <a href="../../../w/h/c/User%7EWhcernan_64e2.html" title="User:Whcernan">Cernansky</a> 01:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
