<p>This doesn't have the most important info: how much money do you get from them? How many hits does your site have to get for it to be worthwhile? — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 01:16, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is against the Google's TOS to tell that.</p>
<p>Google will not allow clients to give specifics, but in general, it depends on the type of site, traffic generated, etc. I have a game site that has been up for more than a decade, which I maintain for fun. It receives several hundred hits per day. It's adsense revenue is less than $5.00 per month. I have am article site, designed specifically to take advantage of adsense revenue. It's been up less than a year, and receives comparable hits to the game site, but earns about $5/day. The difference is one is designed to take advantage of adsense, the other is designed to just be fun to visit. They attract different keywords. A click on the gamesite generates 1-3 cents. A click on the article site generates 1 cent up to five or six dollars. There are many, many, articles on adsense on the web.</p>

<dd>Google has been notorious to disable AdSense publisher accounts without notice, citing "invalid clicks", without shown proof or specific reasons why a publisher's account was disabled. Google also refuses to payout any earnings for accounts that were disabled, regardless if the clicks were valid or invalid, again, with no proof or investigation. Additionally, there is no method for a publisher to contact Google, except for a web form that is always answered by an autoresponder. Publishers must also be warned that an attacker can run a script with 3 lines of Perl code and disable any AdSense account in minutes. This lack of due diligence on Google's part, and Google's unwillingness to responed to affected publishers has many webmasters and publishers up in arms. A quick search of the web for the terms "disabled AdSense" or "boycott google" will turn up hundreds of examples. Advertisers should also be weary of Google's pay per click AdWords advertising, considering many of the banned AdSense publishers routinely "click for fun" on AdSense ads in retalliation to Google regarding it's policies. Besides, it is still unclear to the public if Google really returns the remaining funds in disabled AdSense accounts to relevant advertisers. Advertisers interests may be undermined in such black-box operations.</dd>

<dd>This happened to our own site only last month (which is why I'm visiting this article, because this matter IMO needs more coverage). Our account was disabled for "invalid clicks" with no details given. After a thorough investigation on our part (Google refused to disclose any information that would have helped us narrow it down), we determined that one or two forumites had taken it upon themselves to randomly click on ads every once in a while, with the intent of helping the site out. This was done without administrator permission. We replied to Google with a joint email that the admins worked on, as a team, to make sure it sounded polite, clear, and through; and we did this for each email they sent us. We received a total of three emails from Google during this process, all sounding very much like form letters and giving no indication that they had considered or even read our defense (other than the cryptic "after reviewing the additional information"). Finally they flat-out denied our appeal and prohibited us from contacting them again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At no time during the process did they offer any justification for any action they took, or any indication that they were reading our correspondence. They never answered any questions we asked them. We felt like bugs on a windshield. 204.145.242.1 21:30, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Request: I would like to request content on prohibited use of Google Adsense in depth, for example, promoting sites that contain Google Adsense using autosurf, and whether it is accepted to promote blogs with Google Adsense using services such as blogadvance, blogmad and blogexplosion</p>
<p>I had my AdSense account disabled without warning and was given an autoresponder message that it was due to clickfraud. I was not allowed to even discuss the matter, and never even got to speak to a representitive of Google. I have never participated in such fraudulent behavior and it is insulting to be accused of this. I have seen numerous reports of similar things happening but unfortunately they are usually people posting on blogs that discuss advertising options. The worst thing about my experience with AdSense was that I never could get in touch with a live human being to discuss problems with my account. I had tried to email them over an issue of ads not displaying on certain pages and never got anything other than automated messages and then when I tried to appeal my account be deactivated I had to deal with the same crap. I am a huge fan of Google in other respects, but this experience has really made me think twice about them. I'm sure that there will be more vocal critics in the future if this type of treatment continues. Sorry I can't provide you more than anecdotal evidence, but at the moment it is the only thing I can offer. Vaginsh 19:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The same thing happened to me and all my sites. Disabled with no chance of appeal, lost about $150 woth of revenue. I emailed several Google times but they just said they could not discuss it. It appears that either my name/address or websites are on some kind of block list now. Because I recently tried signing up again and i was not approved. Because my approval was unsuccessfull I cannot re-apply even with new websites because my two emails @evilmerc.com and @gmail.com are now not allowed to be used on adsense?

<p>After much discussion with the page administrator <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZalaBim_b724.html" title="User:ZimZalaBim">ZimZalaBim</a> I have been given the permission to assign citation to techshout rather than eweek. The reason for the change is listed below.</p>
<p>I have studied all posts on the issue available on the internet. But the original article on techshout had the most detailed explanation in this matter. It also showed example picture of this Trojan running which the eweek article didn’t have. Due to the fact it broke the story and as it contained the most detailed information on the Trojans activity, it deserves to be in the reference rather than the eweek article which has derived all the information from the original source (techshout) and added quotes.</p>

<p>This article is one of the most biased commercial endorsements in Wikipedia. Frankly, it sounds like it was written by Google, as it is substantially similar to their own documentation for this service. I suggest that someone who is not an avid AdSense user examine this article and decide for themselves whether it reads like brochure. Even the image sample contains a direct sales pitch for the product, as opposed to its logo, or the sample given on the adsense homepage. Compare to the article for <a href="../../../a/d/w/AdWords_509f.html" title="AdWords">AdWords</a> to see a less biased approach. Note I hesitate to edit this article myself for fear of drawing the ire of the many wiki editors who are devoted Google fans. Tpbarber 23:12, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The entire article reads like a very positively worded advertisement. The <a href="../../../a/d/s/AdSense_b734.html" title="AdSense">AdSense</a> service just happens to be paying money to a very large number of wikipedia editors, and also the new wikimedia-related venture search.wikia.com. When a traditional news media outlet runs a story that pertains to a business partner or shareholder, the fact is typically disclosed in good faith. In this case, the premise of editor objectivity may be a lost cause due to a serious conflict of interest. Making the article more balanced would be a good start.

<p>This section is very ambiguously written, and needs to made clearer. The first sentence makes little sense to me. Who is criticizing who? Who or what is generating the fraudulent clicks?</p>
<p>In the second paragraph, I'm not sure if it's publishers or advertisers who can protect themselves by using click tracking programs.</p>
<p>I changed the 3rd paragraph to make it less couched in the passive voice and negative terms.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the criticism section should be moved above the abuse section. Many readers care about the criticism of Adsense. The abuses described here are Google's problems. Paulgush 07:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article calls people who serve AdSense ads and get paid for clicks "customers". Is that the right term?

<p>I'm understand entirely the need to avoid being SPAMmed with random AS links, but I wonder if <a href="http://www.publisher-world.com/list.php?9" class="external free" title="http://www.publisher-world.com/list.php?9" rel="nofollow">http://www.publisher-world.com/list.php?9</a> would be more useful?</p>
<p>We got sick of the "Where is the bucket of money?", "How far can I push my luck?" and "I got banned, but did nothing wrong!" typical self-serving discussions so attempted to set up something a little more thoughtful.</p>
<p>Note that we don't carry advertising and this is not a commercial venture.</p>
