<p>Hi Adz, Thanks for updating the progress statistics. Yes, I used to do this on a reasonably regular basis, but have been really busy with work, and a new house.

<p>I think the suburb article is a great idea, there is a similar one on the suburbs of Johannesburg. I tidied up the wikiformat a bit- I'm guessing you wrote it in Word and then pasted it to wikipedia? Word eats all the bold and itallic syntax, so I find it best if using a word processing package to type everything in notepad, then spell check in Word and then paste it into Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:01, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. that's exactly what I did. I have used the wordpad method before but I'm cutting corners today because I'm pressed for time. Note to self - don't cut corners. - Thanks for tidying up. I think let's try to complete Canberra first, and then maybe come back to suburbs of canberra. I think it needs a bit of a History section etc. Info about when districts were settled. population etc. maps.... Suburbs of J'burg looks lood! Very interesting too. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 02:05, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've reorganised the Canberra article to include a culture section, since you seem to be knowledgabel on the subject could you expand it when you get a chance. Thanks. Also sister cities seem to have got the chop somewhere along the line, I'd like to put them back, but I'm note ure which section they'd be best in. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:24, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've responded to your locality question on that talk page. With the shopping and town centres, I intend to write articles on all of these in the not too distant future, and think they could make quite workable seperate articles (as we've already seen with the major shopping centres of Melbourne). Others also evidently agreed, as seen by the fact that some of them have started to get articles - it's just that they haven't linked them from the surrounding suburbs yet (which would mean they'd end up with other incoming links), as well as perhaps chains located there. This is why I object to them being redirected or delinked - it's effectively preventing anyone else from coming along and creating what could be a good article at a later date. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:55, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I've voted and proposed what I think is a compromise. If the decision is to collapse the group centres into the suburbs, don't let that deter you from writing articles about them anyway. Link them from the suburb itself. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 11:27, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well to make maps properly you need special geospacial mapping software, of which if you search around you can find some free stuff that works. Unfortunately as far as I can see the data that you need to feed into these geospacial programs is always under copyright, so you can't get a free version out to upload to wikipedia.</p>
<p>The maps I make for wikipedia I like to think of more as illustrations rather than 100% accurate maps, much the same way street directories don't come anywhere close to being 100% accurate. I use Adobe Illustrator into which I paste reference images be it an existing map, satelite photo or whatever and trace over them by hand. Generally if I can use more than one source for a map I feel less guilty about stealing information. As the actual data displayed by the map can't be copyrighted only the map itself. Then you include the info you want, remove the source images and export to png, theoretically it would also be possible to export to svg but I haven't really played with that yet.</p>
<p>Illustrator is really quite expensive and overkill for the job. I would recomend if you want to try out making maps (or other illustrations) download a copy of <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.inkscape.org/" rel="nofollow">inkscape</a> and give it a try. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 12:25, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From looking at the article and its links, I think it's something that is being taught. Whether it is a legitimate martial art or notable in any case, I'm not sure - although I reckon not. You could either 1) contact participants of WikiProject Martial Arts (presumably knowledgeable in this area) and ask their advice on a course of action, or 2) AfD it and notify the WikiProject. I'd say it has a fair chance of being deleted, given it is only referenced in two other websites outside Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> <a href="../../../a/u/_/P%7EAU_c5ee.html" title="P:AU">|</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 07:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Hi, back in October, Whobot changed the names of a number of categories from "Airports of Country" to "Airports in Country". This has caused a problem where categories in wikipedias in other languages had interwikilinks to the categories that were changed. Namely, the links no longer work. I have fixed a couple (Airports in Sweeden and Aiprorts in Poland) but this obviously leaves a great many links in other language wikipedias that have broken links. Is there any way that your bot could possibly go through them and fix the broken links? (I'm guessing not since you would probably need permission from the other wikipedias to run your bot there...? Thought it was worth asking) -- Adz 11:52, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Hi, sorry for the delayed response.. sort of on Wiki-break. Uhm. I would have to look more into it, and yes I would require permission to run whobot on other wiki's.

<p>Hi Adz. Thanks for comments on Jung Sin Yuk-Do. The CKD people are really quite clicky, and never let it be said that something one of their ex-members did was actually good and worthwhile in a positive way!!! A quick glance at the www.ksdi.net page and the link "Resignation" will show you just how this organisation works, and what they will do and say to discredit people.</p>
<p>Jung Sin Yuk-Do is a culmination of years of research, put together in a new non-conventional martial arts recognition &amp; training way. Sure, some whil disagree with that way, but it will always be that way in everything in life. It's like Disney. Millions around the world love it, and a few because of accidents, deaths or for some other reason, hate it. Doesn't make it invalid or irrelevant.</p>
<p>The Choi Kwang-Do people from Australia who are obsessed with the Jung Sin Yuk-Do page on wikipedia, are doing so to discredit something that they know absolutely nothing about. From what I can see, the article shows that Jung Sin Yuk-Do is a martial arts moving forward with some new concepts. Isn't something that breaks from tradition good? If we didn't have people trying new things and new ways, we wouldn't have cars, planes, computers, wikipedia!!! cairnsckd 21:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC) <sup>comments moved from user page </sup></p>

<p>Is appears from reading the messages, that "Clan" is an ex-Instructor of Rod Cook's, and has been discrediting his name via email, phone and now via Wikipedia. The Jung Sin Yuk-Do program is non-profit, and it's the continual hampering by this clan (you can easily pick his email addres, he's on;ly interested in this article and the Choi Kwang-Do one). The sad bit is no-one that has or had anything with Rod Cook and/or Jung Sin Yuk-Do over the last few years, have had anything to do with ex-Instructor of Rod Cooks. It seems that his whole purpose on wikipedia is negative and destructive.</p>
