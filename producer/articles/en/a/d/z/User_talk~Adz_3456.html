<p>Hi Adz, thanks for the edit at <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townsville%2C_Queensland_aacf.html" title="Townsville, Queensland">Townsville, Queensland</a>. I am a relatively new user and would have accidentally made the POV error when I wrote the bit that you edited, could you please explain to me how it is POV so that I can keep it in mind for my future edits. I have been doing a bit of editing/expanding relating to local politicians this month and wouldn't want to go off track without knowing it. I am not in any way disputing your edit.

<p>Hi Adz, your reasoning makes sense and I agree with it (I sort of figured that was the reason RE 'only', but couldn't see the connection with the removal of the Lib Party tag). Thanks for taking the time to reply, will try to keep language neutral. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlec_mcc_15b6.html" title="User:Alec mcc">Alec</a> 12:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>haha, I think you have A LOT to catch up on, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> is very determined, and as you will see sneaky in my view, but I will of course leave that judgement to you. If you are wanting to get involved Thuringowacityrep has set up a dispute arbitration page, although he would probably feel you were biased as you do not live in Thuringowa.</p>
<p>It might be useful for you to know that the following paragraph that I originally wrote (now removed by myself as agreed on the Talk page) is the para under discussion for a lot of the initial debate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although (at the time) Thuringowa did not have the population density to warrant it, Thuringowa was declared a City by the Bjelke-Petersen Government in 1986, this was one of the many controversial electoral decisions made to prop up the Bjelke-Petersen National Party's grip on power at all levels, see Bjelkemander. Although historically the two City Councils and Mayors work very well together and share major infrastructure, there is an issue of unnecessary duplication of services. These are not two cities which have Conurbated into each other such as in New York, Sydney or the Gold and Sunshine Coasts, Thuringowa is a politically motivated, artificially created, city. Since it's creation Thuringowa City has become densely populated, as the greater Townsville city spreads further and further over the now static boarder between the two Local Government Areas. Friendly rivalry between the two cities councils does also have positive benefits to Townsville resulting in such projects as Thuringowa's Riverway as an alternative to The Strand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit that in hindsight that was a bit provocative without references.</p>

<dd>Hi.</dd>
<dd>There was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Townsville%2C_Queensland&amp;diff=95511835&amp;oldid=95501426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Townsville%2C_Queensland&amp;diff=95511835&amp;oldid=95501426" rel="nofollow">edit</a> last night by a new user which I thought was along the same lines as some of the Townsville/Thuringowa edits that you had been making. I thought the username was similar to your in that it displayed an affinity with Townsville/Thuringowa. Not wanting to jump to conclusions, I asked Rebecca to look into it. To specifically answer your question about why you’re being told that you’re attempting sock puppetry, perhaps you should address that question to Alec mcc or Rebecca.</dd>
<dd>Don’t let a debate over once city lead you to the conclusion that “this site is going to the pack”. Wikipedia is a big place with over 1.5 million articles. Sure, there will be disagreements occasionally but there are ways of dealing with them. Take a look at the page on <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">staying cool</a>. Try to talk through the issue on talk pages and avoid making threats and personal attacks. See if you can find common ground. Have a look at the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> page.</dd>
<dd>I’ve only vaguely caught up with the Townsville/Thuringowa debate, and am reluctant to weigh in as I think it would take up a lot of my time, however it might be worth seeking opinions from others, such as the <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">WP:AWNB</a>, or seeking a <a href="../../../r/f/c/RFC_54bd.html" title="RFC">Request for comment</a>. Finally, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. It helps keep things civil. Cheers.</dd>

<p>so if a new user joins and makes a edit that looks a bit like mine them it must be me...it that what it is like here now? if i ask Alec mcc i know what he would say so i'm not even going there but i will ask Rebecca but i thought POV were something that Wiki didn't like. thanks for you advice i have tried to stay cool but evey time i change something along comes Alec mcc and changes it back he has taken it to far now but thanks <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 06:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Hi. Note that I said I didn't want to jump to conclusions. I didn't say that the new user was a sock puppet, nor did I ever accuse you of employing sock puppetry. I simply said that the edit was suspicious and I asked for it to be checked out. I try give people the benefit of the doubt and assume good faith, and I think its fair to have things checked out before comingto conclusions. Rebecca is an admin, and before I went on wiki break, admins were able to check IP numbers, which is why I asked her to look into it. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> 09:43, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>it's ok mate i wasn't having a go at you about it sorry if it seemed that way but that Alec mcc has got me so wild right now, so i guess he has done what he set out to do. i never thought it would be so hard to correct a edit could i get you to have a look at the artical and the refs on the page as i feel that the ref that he is talking about is not very correct and it would be better to remove the ref from a reporter and use the others from government sites can i get your input on this please <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 12:33, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're doing an amazing job with the photos of Canberra suburbs and landmarks - they look fantastic. It's really nice to see photos of some of the smaller suburbs in particular, as they often get overlooked.

<p>Hi Adz, do you think the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_in_Townsville_6479.html" title="Shopping in Townsville">Shopping in Townsville</a> edit is still speculation or is it ok? Thanks, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlec_mcc_15b6.html" title="User:Alec mcc">Alec</a> 15:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Adz, thank you for the comments! that (survey) was actually the one atributed reference that I was not really sure about...</p>
<p>This is the direct quote from the start of the article (I have access to a online media monitor through our City Library):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`COME back David Jones. We love you'. Residents are crying out for a department store, such as David Jones or Myer to return to the twin cities, according to results from the Townsville Bulletin's annual reader's survey. An overwhelming number of respondents to the Bulletin's survey felt Townsville and Thuringowa need a major retailer such as Myer (81 per cent), with more than 50 per cent saying that they would shop there regularly once or twice a month. David Jones department store left the site of what is now the Cowboys Leagues Club in Flinders Mall in 1993. Many believe there has been a shift in the market from the CBD ever since. Townsville Acting Mayor Anne Bunnell said she would love to see a major department store return to the twin cities...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the source survey was actually about whether respondents felt T&amp;T needed a major retailer. But considering the overwhelming response (81%) plus the general tone of the article I attributed that article to saying that residents felt that the store leaving was detrimental to the quality of Townsville's shopping experience. It's an easy jump to make but it might have been too much of a jump for Wikipedea's standards, I was trying to help the general flow and style of the paragraph by saying it that way.
