<p><b>Adrian C. Wilcox High School</b> is a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public school</a> located in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Clara%2C_California_2072.html" title="Santa Clara, California">Santa Clara, California</a>. It is one of four <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high schools</a> serving those living within the boundaries of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Clara_Unified_School_District_ad6f.html" title="Santa Clara Unified School District">Santa Clara Unified School District</a>. The <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a> is named after Adrian C. Wilcox, who served on the Santa Clara Union High School Board of Trustees for over 30 years. Wilcox was first accredited by the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Association_of_Schools_and_Colleges_abe8.html" title="Western Association of Schools and Colleges">Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a> (WASC) in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and is accredited through <a href="../../../2/0/0/2009.html" title="2009">2009</a>. In April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Wilcox officially became a California Distinguished School.</p>
<pre>
==History==
</pre>
<p>Construction of the school began in the late 1950s on 47 acres of land donated by Wilcox, with the school opening its doors in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> to what would become its first <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduation.html" title="Graduation">graduating</a> class, the class of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. The first graduating class to attend Wilcox for all four years was the Class of 1965.</p>
<p>The student body was split when Peterson High School opened in the district and then later recombined when Peterson and Buchser High School (Named after Emil R. Buchser, School Superintendent when Buchser High School opened. His son, Emil R. Bichser, Jr. was the first principal of Wilcox) were converted into middle schools. At that time, the student body voted to change the name of the mascot, newspaper, and yearbook, along with the school colors, to be more inclusive of the new students. The original mascot for Wilcox was The Warrior, the school colors were Green and Gold, the newspaper was The War Chants, and the yearbook was The Promethean.</p>
<p>The school saw a total of seven <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students.html" title="Students">students</a> (either <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students.html" title="Students">students</a> at the time, former students, or <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumni.html" title="Alumni">alumni</a>) killed in action during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. The body of each one was recovered and returned home.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, head custodian Joe Miller undertook an ambitious project to honor the school's past. The idea came about when Miller located several <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panorama.html" title="Panorama">panoramic</a> class <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picture.html" title="Picture">pictures</a> while clearing out a dusty cabinet. As a result of this discovery, he decided to make a wall consisting of the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picture.html" title="Picture">pictures</a> of every graduating class in <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a> history. After successfully tracking down the nine <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picture.html" title="Picture">pictures</a> not in the cabinet (by way of <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mails</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> calls to past <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students.html" title="Students">students</a>), the <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumni.html" title="Alumni">Alumni</a> Wall was completed and dedicated on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">7 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. Now, the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panorama.html" title="Panorama">panoramic</a> photo of each subsequent <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduation.html" title="Graduation">graduating</a> class is added to the wall, which is housed on walls on the inside of the school's main building, just outside the main offices.</p>
<p>Miller is also responsible for the Wilcox Vietnam Memorial Plaque, which lists only the six Killed In Action who actually graduated from Wilcox, and is currently working on a Walk of Fame honoring each graduating class.</p>
<p>Miller was presented with a plaque and certificate by a representative of the Class of 1966 Reunion Committee making him an honorary class member and alumni in a special ceremony given as part of a student rally on January 26, 2007.</p>
<p>In February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Mission City Center for the Performing Arts, a building constructed adjacent to the school and across Calabazas Creek from the main campus, in an area that was the original Student Parking Lot, opened.</p>

<p>The school year typically begins in late August or early September, consists of 180 school days, and usually ends on the third Friday of June.</p>
<p>The school <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> is known as <i>The Scribe</i> and usually publishes eight issues per year.</p>

<p>A way for the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students.html" title="Students">students</a> to display class spirit and unity, the colors are mainly used for the annual battle of the classes, known as Fantastics. Fantastics was formed as a spirit activity by Ha Tran (class of 1998) and other members of the student council in 1997. Held in March, all classes compete against each other in various physical <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contest.html" title="Contest">contests</a> (such as a <a href="../../../t/u/g/Tug_of_war.html" title="Tug of war">tug of war</a>). The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competitor.html" title="Competitor">competitors</a> wear shirts with the color of their class.</p>
<p>The colors are on a four-year rotation, with the color of the graduating seniors being handed off to the upcoming year's freshmen. The class of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> was red, and the class of <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a> will be red.</p>

<p>Wilcox is probably best known for their <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> team, which claimed three CCS titles in a five-year span at the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The team won 10 consecutive league titles from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> as part of the De Anza Division of the SCVAL.</p>
<p>The Chargers received unwanted notoriety in the fall of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, when it was revealed that a reserve on the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> team had forged signatures on a document so he could retain his academic eligibility (at least a 2.0 <a href="../../../g/p/a/GPA_11d9.html" title="GPA">GPA</a>). At the time, the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> team boasted a 6-1-1 record. Because the reserve had participated in six of those eight games, the team forfeited those games (five victories and one tie), and their record plummeted to 1-7. A</p>
