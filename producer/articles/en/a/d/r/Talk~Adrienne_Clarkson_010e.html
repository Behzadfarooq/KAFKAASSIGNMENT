<p>Ms. Clarkson had an impact on me growing up in Canada. Her take 30 shows and later Fifth Estate were hard news, often going into social issues that Canadians found difficult to face such as spousal abuse, poverty, etc. Her interview with the Shah of Iran should be mentioned, she went in for issues such as torture and military expansion that the Shah had to provide answers for, however she went at it with great diplomacy.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>After 9/11 happened, she praised Operation Yellow Ribbon, saying that "communities across the country selflessly opened their homes and hearts to stranded air travellers." Chretien and U.S. Ambassador Paul Cellucci would also do the same thing. They also have never forgotten her standing with both of them on Parliament Hill during the memorial service to honour the victims on September 14, 2001, which over 100,000 attended--the largest single vigil ever seen in the nation's capital.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This bit of phrasing, talking about the (uncited, presumably speculative?) <b>memories</b> of Cretien and Cellucci seems inappropriate to an encyclopedia to me, being suitable rather for a glossy press release. And less glaringly, it seems odd to observe that J.C. and P.C. also praised Yellow Ribbon (in an article about A.C., as contrasted with an article about Yellow Ribbon or 9/11), since that seems to be understandable as baby-kissing writ large. So, I feel that the second two sentences could be cleaned up. In fact, it's possible that this paragraph is not useful, or has undue prominence: is her participation in post-9/11 foofooraw really the most significant event of the first 3 years of her term of office, as the article indirectly suggests? jholman 18:56, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Satirical links are vandalism!? I replaced the satirical link to Clarkson the Terrible.com. There are 2 positive links and a basically glowing encyclopedia entry; plus the link is clearly marked as satirical. She's a head of State, for pete's sake, surely there's room for Clarkson critique on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlickharrison_3f83.html" title="User:Flickharrison">Flickharrison</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I'm concerned satire doesn't "cut it." But it's not because it is denigrating to Ms. Clarkson. I just think that links should be more factual in nature. If somebody's assembled a collection of negative facts about Ms. Clarkson, it has every reason to be linked, but my sense is that a satirical article is not an appropriate place to link to from an encyclopedic article. But I'll leave it in there, pending discussion here. - <a href="../../../c/a/f/User%7ECafemusique_5316.html" title="User:Cafemusique">Cafemusique</a> 17:00, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Clarkson's Maiden Name Is Poy in English, Wu in Mandarin and Eng in Cantonese</b></p>
<p>An editor added that Clarkson is née Poy. But I think the editor confused Adrienne Clarkson with <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivienne_Poy_8e8d.html" title="Vivienne Poy">Vivienne Poy</a>, another female <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese-Canadian_5d3c.html" title="Chinese-Canadian">Chinese-Canadian</a> politician.

<dd>Origin of "poy" as explained in this following link: <a href="http://www.coibs.com/newversion/chinese/CoibsItemCANews/20020206001.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.coibs.com/newversion/chinese/CoibsItemCANews/20020206001.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coibs.com/newversion/chinese/CoibsItemCANews/20020206001.htm</a> . For those who can't read Chinese in this article, it explained that the Ng (伍) surname became "Poy" when the family immigrated to Canada and the grandfather (伍培 Ng Pui) of Adrienne told immigrant official his name as "Ah Pui" and the official took it as the last name which then coined as Poy. However, in an english transcript of Senator Vivienne Poy's address to an australian university, Senator Poy spoke of her grandfather had already used the name Poy in Australia when he opened his store. But Poy was probably not used as a last name in that case. <a href="http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/vpoy/english/Special_Interests/speeches/Nortel_Networks_July00.htm--" class="external free" title="http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/vpoy/english/Special_Interests/speeches/Nortel_Networks_July00.htm--" rel="nofollow">http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/vpoy/english/Special_Interests/speeches/Nortel_Networks_July00.htm--</a><a href="../../../k/v/a/User%7EKvasir_a94b.html" title="User:Kvasir">Kvasir</a> 08:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any merit of listing the Mandarin pronunciation for any of the Poy family members? There is no evidence that the Poys, being originated from southern China (Hakka / Taishan to be precise) even used Mandarin.

<p>Regarding Zocky's edit: 'rm "Her excellency, the right honourable". The article shouldn't start like that. Is there a way (and a need) to work this somehow back in?)' I would like to hear why you think the article should not start with her styles and titles. They are something that a good encyclopedia should include, and in the first sentence is the most natural place to put it. I think the only other way to include them is in a one-sentence paragraph: "Her official styles and titles are ...", What about articles about famous miltary figures? Should their military rank be omitted from the first paragraph? "Her Excellency the Right Honourable" can be see as a civilian counterpart to military rank. -- <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndefatigable_4173.html" title="User:Indefatigable">Indefatigable</a> 20:41, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really. This is not a rank, it's a form of address used for her office. Like "Her majesty". Should pages on monarchs start with "Her Majesty Elisabeth the second is..."? (not that I agree that pages on generals should start with "General Wesley Clark is...")</dd>

<p>Criticising her for not marrying Chinese husbands seems a bit bizarre. Also, considering it was almost unheard of for women to keep their maiden names when she was first married it would be a bit much to have expected her to keep hers.</p>

I can understand them being offended, as in their culture, a chinese taking on their husband's surname would have been "unheard of".</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The point about her last name is irrelevent. When she married Stephen Clarkson 40 years or so ago it was almost unheard of for women to keep their maiden names. To use this as a criticism of her for ignoring her Chinese heritage is silly. Andylehrer 02:21, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "maiden name" article is worded very badly. I shall edit it after this. I'm Chinese and what she did makes perfect sense. Since she married an English person, she just followed the English custom with her name. Her "English" surname wasn't even Chinese. Now in Chinese it would just sound weird to add an extra three sounds (Clarkson) to her name. Nothing to do with heritage, which in any case only applies to the Chinese name written in Chinese. 219.77.98.28 13:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for why she kept the name - she became a TV star in Canada in the 1960s while she was married to Clarkson. Becoming famous as "Adrienne Clarkson" it would have been unreasonable to expect her to change her name upon becoming divorced. Note she has not changed her name to Adrienne Saul since marrying John Ralston Saul.</p>

<p>Is last month's protest really noteworthy enough to merit inclusion in an article about her. As it's listed, it seems to be dissatisfaction about her actions on a relatively unimportant trip.

<dd>I agree.

<p>Although the article tries to represent various points of view, overall the article is negative, constantly citing "some monarchists". First of all, monarchists as a group are a minority; vocal monarchists are smaller again. Monarchists who spend most of their time attacking the Queen's representative end up defeating their own cause by undermining support for a monarchy. Let's face it, the UK monarchy has been in retreat since Charles I was beheaded. That said, it would be nice to say something positive about Madame Clarkson. I am old enough to remember every Canadian Governor General since 1952. Although most were dignified and worthy of the office, some stood out as distinguished and inspirational - Georges Vanier was a magnificent figure and person who commanded respect. Clarkson is hardly in his saintly category, but she commands respect for her intellect and love of Canada. Read her speeches, they are very good. There has NEVER been a time in Canadian history when the OFFICE of GG has not been criticized as a waste of money, but then there are people who seem to think that any government activity of any sort is a waste of money. So what! government goes on and changes itself as required. So, couldn't one of you get rid of the picayune criticisms and focus on Clarkson's dignitas and gravitas. She will be leaving office soon. Let's hope her successor is as committed to the promotion of Canadian culture in Canada and abroad, and not a political hack.--<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentS_9f88.html" title="User:BrentS">BrentS</a> 15:33, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think BrentS has the right idea here, the article definitely has some NPOV problems. Currently almost half of the article is listing her bad press while in office. Though she's worthy of criticism, it should be toned-down. The article focuses too much on the public's opinion of what she did rather than what she did on its own. It might work better if the article first discusses what she did or did not accomplish as GG, then followed by the public criticism of her actions/inactions. --<a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullUpYourSocks_a019.html" title="User:PullUpYourSocks">PullUpYourSocks</a> 00:41, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Adrienne Clarkson ceased to be Governor General the moment Michaelle Jean was sworn in. Yes, The Queen has issued a new commission appointing Madame Jean as Governor General, but note that there was a Deputy Governor General who presided over the ceremony. Now, note the title, "Deputy Governor General" is the shortened version of "the Honourable the Deputy to the Governor General". Now since Michaelle Jean was not Governor General until she was sworn in, who exactly was the Deputy to? Thus, it makes sense that Adrienne Clarkson was Governor General until the moment Michaelle Jean became Governor General. If she wasn't, then the Deputy should not have been 'Deputy Governor General' and instead should have been 'Administrator'. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddo_c49f.html" title="User:Eddo">Eddo</a></dd>

<dd>At a press conference after her "swearing out" (for lack of a better word) on The 26th of Sept Clarkson said that she had "great respect for this office, which I happen to inhabit, until tomorrow". I would think that means that althought she was "sworn out" she was still the GG until Jean was sworn in. After all, Canada needed a head of state - what would happen if war broke out and someone had to sign important legislation in that 24 hour period&#160;? <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowew_71ec.html" title="User:Dowew">Dowew</a> 16:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where did that information come from? The link for the reference goes to gg.ca, and it indicates on that site that the planting did happen. I'm also pretty sure it happened, since I've seen the tree. Anyone who visits the gardens at Rideau Hall can have the tree pointed out to them. True, there is not yet a plaque up for the tree, but there are other dedicated trees at Rideau Hall without plaques as well (such as Hu Jintao).</p>

<p>Does anyone know if Clarkson knows Hoi-San (Hoi-San) /Toi-San (Cantonese) /Tai-Shan (Mandarin) dialect of Chinese? 132.205.44.134 01:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Clarkson's paternal grandfather. . .migrated to Australia and opened a general store in Chiltern, Victoria . . . His eldest son William was later sent back to Taishan and made his way to Hong Kong. There he married and worked with his father for the Canadian government." How could the son have worked with his father while in Hong Kong when his father was running a store in Australia? I didn't remove this as it is likely that the actual facts have simply been obscured by a grammatical error.JeanKorte 17:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right, the facts might have been confounded over several edits by different people. The following <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplified_chinese.html" title="Simplified chinese">simplified chinese</a> sources all basically say the same thing regarding the circumstances under which the Poys immigrated to Canada. There was no mention of grandfather being in Hong Kong prior or during the War.</dd>

<dd>The situation was that, according to the above sources, Adrienne's father was a staff of "加拿大商务局" (need the correct translation) and the family was able to repatriate with the other Canadian civil servants. Even then the family encountered difficulty to enter during to the Chinese Exclusion Act enforced at the time. The Department was eventually able to use the remaining quota in the prisoners of war exchange program to get the Poy family into Canada.</dd>
