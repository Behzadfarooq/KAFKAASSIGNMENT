<p>Welcome, Adrian/Messages from Earth (and other archived stuff), to <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> member association! As you might know, all the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Members_96ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Members">Esperanzians</a> share one important goal: the success of this encyclopedia. Within that, we then attempt to strengthen the community bonds, and be the "approachable" side of the project. All of our ideals are held in the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Charter_5155.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Charter">Charter</a>, the governing document of the association.</p>
<p>Now that you are a member you should read the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_So_you%27ve_joined_Esperanza..._c68e.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/So you've joined Esperanza...">guide to what to do now</a> or you may be interested in some of our <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Programs_cd31.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Programs">programs</a>. A quite important program is the StressUnit, which seeks to support <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Alerts_64a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Alerts">editors who have encountered any stress</a> from their Wikipedia events, and are seeking to leave the project. So far, Esperanza can be credited with the support and retention of several users. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24">Redwolf24</a> runs the spam to keep members up to date. Also, we have a <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Calendar_59ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Calendar">calendar</a> of special events, member birthdays, and other holidays that you can add to and follow.</p>
<p>In addition to these projects, several more missions of Esperanza are in development, and are currently being created at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Possibles_0c06.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Possibles">Esperanza/Possibles</a>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take an active voice in the running of Esperanza. We have a small government system, headed by our Administrator general, <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a>, and guided by the Advisory Committee comprised of <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Titoxd</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a>. The next set of elections will be in February, and I would be glad to see you vote, or even consider running for a position.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, concerns, comments, or general ideas, Esperanzian or otherwise, know that you can always contact Celestianpower by <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Celestianpower_121c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Celestianpower">email</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">talk page</a> or the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EEsperanza_f704.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Esperanza">Esperanza talk page</a>.

I thank you for joining Esperanza, and look forward to working with you in making Wikipedia a better place to work!</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. I will read this article also and redo the section. I read 4 other articles, the ACLU website's page about the lawsuit, and another article about the ACLU's activity in the case. I simply want to get the information correct. 01:56, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. Now that I have read the Wired article, I reworded it to state that a request was made to preserve the information with the intention of getting a subpeona for the information. It is apparent that the DoD didn't grant the subpoena. I'm looking for an article that states that clearly. I have also added that the ACLU sued about the ACT's ability to request business information, but I did not imply that the ACLU lawsuit was a result of the FBI's request - which is how it was worded before. Right now, I'm looking for something that clearly states the DoD denied the subpoena request. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 02:07, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(I figured I'd respond right here; sorry if it's in the way.) Thanks alot, Adrian. I do understand people's aversion to jokes/vandalism/trolling/whatever you want to call it.

<p>The tag says "merge with" not "merge into" so I don't consider it nonsensical to have the tag on the GNAA article, even if that is the obvious title under which all content will be kept; and I included it on the GNAA article because that's obviously where most will observe there's a duplicate article to consider; but I have no strong feelings about how many tags we use or where we put them. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">The Republic Restored</a></small> 04:58, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right! I'm certainly not. Like most people here, I'm another guy trying to develop good content, that will endure and outlast me. But part of that process is establishing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">notability</a> when deciding what content to include.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, Wikipedia has <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> yet developed a surefire way of seeing who is <b>going</b> to be notable. It's quite possible that Mr. Stone is going to be the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">new hotness</a>. But we have no way of knowing that, even if we <b>do</b> assume that an unregistered user with a brief history of vandalism is, in fact, a notable actor/actress, per your AfD comment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your enthusiasm for this individual, but he does not, at this time, warrant a Wikipedia article, IMHO. We can't consider your claims because they constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. But rest assured that if Mr. Stone does become notable, he'll be written about. Heck, I'll do it myself.</dd>

<p>I think I'm just going to pack Wikipedia in. I have strongly believe that the aims of its founder, were good, and I believe that wikipedia is, in theory a good idea; but in reality, a large proportion if its articles are incorrect, unimportant, or just plain stupid. An encyclopaedia should be a valid resource for research, but wikipedia fails on this front, simply due to a collection of members (more senior members, I must add), that seem to believe that their views are more important than anyone elses, and whenever a 'new' person adds or edits an article, they remove it, or edit it to their personal point of view, and involve moderators when anyone complains. I don't see how any validity can be achieved if wikipedia is to remain operating in this way, and as a result, I will revert to using the many alternatives that exist, and shall be recommending others do the same.</p>
<p>It is a shame, really, because a project, such as wikipedia does have such great potential, it is just ruined by a few who get lost in a vitual world of power, that believe that they have the right to out-rule everyone else. I understand that wikipedia, by foundation is not a democracy, but nevertheless, should the voices of newer members still not be heard? It is this fact alone that I have found spoils the concept of wikipedia, there is no restriction, credit, or merit for members; experienced members, rather than provide advice, provide insult (except you, who have been helpful, others have been quick to provide insult, but little in the way of constructive critism). This results in a greater number of new users being forced to the periphery, and who will, after a few articles will have little or no interest in the project.</p>
<p>The only way I can see to rectify this problem, is:</p>
<p>- to give proper credit for people who have created or edited an article; - provide greater support for new members, with useful, and accessible help guides, perhaps even a buddy scheme; - Allow article creators to restrict the editing that may be done by other members (which may or may not be undone by administrators); - Remove the ability users to edit eachothers user pages; - provide an area where new members can talk (i.e. forum), that is readily available; - give protection to new members. - Make it impossible to create an article without references.</p>
<p>Until these have been met, I do not see how wikipedia can be considered a reputable resource of information; simply because as it stands, it is far to easy for more experienced members to cloud articles with their own judgements, as it is easy for new members to accidently mis-edit an article.<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelzagood_9ac5.html" title="User:Helzagood">Helzagood</a> 20:40, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ouch. I'm sorry your initial experience here hasn't been great. I wince a little every time I see someone with good ideas for Wikipedia feel like they should give up and walk away. There <b>are</b> things about Wikipedia that could use changing, and the way folks react to what they perceive as mistakes by new members is one of those things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me try to reply to some of your points ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Proper credit. Article histories <b>do</b> show who wrote what. No author on Wikipedia is ever uncredited for their work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Support. Lots of people <b>try</b> to greet new members, and introduce them to the rules of the road. We just can't get everyone. But the community <b>is</b> there, if you're willing. You can start by introducing yourself at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_user_log_052c.html" title="Wikipedia:New user log">new user log</a>. You can also drop by the Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBoot_Camp_5a63.html" title="Wikipedia:Boot Camp">boot camp</a> -- among other things, you can learn how to join our <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Relay_Chat_c148.html" title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</a> channel, a multiuser realtime chat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Restricted editing: The ability to edit any content is one of the primary features of any Wiki. Pages are sometimes protected for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">cause</a>, but this is almost always an emergency, temporary measure. However, your userpage is considered "yours", and if it's vandalized, another editor will almost certainly revert it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>New member talk. I've placed a link to the newuser introduction page above, and a pointer to our IRC channel. There are other resources out there, too. They're just not always as obvious as we might like. If you choose to stay, after two weeks and 150 edits, I'd like to invite you to join <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP">esperanza</a>, a supportive community organization on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Protection for new members. Wikipedia can set policies and guidelines, but it's up to editors to abide by them. As it is, editors are politely requested <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not to bite</a> new users, and new users are asked to accept the existence of occasionally grumpy existing users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Article creation. It's just not technically possible for an automated process to decide if an article is properly referenced/sourced, and the workload would be prohibitive for any kind of manual review. But if you see an unsourced assertion in an article, you can always add {{citation needed}} to that area of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please remember that <b>lots of new users</b> encounter some static when they first start editing. Wikipedia is not perfect, but it's important to bear in mind that in the vast majority of cases, friction with other editors is <b>nothing personal</b>. You can get through it, keep working to improve Wikipedia, and make it into an enduring resource, with value that will outlast its creators.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Adrian, Thanks for the kudos, but I can't take much credit, I only started a tiny bit of the article, after discussing him on #2600. It's amazing how large it grew in less than an hour thanks to you and a couple of other editors; a testament to Wikipedia and demonstration of &lt;insert name of psychological principal here&gt; - few are inclined enough to start an article, but many are willing to edit.</p>
<p>The *really* weird thing is that I just started reading <i>The Art of Intrusion</i> and it was only yesterday that I read the chapter about you. When I hopped on to Wikipedia a few minutes ago I thought, "where do I know that name from...". Pretty exciting to get a pat on the back from someone I read about in a book. Good to hear you're into journalism, now.</p>

<p>I changed some things because a controversy is still raging about Sand Creek and Black Kettle's responsability in raids against settlers. The difference between Native American friends and historians is often that the former don't want to admit anything and the latter want to find the truth. I am more confident with Mr. Michno's work than with some Native American activists. I saw several evidence of Black Kettle's crimes. I know that "the peaceful chief Black Kettle" is a historical forgery, a myth build during his own life and later given as true.</p>

<dd>The fact that this article is controversial makes it all the more important that you discuss substantial changes on the article talk page. I understand that you feel secure in your changes, but Wikipedia maintains a policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>.</dd>

<p>I think the maximum it will give is 96%. I'm not sure why that is, though. I'll have to go over the point assignments; I probably got some of the allocations wrong.

<p>I think OKCupid may have been giving you a hard time. I just checked the stats and it looks like your latest score was a 96%.

<p>We were both wrong - it's actually 4 AFDs on that article - see my comment on the AFD. I'm not suggesting you're part of a conspiracy - but I'm pretty sure there's something fishy going down somewhere. A rash of inflamatory AFD nominations, appearing over a couple of hours, on a hot button issue that's been all but dead for the past couple of years is about as obvious as it gets. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:19, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to believe you, but when people start "protesteth-ing too loudly" and making gentle cooing noises about "seeing what the community thinks" while whacking the AFD ugly stick on a range of articles that have obviously gone through that process numerous times before, my conspiracy radar starts pinging loudly. Maybe it's just the cynical times we live in. One AFD I'd like to ask you to look at is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Marlborough_3f35.html" title="Principality of Marlborough">Principality of Marlborough</a>. It's actually an important piece of Australian social history, and received wide national media coverage here at the time.

<dd>One thing to keep in mind is that there are all sorts of micronations, many of which have achieved notablilty or infamy but are not land-based (eg boats, floating platforms, conceptual entities, artistic projects, political groups, frauds and the like) so having that as a criteria is not a sound foundation for any governing principles of inclusion.

<dd>Micronation is the "proper term" (inasmuch as anything is "proper") to describe anything that looks like a country but basically isn't. That's a usage that's been pretty much established in the media and in most published written sources since the early 90s, and land seems to have little or nothing to do with it. It seems to exclude popular real independence movements, but anything that's considered a bit offbeat or whacky to hard to fit into another basket is pretty much under the umbrella. The intro to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> sums it up pretty well I think.

<dd>I think the only real place you can draw the line is how the outside world generally views it. Do substantial numbers of real people/governments think it has a real chance of becoming a sovereign state and act accordingly towards its representatives (as with Tibet, Taiwan, Western Sahara, East Timor or Chechnya), or do people/governments smile wistfully and dismiss it as a pleasant fantasy. I see no evidence of Sealand or any other micronation falling into category 1 anytime soon. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 06:03, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will stop the editing for 24 hours, but a more permanent solution needs to be found for this battle. If you look without the greatest bit of effort, you'll find these "inconclusive" and "draw" decisions are being made by an unusually strong Russian bloc, or those who study Russian history, culture, etc. I have no other affinity than to truth, and seeing as how I've studied this battle for who knows how many years, I'm fairly sure it was a Franco-allied victory. My opinion is corroborated by innumerable amounts of military historians, some of which I'd happily cite if you so wished.</p>
<p>I also want to mention that inconclusiveness amidst wikipedia members does not alter history; our conversations here may have faltered, but realities at Borodino frankly don't care what you or I think. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> (<a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUberCryxic_1ddf.html" title="User talk:UberCryxic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_UberCryxic_4af9.html" title="Special:Contributions/UberCryxic">contribs</a>) 23:50, 4 February 2006.</small></p>

Unfortunately Lamo, we've had boatloads of conversation in the talk page of Borodino and we still find ourselves at an impasse. I'm just frustrated since, like I said, it's not hard to see where the sympathies of many people involved in this drama lie (btw I'm from Albania, so no direct tie to any side involved; I thought I should make that clear to avoid any similar charges against me). The problem in the talk page is that it's mostly drawn the attention of Russian enthusiasts, and no matter what I say, they keep coming. I had a scuffle with one a few weeks ago and we agreed to "Marginal French victory," only to see more and more people coming and changing the result to "inconclusive," which is an abomination.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice about how we can resolve this, both with respect towards fellow members and an appropriate deference to history? <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">User:UberCryxic</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be happy to mediate if you'd like an impartial third-party to consider your dispute. If you request my input, I can go over the results of the talk page interaction and try to see if we can build consensus around a mutually agreeable phrasing. I don't know if everyone would be thrilled, but it's more productive than edit warring :)</dd>

Originally, it was me and <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a>. After some arguing, he agreed to leave it at "Marginal French victory." A few weeks later, the results were changed, although I'm not sure by exactly whom. I do know, from the talk page, that <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoyevoda_fad4.html" title="User:Voyevoda">Voyevoda</a> participated in the discussion, so they may have changed something.

I saw some more changes in the results section; were those made under your auspices or by the individual initiative of other editors? Either way, they still got it wrong. It now says the battle was strategically a "draw," when it was more of a loss for Napoleon. Not to go on too much, but I hope we could leave out statements of that nature, as then we could make fanciful statements about even decisive battles like Cannae, saying they were tactical victories but ultimately strategic/political failures.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 17:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I bet you enjoyed that film. I like George Clooney even if I don't agree with his politics. I thought that the film was interesting enough to watch it, certainly better than most of Hollywood's latest and "greatest". I can see why you would like it. It's right down your line of things, I suppose. I say that because I read up on who Adrian Lamo is, if that is really who you are, which I have sufficient reason to believe. Anyway, you led an interesting life so far. I am interested to see where you end up.

<p>I'm actually starting to get used to being a contributor rather than a mere troll/vandal. I added two pictures to the collection, one new article that is still very much in its initial stages, and I adjusted two others. So, all in all, it's going well. --<a href="../../../p/i/s/User%7EPistolPower_0ab2.html" title="User:PistolPower">PistolPower</a> 20:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks!

<dd>I see potential for a review of hyperspace in fiction, which would have room for explanation of any scientific fallacies involved. But that's obviously not required of you, just a suggestion.</dd>

Hey, Adrian, I wanted to thank you for your support of my (unfortunately unsuccessful) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Matt_Yeager_6f76.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Matt Yeager">request for adminship</a>. The final tally was 37/16/5, which fell short of the needed 75-80% for "consensus". Your support was particularily nice, as I hadn't ever heard of you, and it came at a time when people were voting me down because of one (totally polite) editing conflict that I had had in early November. I don't know if or when I'll go up for nomination again, but even if I don't, I will try not to betray the trust that you and 36 others were willing to place in me. Thanks for having faith in me... and happy editing! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Yeager_818e.html" title="User:Matt Yeager"><b><font color="#DF0001">Matt Yeager</font></b></a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random"><b><font size="3" color="#B46611">♫</font></b></a> <font color="#00AA88">(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_Yeager_99d2.html" title="User talk:Matt Yeager"><font color="#00AA88">Talk?</font></a>)</font> 00:57, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right. Thanks again for the concern. That said, while I appreciate your points, until policy on signatures changes, a developer compellingly explains to me why this is bad for Wikipedia, or ruling by a policy body compels otherwise, I don't see myself changing it. It seems like protecting it as-is would address all of your concerns much more equitably; I invite you to do so. Cheers! :)</dd>

<p>I noticed that, under this rubric, you made some changes to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>. Abbreviating "United States" as "USA" seems wrong to me. The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Acronyms_and_abbreviations" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">MoS</a> calls for "U.S." as the preferred abbreviation. (Actually, in the context of the McCain infobox, I think it would be more natural to identify his office as "U.S. Senator" and omit any other reference to the country.) You also changed <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. My own preference is for the former style. It's easier for the editor to create, so we're more likely to stay consistent, and in most contexts there's little chance that a reader would want to click through to the article about the state just because one city in the state is mentioned in passing. Nevertheless, I couldn't find anything on this point in the MoS. Is there a provision that supports calling this format "canonical"? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:55, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm pretty sure that's the most attention anyone has paid to my edits in some time.

<p>Funny you should mention my (67.174.157.xxx's) edits to Ogo. I actually never owned an Ogo... too many unlimited SMS accounts at the time, and too many PDAs in my pocket. But I wanted it to win, it was the first consumer non-voice cellular/PCS device that had a chance. Unfortunately, Cingular's stupidity has sent it to rot in Europe for another few years.

<dd>Unfortunately, that's standard Cingular procedure. Cingular did the same thing to UMTS customers on the AT&amp;T Wireless network for absolutely no good reason. I've had very limited conversations with Cingular engineering, and all I'll say is that those conversations are a huge reason why my service is discontinued this month... and I'll be as far away from the company as possible. They are actually angry that people on their technical level want wireless service of a technically-inclined nature. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Price_e245.html" title="User:Chris Price">Chris Price</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Price_4f29.html" title="User talk:Chris Price">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chris_Price_0b54.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chris Price">contribs</a>) 2006-02-12 13:59:19.</small></dd>

<p>Canada doesn't have a CIA analog per se, but saying they have no foreign intelligence service at all is a bit of a stretch...

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details). Also of note is the <b>Valentines ball</b> that will take place in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" rel="nofollow">the Esperanza IRC channel</a> on the 14th of February (tomorrow). It will start at 6pm UTC and go on until everyone's had enough! I hope to see you all there! Also, <b>the spamlist has been dissolved</b> - all Esperanzians will now recieve this update "newsletter".</p>
<p>The other major notice I need to tell you about is the upcoming <b>Esperanza Advisory Council Elections</b>. These will take place from <b>12:00 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20th</a> to 11:59 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27th</a></b>. The official handing-over will take place the following day. Candidates are able to volunteer any time before the 20th, so long as they are <b>already listed on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_M_38a8.html" title="WP:ESP/M">the members list</a></b>. Anyone currently listed on the memberlist can vote. In a change since last time, <i>if you have already been a member of the leadership, you may run again</i>. Due to the neutrality precident, I will not vote for anyone.</p>
<p>Yours, as ever, Esperanzially,<br />

<p>Thank you for the support and suggestions on this topic. It was kind of you to take the time to offer suggestions and support.

<li>Good evening. I thought I might ask you for your opinions and/or Advice. As this AfD sits there, I find it eats at me. Not because we "NEED" to be there, because we don't. But the truth remains, we are and I, for once, am taking this quite personally. I feel like we are being denied our fundamental right to exist and be recognized in comparison to our peers. Our entry stacks up, yet I am beginning to feel as if this has started as a malicious act and has now become the playground of others to make a point. You are an established Wikipedian and by all accounts a respected member of the community... On top of that you were very pleasant and helpful to speak with. Part of me wants to ignore this thread... however, my pride keeps me watching. How can I (why should I) detach myself from this as the community we have carefully built over the past 5 years is dragged through the ringer? In my shoes, what would you do?</li>

<dd>*facepalm* Ack, I should have been paying closer attention ... look, I can pretty much guarantee that your article(s) are not going to be kept, and using Wikipedia to evangelize commercial opportunities may adversely affect your ability to edit Wikipedia. I encouraged you to use userspace earlier, but even userspace isn't appropriate for commercial content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your article is a non-notable unverifiable neologistic marketing tactic. I wish you the very best in your business model, but I <i>strongly</i> encourage you to read up on Wikipedia policies before creating any more articles. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help!</dd>

<p>I like the layout and how you got rid of the userboxes, and the color scheme can best be described as <b>jarring</b>.

<dd>Thank you my friend, you're right, I definately need to be less controversial and more descriptive in what I mean.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ultimately, that post was to vitalize that group of people to engage in a positive action that would help the encyclopedia, adding objective NPOV criticisms of the encyclopedia they've seen that would not only help any percieved outside bias from outside Wikipedia upon Wikipedia, but help salve some of the wounds they no doubt have recieved from the often paradoxical rule structure here(I can speak first hand for that, I have nightmares about Wikipedia every now and then.)</p>
<p>And that's the tough part to understand for alot of people, if them being banned gets in the way of the encyclopedia, just as "The Cabal" has said, that being banned should be ignored. At least, that's what I believe, I think that many of them were just victims of the circumstances of misunderstanding around them rather than the breaking of any rule, which is far too unclear in the first place.</p>
<p>We can talk more, but thank you for letting me know that i've been going too extreme, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I'd like to ask you a favor, I'm going to continue moving forward, regardless of where that leads, but I might wobble again towards extremism and i'd like to ask you to remind me of that when it happens.</p>
<p>I'm still likely going to be "political"(i'm a political activist in reality), but my goal is not to ruffle feathers, but to make Wikipedia a better place for everybody. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4">Karm</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00">a</font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636">fist</font></a> 20:35, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your edit, questioning whether I'm assuming good faith on nlitements AfD..... Well I refer you to his contribution history. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Nlitement" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Nlitement" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and these quotes "These lists of possibly not-so-played-mods should satisfy your hunger for voting down every possible mod that doesn't satisfy your contribution to demonstrate "notability"."</p>
<p>"So, per their manners in handling notability, I decided to quickly check up some _definitely_ unnotable mods for BF/HL/etc and listed them all for AfD (if True Combat: Elite is actually worth an AfD, then why wouldn't they be?). The thing is, that I didn't really read the articles and thought that 11-14 total AfDs from a very large list of mods wouldn't bring up so many "bad targets", but I was wrong."</p>
<p>Personally as a member of the Firearms development team, I was a little offended to see our mod listed as "non-notable", considering we were the #3 HL mod and bought out by Valve. Assuming good faith only goes so far when the user listed something like 15 mods for AfD, with the same message for all of them, and a quick scan showed at least 3 or 4 that actually were notable. By his own admission he "didn't really read the articles".</p>
<p>So that was my reason for saying he was making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. If you'll look on his AfD submissions there are at least two others saying the same thing. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 15:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry this user's nomination of your apparently notable mod offended you. I did in fact read their <i>mea culpa</i> before closing the AfD, and it looked like they were negligent, but not malicious. In hindsight, you were correct to rebuke this user in re. using <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for his specific agenda.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Specifically, I felt the user was making a <i>point</i>, but not a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, because the latter by definition implies disruption, and disruption implies a break in functionality. I've accused people of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>'ing a tad too liberally myself in the past, and see others do it all the time, and from there flows my admonishment to you about <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I think I should have stated that more clearly instead of just leaving readers to assume that you'd gone with <a href="../../../n/o/f/WP%7ENOFAITH_5995.html" title="WP:NOFAITH">WP:NOFAITH</a>.

<dd>No offense taken. I do feel that I was justified in calling it a WP:POINT as I feel that deletion of at least 2 or 3 valid articles (especially the one withdrawn) disrupts wikipedia for whoever would have in the future read those.

<dd>Thank you for your comment. I believe the relevant part of the guidelines here to be "<i>or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</i>" -- one writer doesn't prop up a good magazine, but the guidelines recognize their involvement just the same.
