<p>He was the eldest son of Jan Hendricx Ostade, who was from the town of Ostade near <a href="../../../e/i/n/Eindhoven.html" title="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>. Although Adriaen and his brother <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Ostade_cdcd.html" title="Isaac Ostade">Isaack</a> were born in <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haarlem.html" title="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, they adopted the name "van Ostade" as painters.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobus_Houbraken_8a99.html" title="Jacobus Houbraken">Jacobus Houbraken</a>, he was taught from <a href="../../../1/6/2/1627.html" title="1627">1627</a> by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frans_Hals_aeca.html" title="Frans Hals">Frans Hals</a>, at that time the master of <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriaen_Brouwer_bc74.html" title="Adriaen Brouwer">Adriaen Brouwer</a> and Jan Miense Molenaer. At twenty-six he joined a company of the civic guard at Haarlem, and at twenty-eight he married. His wife died in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640.html" title="1640">1640</a>, and he speedily re-married. He again became a widower in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1666.html" title="1666">1666</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> he took the highest honours of his profession with the presidency of St Luke's Guild (the painters' guild) in Haarlem. Among the treasures of the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a> is a striking picture of a father sitting in state, his wife at his side, surrounded by his son, five daughters, and a young married couple in a handsomely furnished room. By an old tradition, Ostade here painted himself and his children in holiday attire; but the style is much too refined for the painter of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boor.html" title="Boor">boors</a>, and Ostade had but one daughter.</p>

"Cutting the Feather" c. 1660, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ostade was the contemporary of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Teniers_the_Younger_0fa0.html" title="David Teniers the Younger">David Teniers the Younger</a> and Adrian Brouwer. Like them, he spent his life in delineation of the homeliest subjects: tavern scenes, village fairs and country quarters. Between Teniers and Ostade the contrast lies in the different condition of the agricultural classes of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Brabant_49b9.html" title="North Brabant">Brabant</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> and in the atmosphere and dwellings peculiar to each region. Brabant has more sun and more comfort; Teniers, in consequence, is silvery and sparkling, and the people he paints are fair specimens of their culture. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people depicted by Ostade are short and ill-favoured, marked with adversity's stamp in feature and dress.</p>
<p>Brouwer, who painted the Dutch peasant in his frolics and passions, brought more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his depictions than did his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade's. During the first years of his career, Ostade tended toward the same exaggeration and frolic as his comrade, though he is distinguished from his rival by a more general use of light and shade, especially a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his harmonies remained for a time in the scale of greys, but his treatment is dry and careful in a style which shuns no difficulties of detail. He shows us the cottages, inside and out: vine leaves cloak the poverty of the outer walls; indoors, nothing decorates the patchwork of rafters and thatch, the tumble-down chimneys and the ladder staircases, the rustic Dutch home of those days. The greatness of Ostade lies in how often he caught the poetic side of the peasant class in spite of its coarseness. He gave the magic light of a sun-gleam to their lowly sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment; he clothed the wreck of the cottages with gay vegetation.</p>
<p>It was natural, given the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the first, that he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Rembrandt.html" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he glided from one period to the other. Before the dispersal of the Gsell collection at <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies, the exaggerated caricature of his early works between <a href="../../../1/6/3/1632.html" title="1632">1632</a> and <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>. There is a picture in the Vienna Gallery of a <i>Countryman Having his Tooth Drawn</i>, unsigned, and painted about 1632; a "Bagpiper" of <a href="../../../1/6/3/1635.html" title="1635">1635</a> in the Liechtenstein Gallery at Vienna; cottage scenes of 1635 and <a href="../../../1/6/3/1636.html" title="1636">1636</a> in the museums of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlsruhe.html" title="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darmstadt.html" title="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a>; and the <i>Card Players</i> of <a href="../../../1/6/3/1637.html" title="1637">1637</a> in the Liechtenstein palace at Vienna, making up for the loss of the Gsell collection. The same style marks most of those pieces.</p>

<i>The painter in his workshop (selfportrait)</i> (1663), at the Sempergalerie, Dresden</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>About <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a> or <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640.html" title="1640">1640</a>, the influence of Rembrandt suddenly changed his style. He painted the <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Annunciation.html" title="Annunciation">Annunciation</a></i> of the Brunswick Museum: angels, appearing in the sky to Dutch boors half-asleep amidst their cattle, sheep and dogs in front of a cottage, recall at once the similar subject by Rembrandt, who effectively lighted the principal groups by rays propelled to earth from a murky sky. Ostade, however, did not succeed here in giving dramatic force and expression; his shepherds were without much emotion, passion or surprise. His picture was an effect of light, and masterly as such, in its sketchy rubbings of dark brown tone relieved by strongly impasted lights, but without the very qualities which made his usual subjects attractive.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a> he painted the beautiful interior at the Louvre: a mother tending her cradled child, her husband sitting nearby, beside a great chimney; the darkness of a country loft dimly illumined by a sunbeam shining on the casement. One might think the painter intended to depict the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity.html" title="Nativity">Nativity</a>; but there is nothing holy in the surroundings, nothing attractive, indeed, except the wonderful Rembrandtesque transparency, the brownish tone, and the admirable keeping of the minutest parts. Ostade was more at home in a similar effect applied to the commonplace incident of the <i>Slaughtering of a Pig</i>, one of the masterpieces of <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a>, and once in the Gsell collection.</p>
<p>In this and similar subjects of the previous and succeeding years, he returned to the homely themes in which his power and wonderful observation had made him a master. He does not seem to have gone back to <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospel</a> illustrations until <a href="../../../1/6/6/1667.html" title="1667">1667</a>, when he produced an admirable <i>Nativity</i> which is only surpassed in arrangement and colour by Rembrandt's <i>Carpenter's Family</i> at the Louvre, or by the <i>Woodcutter and Children</i> in the gallery of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassel.html" title="Cassel">Cassel</a>. Almost innumerable are the more familiar themes to which he devoted his brush during this interval: from small single figures, representing smokers or drinkers, to allegories of the five senses (<a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermitage_Museum_c76e.html" title="Hermitage Museum">Hermitage</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Brunswick</a> galleries), half-lengths of fishmongers and bakers, cottage brawls, scenes of gambling, itinerant players and quacks, and ninepins players in the open air.</p>

<p>The humour in some of these pieces is contagious, as in the <i>Tavern Scene</i> of the Lacaze collection (Louvre, <a href="../../../1/6/5/1653.html" title="1653">1653</a>). His art may be studied in the large series of dated pieces which adorn every European capital from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_adeb.html" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> has a large number, and many a good specimen lies hidden in private collections in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. Should we select a few as peculiarly worthy of attention, we might point to the <i>Rustics in a Tavern</i> of <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> at the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague.html" title="Hague">Hague</a>, the <i>Village School</i> of the same year at the Louvre, the <i>Tavern Court-yard</i> of <a href="../../../1/6/7/1670.html" title="1670">1670</a> at Cassel, the <i>Sportsmen's Rest</i> of <a href="../../../1/6/7/1671.html" title="1671">1671</a> at <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, and the <i>Fiddler and his Audience</i> of 1673 at the Hague.</p>
<p>At Amsterdam we have the likeness of a painter, sitting with his back to the spectator, at his easel. The colour-grinder is at work in a corner, a pupil prepares a palette, and a black dog sleeps on the ground. A replica of this picture, with the date <a href="../../../1/6/6/1666.html" title="1666">1666</a>, is in the Dresden gallery. Both specimens are supposed to represent Ostade himself, but unfortunately we see the artist's back and not his face. In an etching (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartsch.html" title="Bartsch">Bartsch</a>, 32), the painter shows himself in profile at work on a canvas. Two of his latest dated works, the <i>Village Street</i> and the <i>Skittle Players</i>, noteworthy items in the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashburton.html" title="Ashburton">Ashburton</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellesmere.html" title="Ellesmere">Ellesmere</a> collections, were executed in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1676.html" title="1676">1676</a> without any sign of declining powers. He died in 1685 in Haarlem.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriaen_van_Ostade_375f.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>The number of Ostade's pictures is given by Smith at 385, but by Hofstede de Groot (1910) at over 900. At his death, the stock of his unsold pieces was over 200. His engraved plates were put up to auction with the pictures. Fifty etched plates, most of them dated <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>–<a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>, were disposed of in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1686.html" title="1686">1686</a>. there are 220 of his pictures in public and private collections, of which 104 are signed and dated, while seventeen are signed with the name but not with the date.</p>
<p>The prices which Ostade received are not known; but pictures which were worth £40 in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1750.html" title="1750">1750</a> were worth £1000 a century later, and Earl Dudley gave £4120 for a cottage interior in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>.</p>
<p>The signatures of Ostade vary at different periods, but the first two letters are generally interlaced. Up to 1635, Ostade writes himself Ostaden, e.g. in the <i>Bagpiper</i> of 1635 in the Liechtenstein collection at Vienna. Later on, he uses the long s (f), and occasionally he signs in capital letters. His pupils are his own brother Isaack, Cornelis Bega, Cornelis Dusart and Richard Brakenburg.</p>
