<p>Two points. First, please use the "Show preview" button, and carefully proof-read your text - this will prevent errors like [[|Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]]), which you left in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">Medici</a> page when you edited it. Second, you marked your change as "Minor", which wasn't really appropriate give how many changes you made to the page. I know <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#Minor_edits" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Minor edits</a> says "spelling corrections, formatting, and minor rearranging of text", but the number and magnitude of your changes (e.g. changing all the names) took it past the stage where that flag was appropriate. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 01:39, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I always preview pages I edit. I also don't see where I erred by changing "Lorenzo de' Medici" to "Lorenzo the Magnificent." I was going to use full Italian names but I figured since this article is in English and the Medici context is given, why not use simplified English names. The "Minor edit" flag is checked by default given my current settings since nearly all of my edits are minor. Unless I'm adding new information or creating a new article, I won't bother to uncheck the minor edit flag. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 06:39, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no problem with people editing text I wrote (check out the pages I created - I'm rarely the top edit), but when someone but gratuitously re-arranges massive amounts of stuff, <i>without adding any new content</i>, <b>and</b> introduces a flock of errors - plus to which your edit seemed hasty and careless because of the numerous errors, including grammatical and formatting errors (e.g. the broken Lorenzo link) - yeah, it's irritating. I mean, someone else asked for more stuff, you replied on the talk page, but didn't actually add any content; I did divert from other things to add content, and then had to come back and fix a bunch of mistakes. Most of your edits seemed like either an improvement, or something I could live with (most uses of names of the form [Foo} the [Bar], which I left alone - I understood your reasoning and was OK with it in most cases), and those I left. The few things I changed back were because I had specific reasons for putting them the way I did - e.g. the "Uffizi buildings" is because I wanted to differentiate with the <i>contents</i> (which the Medici are also largely responsible for). You don't get to have the page <i>exactly</i> the way you want it any more than I do. And how am I supposed to know you know who Cosimo the Elder really is? All I know is what you typed. I'd really rather be working on new pages (there are still tons of Florence-related pages missing) - this kind of stuff really takes the fun out of working on the 'pedia. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 13:55, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../u/f/f/Uffizi.html" title="Uffizi">Uffizi</a> page defines "Uffizi" as "a palace, holding one of the most famous museums in the world." Within the context of the statement referencing the Uffizi in our article which reads, "In architecture, the Medici are responsible for some notable features of Florence," architecture is mentioned and therefore logically concluding that "features" are buildings so stating that those features are buildings is redundant and thus unneeded. You also re-added the "magnificent" attribute to Uffizi which hurt the NPOV of the article.</dd>

<dd>As for new content, I'm currently working on a more informational and accurate Medici family tree using GEDCOM. There are plenty of people missing from the tree such as Salvestro de' Medici who led a rebellion and became the dictator of Florence... and who also was banished. Many of the birth and death dates are incorrect as are some connections between family members. Those whom married into the Medici family also seem to be missing. While that may be intended, I think both parents of a Medici should be listed and not just the "pureblood." <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 19:39, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I used "magnificent" solely to emphasize the scale of the Medici collections, not because of an opinion about the museum.

<p>What on earth is this with "Giovanni of the Black Bands"? He's far better known as "Giovanni delle Bande Nere" - a web count of pages <i>in English</i> shows 311 for "Giovanni delle Bande Nere", and 11 for "Giovanni of the Black Bands".</p>
<p>Look, I give up. You can do whatever the heck you want with the flipping Medici pages. I'm taking this one off my watch list, and you can take complete charge of adding material, writing new pages, etc, etc. I edit Wikipedia for fun, not aggravation, and I don't need this.

<dd>I don't know whether to laugh or poke fun. If you're getting this upset, seeking psychiatric aid is what you should be doing, not editing Wikipedia articles. You've attacked my use of bynames in the past ("the Great," "the Elder," etc.) but you prefer "Giovanni Dalle Bande Nere," which is Lodovico's byname, to the translation "Giovanni of the Black Bands." This is an English article, not an Italian article. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 02:16, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I think my reason for preferring "Giovanni delle Bande Nere" is quite clearly given immediately above, if you bother to read it. And perhaps you meant <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palazzo_Pitti_3d78.html" title="Palazzo Pitti">Palazzo Pitti</a> - or was that another of your mistakes? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 17:12, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Piazza de' Pitti" is a formal name just as "Giovanni de' Medici" is a formal name. "Pitti Palace" and "Palazzo Pitti" are both informal names just as "Giovanni of the Black Bands" is an informal name. Since we're using informal names to dumb down the content for less informed readers, there's no sense in being inconsistent. So no, your reason is weak and doesn't justify using Italian names when English names exists. <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9051738" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9051738" rel="nofollow">See here</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 19:58, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adraeus,</p>
<p>I consider my task to be finished if there is no one left on one side of the dispute. I have not read your essays that you pointed me to because I came into this for the sole purpose of dispute resolution. In order to accomplish this, it is important that I do not take either side. From my point of view, both sides had a valid argument, so I went on to not consider it vandalism on either part and took it as serious dispute resolution. Valid is not to say right. Frankly, I don't care who is right or wrong.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of my intervening was to resolve the dispute to a point where one side is not constantly reverting the other side's contributions and to get things to a point where contributions to the article can resume. That's it.</p>
<p>Atheism is, at its base, philosophy. Philosophy, by its nature, is argumentative and subjective. Wikipedia is not intended to create articles stating one point of view is philosophically correct. It is intended to be neutral. This means in a philosophical matter, all arguments must be represented fairly and impartially. From the title of one of your articles, I see that it calls Ayn Rand's theories heresy. Obviously this means that the authors views differ greatly from Ms. Rand's. Because of this, it is clear that the essay is not neutral. It takes a side. And anyone who recognizes Ayn Rand as a philosopher (which is a large population) would find that essay to be biased. Therefore, if your author's views are represented, Ms. Rand's contrary views MUST be respresented (even if they appear to some to be very, very wrong) in order to make it NPOV. In fact, someone trying to make the article NPOV would seek out these views and include them without passion or prejudice for the sole purpose of illustrating that there are other views and the one that the author is stating is not necessarily correct.</p>
<p>In politics, it is the same way. You can feel down to your bones that Republicans are absolutely correct on an issue. No doubt about it, every shred of scientific and ideological fact shows they are. But if you write an article about it and do not include the Democratic viewpoint without stating, implying or alluding to the fact that it is 100% wrong, the article is biased by definition.</p>
<p>I came to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk:Atheism</a> with the goal of assisting in facilitating compromise. Compromise is the only way that Wikipedia works. I do not consider myself to have been successful by any means. On the contrary, I am as disappointed as you are. But the fact remains that my goal was to relieve the conflict so that contributions to the article could continue. Without 2 or more sides to an argument, there is no conflict. The goal has been accomplished, but I am not happy about how it was accomplished. If <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">User:20040302</a> et al. had left the discussion without resolution, I would not feel happy about it either. But it is what it is. I will not facilitate further argument. And without argument, I have no purpose in this matter. Therefore, I am stepping away and letting Wikipedia continue as was intended.</p>
<p>I am sorry that you feel disappointment with the outcome, but I hope you realize that I do, as well. The difference is that I am not in the dispute, so I will not get myself personally invested in the outcome.</p>
<p>Regardless, if you go back to the article and <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">User:20040302</a> is twisting the views, I will be happy to come back and assist. But you cannot revert everything that does not conform to your views. It is just not how Wikipedia is meant to work. User:20040302 is respectful of my position and knows I mean well, so he will compromise if I place it in front of him. If you feel he is going overboard, I will be happy to reign things back, but you will have to be prepared to accept his views being included in the article to some extent.</p>

<dd><b>Atheism is not a philosophy</b>. From George Smith (1980), " 'Theism' and 'atheism' are descriptive terms: they specify the presence or absence of a belief in god. If a person is designated as a theist, this tells us that he believes in a god, not why he believes. If a person is designated as an atheist, this tells us that he does not believe in a god, not why he does not believe. "</dd>

<dd>I hope you don't honestly think that you can play judge without knowledge of the topic. If the U.S. legal system worked in such a manner, we'd have a monocracy, not a republic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, you consistently refer to the state of the article as "my views." That is inaccurate. While I empathize with that view, it is not a subjective perspective; it is supported by etymology, epistemology, history, literature, and law. The root word of "atheism," "atheal," is from the Greek "without God." If you define "athiesm" in only its narrow form, atheism becomes a religion where the strong atheists are "True Atheists" whom claim the weak atheists are merely religious heretics, not "True Atheists." <a href="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/showthread.php?p=1922685#post1922685" class="external text" title="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/showthread.php?p=1922685#post1922685" rel="nofollow">I reject that fallacy</a> as I'm certain many, many, many other people do. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 22:45, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, quick note to point out that I've replied on <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User Talk:Jimbo Wales</a>. I hadn't looked at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk:Atheism</a> until you mentioned it. I keep only a very small number of controversial pages on my watchlist, lest I go utterly crazy&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had a few discussions with FeloniousMonk, and figured he could use some clarification on wikipedia policies. I kept suggesting he might want to have a chat with Jimbo, but maybe he was shy or something. Following on from that I dropped a note on Jimbos' page asking if maybe Jimbo would like to contact FeloniousMonk then?</p>
<p>I'm kind of surprised at what followed. Poor Jimbo, he's going to have to read through all that stuff now.&#160;:-/</p>
<p>Ah well, also check my reply there, which summarises what I definately did not do.</p>

<dd>The summary on the talk page explains why (according to me) it should be left there (factual, a good time marker, good style, precedents abound, and 4000 google hits). Now, as to why <i>I care</i>, it's simple: Someone decided to take delete a true fact because of their POV that the mention ought to go, then others came in and virtually claimed ownership of the article. That's not wiki. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 00:24, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Instead of promoting a statement that results in inferential conclusions—that is the nature of coincidences after all— why not write a statement that works as a factual "good time marker" without the inferential comparison of Darwin with Lincoln?

Only "loons" take me seriously? I'm somebody's "cronie"? You do realize that complex mechanisms were being developed at the time of Gutenberg: windmills, church clocks, etc. along with masonry and metal works. The Chinese had already invented printing but they used characters engraved on wooden blocks. Printing was an idea whose time had come. This often happens. Leibniz came up with the calculus independently of Newton. Wallace came up with natural selection independently of Darwin. Sometimes ideas appear before the world is ready for them, e.g. Leonardo (who's not in the Ten list, BTW) invented and flying machines way before supporting technologies were available. Of course, that's just a "loony" idea, but Gutenberg before Leonardo? <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 02:30, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Read <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Advocate_8932.html" title="Devil's Advocate">Devil's Advocate</a>. The Association of Members' Advocates—which I'm hesitant to abbreviate since there are far more respectable organizations using the same abbreviation such as the American Marketing Association, the American Medical Association and the American Management Association—promotes Devil's Advocacy. Members of the "AMA" are encouraged to run to the aid of the "defense-impaired" and help them fight the good fight regardless of reason. You even stated, "I'm only <b>defending</b> Vincent because I'm in the AMA! I <b>never</b> did <b>any</b> edit in Charles Darwin ..." You defend Vfp15 because you're an "AMA" member. That's hardly a good reason. Your lack of contributions to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> article demonstrates you are uninterested in contributing to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> article; therefore, your involvement in these issues is purely trollish being unwanted and unneeded. Be grateful that I've reserved the term "vandal" to those who deface articles instead of articles, discussions and issues.</dd>

<dd>First, I recognize that you're one of the best <i>rhétores</i> I've ever seen. I like debates (though I'm not good on them, unfortunately) and that's why I proposed one. You are defeating me!</dd>
<dd>I didn't any edit the article only because I knew it would be another problem for Vincent's position and for me. I knew, and was right, that someone would try to qualify me only because I'm Vincent's advocate and took that decission. Also, I didn't wanted to complicate things more than they are. I don't remember if I said it or not: I came through the RfC to the article. Adraeus, if you'd like, call me the Devil's Advocate, I like the 'title' (I'm not satanist).</dd>
<dd>You said that to defend Vincent only because I'm on the AMA it's not a good reason. You're right, I recognize. You can use this statements as evidence against me if you want.</dd>
<dd>Adraeus, you didn't answer me why you don't like the AMA (the Wikipedia one). It surprises me: you say I don't have good reasons, but bad as I say by myself. You don't have reasons: nor good nor bad. You're the perfect P.R! I'd like to learn from you how to do it, actually.</dd>

<dd>1. By having not established previous interest in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> article and by assuming a defensive stance with <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vfp15</a>, you complicated the issue of <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vfp15</a>'s behavior regardless of your intent to do otherwise. Understand that you are now referenced as an <i>advocate for inclusion of the trivia</i> despite your maintaining that your only interest in the article stems from your involvement with the Association of Members' Advocates as a pseudo-lawyer for <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vfp15</a>.</dd>

<dd>2. Unlike <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a>, I prefer to refrain from using irrelevant facts to build a case. Moreover, I highly doubt arbitration will produce a positive result favoring <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vfp15</a> considering the evidence against him; thus, I see no need to play dirty. A legend surrounding the <a href="../../../s/g/i/Sgian_dubh.html" title="Sgian dubh">sgian dubh</a> is that it is never to be drawn for trivial or mundane purposes and must taste blood before it can be re-sheathed even if the user must nick his own finger. I apply a similar idea to verbal battle.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reasons. Now that I understand what you say and that you were not trying to insult me nor attack me, but expressed half of your opinions about advocating.</dd>
<dd>If someone calls me 'advocate for the trivia', I don't care. I haven't done nothing wrong nor against Wikipedia policies, only said my opinions and offered my help to Vincent in the dispute resolution system.</dd>
<dd>A little off-topic opinion: I'd like to see a mediation (which I <b>won't</b> request) between Sam and you. I say it because many users and I see you in constant battling.</dd>
<dd>Any comment you have, send it to my <a href="../../../i/m/a/User_talk%7EImaglang_20a4.html" title="User talk:Imaglang">talk</a>, for discussion here it's not longer necessary; all it's very clear to me now: you wrote your comments in good faith. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 17:12, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Adraeus,</p>
<p>Just to let you know that in your evidence on the Arbitration pages, it would better if you gave links to the specific diffs that you are discussing, rather than general links to the talk page. The format is discussed at the top of the page <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Charles_Darwin-Lincoln_dispute_Evidence_8167.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Charles Darwin-Lincoln dispute/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Charles_Darwin-Lincoln_dispute/Evidence</a>, but it is really just a matter of looking at the history of your talk page, selecting the relevant diff, then copying the full page URL as an external link on the evidence page. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:00, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trouble is, the Arbitration committee has even more work to do in reviewing the case. They won't be reading the whole history of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7ECharles_Darwin_c733.html" title="Talk:Charles Darwin">Talk:Charles Darwin</a> and various user pages.
