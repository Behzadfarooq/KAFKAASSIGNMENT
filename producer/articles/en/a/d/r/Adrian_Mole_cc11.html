<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Mole_cc11.html" title="Edit section: Themes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Themes</span></h2>
<p>The books have two main themes. The first books concentrate on Adrian's desires and ambitions in life (to marry Pandora Braithwaite, become a published writer of poetry and novels, obtain financial security), and his complete failure to achieve them. In many ways, the books are extremely accurate satires of human pretensions (and teenage pretensions in particular in the early books).</p>
<p>The second theme is depiction of the social and political situation in Britain, with particular reference to left-wing politics in the 1980s in the first three books. For example, Adrian's parents divorce at a time when that was comparatively rare in Britain. His mother becomes a staunch <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> and briefly joined the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenham_Common_57d3.html" title="Greenham Common">Greenham Common</a> campaigners. Pandora and her parents are part of an intellectualised and left-wing middle-class that attempted to embrace the working class, and which was only just becoming apparent at the time.</p>
<p>Humour arises from the outworking of larger social forces within a very ordinary working-class household in what is quite literally <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_England_aa51.html" title="Middle England">middle Britain</a> - the Midlands.</p>
<p>The two most recent books are slightly different from the first three "classic" books, because they show Adrian as an adult in different environments. They are more focused on political satire, mainly examining New Labour, and in particular the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_war.html" title="Iraq war">Iraq war</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Mole_cc11.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Adrian Albert Mole was born on April 2nd 1967 to George Alfred Mole and Pauline Monica Mole (née Sugden). They share their house in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester.html" title="Leicester">Leicester</a> (they later move to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashby-de-la-Zouch_c54f.html" title="Ashby-de-la-Zouch">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a>) with their dog, only ever referred to as "the dog" (and, when eventually replaced, "the new dog"), and later with Adrian's sister, Rosie Germaine Mole (named after Germaine Greer), who was born on November 11th 1982. Adrian's paternal grandmother Edna May Mole (referred to simply as Grandma) is also prominent in many of his diary entries.</p>
<p><a name="Family" id="Family"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Mole_cc11.html" title="Edit section: Family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h3>
<p>Adrian's parents <b>Pauline</b> and <b>George Mole</b> are somewhat <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysfunctional.html" title="Dysfunctional">dysfunctional</a>. Both are <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> characters with limited scope who drink and smoke a lot. They are both perpetually unemployed, and have separated, divorced and remarried more than once. Adrian has a sister called <b>Rosie Mole</b> who is very rebellious and "street", in total contrast to Adrian. Although their personalities are practically opposite to each other, Rosie and Adrian enjoy a close relationship as siblings, and Adrian often feels that she is the only member of the Mole family who truly understands him.</p>
<p>Pauline first leaves George for their neighbour, Mr. Lucas; George fathers a second son named <b>Brett</b> by a lover called Doreen Slater (aka "Stick Insect"); both are soon forgotten. Pauline temporarily marries her much younger lodger <b>Martin Muffet</b>, who eventually leaves her for Adrian's girlfriend <b>Bianca Dartington</b>, giving Adrian and his mother a shared heartbreak. Later, George and Pauline effect a partner swap with <b>Ivan</b> and <b>Tania Braithwaite</b>, only to reunite after Ivan's untimely death.</p>
<p>In the course of his life, Adrian fathers three children.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Glenn Bott-Mole</b>, son of <b>Sharon Bott</b>, whom Adrian fancied at school and had an affair with as a young man, but who developed into an intellectually challenged woman.</li>
<li><b>William (Wole) Mole</b>, the son of his first wife JoJo, from Nigeria. In the most recent book Glenn is fighting in the Iraq war and William has gone back to Nigeria to live with his mother, whom Adrian divorced due to his intolerance of her 'exhibitionist' sneezing and claims of her inability to cook (although she is said to cook Nigerian food superbly), and also the fact that she was taller than him. He has also changed his Christian name from William to Wole to make it sound more African. (When he tells Adrian about this, he concludes his son is going to tire soon of his new name, <i>Wole Mole</i>. This is purely a visual joke, as Wole and Mole do not rhyme; Wole is pronounced <i>wol-eh</i>.)</li>
<li><b>Gracie Mole</b>, the daughter of his current wife <b>Daisy (née Flowers)</b>, a smart, good-looking woman with whom he enjoys great mutual attraction.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Mole_cc11.html" title="Edit section: Friends">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Friends</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora_Braithwaite_b53b.html" title="Pandora Braithwaite">Pandora Braithwaite</a> is the love of Adrian's life. She is beautiful and intelligent, and in the first books they are happy together. In the later books she shuns Adrian in favour of, by turns, physically and intellectually powerful men, though he remains attached to her. Adrian tends to devote a lot of his diary space to her, whomever she is currently dating (and his various flaws), and pining for their lost love. The smart, polyglot and extremely attractive Pandora becomes a rising star in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Labour_d0a0.html" title="New Labour">New Labour</a> under <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Baxter_317e.html" title="Bert Baxter">Bert Baxter</a></b>, an <a href="../../../o/a/p/OAP_758a.html" title="OAP">old-age pensioner</a> Adrian looks after. Despite the fact that Baxter is filthy, rude, a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a>, and has a vicious <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Shepherd_Dog_83e7.html" title="German Shepherd Dog">alsatian</a>, Adrian becomes very fond of him. Bert later marries another pensioner named Queenie, who died in 1982. Bert himself died in 1997, at the age of 105, by falling down the stairs despite previously vowing not to die until he had seen the fall of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>.</li>
<li><b>Nigel Hetherington</b> is Adrian's on-and-off best chum who has a somewhat <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">bohemian</a> lifestyle. He is <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> and becomes <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindness.html" title="Blindness">blind</a> in the last novel, at least partly reflecting Townsend's own blindness.</li>
<li><b>Barry Kent</b> is a <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinhead.html" title="Skinhead">skinhead</a> who initially bullied Adrian and later became a "bad influence" upon him in his teen years. Despite previous racism, at the age of 16 he became a rabid <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-racist.html" title="Anti-racist">anti-racist</a>. At some point, Adrian discovered that Barry had a natural gift for poetry, which he encouraged him to develop. However, he bitterly regretted this when Barry became not only a successful poet, but author of a hit novel <i>Dork's Diary</i> which revolved around a loser called <i>Aiden Vole</i> (a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue-in-cheek.html" title="Tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> reference to the <i>Adrian Mole</i> books themselves). A lot of humour comes from the fact that Barry Kent, although seemingly ill-educated and rough-natured, succeeds on natural talent, which Adrian Mole clearly lacks.</li>
<li><b>Hamish Mancini</b> is Adrian's American friend and penpal. They first met on Adrian's vacation to Shephard. In the second book, Hamish runs away from his home to come live with Adrian briefly. He returns home shortly. In <i>The True Confessions of Adrian Mole</i>, he writes a letter to Adrian asking him to explain the British terms in Adrian's diary, which means that Hamish somehow got hold of Adrian's diaries. However, he sends them back and that is the last time in the books Hamish is mentioned.</li>

<p>Townsend has announced that <i>Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> will be the last book of the series due to her poor health. The series is resolved in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adrian suffers an emotional crisis after the death of Robert Stainforth (Glenn's best friend) in the Iraq War; he realises that the war (which he had supported passionately) was fought for bogus reasons, and faces financial ruin (he has only ever had poorly paid employment, such as working as an offal cook in a fashionable London restaurant). He comes to recognise that he has lived in a dream world and is forced to confront reality.</li>
<li>After narrowly escaping bankruptcy, Adrian obtains a steady job in a bookstore run by Mr. Carlton-Hayes, probably the first employer to make Adrian work efficiently. Although he faces a lifetime of debt service, the job is well enough paid for Adrian to be able to pay his creditors and still make a reasonable living. Carlton-Hayes also strongly hints that he wants him to run the shop after he has retired.</li>
<li>Adrian begins a serious relationship (eventually leading to marriage, although the actual wedding is not chronicled) with Daisy Flowers, his secret love of most of the book, and fathers a daughter called Gracie. They enjoy a happy, fulfilling relationship.</li>
<li>His father, who has become wheelchair-bound, his mother and Animal (his real name), who has assisted them in converting two pigsties into living quarters (one of which Adrian, Daisy and Gracie live in at the end of the book) live together in a consensual <i><a href="../../../m/%C3%A9/n/M%C3%A9nage_%C3%A0_trois.html" title="Ménage à trois">ménage à trois</a></i>.</li>
<li>Pandora continues working as a politician (albeit a blackballed one), and says that despite their insurmountable differences, she still likes Adrian very much. After all these years, he is the only person she can talk to freely. In her autobiography <i>Out of the Box</i>, she describes him as her first romantic interest and gives him an unflattering, but honest account of his shortcomings.</li>
<li>In the last entry, Adrian concludes that keeping a diary is only for unhappy people. Daisy then asks why Adrian was starting one again. Adrian says he wants to start an autobiography but Daisy says that other people will find him uninteresting.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the diary ends, the whole decades-spanning Mole Saga comes to a ragged but hopeful conclusion.</p>

<li>The character originated in a <i>Thirty-Minute Theatre</i> play on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_4_eb17.html" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> called 'The Diary of Nigel Mole, Aged 13¼', broadcast on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">2 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, with Nicholas Barnes as Nigel.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The first name was changed to Adrian in the subsequent book as the original was thought to be too close to that of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Molesworth_13b4.html" title="Nigel Molesworth">Nigel Molesworth</a> (whom Sue Towsend said she had previously not heard of).</li>
<li>The books spawned three TV series.

<li>Fortress Entertainment producers Brett Forbes and Patrick Rizzotti and Ruby Films producer Alison Owen have partnered to produce the feature film entitled <i>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole</i> based on the first books in the series.</li>
<li>Guardian Archive, entitled <i><b>Diary of a Provincial Man.</b></i> A less well-known chapter of Adrian's life was chronicled in a weekly column of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> newspaper, which ran from December 1999<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/article/0,,124422,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/article/0,,124422,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to November 2001<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/0,,124404,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/0,,124404,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

Adrian spends this period living on a crime-ridden council estate with his sons Glenn and William, has an on-off romance with a woman named Pamela Pigg, and temporarily works in a lay-by trailer cafe. He befriends yet another pensioner who subsequently dies, and has a brief infatuation with his male therapist (which he insists is wholly spiritual, not homosexual). The series includes comment on the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_fuel_protests_8329.html#September_2000_protests" title="UK fuel protests">petrol crisis of 2000</a>, the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11 bombings</a> and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a>. Adrian's illegitimate half-brother Brett Mole, born on 5 August 1982, is reintroduced as a 19 year-old; he is an athletic, popular, confident, promiscuous, super-intelligent Oxford undergraduate, already a published poet and TV documentarian - in short, the person Adrian always wanted to be. Brett's mediocre older sibling soon comes to regard him with envious loathing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the period on a sink council estate is referred to briefly in <i>The Cappuccino Years</i>, the events of <i>Diary of a Provincial Man</i> are perhaps not strictly <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical.html" title="Canonical">canonical</a>. For example, Adrian later states that he can count the women he has had carnal knowledge of "on the fingers of one hand" [also in <i>The Cappuccino Years</i>]. Those women would be: Sharon Bott, Bianca Dartington, JoJo Mole and Marigold and Daisy Flowers. Inserting Pamela Pigg into this list makes six - more than the fingers of one hand, unless Adrian has a polydactyl deformity. The third wedding of Adrian's parents is described, but no mention is made of Ivan Braithwaite dying. Also, Adrian's ex-wife JoJo e-mails him from Nigeria and names her new husband as one Colonel Ephat Mapfumo. In <i>The Cappuccino Years</i>, her husband's name is Wole; and Brett is again forgotten.</p>

<p>There are two major temporal contradictions running through the life of Adrian Mole. The first regards his own age.</p>
<p>The original novel, <i>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾,</i> has his 14th birthday as April 2, four months before the marriage of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales_d703.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Diana Spencer</a> on July 29, 1981, placing his birth on <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Townsend_831a.html" title="Sue Townsend">Sue Townsend</a>'s 21st birthday, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2.html" title="April 2">April 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. This is confirmed in the second novel, <i>Growing Pains</i>, which has Adrian's 16th birthday 2 months before the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a> of June 9, 1983. The collection <i>From Minor to Major</i>, stated to chronicle the first 10 years of his diaries, ends on January 1st 1991: thus confirming the start of the first book as January 1, 1981 and Adrian's year of birth as 1967. Howevever, the intermediate book <i>True Confessions</i> begins at Christmas 1984, when Adrian states he is 16 years and 8 months old - which would mean he was born in 1968, not 67. In a following chapter set in June 1988, his age is 20 years, 2 months (and he is having his first sexual relationship, with Sharon Botts - later renamed Bott), also consistent with a 1968 birth.</p>
<p><i>The Wilderness Years</i>, immediately following <i>From Minor to Major</i>, has Adrian's 24th birthday in 1991 - so it seems that he was, after all, born in 1967. The next novel, <i>The Cappuccino Years</i>, is consistent with this, beginning at the 1997 general election and giving Adrian's age as 30. Likewise, in the weekly newspaper serial <i>Diary of a Provincial Man</i>, Adrian has his 33rd birthday in the year 2000.</p>
<p>The final novel, <i>Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>, begins in late 2002 and makes Adrian only 34. In fact, on his birthday in 2003, he pointedly bemoans his turning 35 as the beginning of middle age so, somehow, he was once again born in 1968.</p>
<p>The second, more glaring error is the age of Adrian's older son, Glenn Bott-Mole. According to the final chapter of <i>From Minor to Major</i>, Glenn's mother, Sharon Bott (not Botts), was three months pregnant with him in July 1989. The baby should, therefore, be born around January 1990. On Christmas Eve 1990 Adrian meets Glenn for the first time, describing him as "a strange-looking moon-headed toddler."</p>
<p>The boy is not medically confirmed as Adrian's son until <i>The Cappuccino Years</i>, set in 1997... yet he is now 12 years old, when consistency would require him to be only 7. Those 5 years of premature ageing would require that Adrian's relationship with Sharon be <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> back four years to 1984! This would make Adrian and Sharon 17 when they conceived Glenn (they were in the same year at school, so are the same age). Not only that, but Glenn's 13th birthday falls in April of 1998, not January. The final word comes from <i>The Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>, where Glenn is 17 and has just joined the Army in 2002. This concurs with his age in the previous book — although his father's age has been quietly reduced by a year.</p>
<p>In The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole, his sister Rosie is born on 11 Nov 1982. However, by the start of the Cappuccino Years (May 1997), it is implied that she is 15 years old and about to take her GCSEs and leave school. If her birthdate in the Growing Pains is correct, she should be only 14 years old and in Year 9 in May 1997, and should take her GCSEs and leave school in summer 1999. Later in the Cappuccino Years, in October 1997, Adrian mentions that Rosie is still at school (as she should be, going by her birthdate in the Growing Pains).</p>
