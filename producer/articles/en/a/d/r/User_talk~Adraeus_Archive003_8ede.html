<p>Hi, I really appreciate your invitation. One snag I see is that I do almost all of my research off-line. Also, despite current appearances, I really cannot afford to make research for Wikipedia a priority. I really like the idea of your project and would like to participate. It is just that right now, I am not sure what, or how much, I could contribute, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:22, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, but I really don't have access to an online research database.

<dd>Oh, he's not <i>that</i> bad!&#160;;) Think of <i>Inquiry</i> as a Research Taskforce (a la the Cleanup Taskforce). <i>Inquiry</i> acquires, collects, disseminates, and publishes academically credible research for other editors to use in Wikipedia articles. An important point to consider is that not all members are required to have access to an online (or offline) research database. In fact, <i>Inquiry</i> needs people who are willing to add issues to our in-the-works task tracking system, which will probably use <a href="../../../b/u/g/BugZilla_738e.html" title="BugZilla">BugZilla</a>. So even if you don't want to become an <i>Inquiry</i> reseacher, you can still be a helpful member. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 21:10, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please don't insult people as we have a policy of no personal attacks at Wikipedia. That includes your naive shout at me at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_accident.html" title="Car accident">car accident</a>. I suggest you look at the naming convention "common names" page (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">here</a>). You may also wish to note that I do all the <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> moves so I have quite a bit of experience in naming conventions. Finally, to back up my choice, you may want to compare the Google results:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Vehicular collision": 815</li>
<li>"Car accident": 1,550,000</li>

Of course, I could provide <i>even more</i> academic references, but for some odd reason, the voters at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECar_accident_3538.html" title="Talk:Car accident">Talk:Car accident</a> think "vehicular collision" requires an argument. That was sarcasm, by the way. "Vehicular collision" requires no argument. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is an encyclopedia. As such, articles like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_accident.html" title="Car accident">car accident</a> need to be academically credible and NPOV. The voters at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECar_accident_3538.html" title="Talk:Car accident">Talk:Car accident</a> clearly think "car accident" is an accurate term whereas, in fact, it is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversation.html" title="Conversation">conversational</a> English and politically correct.

<dd>I think the voting, and the scepticism, reflects the fact that (despite your assertions) there is no universally accepted "proper name" for car accidents. "Vehicular collision" is actually fairly rarely used. There is definitely a movement to prefer "collision" over "accident" in professional circles, although I would not say it is a strong majority. Some even use the word "incident" instead (e.g. the California Highway Patrol). It's more common to use "automobile collision", "auto collision", or "traffic collision" than "vehicular collision", I find. And there are plenty of professional organisations and institutions using "automobile accident" or "traffic accident".</dd>

<dd>This isn't "spitting on your proposal" nor the ignorance you so quickly ascribe to those who disagree with you. Frankly, were you willing to engage those who disagree in a friendlier and more equal fashion, your suggestions might be a bit more warmly received.

<dd>There are many esoteric topics on Wikipedia which return less than a single result on Google. See <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html#Wikipediosophy" title="User:Adraeus">User:Adraeus#Wikipediosophy</a> for my thoughts on esoteric subjects. <i>Vehicular collision</i>, or to appeal to popularity <i>automobile collision</i>, encompasses a wider range of content than the simple conversational <i>car accident</i>. In addition, the argument that because <i>car accident</i> is a popular phrase is conclusive evidence that the article on <i>automobile collisions</i> should remain under its wing is fallacious because of the simple fact that <i>REDIRECTS</i> exist. If someone searches for "car accident", the page they'll ultimately visit is automobile collision or <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicular_collision.html" title="Vehicular collision">vehicular collision</a>, so on Wikipedia whether the main article's name is popular is irrelevant. What matters, however, is that Wikipedia articles use precise terminology in article names since article <i>names</i> do heavily influence the article's content and how the reader cognitively <i>categorizes</i> the article. The argument for popular phrases as article names is impractical, and in practice, is not held up in other areas of Wikipedia, such as in biographies. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:55, May 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I said on the talk page of that article, I suggest that you create the <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicular_collision.html" title="Vehicular collision">vehicular collision</a> as the article you are after, having it as a broader view of the topic. You can then have <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_accident.html" title="Car accident">car accident</a> as a subtopic ("<a href="../../../t/e/m/Template.html" title="Template">main|main template</a>", if you will). <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. The above-mentioned image lacks a copyright tag. Even though the original work of art is presumably in the public domain due to age, the bidimensional reproduction may very well not be. Please provide a source and tag for the image, or it may be deleted by a sysop.</p>
<p>I notice you're in the habit of answering messages by writing in your own talk page. Please note it is a discouraged practice, as the original poster does not receive notice that his comments have been answered unless he's written to at his or her own talk page.</p>

<li>Answering messages to me on my talk page, I think, is far better form than your so-called "encouraged practice" of separating a discussion into two parts. Such a separation increases in absurdity when there exists more than two parties to a discussion. The message sender, if concerned for the status of his/her message, may "watch this page" for reponses. I will continue to answer messages written to me on my talk page regardless of what form is considered the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 14:14, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>First, thank you for your contributions to the discussion in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_names_and_surnames_1623.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/names and surnames">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/names and surnames</a>. I'm glad I'm not alone in seeing the encyclopedic value of names (and it annoys the hell out of me when people call it genealogy, when there's none of that on the pages up for deletion!) However, it occurs to me that I've opened a discussion without knowing the proper procedure for closing it. On top of that, I'm going to be camping in the woods for the next week (ergo no internet access from the 23rd to the 27th) and will be busy packing between now and then. Could you take over the discussion page, and see that it gets wrapped up appropriately? --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 20:28, 2005 May 20 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adraeus, I too do not support edit wars, even though, like many editors, I have been involved in a few. But I hope you will consider two things. (1) there is a difference between an edit war over substantive content (e.g., what is the definition of fascism; did Jesus exist) — these edit wars express passionate feelings by editors deeply committed to a given article, and if the conflict cannot be resolve don the talk page (although often it is), mediation is possible. However, I do not think that what is going on in the Persian-related articles falls under this category. Jguk, RickK, and Violetriga have made no substantive additions to these articles. They have not expressed a strong interest in Persian topics per se, let alone any expertise. They are not passionately committed to the top, the article, they are simply reacting against people who <i>are</i> passionately interested in the articles <i>and</i> have already demonstrated considerable expertise, and who use BCE/CE. (2) It is well-established that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia first and foremost, and a relatively anarchic wiki-community second (for many, though not me, a distant second). What I am doing is motivated by my committment to this project of writing a high-quality encyclopedia, which among other things entails respect and when appropriate deference to editors who know what they are writing about. This has nothing to do with my proposal, I hope you understand. I consider the question of how NPOV BCE/CE is to be open, but also recognize that a slim but nevertheless significant majority of involved editors reject my position about BCE/CE and NPOV. <i>This <b>does not</b> mean that BCE and CE are no longer allowed at Wikipedia.</i> As has <i>always</i> been the case, they should be used when a majority if not consensus of the active editors working on an article feel it is appropriate. This is certainly the case concerning the articles I am following (on Jewish or Persian topics). The people who seem to know the most about, and who have worked the most on, Jewish and Persian topics have a clear and reasonable — and strong — preference for BCE and CE. For people who have previously made no contributions to these articles, and who now change BCE/CE to BC/AD <i>against the consensus of people working on those articles</i> is at best senseless and goes against Wikipedia traditions. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:04, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS I know that you are being even-handed and expressing the same views and assessments with Violetriga and RickK. I am not questioning your own sense of fairness, just doing you the courtesy of explaining my motives. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:07, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
