<dd>Dear reader, we must first distinguish VENETS from VENETIANS. The Venets are ancient central European pre Slovans and the Venetians were citizens of republic of VENICE (Italy). It is a significant difference in between. The word VENETI derives from a noun “SLOVENCI” The Greek translation was “ENETOI” because in Greek it’s not common at all to have the letter group “SLOV” as much as letter group “CI” The letter group “TOI” is pronounced “TI” which is similar to “CI”. Rather the same is with Latin. So the Latin version of “SLOVENCI” was “VENETI”. The Venetian findings are all over the central Europe. The most remaining are names of rivers, mountains, volleys… The Slovenian grammar has duality. The most known language with duality is “SANSCRIT” It is more than sure that this two languages are related. Sanscrit is more than 5.000 years old. The earliest finding of written “VENETIAN” – “SLOVENSKI” language are from 100 BC. Now days only words written in bronze, wood or stone were preserved. The most famous found slogan is: “OSTI JAR” which mean “stay jung“ and the grammatical tables with the word cry “JEKATI”. It is really more than exciting all this.&lt; by user:195.210.245.211&gt;</dd>

<p>I also added "see also" for <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venedes.html" title="Venedes">Venedes</a> article, which seems to address the same issue. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:35, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The anon text is, I think, referring to the theory that the Veneti were a Slavic people related to the Slovenes (now mainly in Slovenia). The <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_grammatical_number.html" title="Dual grammatical number">dual grammatical number</a> alledgedly used by the Veneti is indeed also fully employed in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenian_grammar.html" title="Slovenian grammar">Slovenian grammar</a>. The theory is more fully described in the <a href="http://www.thezaurus.com/sloveniana/veneti_ancestors.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thezaurus.com/sloveniana/veneti_ancestors.htm" rel="nofollow">website for the Institute for Slovenian Studies of Victoria, Australia</a>, but I cannot otherwise vouch for its academic respectability. A readable description of the theory would probably not be completely out of place in this section. However, I can imagine it might come with some nationalistic political baggage. The "see also" link for <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venedes.html" title="Venedes">Venedes</a> mentioned by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> above would seem to be appropriate, however I note that it has already been removed. ralphb 129.129.152.74 16:19, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEuganeo_bb38.html" title="User:Euganeo">Euganeo</a> 05:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC) <b>NOTE:</b> Please read my post as carefully as possible as I have made every attempt to reference all my material and to provide any relevant links within Wikipedia.

<p>The theory put forth by user:195.210.245.211 is a complete mess. It is good to see that moderators are cleaning up these politically charged <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistorical.html" title="Pseudohistorical">pseudohistorical</a> entries on Wiki. As for the so-called "Institute for Slovenian Studies of Victoria" it is really just another site that links to a pro-Slovenian nationalistic group involved in the publication of a number of books purporting the strange (and heavily flawed) theory of the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> being ancient <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavs.html" title="Slavs">Slavs</a> of some sort. It is disregarded by the academic community. Anyone wanting a genuine assessment of current theories on the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venetic.html" title="Venetic">Venetic</a> language and people can read an article by Rex Wallace from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst_5351.html" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> which was published in the 2004 book: Roger D. Woodard (ed.), Encyclopedia of the World’s Ancient Languages, pp. 840–856. It is the official (and most recent) publication accepted by established academia on ancient languages and was produced by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>.</p>
<p>The word <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> comes from the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word <b>Enetoi</b> which is present in a number of texts by ancient authors including <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabo.html" title="Strabo">Strabo</a>. Indeed the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Greek_1ff0.html" title="Modern Greek">Modern Greek</a> language pronounced ]<b>OI</b> (or <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega.html" title="Omega">omega</a> and <a href="../../../i/o/t/Iota.html" title="Iota">iota</a>) as an <b>I</b> but not in all cases with <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, however that is another matter. The <b>Enetoi</b> were a tribe of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paphlagonians.html" title="Paphlagonians">Paphlagonians</a> who, according to legend (and the ancient texts), left after the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_War_017a.html" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> to settle in North-eastern <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> in the modern <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneto.html" title="Veneto">Veneto</a> region. <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophon.html" title="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> in his text <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabasis_%28Xenophon%29_692f.html" title="Anabasis (Xenophon)">Anabasis (Xenophon)</a> (known as Anabasis III in the <a href="../../../l/o/e/Loeb_Classical_Library_2d96.html" title="Loeb Classical Library">Loeb Classical Library</a> edition) also makes reference to the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paphlagonians.html" title="Paphlagonians">Paphlagonians</a> from <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_grammatical_number.html" title="Dual grammatical number">dual grammatical number</a> allegedly used by the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a>, it was also used by the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greeks_2c00.html" title="Ancient Greeks">Ancient Greeks</a> from whom the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> absorbed a reasonable amount of culture and lexiconographic influence.

<p>It is of utmost importance that a resource such as the Wikipedia maintains reasonable standards in what sort of content is published. The internet has unfortunately become a haven for pseudohistorians who attempt to subvert public opinion. It is good to see moderators ensuring this.</p>

Sincere apologies but that list has been deleted because it was the point of a political debate in which a number of right-wing debators attempted to expound <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistorical.html" title="Pseudohistorical">pseudohistorical</a> theories upon this particular topic, the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a>. You will notice in the history of the discussions on <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> that there is much abiguity and many of the poorly constructed arguments come from those attempting to identify the Ancient <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> with Slavs. You will also notice that the list posted here, towards the end, became increasingly Slavicentric, to the point that the final points were written in <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic.html" title="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a>! Many of the references and poor English spelling are due to the fact that it was largely lifted from pro-nationalist Slovenian websites in no way affiliated with academia. This same list was posted on the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneti.html" title="Veneti">Veneti</a> page in the form of vandalism, but was immediately deleted. Please be careful of the sorts of unaccredited and <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistorical.html" title="Pseudohistorical">pseudohistorical</a> writings that pop up on this topic. We do not want another disaster as we have had in the past with strange, politically motivated people posting bizarre theories with clearly immoral appropriation of the ethnic archaic identities of other cultures. As noted earlier, the Wikipedia is for the discussion and transmission of information of academic integrity that is accepted by the mainstream and concurred upon by the academia. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEuganeo_bb38.html" title="User:Euganeo">Euganeo</a> 05:46, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can't help it, got to nitpick here. As far as I know, the whole Veneti ancestry debate is restricted to Slovene nationalist discourse. So it seems odd that you would mention Cyrillic script here, since Slovenes don't use it, nor did they ever. Most Slovenes nowadays can't even read Cyrillic (having only been exposed to its Serbian variant during the time of Yugoslavia - a time during which any Slovene that wasn't a politician, journalist or bussinesman could do full well without it), let alone formulate their opinions in it. What's more, Slovene nationalists positively resent it. So it would seem that if Cyrillic was used in the article or on the talk page, that it was probably meaningless, non-related vandalism.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, as a Slovene and a linguist, I feel insulted by the petty and pretentios crap these nationalists spew. A place in France is pronounced the same as it would be if it were Slovene? Well, golly, that's gotta mean them French are really just undercover Slovenes! Heck, I bet if we searched hard enough we could find similar examples for, say, Chinese or Cherokee, proving once and for all that all of the human race is in fact of Slovene descent. Yep, yep.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, I think the article could probably do with a short but well limited mention of the Venetian theory. The whole ordeal is certainly note-worthy enoguh, IMO. Maybe a line in the Notes section? 213.172.234.159 02:36, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello there, yes indeed I do agree with you on the pretentiousness of nationalism. In-fact, I have a number of Slovenian colleagues who detest the uneducated ultranationalism of some Slovenians (and other Slavic groups).</dd>
<dd>As for the Cyrillic, I am aware that Slovenians do no utilise this script, however if you read my comments you will notice that I was merely pointing out the Slavicentricism of the vandalism which was posted on this original page. This did in-fact include a number of paragraphs written entirely in a Cyrillic script (regardless of whether the authors where Slovenian or not). I am also aware (and have discussed with Slovenian academics who do not agree with pseudo-historical or ultranationalist versions of Slovenian history) that many of the proponents of Slavicentric propaganda on the Wikipedia are from other Slavic minority groups (which would account for the fact that large portions of the original vandalism being written in a Cyrillic text, most probably Serbian or Macedonian.</dd>
<dd>In this case it is most probably Macedonian fascist literature, as they have also attempted to cross-pollinate pseudo-historical conjecture with Macedonian nationalism (in essence mixing Slovenian and Macedonian nationalism under the banner of pan-Slavonic propaganda-infused reworkings of history). They have attempted to assert that Alexander the Great spoke ancient Venetic and that somehow the histories of the Veneti and the (Hellenic) Macedonians are all intertwined with proto-Slavic pseudo-history to convey right-wing ideological Slavonic bias with regards to the history of the Veneti and the people of the ancient region of Macedonia.</dd>
<dd>It upsetting to know that some Slovenians pander to this kind of biased politicisation of history - but it is always good to see someone such as yourself, who has enough education and understanding to see through the propaganda and question his fellows.</dd>
<dd>As for Venetian history, this has been relegated to another section of the Wikipedia, as this particular page deals only with the specific history of the Ancient Veneti, which is categorised with the pre-Roman and Italic branches of Classical Archaeology. Venetian history on the otherhand is part of Medieval History. Same location and people, only a different time frame.</dd>
