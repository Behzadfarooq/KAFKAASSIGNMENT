<p>Hi - I think you could probably be more helpful in conversation if you were more conservative about the use of the word "vandalism." Good faith edits are <i>never</i> vandalism, and calling them vandalism just makes further discussion harder. As for the templates, Netoholic is right here - meta templates are harmful, and the developers have asked us to not use them if we can avoid it. I'm inclined to think that listening to the developers on this one is more important than some small issues in how the template appears, but if it's really a problem, you should probably work up a version of the template that looks how you want without the use of meta-templates. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 06:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Netoholic's dislike of meta-templates is based largely on the established rule that we avoid using them. In this regard, then, all of Wikipedia has malice towards them. As for vandalism, please note that the term has a specific meaning on Wikipedia, described at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>, and Netoholic's actions are definitely not that. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:46, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your history and arbitration case makes painfully clear that the only words you consider are your own. The style that existed prior to your devious edition was <i>designed</i> by several of the template's editors and myself. The fact that your trollish reversions hid your style changes under the guise of policy conformity is indicative of the fact that you were performing editions contrary to good faith policy. The <i>only</i> support you have is for the policy conformance editions you committed. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 06:20, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for letting me know... But I don't know what exactly you're referring to. If you are referring to my reversion of your reversion of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Company_547d.html" title="Template:Infobox Company">Template:Infobox Company</a>, well then you clearly didn't understand the fact you had created a few thousand messed up pages by performing your reversion: I was not adhering to the POV of any known troll, I was trying to have the articles on the encyclopedia at least <i>appear</i> clean while not understanding the issue at hand. Further, I don't understand your ability to generalise a single instance of what I had attempted to make in good faith for the sake of the encyclopaedia (and not the specifics of the implementations of a template or the actions of Netoholic) to your comment above.

<dd>Any user careless enough to ignore edit summaries, Talk page discussions, and calls for assistance on administration pages isn't qualified to serve as an administrator of Wikipedia. Your actions, regardless of your excuses, were inappropriate for a would-be administrator. A competent administrator would have a) identified and clarified the situation, and b) devised solutions to resolve any issues observed. You simply acted without concern. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Company&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=7702882" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Company&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=7702882" rel="nofollow">By the way...</a> the Template exists right now because a) I created the Template, b) I designed the Template, c) I promoted the Template, and d) I helped manage the Template in order to ensure the best decisions were made. Moreover, any reversion I made that "broke" the Template was to a previous revision that was likely broken by another user. Now instead of blaming me for breaking the template, a competent administrator would have researched the situation and never produced such radically uninformed assumptions. Since it's obvious you will attain adminship, I certainly hope you can do better with more responsibility; however, my opposition remains. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 06:36, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry about the late reply. I don't mind who made the template; I don't mind who broke the template. I don't blame you for breaking it in any way, except that your action of reversion, right or wrong, broke articles. Had I been an admin at the time, I could have restored appropriate templates; not having been, all I could do was fix a thousand broken articles in a <i>temporary</i> but necessary manner by undoing your reversion. I did not want to get embroiled in the situation, but merely wanted the articles to look correct until you had sorted the issue fully. You wrote: <i>If you and Netoholic are unable to fix the template without messing with the style, then don't try to "fix" the template.</i> By putting myself with Netaholic against you, you imagined that I was trying to "fix the template" and "mess the style". Rather, I was trying to avoid a broken encyclopedia. Are you not able to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> instead of ranting against me as an assistant to known trolls? <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:37, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the risk of appearing ignorant, I really don't understand what was 'unpleasant' about your encounter with the list of songs without the title of the song in the lyrics. As near as I can tell, all that happened was you saw it, didn't like that it was there, said so on the talk page and received a polite response. In what way is this unfortunate? I could understand if it had led to arguments and so forth, but as far as I can tell (of course, this could have happened without me noticing) that didn't happen. Personally, I think the list should stay, but I respect your opinions and your right to express them. Anyway, thanks for your time and I hope for a response.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <a href="../../../w/i/l/Image%7EWilliam_Wallace.jpg_574c.html" title="Image:William Wallace.jpg">Image:William Wallace.jpg</a>. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a> is very careful about the images included in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> because of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_law.html" title="Copyright law">copyright law</a>. We need you to specify two things on the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Image%7EWilliam_Wallace.jpg_574c.html" title="Image:William Wallace.jpg">image description page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The copyright holder, and</li>
<li>The copyright status</li>
</ul>
<p>The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If <i>you</i> created this image, then you are the copyright holder.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image copyright tags</a>. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.</p>
<p>There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a> licence</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Use_83e7.html" title="Fair Use">Fair Use</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The copyright holder gets the best protection of their work by licencing it under an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a> license such as the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> licence. If you have the <b>express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence</b>, use the image copyright tag: {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}}. The <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> is another option. Again, if you have the <b>express permission</b> of the copyright holder, use the tag {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The copyright holder can also release their work into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Public_domain_dedications" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for examples.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Images from certain sources are automatically released into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located. (See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#USA_public_domain_images" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for images from the government of the USA and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Other_countries.27_public_domain_images" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for other governments.) However, not all governments release their work into the public domain. One exception is the UK (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#UK_government_copyrights" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. To see a) if this image qualifies, and b) if so, how to tag it, see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. Please remember that untagged images are likely to be deleted.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them. Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">wknight94</a> 20:54, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../c/l/a/Image%7EClan_Ramsay_%28Tartans%29.png_46b5.html" title="Image:Clan Ramsay (Tartans).png">Image:Clan Ramsay (Tartans).png</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adraeus_Archive006_df40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adraeus/Archive006">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.

<p>Hi Adraeus. Can you please try and be more constructive at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Company_70a3.html#Confusing" title="Template talk:Infobox Company">Template:Infobox Company</a>. So far your contributions seem to be to revert every edit that makes even a slight change, whilst simultaneously refusing to engage in any serious discussion about something that is clearly an issue for some people (except to call their claims 'ridiculous'). Please try and be more civil and engage in the conversation in a more mature manner, so that a workable solution can be found.
