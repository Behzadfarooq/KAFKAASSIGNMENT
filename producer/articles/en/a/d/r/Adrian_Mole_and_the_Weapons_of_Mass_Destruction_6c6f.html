<p>The story also deals with an issue that has affected Sue Townsend directly: a long-term <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabetic.html" title="Diabetic">diabetic</a>, she was registered blind in 2001. <i><b>Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction</b></i> was typed by Townsend's husband from dictation.</p>
<p>The novel is a bestseller due to the series' dedicated fan base, and has met with critical acclaim. Critics have praised the novel for its fine combination of sitcom-style humour with an underlying element of tragedy and pathos. Some consider it less comical and darker than the previous installment, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Adrian_Mole%7E_The_Cappuccino_Years_25ed.html" title="Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years">Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years</a>. It has been suggested that the character of Adrian Mole is becoming stale as he approaches middle age. Critics claim that his immature and angst-ridden personality has lost its appeal as he approaches middle-age, where it was endearing in a younger man.</p>
<p>The character of Adrian Mole arguably matures as this novel progresses. He seems to become more realistic about his life and concentrates on his present problems, rather than half-realised aspirations of fame and literary success. Sue Townsend has confirmed that this is the last installment of the Adrian Mole series. The book thus concludes the Adrian Mole universe.</p>
<p>Adrian Mole works in a book shop and he likes his job. His son Glen entered the army and was sent at his eighteen birhtday to Iraq. William lives now with his mother in Nigeria, Adrian somteimes called William, both miss each other. At the beginning of the book, Adrian had an affair with Marigold,but their realtionship was only based on sexual feelings. Later Adrain felt in love with Marigolds elder sister Daisy,they love each other and at the end of the book they were married and had a daughter. Their realtionship wasn´t always quite good, because they quarrel often about their political opinions. There is no doubt that Adrian is still in love with his first love Pandora, but the faith had now future for them. Pandora write an autobiographie about her life and Adrian had to arrange a autogram hour for her in his book shop. There Daisy and Pandora met for the first time.</p>

He often snaps at Adrian and is rude and contemptuous to him, despite Adrian's attempts to involve him in his writer's workshop and cheer him up. He is awarded a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guide_dog.html" title="Guide dog">guide dog</a> due to his condition.</p>
