<p>This is a tough one to translate; I could use some help. Here are the known open issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Ideea politică a Schimbării" - This goes beyond my ability to deal with a highly inflected language. "The idea of political change"? "Changing the idea of politics?" I can't tell.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The political idea of change".
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>OK - JM</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Reglementari" in International Law. I assume "reglementari" here means "settlements" as in "settling out of court." If that's right, we still need to come up with the right English-language word, because "Settlements in International Law" sounds like it would have to do with something like Israeli settlements on the West Bank.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>reglementare = regulation, so it's "Regulations in International Law"
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>OK - JM</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Adunării Internaţionale a Parlamentarilor de limbă franceză". I believe I'm pretty much on the mark with "International Assembly of Francophone Parliamentarians" but I'm sure it has an official French-language name and a semi-official one in English.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"International Assembly of the Francophone Members of Parliament"
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Members of Parliament" is the same as "Parliamentarians". I looked around the web a little and sites seem about 50-50 on "...Francophone Parliamentarians" and "...Francophone MPs", so I stuck with what I had. - JM</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Raportor al Comisiei parlamentare pentru probleme juridice şi drepturile omului în problema activităţii ilegale desfăşurate de sectele religioase" - Is the "Raportor" of a commission the Secretary? Or something else?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"A raporta" means "To make a report", so it should be "reporter", someone that reports facts.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I"ve gone with "Recording Secretary". - JM</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Also, does "desfăşurate" refer to activities in general or specifically to proselytizing? Or specifically to something else entirely? And this could really use a context. What was going on that there would be such a commission?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>desfasurate = (most likely) "that took place"

<li>so the tranlation I gave is on the mark. This could still really use a context. What was going on that there would be such a commission? -JM</li>

<dd>(<i>Copied from Ref. Desk</i>:) "The only commission about sects which I can link Adrian Nastase to seems to be a European Parliament one (rather than, say, a Romanian one).

<dd>(continuing previous bullet point) "Biroului Permanent" is obviously not "Standing Committee" if there is only one of them.

<p>Given that "Raportor al Comisiei parlamentare..." for one item (the cult thing) turned out to be Council of Europe, not Romanian parliament, is it possible that some of the following are also Council of Europe?</p>

<p>Should we add {{wrongtitle|title=Adrian Năstase}}?

<dd>All Romanian names are usually written without diacritics in English-speaking world, but that doesn't mean that is the correct way. The same way it is rather common to write "Francois Mitterrand" instead of "François Mitterrand". However, Romanian diacriticals are even less used because unlike the French diacritical characters, the Romanian ones cannot be found in ASCII. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 17:53, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The tone in which the section "Allegations of homosexuality" is written seems to me to give undue credence to the allegations. Corneliu Vadim Tudor claiming he has evidence of something but hasn't actually shown it does not strike me as a reason to believe it: he is not exactly famous for his honesty or his ethics. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:20, Dec 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A text is currently circulating on the Internet, allegedly a statement made to the Miliţie (Police) by a writer and history professor. In it, professor Suciu testifies his own homosexuality and names other <i>alleged</i> homosexuals, Năstase among them. I've added a mention to it in the article, with the appropriate remark.</p>

Scriitorilor Români, domiciliat in Bucuresti, Str. Pompiliu Manoliu, nr. 13, sect. 3, declar urmatoarele: in anul 1973, luna februarie, am fost arestat, iar in luna iunie am fost condamnat pentru inversiune sexuala la 2 ani si 4 luni, eliberindu-ma pe data de 9 ianuarie 1975. In prezent, fac formele pentru pensionare medicala, fiind bolnav de diabet zaharat, epidimita, TBC si inceput de boala lui Parkinson. In limita sanatatii si posibilitatii am de gind - de comun acord cu conducerea Institutului - sa-mi public cele 3 carti ce trebuiau sa apara in 1973-1974 si sa-mi continui activitatea stiintifica prin colaborari la revistele de specialitate, cu studii, recenzii si articole istorice. Fiind intrebat despre relatiile mele anterioare, si anume: Radu Ionescu, Adrian Nastase, Negoitescu, Sorin Titel, Ion Dinescu, Alexandru Demetriad, precizez ca stiu despre ei ca sint pederasti, cu exceptia lui Sorin Titel, despre care nu am auzit niciodata ca ar practica aceasta boala.

<p>Nu il simpatizez pe Adrian Nastase dar articolul asta este scris ca si cum ar fi bagat la puscarie. Si apoi chestia cu homosexualitatea nu e in regula: 1. daca este, este problema lui si 2. felul cum este formulat textul lasa impresia ca homosexualitatea ar fi o chestie inspaimantatoare, ceea ce pentru un cititor de prin alte parti ridica niste semne de intrebare</p>
<p><br />
I'm sorry, but I still find the section regarding homosexuality to be incredibly offensive. While Nastase clearly has many faults, so what if he's gay or bisexual? And quite honestly, if he were open about it he could never be elected to office in modern-day Romania. The bombonel comment is akin to using the word faggot or fairy in English.</p>
<p>I don't buy the argument that there is a controversy here in that Nastase attacked Basescu on the issue of gay rights and marriage. Basescu himself retreated on his comments made on MTV in support of gay marriage, and one year after DA led government there are still no plans for domestic partnership. I imagine there will be a lot of additions to this article in coming days following the indictment on the Zambachian property. As these things are added, I urge that the homosexuality section be deleted. Or if others agree, I will remove this myself. MisterMan 22:00, 07 Feb 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's as if there is an effort to drop everything that shows him in a human light or displays his actual involvement in parliamentary politics in any respect other than just the fact that he rose to the top of his party. Especially, if we are going to take a (well-deserved) shot at his writings on human rights in the Communist era, we should show his generally positive post-'89 involvement in this area. I'm not a fan, but we should be evenhanded.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to restore all of this material in one or another form, unless someone can give a good argument in the next 24 hours why it should <i>not</i> be restored. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:29, Dec 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you really think that it is neutral to talk in 30% of the article about corruption allegations and make the contest look like they are actualy 50%?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. For example, look at <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvio_Berlusconi_f762.html" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>, it has more than 50% about his shady deals, trials, allegations, etc. When there is a controversy, we use the NPOV and have to give every side an oppinion. If you want to improve anything on his activity which is not well-covered, you may.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, so you are saying that because there is an article were allegations are 50% of the article it is legitimate do so here too? I think I don't follow your logic. You know, there are articles that talk 70% about academic achivements of some person. Should we de the same here? I don't thing so. Maybe it helps if I rephrase the question. I think that an article about a person should accurately reflect one's personality. Do you think that corruption is such an important trait of AN? If so, then why? ("There are lots of allegations", doesn't qualify as an answer; I would prefer facts: see below.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For one thing they are "allegations", not facts; and I think wikipedia should _concentrate_ on facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How can you distinguish between a fact and an allegation&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Simple, use a dictionary. Let's see what MW has to say. Alleging = "to assert without proof or before proving". Allegation = "an assertion unsupported and by implication regarded as unsupportable". Fact = "an actual occurrence; a thing done". If the difference is still not clear I'll be glad to explain.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "Allegations" part is only based on facts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is the negation of a tautology. See the definitions again.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And on the other hand some of them seem to mentioned just because they are "fun". For example the homosexuality allegation reads like: "Ever since 1990 there are rumors that he is homosexual... But those were started by a guy not to be trusted".</p>
<dl>
<dd>A rumour can be true or not true. However, these allegations are pretty well-known in Romania and deserve mentioning.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One simple thing to do would be to remove the headlines under "Allegations...". A second-level headline for a three lines paragraph surely looks excesive to anyone neutral (say, someone who knows nothing about AN before reading the article): and this happens not once but several times in a raw.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Headlines are used when we are talking about a different subject and here they are used according to the Manual of Style of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A text has a hierarchical structure (phrases, paragraphs, subsections, sections...) What you say is roughly valid at each level (just replace "subject" by "idea"). That doesn't mean that it is sane to start a new paragraph after each phrase, put a sub-heading before each paragraph or put a heading before each sub-heading. It is just bad style. Oh, and about the Manual of Style, here is a quote: "Avoid overuse of sub-headings". If this article doesn't overuse them I don't know what does.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You should note that, in contrast, articles about other romanian politicians (most notably Traian Basescu) contain _no_ information about corruption allegation... although they do exist. -- <a href="../../../r/g/r/User%7ERgrig_634b.html" title="User:Rgrig">rgrig</a></p>

<p>And something else. The only important thing said about the prime-minister period is that economy has grown. I do not find this to be particularily informative since it implies a correlation (between him being prime-minister and economy evolution) that is not supported in any way. Much better would be to give a list of actual things he done (i.e. law A, law B, etc..) and, if deemed important, things he hadn't done.</p>

<dl>
<dd>"the number of Romanians that live below the poverty line dropped by an estimated 4 million"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whose numbers? If this is something authoritative, it certainly merits mention, that would be about 17% of the population. There was no citation, so I was wondering if this might be pulled out of thin air. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:30, Dec 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The numbers are probably not far off. Poverty is generally in rural areas, especially of Moldova, Oltenia and Baragan. The difference is that after the visa changes it was much easier to get to work in the EU, so many of the poor people left to work in the EU (working at some low wages for the EU standard, but high on the Romanian standard) and brought money in the country. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>So do you think we should put it back in the article? If the number in poverty has gone down, it really would be quite an achievement, because <a href="http://www.polito.ubbcluj.ro/EAST/East8/dan5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.polito.ubbcluj.ro/EAST/East8/dan5.htm" rel="nofollow">this article from Ioana Dan, an economist at Babeş-Bolyai University</a> shows the number below the poverty line consistently <i>increasing</i> from 1989 to 1999. It could be, because the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20125485~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258599,00.html" class="external text" title="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20125485~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258599,00.html" rel="nofollow">World Bank shows</a> 28.9% below the poverty line in 2002, the latest I can readily find. If that is comparable to Ioana Dan's 41.20 in 1999, it's quite a drop. And it probably is, since she cites the World Bank.

It is <i>so</i> much harder to identify and add them later. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:33, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On poverty in Romania as this is disputed. I will only point out the two very different means used to assert poverty in Romania. The first of them, used by the National Institute for Statistics, was introduced in 2001? and consider the poverty line about half the minimum monthly wage / person (they use a more complicated formula). As minimum wage is considered 2.800.000 lei (96$), the poverty line considered by using this system is 1.400.000 lei/month or 48$. The second system uses what we refer to as "Cosul Minim de Consum Lunar", that is the minimum requirements for decent living per month (it is considered underestimated anyway, both in terms of products and services), that is set to around 3.000.000 lei/person/month (I have no up-to-date info. on this - I may be rong). This usually result in very big differences between the results. A fellow student has made a poverty assessment for Romania using US and EU-member-country standards, and the results where staggering (if we would use Norwegian standards we would skyrocket to 75%). For poverty in Romania, consider the minimum wage is 2.800.000 lei, average wage is 7.800.000 lei before taxes and about 6.000.000 after taxes, a US$ is 29.000 lei, a kilo of meat 180.000 lei (a kilo is about 2 pounds for those who still use Imperial measurement systems), a kilo of potatoes 15.000 lei and my electricity bill was for November 600.000 lei. Thank you, yours truly, xanthar also known as 195.7.0.159 (I forgot to login). I am not shure how the World Bank calculates poverty levels.

<dd>I'd tend to want to use the World Bank numbers on this when possible because they are comparable across countries; any official national numbers are also useful. In either case, though, citation is important, because these are such easy things for someone to make up out of thin air. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:35, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've erased "surpassing the number allowed by Romanian law." While the carnage was immoral in many respects, it took place on a private domain, owned and maintained by Ion Ţiriac. Private hunting domains do not fall under official regulations. It was immoral, but not illegal.</p>
<p>I also added the facts about Ion Ţiriac because I think it broadens the perspective. Năstase is not alone in what he does...</p>

In any case, we cannot start by mentioning only one highway and then at the end of the paragraph refer to "both highways".
