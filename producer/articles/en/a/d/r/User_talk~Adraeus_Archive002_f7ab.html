<p>Please check your facts before editing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> - the company is traded on the NASDAQ exchange, not the NYSE. I'm only mentioning this because it's the second time I've reverted this change recently. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:54, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I never claimed Microsoft traded on the NYSE. The problem is that NASDAQ provides less reliable information than NYSE due to various influences inherent to the structure of NASDAQ. Also see: <a href="http://www.msb.edu/faculty/pdf/Optimal_Listing.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.msb.edu/faculty/pdf/Optimal_Listing.pdf" rel="nofollow">Optimal Listing Policy: Why Microsoft and Intel Do Not List on the NYSE (PDF)</a></dd>

<dd>When you write "NYSE: MSFT" in an article, that means MSFT stock trades on the NYSE. This is pretty much the standard way of saying what exchange a stock is listed on, used on many investing sites and in other Wikipedia articles. To be honest I don't really understand your other concerns - are you saying the data on NASDAQ's web site is less accurate than the data on NYSE's web site? Where did you hear that? Even if this is so, it does not justify writing articles that inaccurately state that a stock trades on the NYSE. If the NASDAQ data is truly inaccurate, let's solve that problem instead of introducing other problems. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:28, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We should not erroneously claim that Microsoft trades on the NYSE. Yes, writing "NYSE: MSFT" is an automatic declaration that MSFT trades on the NYSE. That is how every reader will interpret it. Read any article in any investing publication (Forbes for example). After the name of a company, they say the exchange it trades on in parentheses: e.g. "Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research upgraded Lockheed Martin (nyse: LMT - news - people ) to "hold" from "sell" and raised the target price." <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/markets/2005/04/01/0401automarketscan11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forbes.com/home/markets/2005/04/01/0401automarketscan11.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They wouldn't say "nasdaq: LMT" or "amex: LMT", because Lockheed Martin trades on the NYSE. We should adhere to this standard. Please give me another case where my logic fails. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:53, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On review, it appears to be a policy problem. Too many strong POV's, and no effective method of determining the truth other than endless debate and revert wars of attrition. I agree w dab mainly, I don't think weak atheists are atheists, and atheism isn't a natural state, but thats just <i>my</i> opinion. As far as what needs done, I think you making a modest amount of noise (like w a RfC) is a good idea. Don't push too hard, or something might break. The answer is a long needed policy change to assist w POV differences, an answer other than democracy (most people are usually wrong&#160;;) I'll keep looking into things.

<dd>At first, I was wondering why you posted this, but after reading <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk:atheism</a> I understood. Refactoring is interesting because it is extremely similar to my ideas about verbal concision in composition. Unfortunately, the same principles of clarity aren't promoted by Wikipedia to editors for effecting its articles. Regardless, nothing useful lost; although, I think Mel Etitis' ad hominem comments are completely out-of-line and his usership should be... refactored...

<p>Isn't there some policy on discounting votes cast before a complete rewrite? The Pandeism article was rewritten as of 13:28, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC). By my count, there have been 7 votes to Delete and 9 votes to Keep since then (including votes cast before that date and later reaffirmed). Holistically, there have been 19 votes to Delete (12 cast before the rewrite) and 11 to Keep (2 cast before the rewrite).

<p>Adraeus, your praise honors me and humbles me. And I truly appreciate it. Alas, the fact that the vote currently favors those opposed, and the lengthy comments critical of my proposal, are proof that I have not offered effective arguments, for which I am truly sorry. One of the things that drew me to Wikipedia is its NPOV policy, and the possibility that I do not really understand it, or that so many other active editors do not understand it, drives me to despair. If you think you can offer any cogent responses to any of those who are critical of the proposal, please do so. Perhaps you can succeed where I have failed ... <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:31, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I just noticed your entry on Clan Ramsay listed on the Cleanup Taskforce page. Don't you think it would be better to merge the page on Clan Ramsay into the page on Ramsay? I think this would be especially beneficial seeing that the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay.html" title="Ramsay">Ramsay</a> page already contains a section for the Scottish history of the family. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">Ganymead</a> 04:15, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_clan.html" title="Scottish clan">Scottish clan</a> for a list of Scottish clans. Each clan uses the [[Clan name]] format. I don't care either way, but if <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Ramsay_068a.html" title="Clan Ramsay">Clan Ramsay</a> is merged to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay.html" title="Ramsay">Ramsay</a>, then the other clan pages should merge with their counterpart name pages accordingly. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a></dd>

<p>Hi. You said on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_BCE-CE_Debate_bb4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/BCE-CE Debate">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/BCE-CE Debate</a> that you think some of the users voting "oppose" are sockpuppets. You should tell one of the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/developer" class="extiw" title="m:developer">developers</a> on <a href="../../../i/r/c/Wikipedia%7EIRC_channels_a457.html" title="Wikipedia:IRC channels">the #mediawiki IRC channel</a>, and they may be able to do a sockpuppet check for you. Remember to ask them to check possible sockpuppets on both lists, since I recognise more users voting "oppose" than "support". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 04:40, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recognize everyone voting "support". Aside from <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>, I recognize no other user voting "oppose". Thanks for the information. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 04:45, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I recognise the following users voting oppose: violet/riga (from a past dispute), RickK, James F. (arb com), David Gerard (arb com), Evil Monkey (from IRC), Delirium (long time user), Angela (long time user, elected to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees) and Geogre (from IRC). Those voting in favour I recognise are SlimVirgin, Eloquence, BrokenSegue (I think) and Neutrality. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 05:10, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
