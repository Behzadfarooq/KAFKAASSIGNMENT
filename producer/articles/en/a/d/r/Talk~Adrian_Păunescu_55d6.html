<p>"His wife killed 4 people in a car accident by her fault and she didn't get any punishment because of Adrian Paunescu political influence." -&gt; Proofs? Is the trial over?</p>
<p>As of 2004 he was a PSD senator, so he could not have been a memeber of the P.A.S.</p>
<p>Though the initial article might have been disputable, the fact that Paunescu joined PSD - a party that lost elections because of its generalized corruption, completes the picture of Paunescu.</p>
<p>As with regard to the results of the process to Paunescu's wife - unfortunately it is well known that Justice in Romania is far from being inpartial. Processes have been systematically interrupted when the main suspects happened to be influential people or to have connections to the government.</p>
<p><br />
Ok, the wife of Paunescu killed 4 people, but what has this got to do with this page? Maybe we can put it in a "Paunescu bashing" section... Second, I recognize to Paunescu two essential activities: poet and organizer of folk festivals. He is and was also a newspaper director, a politician (like most our intellectual elite), etc., but it's not for this that he will be remembered. Now, I would like to see on this page at least: 1. his bibliography (I can do it), and 2. the list of festivals he organized, maybe a list of songs derived from his poems (and the singers), etc. This information is undisputed, and should form the basis of the article. This is why he is one of Romania's best living poets. Then, we can put on a controversy about "Paunescu the communist".</p>
<p>"Der Zweck heiligt die Mittel", goes a German saying. So you would like to start by acknowledging Paunescu's talents in spite of his lack of spine and dignity? That is a bit more than many of us are ready to accept. Paunescu could have used his talents in a different way, but he did not. Because he was an opportunist - and that's a fact too! Thus, why should we not write about this??</p>
<p><br />
Adrian Paunescu is, and always was, for that matter, Romania's best rhyme writer - nothing more. It is easy to excuse a lot with a supposed 'internal dissidence'. Let us not forget that for at least ten years he wielded an immense power based on a very intimate relationship with the government. Let us not forget all the poems glorifying Ceasescu, his wife, the system and those denouncing the real dissidents and the exiles. And this is all verifyable in the magazine 'Flacara'. And this was all also a considerable part of each and all of his folk festivals (cenaclul Flacara). And I DO hope that he will be remembered for these acts also. For my part, I will always remember december 1989 - that frightened rat, back against a fence, trousers wet with urine. Adrian Paunescu.</p>
<p>You people are incredible. So what if he had relations with the communist government?So what if he had his pants wet with urine during the "revolution"?Does that mean he doesn't deserve respect as one of,if not the greatest contemporane Romanian poets and cultural figures?Let's demolish Eminescu for being a siphillitic and for dying in a sanitarium.Let's spit on Bacovia and N.Stanescu for being alcoholics.Let's destroy the Putna monastery because Stefan cel Mare was an adulterous almost-midget.Let's burn history books because Vlad Tepes impaled hundreds/thousands of people.And so on. Question:if you were running poetry/music shows all over a communist country,throwing out the Militia and singing songs that openly attacked the russian nation and instigated the crowds to disobedience (I can bring examples) and the only thing between your person/the continuity of your work and the basements of the secret police is the fellowship and respect of the almighty president what would you do?In fact,what have YOU done during the communist regime to have the right to criticise him?He might have been a friend of Ceausescu,but that does not mean he isn't a great poet,nor does it mean he didn't help people oppose indoctrination.</p>
<p><br />
The page is about Adrian Paunescu as a person, not just as a poet. Therefore any facts related to him are relevant. I do not agree that he is one of "greatest contemporane Romanian poets and cultural figures". He does have a certain value as a poet but from this to comparing him to Eminescu ... it's a long way. Before and after the revolution he was only interested in personal profit. As about his "courage" to instigate the crowds to disobedience, many people served a lot of years in prison for less. He was probably used/protected by secret police as informer and provocateur since he was never convicted or jailed for any of his crimes, political or otherwise. It is widely recognized that he had material and financial gains from his relation with the secret police and the party officials: money, cars, electronics, household appliances, "legal" abortions for his lovers, custom exceptions for goods he brought from outside the country and so on.</p>

<dd>Dpotop, the Romanian version is just longer.

"So what if he had relations with the communist government?So what if he had his pants wet with urine during the "revolution"?Does that mean he doesn't deserve respect as one of,if not the greatest contemporane Romanian poets and cultural figures?" Exactly. To mention him on one page with Eminescu is plain blasphemy.</p>

<p>This version of the article is POV (Paunescu indeed criticised the authorities at certain times). This article (and its sources) should be merged and completed with the Romanian version, which some believe to be tilted the other way. Unfortunately, Gallagher shows that he is a journalist, and not a historian, so that his article is clearly biased. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">Dpotop</a> 10:27, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
