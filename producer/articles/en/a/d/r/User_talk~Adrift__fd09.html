<dd>In the Enclave Directory I was listed as H.C. Unblack, but I've been going by my current alias for a few years (used to post at the old Saviour Machine Arena under both that name and this one, I think). I was also on Xiangoth and the Rackets &amp; Drapes boards for a bit, and I showed up on the Automata Wiki at Flaming Fish for a few edits also.</dd>

<dd>As for stuff that we can work on... there are a few Christian industrial pages here that could use some expansion. I expanded <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klank.html" title="Klank">Klank</a> a while ago, and I've been watching <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_of_Dust_c42f.html" title="Circle of Dust">Circle of Dust</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celldweller.html" title="Celldweller">Celldweller</a>, but those might need some work. Or just generally, any band that meets the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> can be written about here; <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyle_Park_1d43.html" title="Argyle Park">Argyle Park</a> and Rackets and Drapes should be fine (though Argyle Park and AP2 should be combined). I'll hopefully have an article for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Deadlines_6547.html" title="The Deadlines">The Deadlines</a> at least started by the end of today. (Usually, an article on a band that shows up on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">articles for deletion</a> is kept or deleted based on passing WP:MUSIC's guidelines.) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_havaname_83b4.html" title="User talk:Idont havaname">Talk</a>) 21:17, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you're wrong to have reverted that. Paradise Lost has an album called "Gothic" that contains many allusions to this subculture and is, therefore, relevant, even the band it's not strictly gothic. And the inclusion of HIM is also relevant because they are one of the most popular bands of present-day gothic and they're not even mentioned in the whole page. I'm not going to revert back, but please, try to think of it objectively and you might change your mind. --<a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDoppelgangland_16f7.html" title="User:Doppelgangland">Doppelgangland</a> 13:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you're just intending to replace the image, you can just upload the image again with the same name as before (I think, but I'm not really an expert on images); that will overwrite the image you don't want, but the old image will still be in the history if you want to use it later. Otherwise, you can list it on <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIfD_d369.html" title="WP:IfD">Images and media for deletion</a>. There are also some <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Images.2FMedia" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> that pertain to images, but mainly those are for images that are not being used with adequate licensing. (Although maybe criterion #5 covers what you're looking for.)

<dd>The only currently active bots (per <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a>) that handle images are <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrphanBot_88cf.html" title="User:OrphanBot">OrphanBot</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairuseBot_674e.html" title="User:FairuseBot">FairuseBot</a>, and <a href="../../../p/f/f/User%7EPfft_Bot_6bc0.html" title="User:Pfft Bot">Pfft Bot</a>. It doesn't look like those handle that kind of tagging, although you could ask <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> if they do (he runs OrphanBot and FairuseBot). So it would probably be best for you to go ahead and list it on IfD; I don't think it would necessarily make you look bad if you didn't do anything, but if we're not using the images, we don't really need to keep them around. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 23:46, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added.
