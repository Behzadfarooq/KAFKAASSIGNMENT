<p>Didn't the documentation on this issue (preserved in your talk archive) pass your Adrienne purity test back in early April? It doesn't take an article in <i>Cahiers du Cin√©ma</i> to establish that Ms. Barbeau is known for one thing: her busom (well actually two things- bada bing!). No less an authority than the late Gene Siskel said [Barbeau is] "a terrible actress. If she ever buttoned her blouse for a role, she'd probably forget her lines." True, he didn't say "Barbeau has prodigious knockers", but between Siskel's quote, the one from Joe Bob Briggs, living through the 1970s, and observation, the evidence is overwhelming.</p>
<p>It's amusing that you cite "Yahoo Movies" as the source for her sisters name, Jocelyn Jo. Yahoo Movies got that from Wikipedia; I know because I made it up (I later deleted it). Where "Yahoo Movies" got JoJo's birthdate from I have know idea. This is one reason why undocumented firsthand observation (i.e. anyone whose ever watched her in the Battle of the Network Stars) can be better than an internet reference, even on a pseudo authoritative site like "Yahoo Movies". <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> 15:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They got it from Wikipedia? Are you sure? They don't usually take info from us. I'll look into it and probably delete the name, then. As for her breasts, Gene Siskel did not say she was "mostly known for her breats". If you want to start an article about an actress saying "she was mostly known for her breasts" - exactly like that - that is going to need a lot of sourcing to reliable sources that say exactly that. What about the other changes? The picture of the book is too big, the filmography style is now the accepted style for all filmographies, "astonishing" or "amazing" age for when she gave birth is still an opinion, whether correct or not. You'd need to quote a reliable commentator who has made that opinion. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 15:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't believe we're having this discussion (again). The quote above is exactly what Siskel said. Any male growing up in the 1970s/80's knew Barbeau was famous for her breasts. Consider her entrance into showbiz - go go dancing and a nude musical. It's not essential that the article mention her tits in the first sentence, but they, not her acting, are what she is primarily known for.</dd>

<p>Yes, yes, yes, we know it's an absurd age, etc. But Wikipedia can't express that or any other opinion. If respected writer X said it was an absurd age, we can say "Writer X described it as an absurd age". All Siskel said is that Barbeau wouldn't be much of an actress if not for her breasts. That one line by Siskel doesn't mean that she was "known for her breasts". That's the kind of introduction that you would need to source the heck out of in order to include. As for "any male growing up... etc." - if you could source that, that would definitely be good for including. Something along the lines of "Barbeau had a large fan base that admired her physical appearance" or something like that, instead of the very blunt "known for her breasts" <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was specifically addressing your comment that none of us are allowed to write that 52 is a remarkable age for a woman to give birth. Unless we can find a source to corroborate this fact. So can you explain to me why it would be encyclopediac for us to write "Writer X described it as an absurd age" and not "The writer of this article is describing it as an absurd age". What happens if Writer X later comes along and becomes a Wikipedia contributor; does that mean he loses his credibility and can't be cited anymore? <a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 07:35, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Yahoo Movies" uses buxom as the second word of their biography. "Prodigious breasts" sounds more encyclopedic.</li>
<li>Jocelyn Jo exists! I'm amazed at my false memory of inventing her name and amused that any parent would give their child such a silly name.</li>
<li>Performed on army bases seems kinda humdrum - especially compared to childbirth at 52.</li>
<li>Yes, my observation about her battling the network stars bralesss could be considered original research I guess. Unfortunately, closer observation was imposible given the technological limitations of 1970s small screen TV's. She was egriously unfettered, but unfortunately documentation on 1970s trash TV specials is hard to come by. Her quote about not knowing that her winnebagos was the center of attention were the center of attention was so disingenuous that it needed a counterbalance.</li>
<li>Picture too big? That's just your POV.</li>
<li>Nope, not gonna take that bait.</li>

<p>You can say "she has been described as "pretty &amp; buxom" by Yahoo! Movies" or something to that regard. It's their opinion, and we <b>can</b> quote it, but we can't make up any of our own. Yes, Jocelyn Jo exists. The picture is too big by any standard. Again, we can not express opinions like "remarkable", etc. Please read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> specifically on this. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 04:42, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm replyng to MK2 here. Please read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. We <b>can</b> cite the opinion of <b>reliable sources</b> only, and point whose opinion we are citing when we do. We can't use the opinion of Wikipedia contributors. If a writer for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> wrote that it is an "astonishing" age in a NY times article on Barbeau, we can quote them here and say we are quoting that. If that same writer later becomes a Wikipedia editor, only the opinions which he printed in reliable sources can be used, not the opinions he wishes to express on Wikipedia that haven't been printed elsewhere beforehand. So, if Ghosts&amp;Empties wrote an article that the New York Times published about Barbeau, and mentioned it being a "remarkbale" age, we can quote the New York Times article. We can't quote Ghosts&amp;Empties' opinions otherwise. Personally, I think "remarkable" is redundant even if someone mentioned it in a reliable source, because quite obviously it is remarkable and there is no need to point it out. However, if someone can find a reputable source that expresses that opinion, I am not going to object citing it. For examples on how to cite an opinion from a reputable source, see the opening paragraphs of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Rachel_Wood_d4a4.html" title="Evan Rachel Wood">Evan Rachel Wood</a>, which I have just added (among other things) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 07:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was asked to chime in here. However, there's really not much I can say. Mad Jack is correct in what he says. Some of the edits to this article recently have been unencyclopedic and have been violating Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, etc. Now, I doubt there'll be any problems after the editors read Mad Jack's latest discussion post but if there are, please discuss them here before editing the article itself.

<p>Yamla took it out of the cats, but we still have it in the article when we define her father as French-Canadian, correct? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_7_0c48.html" title="User:Mike 7">Michael</a> 00:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, but French-Canadian means a person who lives in Canada and speaks French (more or less). Their ancestry could be entirely British. Or more likely, they have a French relative perhaps four to eight generations back. Additionally, even if the father was half French, that would make Barbeau only one quarter French, not generally enough to categorise her as a French American. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 00:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Barbeau did say she herself was "half French" in her book. This is cited in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French-Americans_f9e8.html" title="List of French-Americans">List of French-Americans</a>. Even though she doesn't refer to herself as "French", I suppose identifying as "half French" seems enough to call her French (American). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 00:25, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm - maybe never mind - the soure on the French page was from an article that just called her "half French Canadian". In her book, she says she has a "French nose", citing her father's side. But she doesn't actually call herself French (though she does call herself "Armenian"), so maybe the categories are fine as they are now. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 00:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
