<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Rollini_bfff.html" title="Edit section: Childhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Childhood</span></h2>
<p>Rollini was born <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> to Ferdinand Rollini and Adele Augenti Rollini. (Some sources will date <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, but his brother Arthur, as well as social security records will attest to the earlier date.) He was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> into a somewhat wealthy family (his father worked for the American Cigarette Company). He was the eldest of several children, including sister Vera and brother Arthur (born <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, Arthur played <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenor_saxophone.html" title="Tenor saxophone">tenor saxophone</a> with <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Goodman_95f2.html" title="Benny Goodman">Benny Goodman</a> from 1934 to 1939, and later with <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Bradley_80d8.html" title="Will Bradley">Will Bradley</a>). Growing up in <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larchmont%2C_New_York_11dc.html" title="Larchmont, New York">Larchmont, New York</a>, he showed musical ability early on, and began to take piano lessons on a miniature <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>, at the age of 2. Before long he had gained "child prodigy" status and was good enough to play for an audience - he gave a 15 minute <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin_d24f.html" title="Frédéric Chopin">Chopin</a> recital at the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Astoria_6828.html" title="Waldorf Astoria">Waldorf Astoria</a> at the age of four.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Rollini_bfff.html" title="Edit section: Teenage Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Teenage Years</span></h2>
<p>He continued with music and by age 14 he was leading his own group comprised of neighborhood boys, in which he doubled on <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> and <a href="../../../x/y/l/Xylophone.html" title="Xylophone">xylophone</a>. He gigged around and finally made his break in 1922, when he began to play for the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Ramblers_dfeb.html" title="California Ramblers">California Ramblers</a>. Originally intended to play <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> for them, the manager, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Kirkeby_efd0.html" title="Ed Kirkeby">Ed Kirkeby</a>, suggested to him that he learn the somewhat cumbersome <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_saxophone.html" title="Bass saxophone">bass saxophone</a> as a possible <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuba.html" title="Tuba">tuba</a> double. It only took him 2 weeks until he began playing and recording with the bass saxophone.</p>

<p>Over time, he developed a distinctive style. "It swung and it spoke. It had that sense of importance about it, a sense that someone is talking to you and saying something very important." He cut many sides under the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Ramblers_dfeb.html" title="California Ramblers">California Ramblers</a> and formed two subgroups- The Little Ramblers (starting in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>) and the Goofus Five (most prominently 1926-1927). Rollini's swing and impetus are quite evident; "Clementine (From New Orleans)", "Vo-Do-Do-De-O Blues", and "And Then I Forget" are among some of the best recordings that not only typify the era but showcase the prominence and power that Rollini brought to the table. During this time, he managed to lay down hundreds of sessions with names like <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_Hanshaw_586e.html" title="Annette Hanshaw">Annette Hanshaw</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Edwards_8f24.html" title="Cliff Edwards">Cliff Edwards</a> (<a href="../../../u/k/e/Ukelele_Ike_18cd.html" title="Ukelele Ike">Ukelele Ike</a>), <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Venuti_6cac.html" title="Joe Venuti">Joe Venuti</a> and his Blue Four, The University Six, <a href="../../../m/i/f/Miff_Mole_49e7.html" title="Miff Mole">Miff Mole</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Nichols_3d39.html" title="Red Nichols">Red Nichols</a> to name a few. Some of his best work would include the Bix sides he cut. (Scattered throughout the 1920s, Rollini's great bass sax solos were on scores of records, and they usually outstanding.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927 was</a> a landmark year for jazz and Rollini, as not only did he participate in numerous sides, but he also got the job heading up the talent roster for the opening of the Club New Yorker. It was a short-lived organization, a who's-who of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> jazz, including <a href="../../../b/i/x/Bix_Beiderbecke_12e5.html" title="Bix Beiderbecke">Bix Beiderbecke</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Lang_bfcd.html" title="Eddie Lang">Eddie Lang</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Venuti_6cac.html" title="Joe Venuti">Joe Venuti</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Signorelli_67cf.html" title="Frank Signorelli">Frank Signorelli</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Trumbauer_18bf.html" title="Frank Trumbauer">Frank Trumbauer</a>. Sadly, salary demands began to rise, and the club had its own shortcomings, which proved a bad combination in the end, and the arrangement only lasted for some 3 weeks.it was not long until other talent would be seeking his name. From across the pond, a young English band leader by the name of Fred Elizalde was leading a band in London at the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savoy_Ballroom_3f3b.html" title="Savoy Ballroom">Savoy Ballroom</a>, and he was looking for the best American jazzmen to spice up his already hot sound. He found Rollini, as well as Chelsey Quealey, Bobby Davis, Tommy Felline and Jack Russin. They all agreed to join him in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> and stayed until September of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>. This time was interrupted when Adrian received word from the States that his father was in declining health. Rollini took a ship back to the States to see his father, and to ask his blessing in his marriage to his fiancée, Dixie. His father indeed gave his blessing and the two were married. Their voyage to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> served as their honeymoon. They took brother Art back with them over to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>After finishing their stay with Elizalde, Rollini and the gang returned to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, but by the time they got back the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Ramblers_dfeb.html" title="California Ramblers">California Ramblers</a> had pretty much folded, as raccoon coats, flappers, and everything else that they had come to be so closely connected to had become a thing of the past. He continued to work, recording with such artists as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Morse_53d7.html" title="Lee Morse">Lee Morse</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dorsey_Brothers_d5a0.html" title="The Dorsey Brothers">The Dorsey Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Selvin_ee85.html" title="Ben Selvin">Ben Selvin</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Teagarden_c667.html" title="Jack Teagarden">Jack Teagarden</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930s</a> saw a shift in musical idea- away from the "hot" sound and towards a more centered, polished sound, and Rollini adapted. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> he formed Adrian Rollini and his Orchestra (primarily a studio group assembled for recording), and they began to record in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, primarily for Vocalion and Banner. While Rollini did manage to assemble some great talent for example <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunny_Berigan_1846.html" title="Bunny Berigan">Bunny Berigan</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Goodman_95f2.html" title="Benny Goodman">Benny Goodman</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Teagarden_c667.html" title="Jack Teagarden">Jack Teagarden</a>, do not expect these records to sound like the Rollini of old - while his beautiful tone and polish is there, you won't find them to be as hot or exciting as the older late '20s cuts, as they were commercial pop recordings. (Particularly great recordings from this period were his work with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Venuti_6cac.html" title="Joe Venuti">Joe Venuti</a>, as well as "Savage Serenade", "Who Walks In While I Walk Out?" and "Got The Jitters" recorded under his own name. These were hot sides with plenty of great <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodman.html" title="Goodman">Goodman</a> solos.)</p>
<p>His other groups would include the Adrian Rollini Quintette, The Adrian Rollini Trio (primarily late <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930s</a>) and Adrian and his Tap Room Gang which was based in the Hotel President at 234 West 48th Street in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> City. Rollini reportedly managed the club inside of the hotel for a short while as well as leading the orchestra. In these recordings, you will notice a gradual shift in Adrian's focus from the bass <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> to the <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibraphone.html" title="Vibraphone">vibraphone</a>. This is not so much that Rollini was giving up on the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_saxophone.html" title="Bass saxophone">bass saxophone</a> or his abilities - only it is now fading popularity in the big band scene - for example, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Ellington_9f87.html" title="Duke Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artie_Shaw_3dd4.html" title="Artie Shaw">Artie Shaw</a> weren't exactly featuring a bass <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> on the bandstand. Rollini responded, recording on it for the last time in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. He continued to be active with <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibraphone.html" title="Vibraphone">vibraphone</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimes.html" title="Chimes">chimes</a>, but sadly, when he gave up his role as a bass saxophonist, his role in jazz went with it.</p>
<p>He went on to play hotels, as well as arranging and writing songs behind the scenes, collaborating with such names as Vaughan Monroe but he never did any big recording once the big band era really got underway- his trio pretty much represents the last of his great work. After these, he faded from the big scene, appearing here and there. He can be seen in a <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> short entitled "For Auild lang Syne" starring <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cagney_83fe.html" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>, as well as "Himber Harmonics" (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>) where he appears with the trio, and "Melody Masters: Swing Style" (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>). He also did a brief tour in the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940s</a> in which he came to the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majestic_Theater_8fa8.html" title="Majestic Theater">Majestic Theater</a> in downtown <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>, as well as other cities.</p>
<p><a name="Death" id="Death"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Rollini_bfff.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Rollini settled in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> where he last worked at the Eden Roc Hotel in September <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>. He also operated the Driftwood Lodge at Tavernier Key. He died <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> at the age of 52. His brother Art claims Rollini fell down a flight of stairs and met his demise; however, the British magazine <i>The Melody Maker</i> wrote in a <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> article that he had been found dead in a blood-splattered car with one of his feet nearly severed. They claim he died in hospital after suffering a heart attack and lung collapse. Others say he died of <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and complications following a liver ailment, while still others argue that perhaps the mob was involved in his death. The actual location of Rollini's death was the James Archer Smith Hospital in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead%2C_Florida_f5f2.html" title="Homestead, Florida">Homestead</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. He died after an 18 day stay in the hospital following a severe trauma to his ankle suffered in the early morning hours (apparently from an auto-related accident)in the parking lot of The Green Turtle Inn at Islamorada Key. This historic <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Keys_224b.html" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> restaurant recently closed its doors in late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, ending a famous part of history in the middle Keys after almost 60 years of operation. After Rollini's death, the old Driftwood Lodge was destroyed in severe hurricane that pounded the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Keys_224b.html" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> in 1960. Today, the site of the old Driftwood has been developed into a private home.</p>
