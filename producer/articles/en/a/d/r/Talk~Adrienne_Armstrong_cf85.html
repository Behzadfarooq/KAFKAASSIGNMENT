<p>I don't see the merit in having an article on this person. She's married to someone notable. So what? I don't think that makes her notable.opose that this article be deleted.

<dd>She's co-owner of Adeline Records and Adeline Street; a record company and a clothing company, respectfully. I would say that she's very important.

<dd>While there is mention of this in the first sentence, ~ 95% of the article is about her marriage to a famous musician. Upon re-reading this article, I again believe it is not warranted. The claim that she is "very important" is not a good use of the word "very". I would call Nelson Mandella, George Bush or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "very important". But someone who opened a record company and clothing store? Not so much. There's a lot of people who have started businesses - what makes them notworthy? I suggest that the answer is "nothing". I propose that this article be deleted. Thanks, <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_Gadarn_2814.html" title="User:Hu Gadarn">Hu Gadarn</a> 20:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's fine. The problem is that we don't have enough information about her because she's just starting out. This article used to redirect to Billie Joe Armstrong; that might be a better source than just deleting it. I never said, nor meant, that she was more important than Nelson Mandella. The meaning of "very" is a subjective topic.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 09:49, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>OK, now I'm getting concerned - do you think the trivial "trivia" material belongs here? Someone has listed that she used to manage a store in the "90's" [sic] and her brother is a "professional skateborder" (redlinked). Almost the entire article is about her relationship with her husband and not much about her significance. Again, I want to be clear that I'm not saying that she is a bad person, merely that she does not appear to be noteworthy. I'm sure any user on wikipedia would warrant their own page if we used these criteria (how many people have won awards? managed stores/ staff? travelled to interesting places? spoke in front of audiences? etc. This is not noteworthy material.) - I welcome your thoughts on this.

<dd>You know... I'm really trying hard to explain this, but it doesn't seem to ever be enough. Just recently the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council_2f8d.html" title="Natural Resources Defense Council">NRDC</a> enlisted her to help them raise awareness for environmental issues. Would they enlist her in a highly public campaign and put her in her own video if she wasn't a very important person to a lot of people? I just don't see how she's irrelevant at all. Her article is a growing process. She's becoming more and more active in the public eye and I honestly think that her article will be greatly improved as this happens.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 06:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for responding - I appreciate your efforts to communicate and I recognize that email between distant people is not an easy way to do this. That said, I'll ask yuou directly: do you think information on someone such as the fact they managed a store in the 1990s is important? And someone is "trying to raise awareness"? Awareness of what? Mars? Air pollution? If this is noteworthy material then I propose it be clear and preferably referenced; if there is a magazine interview with her somewhere, then please include the info. If there's an on-camera interview with her, same story, please provide a link. But if someone is merely working on projects, raising awareness and worked in a store &gt;10 years ago - this does not seem like noteworthy material to me. I want to be clear that I have no vested interest in this person and I had never heard of her before hitting the "random article" button, my issue is trying in some small way to make wikipedia a better place. And part of that means considering whether content is noteworthy. Thanks, <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_Gadarn_2814.html" title="User:Hu Gadarn">Hu Gadarn</a> 16:21, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems there is effort being made to source the information in this article. Deleting this article is not going to help any effort being made to help this article. I'm sorry if I sound annoyed or something, but I am not. An effort is being made to find sources and maybe not all information or everything is clear. It may not be Good Article material, however, there is still an effort being made. I believe that with her being married to Billie Joe, her involvement with the record company and clothing company this makes it a notable article. And her involvement also with the NRDC. With all these things together it makes this article notable I feel. <font style="arial: ridge 2px #FF0000; background-color: #000000" color="#FF0000"><big><b>&#160;<a href="../../../o/r/f/User%7EOrfen_3254.html" title="User:Orfen"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="arial"><b><i>Orfen</i></b></font></font></a>&#160;</b></big></font><sup><small><a href="../../../o/r/f/User_talk%7EOrfen_ba32.html" title="User talk:Orfen"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="arial"><u>User Talk</u></font></font></a></small></sup> | <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orfen_d6cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orfen"><font color="#000000"><font face="arial"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sub> 22:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I understand what you're saying now. The problem is that the NRDC tip came from an email from NRDC themselves to the people listed on their mailing list. I do recall an article about Adeline Street that I could post here, but it's scans from a magazine and I'm not sure what the policy is on scans. I don't want to violate a copyright and have them delete the links. Should I post the links to the scans as references ( which they are ) and hope for the best? I'll get on that now. If they're deleted I can just reference the magazine itself, though that would require people to buy it to be able to validate the source. The main resource for all of the information from this article is an episode of Driven on VH1. There was also a Behind the Music that she contributed a lot to. I'll check greenday.net ( which is the official fansite for the band and used to be their official website period ), and see if I can dig up the info from there. There's actually an account directly from her mouth on the site FAQ that was posted before the site was moved to GreenDay.com but I can't prove that it was the official site before then except for messages from Green Day in interviews ( video ) saying to visit it because it's their official site. So you see, there's a lot of half-arsed resources that are valid, but it's hard to prove. I'll get to work putting them up and revamping the article, because at least it's something.

<dd>OK, I think that we've made some progress and that we're approaching a similar perspective now. Thanks for trying to understand me - I know it's sometimes difficult to write/read the nuances of communication via impersonal text. That said, I welcome any references you're able to dig up - and I'll not expect anything in the immediate future (i.e. I'll be patient). I agree with you that the scanned material is likely not kosher here but even a written ref would be good (e.g. "Discorder Magazine, Sep 2006").

<p>Adrienne Armstrong married billy joe Armstrong (the lead singer and guitarist of the punk rock band Green day) in the year 1992. Despite that being all I can tell you about HER in general, I can also tell you that it is almost impossible to find a picture of her on the internet. Believe me I've tried.</p>
<p>ive seen how she looks, i saw her on vh1's driven from Green Day. I think she is pretty.</p>

<dd>It's probably not fair use. I've never been able to find any and I'm pretty sure I've seen all of the ones that have crossed the internet.

<p>No, you don't seem to understand the copyright policy. Without a fair-use source we can't just update it. And since there's no way of knowing who took the image in that link, we can't upload it.

I meant any images you thought were fair use, to upload them; not specifically that photo. I'm sorry that I didn't state that clearly. I was honestly just trying to be polite. I know for a fact that none of the images of her that have crossed the internet are fair use at this point, though. I thought maybe you had a photo you had taken with her, though. That's always a possibility, that someone has a personal fan photo with her, and that's why I asked you to upload it if you thought it was fair use. Again, I'm really sorry, and I don't know how else to explain it. I have a hard time explaining things.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 19:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since Adeline Street wasn't notable enough to have its own article, and it would have been dwarfed by Billie Joe's long article, I added information about the company here. I think it makes sense because Adrienne spends most of her time working on the clothing line. I sourced the information. I think it helps people understand that she's a growing influence in the fashion industry, therefore giving her article more credibility. If you have anything to add please don't hesitate to do so!--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 00:46, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
