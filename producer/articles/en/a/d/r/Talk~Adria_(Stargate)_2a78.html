<p>Well, then i will further enhance my contribution. After all, i doubt any of you have a clue about latin phrases.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 19:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>and by the way, the actress starring Adria at the age of seven is actually older. Furthermore, weren't they been made aware of, most people wouldn't know whether the phrases are in Latin or Ancient so please stop reverting my note.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 20:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly, thus why your it is latin is being removed. Unless you can backup this claim it shall be removed. <font face="Tahoma" size="1"><font color="#C11B17">Matthew</font> <b><font color="#3366FF">Fenton (</font></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton"><font color="#356468">contribs</font></a><font color="#3366FF"><b>)</b></font></font> 20:05, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
in latin poetry it was an expression "tollere ad sidera voltus" used by Vergilius, Ovidius etc. It is precisely the same expression useb by the Prior. For example:</p>
<p>1. "velum adversa ferit, fluctusque ad sidera tollit voltus" (Virgil's Aeneid, Book 1)</p>
<p>2. "tollens ad sidera voltum" (Ovid, Fasti II)</p>
<p>3. "coelumque tueri Jussit, et erectus ad sidera tollere voltus" (Solatium Podagricorum)</p>
<p>In addition, words like "videri" = present infinitive passive of the verb "to see", "esset" = past subjunctive of the verb "to be", "terra" = earth, "rus" = cultivated field are certainly latin. i'd suugest you use a latin-english dictionary to check that.</p>

<p>I am also being polite to tell the Prior speaks pure Latin not Ancient/Latin. Were it otherwise, the grammatical structure and vocabulary would be somewhat changed. Furthermore, you can hear for yourself the Latin words and stating that is Ancient is as absurd as saying that the phrase "who are you" belongs to a future language derived from english. The show script may regard this as Ancient taking advantage that almost no one knows this language. However, that does not mean we should alter the real fact. It is just like accepting all the show story as a reality, wouldn't u think?<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 20:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>thank you very much. an editing conflict just wiped away an entire paragraph.</p>

<p>I am not intending to turn the article into a language lesson i just want to mention the language of the phrases. it will not affect the article nature, it will just add a short clarification.

<p>Yes, i can prove and i will. I agree: in the SG Universe he may be speaking whatever alterian or ori but I am referring to REAL SOURCE. Haven't you understood that by now?

<p>As i am accused i cannot back up the fact what the Prior says is Latin indeed, i fell compelled to delete my transalation of these phrases since i obviously based it on the fact the phrases were Latin. Consequently, until i can prove the Prior is speaking Latin actually (although IN THE STARGATE FICTIONAL UNIVERSE, which some tend to mistake it for reality, is regarded as Ancient/Ori language), the translation is presumbaly wrong and it is to be removed. Any objections will be an argument to the fact that the phrases are Latin indeed. Or maybe user Fenton will come up with an "Ancient/Ori" translation.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 17:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Since there is no proof that Tomin translated the phrase i will remove it. Vala did not ask him "what did he say", she just said "what is it, Tomin", refering to its sudden change of attitude, so Tomin's response could be a personal phrase. Until it can be demonstrated that the Prior said in Latin what Tomin said afterwards, you cannot back up the fact that Tomin's words are a translation.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 19:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I strongly recommand then the removal of this personal opinion until you can demonstrate me that what the Prior said and what Tomin uttered afterwards are the same thing. and please stop rambling about your lenity, reasoning and fairness as though i'd have to thank you. i'd be more than happy to report me so we can solve this problem.

<p>"or as Tomin translated, from one all will learn" is a personal opinion as it cannot be proved that Tomin's words were a translation or that they were even connected to what the Prior said in that "unidentified" language. Since you cannot be sure of the language, you cannot be sure of what the Prior said therefore u cannot state that Tomin's words were actually a translation. have i made it clear?<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 19:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay then even tho that is not an opinion, haha. translated -&gt; said; the change in word now does not mean or imply it is a translation. <font face="Tahoma" size="1"><font color="#C11B17">Matthew</font> <b><font color="#3366FF">Fenton (</font></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton"><font color="#356468">contribs</font></a><font color="#3366FF"><b>)</b></font></font> 19:44, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It still does imply they have the same meaning "or as Tomin said". The show does not explicitily indicates that both Prior's words and Tomin's suggest she is carrying a tremendous a tremendous amount of knowledge. In order to keep that idea, it should be removed the Prior's phrases as we do not know their meaning. Furthermore the second Prior phrase should be removed "et terra rus ad sidera tollere voltus". Not knowing the exact meaning of those words the statement that they announce Adria's double nature cannot be backed up and could be considered a personal opinion.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 19:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
the statement " Furthermore the same Prior announced her combined divine and human nature by uttering "et terra rus ad sidera tollere voltus". This cannot be supported since we cannot be sure of what the Prior said and therefore we cannot deduce its meaning. it is thus a personal opinion and should be removed too.<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.32.1.82.html" title="User:89.32.1.82">89.32.1.82</a> 19:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And the phrase "her initial name given by the Prior was Orici" is incorrect. Tomin used for the first time the name and later Adria said "they call me Orici", without mentioning "they" are the Priors. Moreover the Priors never uttered the name Orici by now so her initial name was given by the Ori believers(Tomin, they - which includes Priors and ordinary people).

<p>i agree with 71.203.209.0 regarding her real age. one's real age is considered the genetic age so i added an emphasis to point out that "age four" "age seven" are not exactly her normal age.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_89_guy_98ba.html" title="User:The 89 guy">The 89 guy</a> 07:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps we should have a list of her observed powers. We have already seen teleknisis, telepathy, super-human stregnth, exreme knowlage, memory and intelegence, ability to surive strikes by superweapons, ability to heal and resurect, and the ability to put a holographic projection over herself. Who supports adding a list of her powers to the article? We could also include a list of powers she is likely to have since other close-to-asension beings have them, like superhuman senses and rapid self healing. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 20:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like a good idea though I might use the term "Abilities" instead of "Powers". I'd also include information on the personal shield necklace if it is not already included.

<p>I just had a thought and was wondering if it was worth including in the article - if Baal was telling the truth and the collective Ori were destroyed by Merlin’s weapon, then Adria will now be the only ascended Ori left (obviously). Whilst this would make her completely outnumbered by the Ancients, the billions of people who worship the Ori still believe in the Ori, and thus contribute their life force to any ascended Ori. If Adria is alone now, then she will not have to share that power given by her followers with anyone else, potentially making her the most powerful individual ascended being in existence. That might prevent the ancients from directly attacking her. If not, she could still chose to ascend anyone she wanted (perhaps the Doci and a few Priors) to assist her (though that would force her to share the power given by the Ori followers). Anyway, I'm just spittballing and wondering if any of that is worth mentioning. (Anon - 3:10pm 07 March 2007)</p>
<p>Oh, and on an another note, what about the Sangraal? From the description of it the weapon was not so much a bomb as it was a kind of ZPM. If it didnt explode when it was used, then is it not still in the Ori home galaxy, physically intact? If so, doesnt Adria now have a weapon in her possession that could wipe out the Ancients the same way it did to the Ori? That makes sense, but would make it far too easy for her to win, something I dont think the writers would do. Is it possible that Merlin designed the Sangraal to self-destruct after use, knowing that it would have to be in the Ori galaxy before it was used and not wanting it to fall into their hands? (Anon - 3:30pm 07 March 2007)</p>
<p>I don't know. Ba'al would have no reason to lie. Remember, he himself wanted to kill the Ori AND The Ancients. They're probably dead. Anyway, about the Sangraal still being there. Yeah, it was on the ship that Adria was on that was sent through. So either it self destructed or they have it in the Ori galaxy but can't use it for the same reason they couldn't kill the Ancients in the Milky Way. They would use their powers to destroy the device first.</p>

<p>Then why did the Ori not use <i>their</i> powers to destroy the weapon when it entered their galaxy? Perhaps the device is protected from ascended beings in a similar way that Arthurs Mantle rendered things invisible to ascended beings. That would explain why Morgan le Fay stopped Merlin from building it in the first place as opposed to destroying it when it was finished (perhaps she couldnt). (Anon - 6:33pm, 7 March 2007)</p>

<li>Speaking of her ascension, would this constitute a <i>re</i>ascension on Adria's part? -- <a href="../../../s/f/h/User%7ESFH_3da7.html" title="User:SFH">SFH</a> 21:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I dont know. Maybe they were caught off guard or the Ancients were helping SG-1 by "distracting" them in a simmiliar fashion that the Ancients would have been distracted when every soul in the galaxy would have been worshipping the Ori like Adria stated before.</p>
<p>No, she didn't reascend as she was never an original Ori. She is basically the daughter of an ascended Ori. She was never an original Ori. My guess is that no Ori would risk their butt or descend and lose the privilige of sapping power from humans to lead their forces.</p>

<p>Actually there is no direct evidence one way or the other - Whilst it is possible Adria is an entirely new life born from Vala, it is equally possible that an ascended Ori impregnated her with itself to be born in human form. According to Daniel in 'Flesh and Blood' he stated that Adria was "Not a child, she is an Ori in the body of a human" which strongly implies the latter possibility. Then again, why go through the trouble of being born when, if she was an ascended being, she could simply retake human form just as Merlin did? He was able to take human form and still retain great powers and knowledge, one would think it would have been quicker and easier for an ascended Ori to do the same.</p>
<p>Well, obviously they included the Vala pregnant thing because the actress actually WAS pregnant at the time and the writers wanted to include that into the plot. Also, being born with ascended knowledge and power might have given her more leeway than simply descending with it. Morgan Le Fay was able to interfer with Merlins work because he used ascended knowledge and power to build his weapon. If Adria (as an ascended Ori) had simply manifest as an equally advanced human form and kept her ascended knowledge, the ancients may have been able to attack her or at least stop her from using her powers, but being physically born with them may have constituded a loophole in the ascended rules that let her wield the same ascended knowledge and power Merlin had, without drawing their wrath.</p>
<p>Err, ok that came out a bit more complex than I intended, but hopefully you catch my drift. Anyway, wouldnt it be kinda like Jesus? He was supposed to be the son of God (and Mary) and yet he was also supposed to BE god in human form, both at once. Like the holy trinity and all, the paradox of god and human as one. I dunno, I'm just rambling, but I still think it could be either in Adria's case - she could be a newly born conciousness with Ori knowledge, or she could be a descended Ori that took the form of a fetus instead of a fully grown human.</p>
<p>Oh, and as to why any Ori would risk their ass taking mortal form, well they wouldnt be would they? Because unlike the poor Priors, Adria KNEW how to ascend. We know she had the ability, and we also know that death is quite a common trigger for ascension. That, combined with super funky powers and a near invulnerable shield meant that any Ori that chose to do as Adria did would hardly be putting themselves at great risk. Even if someone found a way to get past all her protection and powers and kill her, she could still ascend at will and end up right back at square one again. And besides which, Orlin and Merlin took great risks in giving up their ascension, and even Daniel gave up his. Whilst the Ori seem to be a tad more evil than them, it doesnt change the fact that, with good reason an ascended being WILL give up their ascension. (Anon - 8:45am, 08 Macrh 2007)</p>
<p>Note - the Ori armies are not completely leaderless; they still have the Doci to lead them. And it would be cool to have Julian Sands back in the show! --Anon - 8:52am, 11 March 2007--</p>
