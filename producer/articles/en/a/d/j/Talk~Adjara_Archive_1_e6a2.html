<hr />
<p>Very funny description of the latest developments. It doesn't describe the basic conflict. The oppositional movement is called supporters of Saakashvili. Igor Ivanov's talks with Abashidze are not mentioned at all. Very funny. That's world history Walt Disney style. ChrisM, May 10, 2004</p>

<p>The flag of Adjara was not the official one, but only the flag of Aslan Abashidze's political party. The government of post-Aslan Adjara adopted a new flag in 2004.</p>

<p>Does somebody know what is the current religious composition of Ajaria? Is there more Muslims or Christians? Could somebody to write this in the article? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>

<p>Mcx327 a couple days ago removed "forcibly" in the sentence saying that the Ajarians were forcibly Islamized during the Ottoman rule. Did they convert by choice, or did they have no choice? --<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHottentot_55b5.html" title="User:Hottentot">Hottentot</a></p>
<p>Typically under Islamic Sharia law, forcible conversion is not allowed. But as you know, these rules might have been violated. If they converted over several centuries consider this voluntary, if over one year or decade this is probably forcible conversion. Also, I do not know the current Musim vs Christian mix, I presume current Georgian government does not want to emphasize division of Georgians. If this is so, why Ajarian flag has a cross? <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 12:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As Adjarians, we adopt Islam voluntarily!</p>
<p>Now in adjara, there is a Christianization through psychological and economic press. Adjara is an autonomous republic because of Islam. So we don't accept the new flag. And we want to perform Adhan at the mosque.</p>
<p>These are realities of Adjara and Adjarians.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Adjara has its own official flag whether you accept it or not. Georgia is a free country and doesn't press Muslims to accept Christianity. I doubt you are not Adjarian at all. Your pattern of behavior can be seen as vandalism and may get you blocked from editing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 11:33, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>As Muslim Adjarians, we don't accept this flag that includes Christian symbol. It violates the autonomy of Adjara. Because Adjara has autonomous due to Islam. If Georgia is free, why don't allow to perform Adhan at the Mosque? Be sure I'm Adjarian. I doubt you are not Adjarian. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia. It is not a special or official book!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You should provide your sources before making such questionable edits. Adjarians have never protested against a new flag. I'm definitely sure you don't come from Adjara (despite your username). Adjaria has autonomy not due to Islam, but because of politics. There is much larger Muslim community in another region of Georgia, but they don't enjoy autonomy. Anyway, your edits are biased POV and vandalism. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 14:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please read the history of Adjara that be found in this article: "After a brief military conflict in March 1921, Ankara government ceded the territory to Georgia due to Article VI of Treaty of Kars on grounds that autonomy is provided for the <b>Muslim</b> population. Adjarians are total Muslim People and Adjara is a special region. The autonmy is quaranteed by Kars Treaty that is a international treaty. Your information are biased and I give back your insult "vandalism". I'm definitely sure you are not Adjarian (look at your username).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I don't argue that Adjara is not autonomous. I'm not Adjarian, I'm from Tbilisi, but I have many relatives and friends in Adjara and know the region very well. You should provide sources for your claims and restore the flag and governmental statistics. You actually violated the 3RR. I'm not going to do the same. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 15:11, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You can not realize importance of the autonomous, because you are not Adjarian. The autonomous is an international status. So you argue it or not... This place (encyclopedia) is not govermental or official area.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I do realize the importance of the autonomy. What you cannot understand is that Wikipedia is not a place for religous or political propaganda. Adjara is an autonomous part of Georgia and has its own flag and statistics you've removed without any explanation. If you really are from Adjara, you obviously read Georgian and can easily check my info. Also you violated the 3RR rule and may be blocked from editing. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 16:18, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't make propaganda. The religion is the basic matter in this subject. Because Adjara has autonomy due to religion (Islam). Yes, Adjara is a part of Georgia, but it has a religious autonomy! The flag clearley violates the autonomous. The informations which you added (included flag) are official info. They are not neutral!

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>The last census conducted in Georgia was in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and only estimates could be made for the two regions not controlled by the central government of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a> (<a href="../../../a/b/k/Abkhazia.html" title="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Ossetia_c252.html" title="South Ossetia">South Ossetia</a>). 2002 census included <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjaria.html" title="Adjaria">Adjaria</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002, population figures were;</p>
<p>4,371,500 (Georgian controlled) + 230,000 (Abkhazia + South Ossetia) = 4,601,000</p>
<p>Experts' estimates for 2005 population figures are;</p>
<p>4,289,100 (Georgian controlled) + 227,000 (Abkhazia + South Ossetia) = 4,516,000</p>
<p><a href="http://www.statistics.ge/Main/Yearbook/2005/05Population_05.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.ge/Main/Yearbook/2005/05Population_05.doc" rel="nofollow">Statistical Yearbook of Georgia, 2005: Population</a></p>
<p>The figure given by <a href="http://adjarastat.com/Docs/EROVNEBA.doc" class="external text" title="http://adjarastat.com/Docs/EROVNEBA.doc" rel="nofollow">Adjarastat</a> for the total population of Georgia proper is 4,371,535 which corresponds to the 2002 census. Therefore, it is wrong to state that 376,016 is the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> population of Adjaria. It is the 2002 population. Otherwise, why choose the 2002 population for the whole of Georgia? Experts' estimates for 2005 would have been chosen instead. Indeed, for a further example, 121,800 is the 2002 population given for the city of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batumi.html" title="Batumi">Batumi</a> by the Georgian central agency of statistics, which is also taken over by Adjarastat. But they are and they remain the 2002 figures. Which should be indicated in this article.</p>
<p>Secondly, 2002 census did register ethnicity, but not religion. And in ethnicity terms, all Adjarians were counted as Georgians. One can easily draw a conclusion between the number for the, for example, ethnic Azerbaijani population in Georgia and the corresponding number of Muslims. But Adjarian Muslims have not been put into figures on the basis of an actual count. They are estimates. Could anyone confirm this?</p>

According to the BBC "Nowadays about half the population professes the Islamic faith" as opposed to which is quite different to the statement in the article that a "significant number of Ajarians remain Sunni Muslims":</p>

The Georgian User Kober who argues about the religous composition of Adjara and accuses other users of being non Adjarians seems to have a biased POV regarding this article.</p>

<dd>First of all, I have no reason to be biased because I respect all religions practiced in Georgia and have Muslim friends among Georgians and Azeris living in my country. Secondly, the governmental statistics appear to be more accurate than BBC as I’ve never heard of any research on religious composition of Adjara conducted by BBC. So, please (whoever made the above comment on my POV) cite more reliable sources if you have any. The reconversion to Christianity began in 1989 <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~bsp/publications/2004_04-sani.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~bsp/publications/2004_04-sani.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and is still underway. I personally know a Georgian Orthodox priest from Keda, Adjara, who was born and raised in the family of a hoja. Again, I have nothing against religious minorities and strongly support religious freedom in Georgia and elsewhere in the world. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 05:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A quoatation from www.geotimes.ge/forum:</p>
<p>I HAVE ENOUGH INFO ABOUT THE OBLIGATIONS APPLIED ON MUSLIM GEORGIANS TO CHANGE THEIR RELIGION. IMEDI AND RUSTAVI-2 TV STATIONS SHOWED THE CEREMONIES OF CHRISTIANIZATION OF MUSLIM GEORGIANS IN ACH'ARA (MACHAKHELA GORGE). MR: ZURAB ZHVANIA JOINED THE LAST CEREMONY IN MACHAKHELA. I REMEMBER THAT HIS MOTHER IS ARMENIAN. THE ONLIEST CAUSE OF AUTONOMY OF ACH'ARA IS ITS RELIGIONAL DIFFERENCE. I DO NOT WANT ACH'ARA TO BE SEPERATED FROM GEORGIA BUT OUR CHRISTIAN SIBLINGS MUST RESPECT TO THEIR MUSLIM GEORGIAN SIBLINGS' BELIEVES. ALSO INTERESTING SCENES RECORDED BY TRT (TURKEY'S OFFICIAL TV STATION) FOR ITS PROGRAM 'SINIRLAR ARASINDA' (meaning: beyond the boundaries). THE CRISTIANIZATION CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA ON MUSLIM GEORGIANS BOTH IN ACH'ARA AND SAINGILO PUTS US INTO VERY HARD POSITION IN TURKEY'S PUBLIC VIEW. DO NOT THINK THAT MUSLIM GEORGIANS IN TURKEY ARE IN FULL RELIGIONAL COMFORT, BUT IF MUSLIM GEORGIANS CAN NOT BE IN COMFORT IN THEIR MOTHERLAND, WHERE SHALL THEY FEEL THEMSELVES IN FULL COMFORT ON THIS PLANET? WE ALWAYS IMAGINED GEORGIA AS OUR LEGENDARY MOTHERLAND IN WHICH OUR BEAUTIFUL HEARTED SIBLINGS LIVE UNDER SOVIET PRESSURE FOR MANY YEARS. ARE NOT OUR ETHNIC-CULTURAL TRADITIONS OUR COMMON VALUES WHATEVER OUR BELIEVES? WE HAVE ENOUGH INFO INCLUDING SCENES FROM IMEDI, RUSTAVI-2 AND GEOTVR STATIONS ABOUT CHRISTIANIZATION CEREMONIES IN ACH'ARA. ALSO, WE KNOW THAT SOME INTERESTING POWERS PAY MONEY TO PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR RELIGION AND NAMES. AND, THEY TELL THAT THEY CAN FIND JOBS FOR THOSE CHANGING THEIR RELIGION. THESE POWERS BLAME MUSLIM GEORGIANS IN ACH'ARA WITH BEING TURK, TATRI, TURKEY'S SPY, ETC. UNLESS THEY CHANGE THEIR RELIGION... I WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT OTTOMANS OR TURKS DID NOT MAKE GEORGIANS IN SOUTHWESTERN GEORGIA MUSLIM BY FORCING OR OTHER WILD WAYS; GEORGIANS IN THOSE REGIONS ACCEPTED ISLAM BY THEIR HEARTS... THEY HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED ENEMINESS TO THEIR ETHNIC SIBLINGS... I ALSO WISH TO KNOW; WHY A PREST SCHOOL HAS BEEN OPENED IN KHULO WHERE THE POPULATION IS COMPLETELY MUSLIM? WHO WILL GO TO THIS SCHOOL? GEORGIAN CHILDREN FROM TBILISI? AND, WHY ARE THERE CHRISTIANITY LECTURES IN THE SCHOOLS IN ACH'ARA GIVEN BY GEORGIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH MEMBERS? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT ANY MUSLIM GEORGIAN ENFORCING THEIR CHRISTIAN GEORGIAN SIBLINGS TO CONVERT TO ISLAM? WHY IS IT FORBIDDEN TO CALL ADHAN (PRAYER'S CALL) IN BATUMI MOSQUE? WOULD IT BE NICE TO STOP THE CLING-CLANG VOICES IN CHURCHES? AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING THE FLAG OF GEORGIA? DOES GEORGIA REFUSE ITS REPUBLICAN EXPERIENCE? IS MONARCHY OR THEOCRACY BETTER THAN DEMOCRACY? BY CHANGING ITS REPUBLICAN FLAG WITH KINGDOM'S FLAG... DO NOT YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR MUSLIM GEORGIAN SIBLINGS IN TURKEY, SAINGILO AND IRAN? DOES GEORGIA BELONGS TO ONLY CHRISTIAN GEORGIANS? HOW WILL YOU DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONS WITH MUSLIM CHECHEN NATION AGAINST RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM ON CAUCASIA? IS IT RIGHT THAT ARMENIANS ARE THE UNSEPERABLE SIBLINGS OF GEORGIANS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION? DO THEY SEE YOU AS THEIR CHRISTIAN SIBLINGS? SO THAT THEY IMAGINE TO OCCUPY JAVAKHETI AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA FOR ARMENIA LIKE QARABAGH? IS ORTHODOX RUSSIA ALLY OF GEORGIA? WHY DO WESTERN CHURCHES (PROTESTANT, CATHOLIC, ETC.) FROM EUROPE AND USA GIVE NICE MESSAGES FOR GEORGIA? IS IT BEACUE OF GEORGIAN'S BEAUTIFUL FOLK DANCES OR CUISINE? OF COURSE NO! THEIR AIM IS TO CONVERT GEORGIAN NATION TO THEIR OWN PERSONAL 'CHRISTIANITIES' LIKE PROTESTANT, CATHOLIC, EVANGELIST, PRESBYTARIAN, BAPTIST, ETC... IN FACT THEY DO NOT LIKE AND HAVE NO TOLERANCE ON GEORGIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH... THEY WISH TO MAKE IT A SATELLITE OF THEIR COMPLETELY PERSONAL CHRISTIANITIES... THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT GEORGIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH'S ANCIENT HISTORY. THEY JUST CARE ABOUT 'HOW CAN WE MAKE THOSE PEOPLE OUR SLAVES?' SLAVES OF OUR CAPITALISM, OF OUR CHURCH COMPANIES...

<p>Macahel, the flag was adopted by the Supreme Council of Adjara democratically elected by the region's population in 2004. What do you mean by "illegal and unlawful"? I'm also interested if you have citizenship of Georgia. If not, then why have you decided that you have a right to judge its status? Take care to answer.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 14:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As we know, Adjara has an international autonomy according to Article VI of Treaty of Kars. The basic reason of autonomy is Muslim People and their religious, cultural rights. So, is this flag conform this autonomy? You know the meaning of cross that exists in this flag very well. As a result it is unlawful, according to international Treaty of Kars! I'm also interested if you are Ajarian and Muslim Georgian? If not, where does your interested in Adjara come from? As a historical meaning, I'm Ajarian and Muslim Georgian as ethnic. Furthermore there is an international Treaty related autonomy. I hope, now you can understand the right to judge! --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacahel_99d9.html" title="User:Macahel">Macahel</a> 15:32, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Macahel, please read my question more carefully. I'm not asking about your religion, but about your citizenship. I'm not Muslim.

<dd>As you guess, I'm not citizen of Georgia. I have Turkish citizenship and I'm Ajarian(as a historical meaning) and Muslim Georgian as ethnic. But you are not Ajarian and not Muslim Georgian.

<li>The first point is being an Ajarian! Of course everybody has right to take interest in Adjara or Ajaristan! But if one has a special interest, like you (you behave as if unique owner of the article of Ajaristan, moreover land of Ajaristan!), other may ask this question, like me. Yes it is true that Ajaristan is a part of Georgia as a result of Treaty of Kars (had been signed between Turkey and Georgia and other border countries), but it is also a fact that Ajaristan has an international autonomy, based on Treaty of Kars. I think you know also content of the autonomy! And it is clear that current flag of Ajaristan violates its international autonomy (i.e. Treaty of Kars)!--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacahel_99d9.html" title="User:Macahel">Macahel</a> 16:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Listen Macahel. I'm getting weird your accusations. You're not the right person to decide whether this flag violates the Adjarian autonomy or not. There are many thousands of people of Georgian background around the world, but I don't think that all of them have right to interfere in what is defined by the law of Georgia and its subnational enitity. I'm ready to discuss with you any issues related to Adjara, but the removal of the flag is unjustifiable.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 16:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I know you don't enjoy this fact... But the autonomy of Ajaristan is an international autonomy. It is not only defined by the law of Georgia, but also and especially by Treaty of Kars, which Georgia is a signatory... Therefore the Treaty of Kars is also a part of law of Georgia.

<p><b>Ajaria (Georgia)</b></p>
<p><i><b>Presentation of Ajaria</b></i></p>
<p>Name: Ajarian (or Adzharian) Autonomous Republic</p>
<p>Location: Georgia</p>
<p>Status: Constituent part of Georgia.</p>
<p>Notes: The Ajarian ASSR was created in 1921, largely for political reasons. Firstly, it prevented the Georgians from exercising full control over the port of Batumi, and served to encourage supposedly pro-Communist elements amongst Ajaris (or "Lazis") living on the Turkish side of the border.</p>
<p>Stuart Notholt, 28 May 1995</p>
<p>Quoting Rudolf A. Mark - Die Völker der ehemaligen Sowjetunion:</p>
<p>The Ajar (selfname: Adzareli; Russ.: Adzarcy) are a Georgian ethnic group at the south-eastern coast of the Black Sea. They became Christians in the IVth century and got part of the Kingdom of Georgia in the IXth century. Since the middle of the XVIth century they have been under the rule of the Turks, who Islamized the Ajar. The Ajar were integrated into the Russian Empire in 1878. [...] The language of the Ajar is an east Caucasian language.The writing language is Georgian. The Ajar are Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>Jean-Patrick Fischer, 23 July 2004</p>
<hr />
<p><i><b>Flag of Ajaria</b></i></p>
<p>Interfax Agency announced (20 July 2004, 22:20) that the Supreme Council (Parliament) of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic (Georgia) at the first session on Tuesday on 20 July 2004 had ratified a new flag of the autonomous republic. The flag has seven dark blue and white stripes, and in the upper corner the national flag of Georgia with the five red crosses. The dark blue stripes symbolize the sea whereas the white stripes symbolize purity.</p>
<p>Mikhail Revnivtsev, 21 July 2004</p>
<p>Photographies of the flag can be seen on the Ajarian government website. The canton with the Georgian national flag stretches over three vertical stripes (and not over four or five stripes as it had been reported earlier).</p>
<p>Jens Pattke, 17 September 2006</p>
<p>Following the Rose Revolution and the overthrow of President Eduard Shevardnadze in November 2003 in Georgia, during which there was extensive use of the "five-cross flag", which became official after the accession of the new President Mikhail Saakashvili, there was a nationalist movement toward unification of the diverse regions. During the subsequent May 2004 protests against their leader Aslan Abashidze, Ajarians also used the five-cross flag. Abashidze was then overthrown in what many considered a "Rose Revolution" of their own. Saakashvili was welcomed, and Ajaria was reunited with Georgia. So it will hardly be surprising that Ajarians decided to place the five-cross flag in their canton. Unlike most of predominantly Christian Georgia, however, Adjaria is majority Muslim. So it is notable how Adjarians have adopted the five-cross flag as their own, even incorporating it into their regional flag. This is only to emphasize that the flag, despite its crosses, has a nationalist rather than a religious meaning to Georgians.</p>
<p>Richard Knipel, 21 July 2004</p>
<hr />
<p><i><b>Problems with the new flag</b></i></p>
<p>BatumiNews (page no longer online) reports a failed attempt to hoist the new flqg of Ajaria in the village of Gonio.</p>
<p>An attempt of hoisting the so-called "five-cross flag" failed in Gonio, while a group of certain forces were trying hard to reach the top of the Village Council of Gonio. The group members, quite a few though, besides the attempt of hoisting the flag, urged for the change of the Ajara Autonomous Republic Government. As was reported, the local population stymied the process, another version goes as law enforcers of the Ajara Autonomous Republic intervened with the gang of squabblers. BatumiNews contacted for the comment press service of the Ajara Autonomous Republic Ministry of Interior. David Gergedava, chief of the press service ruled out any foray on behalf of the law enforcement structures. "The squabble took place among the local population and the group which tried to hoist the flag of the Nationals". The population was compelled by the brute force of destabilizes. The camera belonging to Rustavi 2 was dispossessed temporarily, though the cameraman gained it back through the police assistance.</p>

<dd>Im sorry but islamization of some Ajarians and Lazs by force is a historic fact. Ottoman savagery towards Armenian and Georgian Christians has been well documented and known throughout various sources and documents (by both western and armeno-georgian scholars). Almost all of the churches in former Georgian territory of Tao-Klarjeti has been destroyed by Turks. Georgian bible was banned in Artvin (former Artvini) and all Christian ceremonies where also banned in all Georgian and Armenian churches. Some of the Tao churches have been converted into the garbage dumps by the Turks. These are just very few examples of non tolerance towards Christians. Ottoman plunder and genocidal warfare against Christian Georgians can not even be disputed as it is a solid historic fact as Holocaust was. Turks forced Ajarians and Lazs to make a choice: adopt Islam or perish. Armenians had similar choice, and we all know what happened. To deny as such, is a sure POV.<a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 16:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>All of your claims are false and big lies that produced by some marginal Orthodoxes, especially Armenians. The historical Churches in Artvin clearly deny your marginal assertions! These are enough to show the facts! Ottoman was the greatest and strongest state in its period.

They also know, in which meaning the "somexi" is used in speaking. Kober, don't misrepresent the issue of flag.. I remove the flag of government of Ajaristan, because Ajaristan has a religious autonomy! The government of Saakasvil and its designated government of Ajaristan violates this autonomy with this flag.

</dl>
<p>Macahel's assertion that the flag "violates Adjara's autonomy" is completely irrelevant to the article - that's his personal point of view and prohibited from inclusion per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, two of our most fundamental editing policies.</p>
<p>As for Macahel's other "contribution" to the debate, he appears to be having an edit war over on the Turkish Wikipedia as well. There are now two separate (forked) articles at <a href="../../../../tr/a/c/a/Acara.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Acara">tr:Acara</a> and <a href="../../../../tr/a/c/a/Acaristan.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Acaristan">tr:Acaristan</a>. Obviously this is beyond my ability to resolve but I think we need to settle on which version we link to. I would guess that the Acara article (with flag) is more likely to be accurate than the "Acaristan" article (without flag), which Macahel appears to have mutilated. I note that Macahel hasn't provided any evidence that it's still called "Acaristan" by anyone. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear ChrisO, there is no doubt, the flag is in official use. But Ajaristan has an autonomy and it is clearly related to the article! I think, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, not an official enyclopedia. "Acaristan" is the Ottomanish-Turkish name of the autonomy republic. And the flag can not be a criterion for linking. There are several other versions that don't include this flag!

Macahel should answer this question first of all: Who are Adjarians? We see, is this answer a same answer in both Turkish and English wikies, or not?

<p>Do forgive me all for not knowing such things, but I have just noticed the ethnic structure of Adjara as it is on the infobox. Can someone tell me, was <i>Adjaran</i> ever used as an ethnicity/natioanlity? Or did the majority always identify as Georgian? <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 17:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They always identified themselves to the Georgian nation as they always have been. The boundaries were drawn due to religious conviction; otherwise there are no differences between them and Gurians (another Georgian sub-group living near by).

<dd>Quotation from article:"The Georgian population of Adjara had been generally known as "Muslim Georgians" until the 1926 Soviet census which listed them as "Ajars" and counted 71,000 of them. Later, they were simply classified under a broader category of Georgians as no official Soviet census asked about religion". It is clear that Ajars are separate ethnic group as they always have been! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacahel_99d9.html" title="User:Macahel">Macahel</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacahel_47d2.html" title="User talk:Macahel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Macahel_6159.html" title="Special:Contributions/Macahel">contribs</a>) 16:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li>Adjarian Autonomous Republic or Ajarian Autonomous Republic (both: əjär`ēən), formerly Adzhar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (əjär`) or Adzharistan (əjär'ĭstän`, əjär`ĭstăn'), autonomous region (1990 pop. 382,600), c.1,160 sq mi (3,000 sq km), SW Georgia, on the Black Sea, bordering Turkey on the south. The capital is Batumi. Mountainous and forested, the region has a subtropical climate, and there are many health resorts. Tobacco, tea, citrus fruits, and avocados are leading crops; livestock raising is also important. Industries include tea packing, tobacco processing, fruit and fish canning, oil refining, and shipbuilding. <b>The Adjars or Ajars, a mainly Muslim people of the South Caucasian linguistic family, constitute the bulk of the population; the remainder are Georgians, Armenians, Russians, and Greeks.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Colonized by Greek merchants in the 5th and 4th cent. B.C., the region later came under Roman rule and after the 9th cent. A.D. was part of Georgia. The Turks conquered the area in the late 17th and early 18th cent. and introduced Islam. Acquired by Russia in 1878, the region became an autonomous republic of Georgia in 1921. In 1991 it became an autonomous republic of the newly independent state of Georgia. Subsequently, the region became increasingly independent of the Georgian central government, leading to a crisis (2004) in which Georgia reasserted its supremacy and forced Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze into exile.</p>
