<p>I'd have to agree with the comment that this page, for all its content, lacks motivation. Put it another way, such feeling as I have for the adjunction concept didn't come from reading this sort of account. It is more difficult to know exactly what to do about it. The sort of example that might help is the way implication in logic can be defined (introduced) as an adjoint. (But it depends on your background.)</p>

<p>Hmmm - generalised inverses - I'd have to say my understanding of the concept improved when I <i>stopped</i> trying to use this as an intuition.</p>

<p>Why the plural in the title? I realize that two functions are adjoints to each other, but the term can also be used in the singular: This functor is the adjoint of that functor. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:26, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FWIW, I came here typing "adjoint functors" in the search box. For singular, I would have typed "left adjoint" or "right adjoint f." <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 20:50, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Plural is better, really. Pair of adjoint functors is a fuller version. <i>Left adjoint</i> or <i>right adjoint</i> is OK; but 'adjoint functor' on its own is a bit like 'scissor', IMO. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 15:51, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC) See also <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stilts.html" title="Stilts">stilts</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a></p>

<dd>It is a little bit different, in that adjoint functors have a built-in asymmetry that scissors or stilts don't have...but agreed that left adjoint and right adjoint should still just redirect here. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:38, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adamek, Herrlich, and Strecker give a definition of "adjoint functor" and "co-adjoint functor", but I think these are just names for "left adjoint" and "right adjoint" (or the other way around), curiously, they don't bother to mention the relation to the usual left/right adjoint terminology. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:35, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like an explanation of the notation in <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjoint_functors.html#Formal_definitions" title="Adjoint functors">Adjoint functors#Formal_definitions</a>.

<p>Not really. <i>Mor</i> for <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphism.html" title="Morphism">morphism</a> is more correct, pedantically speaking, but I suppose <i>Hom</i> for <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homomorphism.html" title="Homomorphism">homomorphism</a> is very common. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 20:26, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed from "Mor" to "hom" on the category pages just because that's the most widely used (e.g. Mac Lane, the standard reference). In an ideal world, "Mor" would have become the standard notation, but somehow that didn't happen. Both are common...once you're aware they mean the same thing, it shouldn't be confusing. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:42, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometimes, certainly, but I think it can be overwhelming to present too much information at once. Footnotes give an easy way for people to skip the extraneous stuff on a first read. Most importantly, for example for this remark it isn't obvious why John Conway is mentioned (out of other mathematicians), nor what part of his work is being referred to. From what I know about abstract algebra and John Conway, I can imagine that he would prefer a synthetic rather than analytic approach to defining things - but this only helps me understand what the comment might be talking about, I don't actually learn anything new by reading it. I see a lot of comments like this in the maths sections of Wikipedia which read like they were written by someone who was more interested in showing off his or her own knowledge, than in communicating something useful to readers. <a href="../../../a/5/_/User%7EA5_333e.html" title="User:A5">A5</a> 15:23, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're missing the point, or perhaps you didn't read all of what I wrote above. I'm certainly not opposed to <i>helpful</i> comments which <i>communicate</i> useful information to the reader. These can even be tangential; and can talk about mathematicians and their work, as this one tries to. What I'm opposed to is comments that mention facts without indicating why they are true, where they came from, why they are relevant, why they are more relevant than other things, etc. It's true that such useless comments often happen to be tangential, but that's not what makes them useless. <a href="../../../a/5/_/User%7EA5_333e.html" title="User:A5">A5</a> 21:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So we blitz all that: <i>facts without indicating why they are true, where they came from, why they are relevant, why they are more relevant than other things, etc.</i>. And whenever <i>anyone</i> says 'that's not relevant', we have to cut it out. How much supporting material would we be left with? Actually, we'd be left with the kind of treatment there is on PlanetMath. Written largely for grad students, by grad students.</dd>

<dd>I have never believed that this kind of treatment is appropriate for WP. Of course we can include (mathematical) facts without indicating why they are true. Every mathematical encyclopedia does that. This is not a textbook effort. Wikibooks does that. The kind of supporting comments, in detail, is of course negotiable. But the principle that articles aren't purely logic-driven expositions is not. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:27, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's look at the comment in question: "(This is favoured, for example, by John Conway.)" Where does John Conway favor it? Why? Who else favors it, and why did you pick John Conway? Is he part of a broader school of thought? Did he write some book which advocates defining rings constructively? Obviously devoting a paragraph to John Conway in the middle of this article is a bad idea, but you don't have to do that. Just another sentence would be enough. Put it into context. As it stands, you annoy two kinds of readers. You annoy the readers who just want to learn about adjoints, and not anything else. And you annoy the readers who are interested in the cultural context as well, by telling them a dangling fact which they can't easily follow up on, in a form which they can't easily pass on to others.</dd>

<dd>Personally, I would advocate deleting it, and moving it to the talk page, but not because I think it can't be turned into a useful remark - rather, because I don't know how to make it useful, and given that the author seems unwilling to make it useful himself, I'm inclined to question how important it was in the first place. <a href="../../../a/5/_/User%7EA5_333e.html" title="User:A5">A5</a> 15:57, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Baez defines in q-alg/9609018 2Hilb to be the <a href="../../../2/-/c/2-category.html" title="2-category">2-category</a> of all 2-Hilbert spaces, defining a 2-Hilbert space to be a category with zero object (like the zero vector in Hilbert space), coproducts (vector sums in Hilbert space) (this is like scalar multiplication by complexes. Instead you have tensor multiplication by Hilbert spaces), cokernels (vector differences), a Hilb-module (a module category over Hilb, the category of all (finite-dim?) Hilbert spaces), and an enriched category over Hilb along with a *-morphism over the hom-sets (the inner product of two vectors should live in C). OK, that sounds like a lot of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_nonsense.html" title="Abstract nonsense">abstract nonsense</a>, but then, Hilbert spaces have a lot of structures, and they all have to be categorified. The upshot? Any Hilbert space makes a (2-Hilbert space) category whose objects are the vectors and whose morphisms are the amplitudes between vectors, and adjoint maps between two Hilbert spaces are adjoint functors of the corresponding categories. The other way, one can say that if two morphisms in 2Hilb, that is, two functors between 2-Hilbert spaces, are adjoint functors, then they induce adjoint linear operators on each hom-set. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 16:39, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that the category of 2-Hilbert spaces is actually a 2-category doesn't seem to be too important for just understand when adjoint functors are adjoint maps. I think he does that as part of his n-category quantization program. Anyway, I think I will try to distill some of the easier parts of the paper and make an article here.

<p>Let's walk through this then. <i>The monoid ring construction gives a functor from monoids to rings. This functor is left adjoint to the functor that associates to a given ring its underlying multiplicative monoid.</i></p>

<dd>Hom<sub>monoid</sub>(M,R)= Hom<sub>ring</sub>(Z[M],R).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yup. You tell me where m in M goes, either way, equally good. You are correct that it is the integral version of monoid ring/group ring; you can get a group algebra version with appropriate algebras instead of rings.

<dd>If that italicized bit is a quote from MacLane-Birkhoff, then the article definitely needs a citation so that the reader can, in theory, go back to the source and determine what assumptions the authors make. In this case, they seem to be using a convention that if the ring is unspecified, it is understood to be Z by default. I don't think that's standard, and if we're going to assume the convention here, then it has to be noted at least in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoid_ring.html" title="Monoid ring">Monoid ring</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_ring.html" title="Group ring">Group ring</a>, with citations there too. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 16:42, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well no, the italicised bit is a quote from the <i>page</i>, here. This is getting too pedantic for me. I'll make it integral group ring and monoid ring. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 16:49, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let us note the strange (crossed) arrangement of primes on variables: in case of <i>f</i> it is reversed (compared to the case of <i>g</i>).</p>
<p>Now we build an interesting thing in the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/d/d/7dd6a6b7e635ba885176cc7cc2a8155f.png" alt="\mathcal{SET}" /> category out of all these above <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/8/c/98c20e34c90ebe87fa78ddb2b83977fd.png" alt="\mathcal{C}" />-things:</p>

<p>Now the strange, “crossed” arrangement of primes does not look so strange any more — the construction has showed the main point.</p>
<p>I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adjoint_functors&amp;diff=79617282&amp;oldid=77744954" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adjoint_functors&amp;diff=79617282&amp;oldid=77744954" rel="nofollow">5 Oct2006 contribution</a> (that has made the strange “crossed” arrangement of primes “straight”) was benevolent and (in a sense) logical, but erranous.</p>

<p>Thank You for having corrected it. Now, the above argumentation of mine has lost its original purpose. By the way, is my above argumentation correct at all? I do not really understand much to category theory, The above things are just my conjecture based upon esthetical consideration — I have not proven it. I suppose the answer lies in the article <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hom_functor.html" title="Hom functor">Hom functor</a>…</p>

<dd>Yes, your argument is essentially correct. Thanks for pointing out the mistaken edit. In fancy language one can say that the Hom functor Hom(-,-) is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second. Hence the funny arrangement of the primes. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 03:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
