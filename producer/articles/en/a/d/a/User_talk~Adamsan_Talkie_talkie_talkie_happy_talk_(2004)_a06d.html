<dd>Hi again. I just came across your edits at <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Hancock_c42c.html" title="Graham Hancock">Graham Hancock</a>. Wikipedia policy is to go to considerable lengths to avoid putting external links in the body of an article. If referring, for instance, to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, one would link to the <i>Wikipedia article</i> on Google, which contains the link to the company's website. Thus, I think it would be best if you relocated all of the external links to =External links=.

<dd>I'm glad you've joined us, we certainly need more archaeologists (or at even just more critical thinkers come to think of it)- the prime source for some contributors appears to be <i>The Big Arthurian Book of Celtic Ley Line Mysteries (now with extra ancient wisdom)</i>. My favourite find so far as been the definition of a henge as 'a palaeolithic solar declinometer'. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 20:29, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I note you're an archeologist, so all due deference to you. My area is the written word. Is there a technical reason for your insertion of <i>site</i> after <i>stone circle</i>? As a trained journalist I tend to baulk at unnecessary words, and I would say 'site' is evident, ie surplus to requirements. I'm more curious about it than caring. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 21:13, May 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Botnotbod, I felt the earlier text implied that a henge and a stone circle are the same thing. By changing 'henge or stone circle' to 'henge and stone circle' I felt this made the difference clearer. Adding 'site' seemed to be more natural as it supports the implicit meaning that the henge and the stones although separate, constitute the 'site' of the Avebury monument. English Heritage's online thesaurus of <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus/mon_types/default.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus/mon_types/default.htm" rel="nofollow">heritage terms</a> gives good concise definitions of henge and stone circle and I have used it as the basis for my rewrites of the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henge.html" title="Henge">henge</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_circle.html" title="Stone circle">stone circle</a> entries. I agree that unnecessary verbosity should be avoided but felt that the distinction needed to made as it is common mistake to confuse the two, both on Wikipedia and elsewhere.</dd>

<p>The disk has only just begun to attract the kind of speculation that hangs over Stonehenge, but uneasiness about the circumstances of its recovery have focused on the following weaknesses: " <i><a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 22:38, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry Wetman I cant't let that pass. You have reverted to the previous POV article and are presenting theory as fact. There is no secure provenence for the disc and therefore to call it a record of the earliest observatory recorded and a Bronze Age artefact is misleading when it may well be a fake. The Scientific American article appears to be about a different site altogether and that is why I removed it. The whole thing is POV and demands a rewrite.</dd>

<p>Hi. My edits to the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henge.html" title="Henge">henge</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> articles were in aid of pointing out that the Neolithics probably didn't use the word "henge" to describe what they were building, so our use of the word for a specific type of monument is an artificial classification on our part. It is a perfectly lovely classification which I don't have a problem with, but I wouldn't want people to think that we are saying that we somehow know Neolithic/Bronze farmers <i>themselves</i> called one style of bank and ditch monument a "henge" and another, differently ditched, monument something else. There are all sorts of variations on the bank/ditch theme with these monuments, inner ditch, outer ditch, double ditch, etc., enough to almost make one think it was a function of local fashion. I probably wasn't as clear about the whole thing as I should have been, and have been re-thinking it since as probably too obvious a point. Any amendation to that theme you would care to make is fine with me. Cheers, <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 19:57, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you think it might be a good idea to create a List of Ancient sites in the United Kingdom article, or something along those lines. I was considering it. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 13:56, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Nickshanks. Could you explain what you're doing with the archaeology categories? The British archaeology category covers a wide variety of topics; sites, cultures, tools, archaeologists etc. I hope that it will become a useful introduction to the subject. If you wish to add sites to an Archaeological sites in Britain category, please do not delete the other listings without explaining. Cheers <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 18:01, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, yes it's quite simple, I'm separating out the sites from the general 'roman britain' type entries. I am putting them into a category who's name conforms to the format the rest of Wikipedia uses for archaeological sites, and making that a subcategory of both british archaeology and archaeological sites by country. This improved categorisation will take a while to complete, so please be patient. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickshanks_6da8.html" title="User:Nickshanks">Nicholas</a> 18:04, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think I'm done now. Could you look through <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_archaeology_bb1a.html" title="Category:British archaeology">British archaeology</a> and verify all sites have been moved into British archaeology &gt; Sites. I also created a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_sites_in_Scotland_7717.html" title="Category:Roman sites in Scotland">Roman sites in Scotland</a> category since one didn't exist. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickshanks_6da8.html" title="User:Nickshanks">Nicholas</a> 19:32, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Cool, nice work. I suppose <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorvik.html" title="Jorvik">Jorvik</a> could be separated out as a site as well as a tourist attraction and <a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey_Holes_74b8.html" title="Aubrey Holes">Aubrey Holes</a> are an element of Stonehenge so might be more comfortable in the sites category. I'll take out <a href="../../../v/o/t/Votadini.html" title="Votadini">Votadini</a> from the sites list as they were a tribe. Great stuff though and I will start adding to your scheme from now on. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 20:18, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I looked at Jorvik, but decided not to move it because it didn't really seem like a 'site', just the Norse name for York. I have subsequently been thinking about amalgamating the <i>Roman sites in England/Scotland/Wales</i> categories into their parent <i>Roman sites in Britain</i> category, as I don't think Wales and Scotland have enough sites to warrant their own subcategory. It seems unnecessary, what do you think? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickshanks_6da8.html" title="User:Nickshanks">Nicholas</a> 20:23, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've just found <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_sites_in_the_United_Kingdom_a4fa.html" title="Roman sites in the United Kingdom">Roman sites in the United Kingdom</a> which lists a few and which I guess will need incorporating somehow into the new system. As for Jorvik, I suppose it depends on your definition of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeological_site.html" title="Archaeological site">archaeological site</a> which I had a go defining a while back - could it go in both categories as it is certainly something that has been archaeologically investigated? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 21:02, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Well I'll leave it up to you to decide upon, as you're better placed than I am to make such calls. I'll move on for the time being. Find another corner of Wikipedia to spring clean&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickshanks_6da8.html" title="User:Nickshanks">Nicholas</a> 21:12, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll put my name down as a contributor; I've mainly studied classical archaeology, and have worked a couple of places in Greece, so I should be able to contribute something there. My studies and work also included general principles of archaeology, of course. Also, since I've been working with Roman and Anglo-Saxon Britain, I should be able to write something sensible about that. <a href="../../../c/n/y/User%7ECnyborg_49e4.html" title="User:Cnyborg">Cnyborg</a> 15:25, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
