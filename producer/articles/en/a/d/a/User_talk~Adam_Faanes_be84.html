<p>Hi there. I saw your note on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_user_log_052c.html" title="Wikipedia:New user log">new user log</a>. I'm sure we can use contributions on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Africa_008d.html" title="History of Africa">history of Africa</a> - there's a lot of history, and not many people study it compared to European history. If you're interested in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>, there's a lot to write over there, too. By the way, you don't need to stop working on a section just because someone else knows more than you about it. If each article had to wait for the Wikipedian best qualified to write it, we'd never get anything done. Besides, wiki is a collaboration. Each person does what they can on an article, and the sum is better than any of us could do alone. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 18:13, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Adam, re <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_League_a76d.html" title="Muslim League">Muslim League</a>. I apologise for my peremptory note last night. I was a bit annoyed when I went to save my article to discover what had been an empty space two hours previously had been filled while I was writing. I assumed that someone had seen Danny's request at my <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Carr_3b1b.html" title="User talk:Adam Carr">User talk:Adam Carr</a> and decided to write the article just to annoy me, as sometimes happens. It is unusual for someone to create a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_link.html" title="Dead link">dead link</a> and ask someone else to write a piece to fill it, so you don't usually need to check. I certainly don't want to discourage historians at Wikipedia, particularly ones called Adam. You are perfectly free to edit my article, as you are free to edit any article, and there is some material in your version which is not in mine, so you are welcome to add it. I think you need to watch the <i>tone</i> of your writing though. It is not considered <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> to talk about "the excesses and duplicities of British rule" or describe people as "excellent poet and philosopher" or say that Jinnah "cheerfully and nobly accepted the duties of office". Also it is not true to say "the Muslim League became the key political party in government for several decades, and has remained so to the present day." But we can debate these matters when edit the article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 22:54, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding you recent comments on talk:Spanish empire:</p>
<p>I am very interested in improving the History of Spain pages. Although I am a scientist by training I have a keen interest in History. One of the things I try to do with the History of Spain articles is try to pull them away from "traditional" historiography (the Catholic kings were great, the reconquista was a crusade...). Maybe we could try to work together on this.</p>
<p>The bottom-up approach (from the particular to the general) is already taken care of by the wiki model, in that people can write topical articles about whatever they feel like which can later be folded into or coordinated with more general history articles. However, I find that a lot of general articles are not terribly consistent with the topical articles, and there's some work to be done there.</p>
<p>I would like to take a top-down approach, starting with the =History= section of the Spain article, which is really sketchy and actually out of sync with the History of Spain article in its emphasis. I added a couple of paragraphs about preroman Spain to the section, but a lot of work is needed still, and you seem to have a lot of the necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Inevitably the =Histoy= section will get too large for the Spain article. Then it should be refactored, summarized and the excess material put into the History of Spain article. If some of the sections get too large, they can in turn be refactored and the excess material moved to topical articles, etc. In particular, an article on Al-Andalus is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>What do you think? You could start by looking at the =History= section of the Spain article. — <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_74e3.html" title="User:Miguel">Miguel</a> 01:28, 2004 Apr 7 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's start work on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html#History" title="Spain">Spain#History</a>. The section is already rather long. I think the hardest part will be to summarize the swhole history in a few sentences when the time comes to move the content to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html" title="History of Spain">History of Spain</a> — <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_74e3.html" title="User:Miguel">Miguel</a> 04:50, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for adding great images to articles! Note that <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old_4083.html" title="Template:PD-old">Template:PD-old</a> specifies "Author died more than 100 years ago", apparently the last time limit for an old image or work to be clearly PD worldwide. Note that this is dependant on the date of the death of the creator of the work, not the date of the work -- for example a photograph from 1904 is not yet PD-old if the photographer was still alive in 1950. The "PD" tag seems better for old public domain images that don't fit this strict cretiera. (Note that anything pre-1923 can safely be tagged as "PD-US".)

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Bob Bullock.jpg</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use</a>.

<p>Hi Adam Faanes, it seems that every other Wikipedia article on the Spanish Armada is using the image that you originally uploaded to the English Wikipedia (and which was later copied to the Commons)!&#160;:o) As I saw that it was still pretty poorly labeled there, I'm trying to improve that... and given that it's such a widely used image, I thought it might be worth trying to really track things down&#160;;o) ... So I'm asking you: Under which name did you originally save it? (Unfortunately, the user who uploaded it to the Commons didn't indicate that.) Oddly, I can't find anything in your contributions or anywhere else. It may have been deleted as it's on the Commons... And do you remember from which source you've uploaded it? I mean, there's no doubt it's public domain, I just wondered if you happen to remember... If you don't or prefer not to indicate it, well, obviously no big deal!
