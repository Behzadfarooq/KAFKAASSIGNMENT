<li>RC Patrolling is not a contest, vandals won't "win" anyway, that sounds a bit childish.

<li>Fix your grammar and spelling. I know it seems like a small issue, but the way you write says a lot about yourself. I have opposed other candidates before because of this. It seems like a small issue, but I don't want to see you dragged down in your next RfA because of this.

<li>Understand that adminship isn't a shiny badge- it's a tool given to users who help out the Wiki. I waited nearly a year from my first edit until I was nominated, at which time I had over 1,000 article edits, and nearly 3,000 edits overall (more than is normally needed, but it's always good to have more.) While I know adminship is no big deal, and stress this regularly, I think that more vandalism-fighting, and more original edits would go a long way toward helping out the Wiki, and thereby giving you more credibility on RFA. (On a similar note, I would refuse any new RFAs for at least 3 months, probably closer to 6 months. This way, it doesn't seem like you're trying specifically for adminship.) <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 19:43, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Try working on article-editing processes, rather than just vandal-fighting to have a more all-rounded experience on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 18:21, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Think more about how your comments may appear to come across to people reading them (and I don't just mean for RFA). e.g From the RFA "and for now you should be in #wikipedia-en-vandalism2" comes across as either an order or suggesting that the other editor (me in that case) is somehow at fault. "Thanks for mentioning them you saved me the time of having to make a link (0.5 secs)", to me comes across as patronising. Also your response FreakOfNurture showed two things (1) you didn't understand Cynicals point and (2) was "attacking", sure people complain of editcountitis in RFAs but it's not such a great idea for the candidate to do so in such a direct manner --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 21:34, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not a race, take your time and do things right (and this ties up a bit with the one above). e.g. "I was replying to so many things that I just forgot to sign some of them.", you acknowledge it isn't an excuse, but it seems to suggest you weren't being careful. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 21:34, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Punctuation.</b> I know this ties up with GregAsche's comment about spelling and grammar, but sometimes a lack of punctuation in your comments makes them ambiguous and difficult to understand. For example, and I quote you, "One oppose for edit count reason high one.... next its not that high oppose". You might be able to understand that, but it is difficult for others to understand the meaning of it on the first read. It needs rewording and the addition of commas to make it clearer. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaverocks_009d.html" title="User:Daverocks">Daverocks</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaverocks_3410.html" title="User talk:Daverocks">talk</a>) 00:44, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Try and see the wood, and not the trees. Look at the bigger picture, rather than asking for specific points. Knowing when <b>not</b> to do something is just as important as doing stuff <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 10:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I said on your RFA, many of your policy beliefs are flawed. You should read over these again, and try to understand the meaning of them- why they were enacted, and when they should be used.

<dd>Adam, you already have been quizzed on Wikipedia policy in the questions on your RfA, and your answers show your policy beliefs are flawed.

<dd><i>"Being an administrator requires a knowledge of Wikipedia policy, which I don't believe Adam1213 has. His mention of "Google rankings" on question #6 about WP:CSD shows a fundamental misunderstanding about speedy deletion. His answer to question #9 shows that he doesn't understand consensus, a</i> pivotal <i>part of being an administrator. His answer to question #10 is horribly wrong- WP:IAR has many different interpretations, none of which fit with his."</i> -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaverocks_009d.html" title="User:Daverocks">Daverocks</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaverocks_3410.html" title="User talk:Daverocks">talk</a>) 00:51, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
