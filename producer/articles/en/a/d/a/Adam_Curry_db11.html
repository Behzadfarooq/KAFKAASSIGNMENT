<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, before the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>, in the days of <a href="../../../g/o/p/Gopher_%28protocol%29.html" title="Gopher (protocol)">Gopher</a>, Curry began experimenting on the Net. He registered the then-unclaimed <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_name.html" title="Domain name">domain name</a> "mtv.com" in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Although sanctioned by <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_Networks_05f9.html" title="MTV Networks">MTV Networks</a>, when Adam left to start his company OnRamp, MTV sued him for the domain name, which led to an out-of-court settlement.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Curry left MTV in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> and founded OnRamp, Inc., a Web design and hosting company. He eventually grew the company to 40 employees and sold it to THINK New Ideas, Inc., another company that he co-founded. He became <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Technology_Officer_6a0a.html" title="Chief Technology Officer">Chief Technology Officer</a> of THINK. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, as the Internet was undergoing its legendary "bubble", the company made an <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_public_offering.html" title="Initial public offering">initial public offering</a> on <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASDAQ_7dfd.html" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> under the ticker symbol THNK.

He pursued his radio and television career by presenting a morning talk/music show for his former employer, Veronica Radio, which was discontinued in September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. He carried out several loose television assignments and his family briefly starred in the reality soap <i>Adam's Family</i>. <sup id="_ref-imdb-title-tt0386908_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imdb-title-tt0386908" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Curry and two business partners founded the multimedia company United Resources of Jamby in 1999. It was to act as an incubator and cultivator for new Internet-related businesses. The business was unsuccessful. The participation in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennisnet.html" title="Kennisnet">Kennisnet</a>, a venture to introduce Internet to Dutch schools ended in a bitter argument and lawsuits over incorrect European invitation to tender.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Sportus.nl, an online webshop in cooperation with Dutch sporters like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Wouda_599f.html" title="Marcel Wouda">Marcel Wouda</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacco_Eltingh_7c3b.html" title="Jacco Eltingh">Jacco Eltingh</a>, Ron Zwerver and Daniëlle Overgaag, started in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, went bankrupt in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.<sup id="_ref-sportusdotnl-nieuwe-sportwinkel-mikt-op-europese-markt_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sportusdotnl-nieuwe-sportwinkel-mikt-op-europese-markt" title="">[4]</a></sup> And a prestigious content exchange project called Freedom Controller<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> was cancelled in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> he and his business partner Simon Cavendish, who had also participated in his earlier ventures, founded the RotorJet company which was to offer helicopter services to a select audience. The company went bankrupt in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. In a subsequent dispute, Cavendish (formerly known as Michael Jackson<sup id="_ref-dutch-legal-document_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dutch-legal-document" title="">[7]</a></sup>) seized the assets of the company. In April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Adam Curry was ordered by the Dutch Court to restitute approximately two million American dollars which he had illegitimately withdrawn from RotorJet.<sup id="_ref-dutch-legal-document_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dutch-legal-document" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the Curry family, who had resided in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> since 1999, moved their home to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

<p>On July 2, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Adam's mother, Valerie Gail Clark (Breezy), died after a 2-year battle with cancer.<sup id="_ref-currydotcom-dsc-for-mom_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-currydotcom-dsc-for-mom" title="">[8]</a></sup>During the same month, a younger cousin of Adam Curry, Timothy Curry, was arrested in Amsterdam for the possession of several illegal drugs.
