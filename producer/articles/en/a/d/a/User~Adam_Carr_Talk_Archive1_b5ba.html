<dd>Welcome! Just thought I'd let you know that there's an easier way of marking text as bold. Just use three inverted commas either side of the word, rather than &lt;b&gt;<b>and</b>&lt;/b&gt; tags.

Wow, we seem to have an Australian history section all of a sudden!

<p>Ahhh .... <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Australia_1eca.html" title="Culture of Australia">Culture of Australia</a>. On the whole, I think the most telling criticism of it is the one made by the first poster to the talk page - young feller named "Tannin", I think it was.&#160;;) It's a nice bit of ceative, more-or-less factual writing, and would sit quite well in a glossy Sunday magazine somewhere (you know: the sort of thing people carefully leave lying around the house in the hope that visitors will get the impression that the hosts don't actually read the sports page first). But as a 'pedia article, it's not relly appropriate. It's one of the very few entries I wrote "against my will". I'd only been here a couple of days, and Tim Starling, noticing my training, suggested that I write a "Culture of Australia" article because we didn't have one. Stupidly, I did. Seeing as Tim had asked for it, he had to be polite about it!</p>
<p>Oh, the missile defence thing, I nearly forgot. No, I'm afraid I know nothing about it. I haven't really kept current with aviation stuff this last year or so.</p>

<p>Hi Adam. With "History of Australian culture" you are indeed taking on a huge task! I'm afraid that I'm not going to take you up on your kind suggestion about Australian economic or environmental history. I've never studied Oz economic history (bar the stuff you pick up along the way looking at other things) and although I know enough environmental history to make a reasonable start (and am learning more as time allows) I'm mainly aiming to finish off some of the many things I have left lying around half completed in the 10 days or so I have before I take off on my 5-week trip up north.</p>
<p>Five weeks alone with a small car, a large camera, and as much wildlife as I can point a telescope at - bliss! Naturally, I'll be adding appropriate illustrations to the 'pedia when I get back. Birds are my #1 priority, but I'm interested in everything. I'll never get to everywhere I want to go, but the rough plan is to go up to Cape York via Broken Hill and Bourke, back via the coast. I'll be lucky to have time for half of that, but no matter. Cheers, <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>Hi, is Adolf_Hitler_2 a draft? <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 14:40, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note on Adolf Hitler 2</p>
<p>I have had several tries at editing <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, but I finally decided that it would be easier to write a whole new one. I know it is Wikipedia policy to "be bold in editing," but I am not sure if this extends to completely replacing a major article with a new one without any consultation. So I am posting it here Adolf Hitler 2, and readers can make up their own minds. If the Wikipedia powers-that-be decide to replace the current version with this version, fine; if they don't, also fine. I will place it as a link at my homepage and readers can have two Hitler articles to read.</p>
<p>I would, however, be opposed to anyone trying to amalgamate the two articles. My main criticisms of the original article are that it is incoherent and that its tone is inappropriate. These problems would only be perpetuated by creating a hybrid of the two articles. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Adam_Carr_8ba5.html" title="User:Dr Adam Carr">Dr Adam Carr</a> 14:51, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your concern. One solution would be to create a new page in your User talk: namespace, rather than the article namespace, e.g.:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>User talk:Dr Adam Carr/Candidate replacement for Adolf Hitler page</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you click on the above link it will be created, and just copy the text. Then put a link on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdolf_Hitler_3520.html" title="Talk:Adolf Hitler">Talk:Adolf Hitler</a> and perhaps on your main User page: <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Adam_Carr_8ba5.html" title="User:Dr Adam Carr">User:Dr Adam Carr</a> asking for comment and proposing it as a replacement. This way you don't have the confusion of two articles in the main article namespace, and the temporary page is clearly labelled as such. I think if the original page really stinks, then it won't be a problem with replacing it, but as Hitler is a controversial topic I see your concern. In any case, one can always revert the page to a previous state. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexor_1be7.html" title="User:Lexor">Lexor</a> 11:58, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Adam,</p>
<p>It's great to see how much the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="History of Australia">History of Australia</a> and other sections you're working on are coming along, adding some much needed respectability. Regarding your concerns about "permission", e.g.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Since Tim assures me that it is OK to rewrite this article, I have done so. Anyone who wants to argue with me about anything I have written is welcome to do so&#160;:) Dr Adam Carr 13 September 2003 (UTC)</i> (on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_Australia_276b.html" title="Talk:History of Australia">Talk:History of Australia</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Could someone who has the authority to do this change George Houston Reid to George Houstoun Reid? This is the correct spelling. Dr Adam Carr 11:22, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</i> (on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There really is nobody "in charge" (except for sysops who are elected themselves can protect pages and ban users from time to time, which is rare). There is no authority required or indeed, available, from anybody.</p>
<p>Don't worry about being timid with any updates, if you see something obviously wrong like mispelled pages etc., feel free to correct it, move the page (<a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page_3490.html" title="Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page">Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page</a>). Occasionally you may get somebody objecting, but it's rare, especially for the kinds of errors you're talking about and it's a normal part of Wikipedia in any case. I think Tim Starling may have already pointed this out to you, but it does pay to check them out: <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a> and especially <a href="../../../m/o/s/Wikipedia%7EMost_common_Wikipedia_faux_pas_a5bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Most common Wikipedia faux pas">Wikipedia:Most common Wikipedia faux pas</a>, particularly section #7.</p>
<p>Good luck, good to have you onboard. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexor_1be7.html" title="User:Lexor">Lexor</a> 11:47, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>It just seems to be the convention to list it that way (along with external links). Maybe it's because of the heading - having the indent just looks better. It's a <i>potential</i> list... --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 07:52, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice work on the UN page, complex subject with lots of facets. Are the materials on your personal web site released under the GFDL? Some of the travel photos and corresponding information might make a useful addition in places, we always need more photos of well known locations that are released under the GFDL.

<p>Regarding Goldhagen, I think the general consensus seems to be that what is good is not new, and what is new is not good. The fact that ordinary Germans were implicated in the holocaust is not a particularly new one. Certainly, Goldhagen makes this point. But so did Christopher Browning, with a lot more sophistication and a lot less self-promotion. But, in any event, I don't think it's that Goldhagen argues for <i>unique</i> German anti-semitism, so much as that he argues for unique <i>eliminationist</i> anti-semitism being popular among German people. I don't think there's that much evidence of this. Robert Gellatley's JMH review of Goldhagen puts it well, I think:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is true that anti-Semitism did not simply fade away, as many Jews and other Germans had expected, and that before the nineteenth century ended it became more ubiquitous and more often presented as based in "science." Most historians would also agree that anti-Semitism enjoyed sustained growth during the Weimar era. However, no political party could get elected with this one plank in its platform. In the last elections before 1933 Hitler tended to downplay anti-Semitism, evidently because he thought it would cost him votes, and in the first years after the Nazi "seizure of power" he made few anti-Semitic statements in public, presumably because they would detract from his popularity. According to Goldhagen, Hitler's role in the Holocaust was crucial, but not because the Führer cast some kind of demonic spell. What he did was to "unshackle" an already existing anti-Semitism, making it more open and lethal. Goldhagen tends to paint what happened after Hitler's appointment as chancellor monochromatically, as a continuing success story, so that he portrays even an evident propaganda failure - like the boycott of the Jews in April 1933 - as a victory. In his view, there was at best minor dissent over the boycott and the later violence. Although Hitler gave several bloodcurdling speeches on the subejct of the Jews in the periods before and during the war, Goldhagen exaggerates in stating that "rarely has a national leader so openly, frequently, and emphatically announced an apocalyptic intenion" - essentially to carry out the Holocaust (p.162). Hitler's remarks on the "Jewish question" were neither open, frequent, nor unambiguous.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Goldhagen claims that "Hitler displayed an acute insight into the nature of the German people and into the way in which their 'instinctive' antisemitism [could] be activated by him for the necessary consequences" (p.443). But if there really was such a meeting of minds between Hitler and the German people, why did he say so little about the "eliminationist" anti-Semitism of Nazi state policy, and why after 1939 did he never state unequivocally in public - nor even among his closest confidants - what was happening to the Jews? The half dozen or so "prophecies" he made public during the war, in which he talked about the destruction of the Jews, kept up this ambiguity, as what he said almost always constituted threats of what would befall the Jews at some point in the future. In fact, during several of these wartime speeches the annihilation of the Jews was already well under way. Why did Hitler evidently consider it inappropriate to mention any of these "hard facts" in plain language? Why the need for the painstaking "language regulation" in the whole realm of the Final Solution, and why above all was the killing carried out in such secrecy? If the German people were really under the spell of such "hallucinatory anti-Semitism," would they not have welcomed such publicity? Evidently, the regime kept the tidings of anti-Semitic actions and of the existence of the camps in the east such a secret back home that even some leaders of the German Jews - people with a vested interest in finding out what they really faced as they were deported - discovered little about what was happening in the east until after most of the killings had already taken place.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And so forth...the point is, this is a serious flaw. I think what made it worse in the eyes of a lot of historians is that Goldhagen took it outside the profession, turning it into a "public debate" in which he could be the brave iconoclast taking on the historical profession. At any rate, I think his whole "eliminationist anti-semitism" argument is overwrought, at least as far as the pre-1933 period goes, and probably even further on. At any rate, whatever the merits of Goldhagen's book, I think it's a bad idea for Wikipedia to recommend a book which has been savaged by pretty much the entire academic community specializing in the field. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 05:46, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>What you did was <a href="../../../m/o/s/Wikipedia%7EMost_common_Wikipedia_faux_pas_a5bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Most common Wikipedia faux pas">Wikipedia:Most common Wikipedia faux pas</a> #5. At least, that's how Mav saw it. Making a major change is very difficult when a number of active editors have contributed to it significantly. It's just an unfortunate aspect of Wikipedian politics. You can improve your chances by increasing the length, and making it technically perfect. Editors will use flaws in the new version as an excuse to revert it back to the version they wrote. In this case, the broken redirects you left were such an excuse.</p>
<p>As for being bold: it sounds like there was an active discussion going on, and you got sick of arguing and decided to do it your own way. You can't expect the others involved in the argument to sit idly by when something like that happens. Wikipedia relies on consensus decision making. If you want your version to be accepted, there has to be a consensus in favour. Otherwise it will just spark an edit war, the outcome of which is usually determined by tenacity.

<p>Hi Adam, I actually live in Kew. I agree that some of the upper class live there -- and it is one of Melbourne's most expensive suburbs (after Toorak, South Yarra and East Melbourne).</p>
<p>But most of Kew is firmly middle-class, and the suburb used to have a reasonable number of working class families too (especially so when Whitlam was born there). Even in the most expensive areas I'm aware of, there are still a few poor families that haven't sold out. Of course, their houses get demolished when they do.</p>
<p>The expression "upper class" is very strong -- to me it suggests Melbourne Club memberships, serious money, friends in the Tory cabinet. Upper middle class might be the term you were looking for... -- <a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPde_ed2a.html" title="User:Pde">Pde</a></p>

<dd>Yes indeed. I probably got there by a different route (worrying about copyright and patents interfering with free software &amp; digitopian fantasies, before I learnt about essential medecines issues), but that's what building coalitions is about, right?&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I had noticed your election archive. I thought we had a nice coincidence of themes&#160;:). I agree about the disorganisation of politics articles -- but I don't think it's just a problem for Australia.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that there are three places where the political history of countries can be written up: in the History_of_Country article, the Politics_of_Country article, and in the entries on various political figures. I suspected briefly that the CIA World Factbook material in Politics_of_X was stifling those pages, but I'm no longer sure that this is true -- in some cases it's been overhauled quite effectively.</dd>

<p>Yeah, I don't really know anything about this Sidney Warburg nonsense, either. But, so far as I can tell from limited looking, there's no particular evidence of the existence of a "Sidney" Warburg, and the whole thing doesn't make any sense on the face of it. The Warburgs were a Jewish family. Why on earth would they have given money to Hitler?

<p>The changes I made to Aussie PM pages were to do with the images. Most of the divisions the images were in, were set to a width that was different to the actual size of the image. This can lead to situation where some web browsers will expand the division to fit the image, while others will shift the image off to the side to make the image fit the division. Anyway it is all fixed now. Also some of the images you uploaded were .bmp that had been renamed to a .jpg. The images are much smaller when they are real jpg files so I converted them to real jpg files. For instance George Reid is now 20 times smaller than it previously was. It looks the same as before but will download a lot quicker when someone views it. -- <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopsracer_cec6.html" title="User:Popsracer">Popsracer</a> 07:04, 13 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

When you write comments like that in the recent changes, everybody who accidentaly reads it (at least I) feels a bit "assaulted", so i imagine what the new user felt...

<p>Re: the Winged Victory--it seems suspicious to me as well, but I've found several sources claiming it was presented to the Louvre by the Greek government, though how reliable they are, I'm not sure. The frieze story can be found at <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/greekart.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crystalinks.com/greekart.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and <a href="http://www.artfaces.com/artkids/greekart.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artfaces.com/artkids/greekart.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> claims something similar. Other sources claim it was discovered personally by the French consul in Samothrace (who was also an archaeologist), but are silent about the legalities of who allowed him to take it back to France with him. If you can find some more definitive information that'd be great; otherwise, I'll try looking at a library in a week or two when I get some time. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 04:02, Oct 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>After some more searching, it appears that perhaps a plausible story is that it was the Winged Victory's hand that was exchanged by the Greek government for a temple frieze (the rationale being that the hand was valuable to the Louvre, since they had the rest of the statue, but relatively useless by itself, so might as well trade it for something that can be displayed more productively on its own). This was probably corrupted into the other story. The 1863 discovery appears to have been done entirely by the French consul who took it back himself, perhaps without really consulting with any authorities (I'm not sure what the Ottomans did about this sort of stuff). --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 08:34, Oct 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>A page on History articles needing writing or rewriting is an excellent idea. I'm going to start compiling a list right away.</p>
<p>Wiki articles often ignore diversity, complexities, and context. Many neglect long-term historic processes and broads pattern of structural change. Consequently, they often fail to understand historical actors in the cultural, political, and economic realities of their times. It's all too common to run into disputes with users approaching things from a more values-laden angle and a narrow frame of reference. Wiki is better, however, at more matter-of-fact summaries or chronicles.</p>
<p>As a result, I've tried to make up for that by focusing very broad, complex topics - which are the ones often needing the most work. However, this has left me with a plethora of my own unfinished articles and series of articles. Many articles that I'd add to that list would be my own pet-projects languishing unfinished.</p>
<p>BTW, sorry about the lack of a list on the user page. After months on this site, it's been frustrating that the external links have failed to inspire any comments. So I decided a while ago to forgo a conventional user page, hoping that listing these links in isolation would leave them more noticeable. That idea has been a complete failure. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:55, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user namespace is just any page that comes after <i>User:</i>. Pages in that do not need to follow the same rules as the rest of the encyclopedia because they are part of a user's "own" pages (although they aren't really your own). If something is not the real article, it can either be at a "temp page", like Talk:Zionism/Temp, or in the user space. As you had called this one "Adam Carr's draft..."

<p>Hi, Adam. For the first statement, <i>The key event in triggering the modern Zionist movement</i>, I would modify it to read: <i>The key event in triggering the modern political Zionism</i> to distinguish between other forms of Zionism (cultural, religious, proto-Zionist attempts, etc.). Hope that is okay with you. The Bund should definitely go in, as we agree. It certainly needs an article, but so few people know about it today. I can do some research, but it will need time. Another thing to consider is the impact of romantic nationalism on early Zionism--Herzl was actually from Budapest: was he influenced by Kossuth, etc.? Did von Trietschke's nationalism impact early German Zionist authors (Hess comes to mind). De Haan is a fascinating subject: a gay Dutch Jewish poet, who was attracted to Zionism then had a religious apotheosis, became spokesman for Agudath Israel when it was vehemently anti-Zionist. He was assassinated by representatives of the Yishuv, while leaving afternoon prayer services in Jerusalem. I would love to write more on the Jewish materials and clean up what I see as a terrible mess in some areas, but I do not want to get into partisan fights with people, so I let it ride. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 17:00, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of them are pretty old, but in Canada, where I grew up there are still schools associated with the Bund, and here in New York there are some Yiddishists who also associate themselves with the Bund. Incidentally, Marek Edelman, a Bundist and the last surviving commander of the Warsaw Ghetto, is still active in Warsaw.

<p>Hi Adam, your <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wikipedia_Quality_Survey_a4c2.html" title="The Wikipedia Quality Survey">The Wikipedia Quality Survey</a> page has been moved (twice). Camembert moved it to the Wikipedia namespace but suggested it might be better at Meta. I agreed and have since moved it to Meta. If you use a title like that, it is in the main article namespace. This means it is a real encyclopedia article. I'm sure you realise that a survey like this is not an encyclopedia article and would be quickly listed at VfD.</p>
<p>To put something in the Wikipedia namespace, just type <b>Wikipedia:</b> in front of the title. That is the area that is for pages relating to the running of Wikipedia – like policies and help pages. Therefore, it isn't really suitable for a survey, which is more of a discussion about Wikipedia, rather than something which is a utility for editing here.</p>
<p>The Meta Wikipedia is for discussing things relating to the project as a whole, and would seem the perfect place for your survey. You can now find it at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia_Quality_Survey" class="extiw" title="m:English_Wikipedia_Quality_Survey">m:English Wikipedia Quality Survey</a>.

<p>I have readded the text u added, I did not see it before.

I don't really mind where it is, so feel free to do with it what you will. By the way, it was in no way intended to be critical of Wikipedia, which I think is a wonderful project.

<p>Adam re Jesus page.</p>
<p>I suggested an another alternative sentence in your introductory paragraph. I think it got missed in the discussion, though I replied to your query on Jesus and other religions on the talk page.</p>
<p>Suggested new first paragraph. Islam sees Jesus as a prophet other religions see him in much different ways. Also added Lir's sentence about the Gospels because I think it is well written and allows Christian movement with the phrase divinely inspired as to whether it is literally correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jesus Christ (or Jesus of Nazareth, see alternate names below) (c. 4 BC - c. 30) was, according to Christian belief, the Son of God, who brought salvation to man through his crucifixion and resurrection. Jesus is considered to be a major religious figure by several other religions, for instance, he is regarded as a prophet in Islam. The primary source of historical knowledge, about Jesus, is contained within the Christian Gospels, <i>which Christians view as the divinely inspired writings of God</i>. Most secular historians accept that the Gospels are sufficient evidence that Jesus existed, but do not believe that the details of his life can be known from the available evidence.&#160;: ChrisG 16:22, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you think about Lir's line in replace of 'Word of God'. There are many Christians who do not believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible.</p>

<p>He is a Senator, however this title does not need to be placed at the head of the article, as it is a temporary title only granted during his time in office. Even if it were not, there are at least some Wikipedians who would prefer such titles not be used in that manner, instead introducing the person as a person, and later mentioning what offices and titles they hold (perhaps later in the first sentence if important). See <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F.

<p>It's probably something that should be standardized at some point to avoid future conflicts, so I'll leave things as they are for now (feel free to change back if you feel strongly that way). I personally would prefer not having the titles at all (Sir, Dr., President, Senator, etc.) unless they are an integral part of the person's identity without which the name wouldn't make sense (as in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a>, and so on). Then later in the article if they have honorific titles, whether because of offices or degrees or awards, these can be mentioned. I'll get around to proposing this on the village pump or mailing list at some point and see what comes of it. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 09:37, Oct 23, 2003 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Would you like to rephrase it? You did suggest that you disliked it before. Essentially the page was protected because of this first paragraph, so if we can get real agreement on this, then we can restore the page and just restore is wikiness. Obviously Lir will won't to add 'Ascetic', which ought to be dealt with once and for all by a vote of interested parties I suggest.</p>
<p>Also I would suggest we retitle the first section of the article - "Introduction" rather than the 'Problem of Jesus' which is rather less inflamatory and describes it more accurately.: <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisG_fb9b.html" title="User:ChrisG">ChrisG</a> 10:33, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam re Jesus page. I'll put the compromise up on the the Jesus talk page. Looking at the entries on the page it seems clear that Lir has no support for listing in the introductory paragraph since it is not considered so important. Hopefully he will be mollified by the addition of some of his text however.</p>
<p>You didn't comment about changing the title of the first section, but I assume you have not problem with that.</p>
<p>Since it was the cause of problems we should be able to get the protection removed.</p>

<i>And indeed relations between the Arabs and the early Jewish settlers in Palestine were generally harmonious. Jewish settlement and investment in Palestine stimulated Arab immigration from other Arab countries, and the Jewish and Arab populations grew in tandem to their mutual benefit. At this time, it seems, there was no sense of Palestinian national identity, and apparently no opposition to Jewish settlement.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>There is some vagueness in this section about which time period is being referred to (but this is easily fixed).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arab immigration into Palestine was insignificant both before and after WWI.</li>
<li>The settlements of the first aliyah employed Arab workers, but not enough to make a major difference to the Arab economy. After about 1905 there was a campaign to employ only Jews and this was reasonably successful. Thousands of Yemenite Jews (who were willing to work for "Arab wages") were imported as laborers.</li>
<li>There was Arab opposition already in the 1880s. Several times the Ottoman authorities were successfully petitioned to restrict Jewish immigration and especially against land sales to Jews, which drove the prices up beyond Arab means. These measures were not very effective. After the aims of the Zionists became known in the 1890s (contrary to common perceptions, the Arabs were very well informed of news from Europe), serious political opposition started. I'm looking at Mandel, <i>The Arabs and Zionism before World War I</i>, which documents all this.</li>
<li>Palestinian nationalism, as opposed to Arab nationalism, is sometimes traced into the 19th century but did not really become significant until after Palestine was separated from the rest of the Arab world in 1918. However, opposition to Zionism preceded Palestinian nationalism by decades.</li>
<li>As to <i>what</i> to replace it by, I didn't write anything yet. I think the whole section needs reworking.</li>

</ul>
<p>That's three different permutations.</p>

<p>I think that the attitude of Zionism towards the Arabs is important, not least because it is the thing that ended up causing the greatest trouble. The Arab reaction to Zionism is perhaps less important, though some mention is needed in order to put the former into context. However, probably something can be done in about the same amount of space. Another missing topic (as Danny suggested) is Ahad Ha'am.

I guess I must not be an expert on Edgardo Mortara since I never heard of him. Sounds interesting though (but only 3 Google hits, why the interest?). Incidentally, I can read a tiny (tiny) bit of Hebrew but not enough to understand a newspaper for example. Yiddish has essentially the same alphabet but uses more vowels, and many words are stolen from German. So sometimes I can understand it a little, but only sometimes and only a little. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 13:57, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I am checking with someone at work who knows quite a bit about the historical Bund. I noticed the differences when I added the Yiddish, but just left it till I could check with him. I have a day off tomorrow, so I will see what I have about Ahad Ha'am around the house. Mortara is a fascinating topic. Not very well known now, but it was a major sensation back in the days of Pius IX. His great-grand niece is still around in Italy and was very upset, apparently, about the beatification of Pius as a result. Didn't get quite the press as Mother Teresa (thankfully) or even as much as St. Edith Stein, but it is an interesting story and relates to the issue of forced baptisms. In some way it relates to a project I am working on now--non-Jewish rescuers during the Holocaust--since there is an ambivalent attitude about Catholic rescues. Many were genuine acts of kindness (I like the term "a conspiracy of good"), but in certain instances, there was a lot of pressure on some people to convert. I won't get into Cardinal Lustiger, because I haven't researched all the details (What's the difference between the Cardinal of Paris and the Chief Rabbi of Paris? The Cardinal speaks Yiddish), but Mortara was also a forced conversion, ostensibly for the good of the child. Lemme do some checking. BTW, you're doing some great work on the Jewish history stuff.

I'm not sure myself if they're a waste of time or not. Even if I don't use them, others apparently do. Either way, I keep hearing talk of an automated list-making system, and that'd hopefully get rid of the bias problems that I am concerned about. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandperl_547d.html" title="User:Zandperl">zandperl</a> 04:36, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, please can you put the most recent vandalism at the top of the page on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress</a> rather than the bottom. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 04:33, Oct 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It may be protected on request but that would mean you could not edit it either. Whether or not others have any business editing another user's homepage is a matter of debate. Some feel strongly against the protection of pages in general. You might want to speak to <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> about it as his views seem to be against it. I don't hold a strong view either way although it seems rather unnecesaary to preemptively protect a page. If someone wants to vandalise something, they will do. They will just move from the protected page to a different one, and seeing that a page is protected is more likely to frustrate them and lead them to further vandalism. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 04:46, Oct 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yours said "...born...born...". You had born twice in the same sentance. Jiang's version was easier to read and contained whole sentences. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 06:04, Oct 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>
