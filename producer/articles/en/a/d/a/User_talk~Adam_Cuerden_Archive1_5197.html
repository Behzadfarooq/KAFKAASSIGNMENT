<p>No problem. I have that page watched because of some older vandalism, so I keep an eye on it for more vandalism. I don't have a real interest in the subject myself. But I saw your edit, and your request on the talk page for someone to reposition it, so I went ahead and did so. Not a huge deal. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 20:50, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Adam Cuerden, <b>: )</b> glad to help. Here is <a href="../../../p/d/_/WP%7EPD_9540.html" title="WP:PD">WP:PD</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> policy and guidelines to make sure that you understand the way WP interpretes these copyright laws. Hopefully, it is in the PD and you can use it. So your other concern is about style. WP has a <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> that discusses how to put an article together on the page. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_Editing_Wikipedia_f2e1.html" title="Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia">Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia</a>, too. Short quotes are fine. You are the judge of the length, of course other editors might adjust. If you have multiple quotes or one that is long for the article you can put the quote in our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a> or on our other sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>. I suggest you work on the article and then other editors will come along and help. I'll check to see how you're doing. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 01:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it looks good to me. Sometimes people put hidden text in the edit window saying where the quote was obtained and explaining the fair use.

<p>Looks like you got it taken care of by someone else. Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. I picked up a Wikipedia stalker and got distracted.

<p>Thanks for your comments about my editing - appreciated! Re contractions, I read somewhere in Wikipedia's style notes that contractions are frowned on, and I agree: I wouldn't expect them in a hard-copy encyclopaedia, so why on Wiki? (Talk pages are different!) As for a.k.a., I don't think it's necessary - it's common practice to put an alternative name in brackets, without such an abbreviation. If you do feel it necessary, I suggest writing it out in full - again, I wouldn't expect to find such an abbreviation in the text of a hard-copy encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoyed your article - it took me back to being a shepherd, a god and whatever else in the chorus many, many years ago! Birdhurst 10:40, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam. Best of luck with <i>Contrabandista</i>/<i>Chieftain</i>. You should rename it "The Contrabandista/The Chieftain," rather than just "Contrabandista/Chieftain." You'll see that the articles for operas that begin with "The" always have "The" in the article title (e.g., The Mikado). You should also add redirects from "The Contrabandista" and "The Chieftain" singly.</p>
<p>FYI, I've done an article on <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivanhoe_%28opera%29.html" title="Ivanhoe (opera)">Ivanhoe</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed you've gone into the Savoy opera page and added a bunch of links to operas that don't have Wikipedia articles yet. There's actually a WP guideline that recommends not doing that. Links that go nowhere are a distraction to the reader. It's better to link them when you're ready to create articles for them, rather than creating dead-ends to opera titles that aren't going to have their own articles anytime soon. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 12:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you meant by your question about the original version of "Is live a boon?" Do you mean, am I interested in it personally? Well, my own view is that Gilbert was right, and the second setting is better than the first. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 20:35, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think "A laughing boy" and "When jealous torments" are pretty easy to find nowadays, as it's fairly common to encounter them in performance. I've lost count of the number of productions that have included them. Savoynet's 2000 production at Buxton was an example, but there have been many others since then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 6/8 "Is life a boon" is harder to find, mainly because there doesn't seem to be any great interest in performing it. I think the VS might be in "Sing with Sullivan," but I'll need to double-check when I get home. Unfortunately, I'm not likely to have the time for a copying job at the NYPL. They don't allow photocopies, so I'd have to physically copy out the ms. by hand, which would not be a trivial undertaking. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 21:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You asked: "...what's the time signatures of the Act I finale "Oh, happy the lily" and the Act II finale one?" In Finale Act I, it's 9/8. The rest of your question turns out to be a trick question, because in the original ending of the Act II finale, it is also 9/8. However, in the *other* version of the Act II finale, it (that is, only the ending section) is in 4/4. &#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 05:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You asked if the 4/4 is Toye's or Sullivan's. The OUP piano vocal score is not clear about this but seems to indicate that it is basically the 1887 published version. So, it appears that Sullivan, not Toye, changed the end of the Finale to the 4/4 (IMO awkward) section. What Toye then did later, I cannot say, but the DOC recordings should reflect it. --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 13:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Adam, your last edit seems to ignore my message above. I think you better stop and try to get Marc to fix it. Also, your changes about the orchestra parts were not right. Anyone could rent the songs and verses that Toye cut, although to restore some of the small internal cuts, the music director would probably have needed to mark up the scores. This is not worth trying to explain in the footnote, and in any event we do not have a source to confirm it. The basic point that the encyclopedia needs to make is that the orchestra parts reflected the Toye cuts, but the cut material was available, which is what it says. --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 13:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good start on both articles. One potential troublesome point: in both articles, there are comments that appear to be your personal opinions of those works. Comments in both artcles appear (unless I am mistaken) to be your original analysis.

<dd>Thanks for your message. All that's required is to include a survey of what <i>other people</i> have said about these works. For the Overture this is pretty easy, as it was widely performed during Sullivan's lifetimes, and the critics had a lot to say. The opera is another matter, as it went unperformed, and neither a libretto nor a score survives. It is impossible for <i>anybody</i> to verify whether Chorley's libretto was any good, or for that matter, Sullivan's score, aside from the few small bits that have survived. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 02:23, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You asked my advice on what you should do. OK, my advice is to improve the plot synopsis for Dorothy. Then, create an article for Princess Toto and the other Gilbert operas that do not have articles. Then articles on the most imporatant Savoy curtain raisers that do not yet have article. Then, go through the To do list on the WP:G&amp;S project page. Those are the highest priority items that Marc and I had identified. I know that you may have your own priorities that are different from ours, but since you asked, that is my advice.

<p>Just a suggestion. I think we are putting undue focus on very minor Sullivan works. <i>The Sapphire Necklace</i> was never produced. <i>L'Ile Enchentee</i> and <i>Kenilworth</i> were minor pieces; practically juvenile works. When it came time to write his biographies, they were little more than a footnote. There are Sullivan works of considerably greater importance that don't yet have Wikipedia articles, as well as quite a few Gilbert plays. Obviously it's not my place to tell people what to work on, but realistically these items are pretty low on Sullivan's totem-pole, even for a Sullivan fan. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 20:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's fine that you wrote the plot summary based on your viewing, because there is a link to the libretto. If anyone who reads Russian wants to check it, they can. But I don't think you want to state, under the heading "Bibliography", that part of the article is based on watching the performance. Of course, all the opera articles probably have some info in them derived from editors watching performances, but we don't "say so". I don't know what the "style" is at the Opera project, but what I would do is just mention the programme under "Reference", because that is the only reference in writing, if you see what I mean?

<p>Mazeppa (synopsis)</p>
<p>Composer: Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky</p>
<p>ACT I. In the garden of Kochubei‚Äôs farmstead, on the banks of the Dnieper, peasant girls pass by in boats, inviting Maria, Kochubei‚Äôs daughter, to join their fortune-telling games. She demurs; her father is entertaining an important guest ‚Äî the Cossack chieftain Mazeppa, ruler of the Ukraine. When they are gone, she reflects that girlish pursuits hold no charm for her since the elderly Mazeppa has bewitched her heart. Andrei, overhearing her passionate declaration, offers comfort and understanding, but when she thanks him for his friendship, he replies that it is not friendship but love that inspires his sympathy. She asks his forgiveness, and they lament the fatal passions that rule them both. Bidding her a tearful farewell, Andrei rushes away.</p>
<p>In Kochubei‚Äôs house, the assembly hails the guest of honor. After a group of folk dancers regales them with a Hopak, Mazeppa draws his host aside to ask for his daughter‚Äôs hand. When Kochubei, appalled, points out the gulf between their ages, Mazeppa replies that the passions of a mature heart burn slowly but steadily, assuring Kochubei that Maria returns his love. The proud father refuses his consent and orders Mazeppa to leave his house. Mazeppa, affronted, calls his in guard and demands submission, but Kochubei defies him, backed by Andrei and the guests, who condemn Mazeppa‚Äôs sinful desires. Maria, torn between love and duty, throws herself between her beloved and her father; Mazeppa, preparing to leave, forces Maria to choose between them. After an agonizing moment, she runs into his arms. With his guard holding back the horrified company, he leads her away.</p>
<p>A group of women comforts Lyubov as she laments the loss of her child. Sending them away, she urges Kochubei to wreak vengeance on Mazeppa. Kochubei reveals that in an unguarded moment Mazeppa has let slip hints of a treasonous plan to align himself with the Swedes to overthrow the Tsar. Kochubei plots to betray Mazeppa to Peter the Great. Andrei, saying his life is of no value without Maria, volunteers to brave the Tsar‚Äôs disbelief by denouncing his trusted hetman. Kochubei and Lyubov exult that their enemy will die at the hands of executioners.</p>
<p>ACT II. Kochubei, imprisoned and awaiting execution, laments that the Tsar has taken Mazeppa‚Äôs slanderous word over his loyal one and turned him over to his enemy; Kochubei, who has made a false confession under torture, regrets the loss of his honor more than his life. When Mazeppa‚Äôs henchman Orlik enters, demanding to know where Kochubei has hidden his treasure, Kochubei replies that, since Mazeppa has stolen his and his daughter‚Äôs honor, the only treasure left him is vengeance, which rests with God. As Orlik summons the torturers again, Kochubei falls senseless.</p>
<p>In a room in his palace, Mazeppa resolves to kill Kochubei and Andrei, but his soul is troubled by guilty visions, and he wonders how Maria will react when she learns of her father‚Äôs fate. Orlik comes to report Kochubei‚Äôs refusal to cooperate, and Mazeppa sends him to prepare for the execution. Alone, he reflects on the rejuvenating effects of Maria‚Äôs love. She enters to complain of his recent neglect, remaining unconvinced by his avowals that he loves her more than glory or power. To assuage her fears, he confides his revolutionary plans, saying he may soon ascend the throne of an independent Ukraine. Maria is swept away by visions of his glory; when he warns that failure will mean the gallows, she vows to die with him and reaffirms her love. When Mazeppa asks whether he is dearer to her than her father, Maria, perturbed, assures him of her devotion; they embrace, asking one another‚Äôs forgiveness. Left alone, Maria envisions her parents in distress. Lyubov enters unexpectedly and implores her to save her father‚Äôs life. Maria, at first uncomprehending, finally realizes what has happened and, overcome by guilt, falls in a faint. Reviving quickly, she hurries away with Lyubov to plead for Kochubei‚Äôs life.</p>
<p>In a field near a scaffold, an unruly mob awaits the execution. A drunken Cossack sings a song, berated by the crowd, which bows subserviently to Mazeppa when he rides by. Kochubei and Iskra are brought in. They kneel in repentant prayer, then mount the scaffold. As the crowd surges forward, Maria and Lyubov rush in, only to see the axes fall. Maria collapses in her mother‚Äôs arms.</p>
<p>ACT III. In the ruins of Kochubei‚Äôs farmstead, now a battlefield, Andrei, thirsting for vengeance, regrets that he has pursued Mazeppa in vain. Surveying the place where his childhood love for Maria blossomed, he laments his lost dream of happiness, wishing for oblivion and peace. He withdraws as Mazeppa and Orlik ride in, fleeing the victorious Russians. When Orlik leads the horses off, Mazeppa, now branded a traitor, bemoans the downturn in his fortunes. Andrei comes forward to berate him for destroying the happy home that once stood on the battleground and challenges him to a duel to the death. Mazeppa replies that his grey hairs and his misfortunes should command respect, but when Andrei, unmoved, rushes at the old man with his sabre, Mazeppa draws his pistol and shoots. Andrei falls wounded. Mazeppa, calling for Orlik, is stopped by the appearance of Maria, mad with grief over her father‚Äôs death. She fails to recognize Mazeppa, who tries briefly to bring her to her senses before abandoning her at Orlik‚Äôs urging to save himself. Alone, Maria comes upon the wounded Andrei. Imagining him to be a sleeping child, she cradles him in her arms and sings him a lullaby. Andrei, coming to, tries in vain to penetrate her delirium, but his eyes grow dim, and he dies with a last farewell on his lips, as Maria gently rocks him in her lap.</p>

<dd>I appreciate your help. You cyrillic is fine. But I do not like your title "List of songs". It is a quite wrong concept to thing that opera is a series of songs. "The structure of opera" (or libretto) would be better.(<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMeladina_cd2e.html" title="User:Meladina">meladina</a> 13:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>It would be wrong if you will put full text of libretto into the article.

<p>I prefer: "Mazepa" (so we can move the file Mazeppa (opera) into Mazepa (opera), and anyway, Mazeppa (opera) would be also recognizible as a title after this] About Mariya or Maria, Andrei or Andrey please follow your taste and instinct. Congratulations again! Yours (meladina 15:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Please change all "-"s into "‚Äì"s. (meladina 15:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)) Sorry, I began to hesitate. I've just vizited Google that gave me the following results:</p>
<p>Mazeppa</p>
<p>569 000 for Mazeppa. 164 000 for Mazepa. Maria</p>
<p>400 000 000 for Maria. 1 110 000 for Mariya. Andrei</p>
<p>20 600 000 for Andrei. 9 630 000 for Andrey. Probably more popular names are preferable? What do you think about? Let us to ask somebody else's advice. (meladina 15:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I am going to give my opinion on Meladina's talk page in two minutes --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 15:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. I think you should refer to the transliteration of the name of the opera on Adam's programme to see what people are using who actually peform the work. Also, do your books on Russian opera agree on the spelling? I don't think we should leave this one to google. of course, it really doesn't matter very much whether it is one "p" or two, as long as the references cited in the WP article agree with how you are using it.</p>
<p>2. For Maria/Mariya, I would go with Mariya, because it is more distinctly Russian. Maria is more usually an Italian or Spanish/hispanic name. So by spelling it with the "y", you give it a Russian flavor. I do not think google helps here, because google picks up all the non-Russian usages.</p>
<p>3. For Andrei/Andrey, I would go with the google answer here, because this name is particularly Russian (or at least slavic), and so google's consensus is more likely to be helpful. Personally, I find the Andrei spelling to look more typical and attractive for English usage.</p>
<p>I hope that helps! --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 15:55, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My English music books used Mazeppa, Maria, Andrei, Kochubey (Kochubey is not a Russian, but Tatar name). Please check in your program, and then we will chose the best solution.

<p>I put back in the comment on the title of <i>Pirates</i>, but reworded it in a fashion that I hope will satisfy you.

<dd>I don't have my reference books handy at work, but just about any decent G&amp;S history book tells this story. American producers who ripped off foreign works were commonly called "pirates." Gilbert &amp; Sullivan came to America because <i>Pinafore</i> was routinely being "pirated" in this fashion. How could this <u>not</u> have been on Gilbert's mind when he chose the name? Also, it is well known that the original concept was about burglars or robbers, not pirates. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 19:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you have any G&amp;S history books in your own collection, and I'm sure you do, you could look it up yourself. Whether you choose to believe it is a whole other story, but this isn't some David Eden crackpot theory. It's the standard account of how the title came into being.

<p>You might consider uploading those same excellent photos you sent to the G&amp;S Archive for The Emerald Isle cast for use on the relevant actors' pages here. I have a number of photo sources I'll eventually get around to scanning, but I think it's nice to show people like Henry Lytton and Rosina Brandram who played such a variety of characters <i>out</i> of costume. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnivron_b135.html" title="User:Anivron">Anivron</a> 05:18, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, Louie Pounds would be nice. Also, I didn't seem him pictured over at the archive, but if you have Walter Passmore out of costume, that too would be fantastic. As for Lytton, we could probably move his Major General picture over to the Major General's Song's page and then put him out of costume on his own. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnivron_b135.html" title="User:Anivron">Anivron</a> 15:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Take a look at the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Zoo_0092.html" title="The Zoo">Zoo</a></i> page, and you'll see that, despite what Sullivan wrote, there was in fact another professinoal revival in Sullivan's lifetime, and as far as we know, he did not make any of the changes he alluded to in the letter that Allen quotes. The situation, therefore, really is not parallel to what happened with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sapphire_Necklace_dc11.html" title="The Sapphire Necklace">The Sapphire Necklace</a></i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 18:27, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Adam, I agree that it would not be accurate to say that Sullivan suppressed the Zoo. When someone offered to revive it, Sullivan permitted it. Sure, he had wished to improve it, but I imagine he might have liked a second crack at a number of works that he never got around to revising. And, if you look at the Chieftain, a second attempt doesn't necessarily yield a radically improved work.

<dl>
<dd>Adam wrote on my talk page:
<dl>
<dd>Eh, just because he reluctantly let it be revived because he was pressured to do so doesn't completely invalidate the fact that the concern for the libretto caused a fair bit of suppression of the Zoo, in my opinion. But I suppose it doesn't really matter, except that it seems a common thread between the three main lost works (Thespis, Zoo, and Sapphire Necklace)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There is no evidence that Sullivan allowed the <i>Zoo</i> revival "reluctantly," or that he was "pressured to do so." We don't know the circumstances behind it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As late as 1875‚Äì76, Gilbert and Sullivan wanted to revive <i>Thespis</i>, but Richard D'Oyly Carte wasn't able to gather the funds. I don't believe either Gilbert or Sullivan ever stated a reason for why the subject was never brought up again. One could reasonably infer that the re-use of "Climbing over rocky mountain" ‚Äî and if Tillett &amp; Spencer are to be believed, a whole lot more ‚Äî effectively precluded a revival. But I don't think G&amp;S themselves ever gave a reason.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even the contemporary source quoted on the <i>Sapphire Necklace</i> page doesn't tell the whole story. After the opera was written, Sullivan tried mightily to get it produced. Rejections followed, and he got the message. Years later, after he had already chopped up the score and reused the bits that were worthwhile, no doubt he looked on the Chorley libretto with disdain. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 19:39, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that we've gotten them started, but I'm not seeing a lot of movement; I think that the majority of editors liked the NPOV discussion and don't want it to end. I would suggest setting a deadline for a new NPOV structure and if this doesn't occur, then nominating both lists for Afd. If they don't get axed then, the next step would be removing anything without a proper source. Thanks for your help with this! Musikfabrik 15:10, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, I'd be happy to participate in a discussion of the NPOV issues on the List of major opera composers talk page with you and other bona fide Wikipedians now that some side-issues with another contributor there seem to be (almost) resolved. I would have participated in such a debate earlier, but I had strong suspicions that User:Musikfabrik was/were not acting in good faith and any NPOV discussion would just degenerate into a series of pedantic obstructions culminating in a total deletion of the page. He/they also harrassed me (and, I believe, Moreschi) elsewhere, so if I was defensive I had good cause.</p>
<p>However, I now hope to be able to get down to a sensible discussion of the POV issues without somebody breathing down my neck all the time. There probably are major POV difficulties on the page as it stands. These probably stem from an attempt to create too selective a list. As you can see, we attempted to chop it down to 25-35 names. Any reader with a passing interest in opera coming by the list might wonder why some well-known composers had been omitted. Therefore, I think the list needs to be expanded.</p>
<p>Another mistake was trying to decide on the selection without stating clear criteria from the outset. I'll attempt to describe what I think were the selection criteria below. I might transfer this info to the Talk Page. Some of it might be useful for establishing the new criteria but, of course, other methods like lists (or reference books) might be the way to go.

<p>As you can see from previous discussions, an attempt was made by contributors to whittle it down to a shortlist of about 25-35 names. Selection criteria for inclusion were never stated in an clear enough fashion from the outset. I'd say the unstated selection criteria included composers who were at least one of the following: composers who were historically significant or influential (e.g. they effectively founded a major national repertoire, so Monteverdi, Lully, Glinka or Smetana; or started a new genre, like Offenbach with operetta; or who are widely recognised as major reformers or revolutionaries, e.g. Gluck and Wagner); composers who have a significant place in the international repertory as it currently stands - ideally those who have shown long-term durability (Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, Puccini, Richard Strauss, Janacek, Britten); the latter may cover composers who have a single opera which is immensely popular (e.g. Bizet with "Carmen"; Gounod with "Faust"); composers regarded as representative examples of a genre (e.g. Handel, generally regarded as the finest composer of "opera seria" by critics); composers held in high critical esteem for their operas (e.g. Charpentier, Berlioz, Prokofiev). This is probably not an exhaustive list and there are borderline cases. Hope this clears things up a bit--<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 09:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, Adam. I think you're right and comparing lists is going to be a major way to enhance objectivity. Also, compiling lists of composers mentioned as significant in short introductions to opera/the history of opera might help too. "Grove" is a great authority on music, as you know. The complete Grove opera encyclopaedia is obviously too extensive to use for a shortlist (to put it mildly!), but Grove also publish separate, cheaper compilations of the entries for composers they deem important. For instance (though I don't own a copy, this is citable from the Amazon.co.uk), "Grove Masters of Italian Opera" contains Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi and Puccini (I imagine Monteverdi is in "Italian Baroque Masters"). So that's a real endorsement for inclusion. I do own "Grove French Baroque Masters" - the opera composers they include are Lully, Charpentier and Rameau. Wagner and Mozart have Grove books all to themselves. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:27, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yeah, and I think we only included one post-war composer because of concerns over objectivity and neutrality. Ironic, really.

<dd>One last thing: sorry about Tippett! I have to admit I've never seen or heard one of his operas in my life. I'm actually genuinely surprised Sullivan hasn't come up in those lists so far (Vivaldi and Carl Nielsen are other inexplicable absentees). Sullivan's article in "Viking" is about 17 pages long (longer, I think, than Puccini's - of course, he wrote more works than the Italian). Never mind, tomorrow I'll try to get the list from the famous Kobb√©'s Opera Guide. Might change things but we'll see how the dice fall.

<p>If that's what you feel should be done, then I do respect it. I won't be commenting on the AfD discussion and quite frankly, once the NPOV issue is cleared up on List of major opera compoers, I really doubt that I'll be participating much on Wikipedia. I'm being to see the whole inherent POV problems and the resistence to solving them. I won't be shutting the door entirely, but I don't see any way that this could be solved, other than organising the International Alliance of Women in Music to fix the gender bias issues and the American Musicological Society to fix the sources...I've considered that, but it just could never work. The whole system of how things are edits, why and what information is added needs to be changed and this problem is probably too big for me anyway, with everything else I have to do. If the 20th century section of Organ composers is slashed, so be it. I have no hard feelings against you at all. Thank you for your help and support. Jean-Thierry Boisseau 19:39, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Paul Wehage has brought the gender bias issues to the International Alliance of Women in Music. You may see some members of this organisation on this list and others working on creating neutrality against gender bias. This is an international forum of people working on the subject of women in music, so these are very well-informed academics who know this subject extremely well. Those of us who work in this field take the position that gender bias is in itself inherently non-neutral and the only way to achieve neutrality is to reduce gender bias to a minimum. Please encourage others to be polite to these people, as it may have adverse effects on the reputation of the project. Jean-Thierry Boisseau 20:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All the Hal√©vys are the same guy. The other major disambiguation issue I should have warned you about is over "Charpentier". There are two: Marc-Antoine Charpentier (the Baroque composer) and Gustave Charpentier (the early 20th century composer). I have given all references to the latter as "Gustave Charpentier". If there's a Charpentier with no Christian name specified, assume it's the Baroque guy, Marc-Antoine. Sorry for any confusion. Gustave only began to appear in the later lists. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 12:55, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I actually like G&amp;S quite a bit. In fact, they were really the only opera I liked when I was a kid. I only know the main Savoy operas but I used to read a bio of them and dream about hearing "Thespis" (because it was lost - is that still the case?). I heard bits of "H.M.S. Pinafore" on an episode of "The Simpsons" (of all places) the other day and found myself throughly enjoying it. I'll have to replace my old tapes with CDs now. My "blind spot" is probably bel canto (except Rossini) and Schoenberg. If there ever was an NPOV violation on the previous discussions we had, it was chopping Arnold. I think we were all a bit eager to put the knife in (sorry!). Tippett's libretti have a certain reputation, which is probably why I haven't explored him yet.--<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 13:14, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the "Thespis" info. That name in full (add the missing accents to taste): Jacques-Francois-Fromental-Elie Hal√©vy (alternatively Jacques-Francois-Fromentin-Elias L√©vi). French composer of "La Juive", currently enjoyong something of a revival (it's on DVD). I've only heard the one famous aria Caruso sang. Of course, not to be confused with Ludovic Hal√©vy, joint librettist with Henri Meilhac of many libretti for Offenbach and others (plus Bizet's "Carmen" of course).--<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 13:32, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we could put her on the list if the need arises (then we'll no doubt get accused of British bias!). Most of those lists have a certain "modernist" bias as the compilers try to hedge their bets as to which contemporary composers posterity will regard as major. We should probably put some kind of disclaimer about that in the explanation we'll give of the selection at the top of the page.

<p>I've checked Kenyon twice. He also mentions Galuppi and Piccinni (because they set libretti by Carlo Goldoni, who influenced Lorenzo da Ponte). This probably involves promotion for Piccinni (actually, I have heard a couple of his operas). Shame Pacini is nowhere to be seen, then we could have the good old Pacini, Piccinni, Puccini trio. Disambiguation of "Charpentier" for the total lists: Marc-Antoine Charpentier gets 2 mentions; Gustave Charpentier gets 5.--<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 08:34, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I completely understand your frustration. It'd be nice if we could resolve this, but I don't see Jean-Thierry making practical suggestions. I've left a note, asking him to do so if possible. I've also asked that people comment on the content and not contributors (I felt compelled, for the sake of fairness, to include you, as I don't think telling anyone to shut up is going to help matters. Sorry.) And let's remember, if trolls there be, it is best if we do not feed them too much, although I must say being accused of being a tool of the patriarchy is a pretty good way to get me pretty riled up.

There are also a couple of familiar names there. Wonder who edited the page...(Update: the same situation seems to apply at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_organ_pieces.html" title="List of organ pieces">List of organ pieces</a>. Again, Germaine Tailleferre - published by Musikfabrik- seems to be the lone woman on the list. Never mind, at least she has Messrs.

<dd>Besides the Nancy McIntosh thing, how d'ye think we're doing on Gilbert? Getting near GA? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 20:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Frankly, Adam, I don't care about GA. To me, it seems tediously technical and all about formatting of citations. I want all of our articles to be improved to where they are optimally informative to a person who knows little about G&amp;S. They should be balanced, with the stuff that is most important to a general understanding of <b>G&amp;S</b> being emphasized accordingly. That means that Nancy McIntosh will never be a big deal as compared with, say, Utopia Limited. Utopia is one of their shows that is still performed, while and Nancy is just a personal item of interest in Gilbert's life and one of the performers in Utopia.</p>
<p>So, what do I think of the article?</p>
<ul>
<li>Notwithstanding what I just said, I think the article is missing a major section on what W.S.G. was like as a person and, yes, what his life was like at home. I added a little of this near the end.</li>
<li>Biographical details are still sketchy. Was he stolen by brigands or not?, etc.</li>
<li>As to his works, like Engaged, or Eyes and No Eyes, if there is a good article that is blue linked, I don't think we need a lot of description of the works here.</li>
<li>As to the table of G's works, I think it is just fine and very useful? What's wrong with it? I think the thing you are working on is just a less useful copy of it. But I agree that at some point (not yet), we will need to separate it into a separate entry (and perhaps leave in the WSG article a list of "major works"). Take a look at some WP articles on other major writers or playwrights and see how they do it. Unfortunately, our article is probably better than a lot of them on WP.</li>
<li>As to the citation format, I am happy with the external links and a good list of references (that is, Bibliography). --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 20:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To my mind, the next thing we need is articles on the <b>most important</b> Gilbert plays and Sullivan pieces, which are the ones redlinked at <a href="../../../g/%26/s/WP%7EG%26S_a626.html" title="WP:G&amp;S">WP:G&amp;S</a> under "To do... new articles needed" --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 21:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, yes: The table: Idea behind the revision is to give a short description of each play, to make up for all the ones without articles. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 21:34, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Same thing. First, let's write up the important Gilbert plays. Then, you can see what is left and make a list of brief descriptions of ONLY them. Just my 2 cents. BTW, I wrote up the rest of the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savoy_Opera_2754.html" title="Savoy Opera">Savoy Operas</a> that had significant runs (<i>Lucky Star</i>, <i>Ib and Little Christina</i>, and one or two others), and I wrote up all the curtain raisers that had significant runs at the Savoy (about 10 or 12 articles). Did you look at them?

<p>Overall, I think it's pretty good. My only complaint is that the poster image is a bit large, and I think it might be better both made smaller and moved a little further down into the text.</p>
<p>By the by, I see a little discussion on Nancy McIntosh up there - I've been meaning to put together something about her myself. I've always had a little suspicion that Gilbert's insistence in having her create Zara may have further deepened the rift between the two men - just a gut feeling, really. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">AlbertHerring</a> 20:57, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Incidentally, while I'm at it - are you familiar with the edition of the first-night libretti that Heritage Books put out in the 40's? I have a copy - there's a <i>lot</i> of good background for each work, including quotes from reviews of the day and from Sullivan's personal diary and letters. If there's no objection I can go ahead and place those into the respective articles - there's a quote presented for each opera. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">AlbertHerring</a> 21:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True - don't forget, though, that if somebody wants more detail he can always click on it. Anyhow...let me play around with it a bit and see what I can come up with.</dd>

</dl>
<p>I'll try the poster at the bottom and see how it works.</p>
<p>As to the Heritage Books, I don't forsee any trouble with using them as a source, so long as they're properly cited. Thumbing through, I find Sullivan's thoughts on most of the works save <i>Trial by Jury</i> (oddly, the quote they have <i>there</i> is from the <i>Times</i> review) and <i>Pinafore</i> (from Gilbert's diary). There are excerpts from contemporary reviews and letters from both men on various subjects pertaining to the operas. There's also some delicious commentary on Hugh Talbot, who created Frederic in <i>Pirates</i> and apparently did a rotten job of it; even Sullivan, in a letter to his mother, has bad things to say - on the whole, there are about nine or ten press clippings excerpted. After dinner I should get around to writing an article on Talbot.</p>
<p>I'm a definite Britten fan, <i>Grimes</i> as much as <i>Herring</i>. Really, anything vocal of his, for that matter. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">AlbertHerring</a> 21:19, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the poster looks best this way - it's large enough to be legible, but small enough to flow well with the text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Britten, I would definitely go for <i>Peter Grimes</i> - I think the Phillips recording with Jon Vickers is still available; 2 CDs for the price of 1. There's also a good recording of <i>Albert Herring</i> on Naxos, at the same price - it should also be still available. Naxos also put out a couple of CDs of his choral work; I have the ones with the <i><a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn_to_St._Cecilia_48ac.html" title="Hymn to St. Cecilia">Hymn to St. Cecilia</a></i> (which I was quite pleased to see on here) and <i>St. Nicholas</i>. I'm a little iffy about his symphonic music, although anything with the Four Sea Interludes and the Young Person's Guide will be good. The violin/viola concerto and Cello Symphony I'm honestly not too fond of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The trouble with most of the other works is that I don't know of any good cheap recordings - the only <i>Billy Budds</i> I've seen have been full-price, for instance. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">AlbertHerring</a> 21:31, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please excuse me if you don't like random people on your talk page, Adam. I did "Hymn to St. Cecilia" in my college choir, and I had to write a paper for my "Song and the Poetic Text" class, so that was my choice. I attempted to adapt the paper to Wikipedia, although I'm not sure how successful I am. I was absolutely stunned by Peter Grimes when my college did it - we had really good guys as Peter, one of whom made him seem like the villain, the other like the hero. And how can you not love the Sea Interludes?

<p>I know the feeling. My sixth sense was telling me Musikfabrik &amp; Co. was playing fast and loose from the start, which is why I initially thought it would be a waste of time trying to save the article with them involved there. The Talk Page for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_major_opera_composers.html" title="List of major opera composers">List of major opera composers</a> is now a string of retrospective ironies (IIRC they accused us of running a cabal - a "Koffee Klatch"-, of having a "POV agenda" and of having the interests of the editors rather than the general public in mind. Such altruism). They also seem to have an obsession with tea- and coffee-drinking. But I'm not going to investigate that...</p>
<p>AFAIK their "empire" at the French version of Wikipedia remains largely intact. I have no plans to clean up that particular Augean stable. The user page for Musikfabrik invites us: "Si vous voulez me conna√Ætre, lisez mes contributions" ("If you want to know me, read my contributions").

<p>I have removed your recent additions to the Vesta article. While a detailed history of the symbols used to represent asteroids is interesting, it is not necessary in the article and is rather confusing, especially since symbols are now used very infrequently. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 00:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Surely, though, even if the discussion on MPC numbers is too long, the symbol ought to be there? I explains why there's several forms of the symbol (different ways of simplifying a very complex original). Adam Cuerden talk 00:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not think it is, because the symbols are now archaic. An analogy might be the term "planetologist", which has been replaced by "planetary scientist" or perhaps "ecologist". We don't need to give the etymology of "planetologist" in the "planetary scientist" article, because that is not the point of the article. Similarly, the Vesta article is not a history of the symbols used for the object. If there is an article somewhere on astronomical symbols, your discussion would be appropriate there. That said, if there is consensus in favor of the addition on the talk pages, then you can add the material. Just wait before adding anything until there is consensus. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 00:20, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That last editor appears to be a different person. WHOIS shows a US Verizon address, not a Thailand one. So it may be he actualy thinks it's useful link. There are quite a few editors who honestly seem to think Wikipedia should be a onestop gateway to purchasing decisions rather than an encyclopedia (my PoV is showing here:-).

<p>Adam, where are you getting these symbols from? I have seen the symbols for Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta in very old asteroid catalogs, but have never seen any of the others. You also haven't listed sources in the articles. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 21:44, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Query: I am right in thinking that drawing a symbol which was described, but, as far as is known, never drawn due to Gould's paper coming out soon after the symbol was proposed, would be horrible, horrible cruft, and that it would be better just to put, at most, the description into the article? Adam Cuerden talk 23:36, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I certainly wouldn't attempt to draw symbols that have never been drawn. As I have said before, I disapprove of including the symbols at all, with the possible exceptions of the first four, because they had widespreaad use for much longer time than the others. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 23:54, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your message. I must say that I appreciate what you are saying and do understand your point of view. I too tend to get very involved in these kinds of discussions and have a difficult time knowing when I am hitting people over the head with my positions.

<p>Yes that's me. Thanks for finding it. What search did you use to find it? I was actually looking for my physical file on the strike in my own files and unfortunately did not find it.

<p>I am about to replace my non-functional scanner. I think once I do, I'll scan the photos I have from the '68 strike and maybe write a little memoir and put them on my personal website. That sort of stuff is really good for historians and should be on the web.

<p>I think the article might even be ready for a "Featured Article" review. I tweaked a couple of sentences and italicized a few things, but overall it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>Two things: first of all, I've heard a story that Gilbert was abducted as a baby and held for ransom - do you know if this is true? I only have one source for it, so I'm not too sure, but it might be a good addition, if verifiable, to his early biography. Secondly, I think it wouldn't hurt to find a couple of illustrations to the section regarding his collaboration with Sullivan - even a portrait of Sullivan would do. And I've found scans of a number of illustrations to the <i>Bab Ballads</i> which might be nice to illustrate both this article and the one on the ballads.</p>
<p>Other than that I think it looks stunning. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">AlbertHerring</a> 17:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created a Wiki account so I could reassure you that I do not think you are sexist--I was horrified that you (and others) assumed I was making judgements about individuals involved in the discussion. I don't know Musikfabrik, or the two (?) people using that account, except as occasional participants in an email discussion list. My correspondence has been with Paul Wehage. I was quoted correctly, but I don't necessarily agree with anything else Boisseau or Wehage say, nor with the other people quoted. I gave permission to post part of my email to PW, but any conclusions drawn from my email are PW's or Boisseau's and nothing to do with me. I don't think I have always been correctly interpreted, and I wish to distance myself from the way my comments have been used.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I am not interested in individuals involved in canon formation/list making: it is the _process_ that interests me. Discussions over which male composers to exclude (in other words, to designate minor or unimportant) and on what grounds are just as much part of the canon formation process as whether to include female composers. The purpose of a list (or canon) is to come up with a limited number of composers (or whatever) that fit the criteria. I do not think anyone involved in the process is necessarily sexist; I do think the process is flawed wherever and whenever it occurs--not just on Wikipedia, but in published scholarly sources too. My answer to what I see as a problematic process (for all sorts of reasons, not just related to gender) is to try to abstain from making canons/lists. Of course, that is to an extent impossible: when I teach a course, I can't possibly include everything I would like to and so I have to leave certain things out. This is a process of selection and exclusion that is similar to canon formation. So, I admit the limitations of my critique: I don't like the process, and I try to subvert it (and the power dynamics) in my classes by having students bring in music and their own concerns too.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>I noticed you asked on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Gender_Studies_d57d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gender Studies">WikiProject Gender Studies</a> for background information about historical attitudes towards women during the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_England_ad9b.html" title="Victorian England">Victorian period</a> (which I take to mean between the mid 1830s, or thereabouts, to about 1900); my question, firstly, is whether you are interested in primary sources, general background about that period, or more specific secondary texts?</p>
<p>Anyway, it is worth keeping in mind that the period that you are talking about was defined - especially in Britain - by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, and the deep class divides and the radical thought that was produced as a result. Prior to about 1830 or 1840, radical political thought in Great Britain had been dominated by the ideas of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Owen_a7c4.html" title="Robert Owen">Robert Owen</a> (whose classic texts include "A New View of Society" and "Report to the Count of Lanark"). From there, you had a split between the successor movements of Owen (one of the most notable being the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochdale_Pioneers_5dc1.html" title="Rochdale Pioneers">Rochdale Pioneers</a>) and the early British Marxists (Engels famously dismissed Owen as being 'utopian' in "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific"). During this period, the right to vote had not been extended yet to many (working class, peasant, and under-class) men, let alone women; leading to movements such as the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartists.html" title="Chartists">Chartists</a> (of which a good history is given in G.D.H. Cole's "Chartist Portraits"). Anyway, if you want a good general history of the radical politics of the period, I most highly recommend the first few chapters of G.D.H. Cole's "A Century of Co-operation" (Cole, G.D.H., ‚ÄúA Century of Co-operation‚Äù, Oxford: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1944.) which covers all the movements I have just discussed.</p>
<p>The Victorian era (except for its latter years) pre-dates the <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragette.html" title="Suffragette">Suffragette</a> - like I said, the Chartist ideal of "Radical Sufferage for all men over 21" was considered quite radical at the time. Meanwhile, women were goverened under the doctrines of <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coverture.html" title="Coverture">Coverture</a> until the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Married_Women%27s_Property_Act_1882_184b.html" title="Married Women's Property Act 1882">Married Women's Property Act of 1882</a>. As for first-hand accounts from women during that period, it is worth pointing out that women were under-represented as authors (or significant political theorists) during the period. That having been said, there were a few notable exceptions; an example that immediately comes to mind is <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatrice_Webb_46d5.html" title="Beatrice Webb">Beatrice Webb</a>, who began writing during the later years of the Victorian era (Potter, Beatrice, ‚ÄúThe Co-operative Movement in Great Britain‚Äù, London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1891., for example; at one point this book interestingly codes consumers as women, and trade unionists as men, yet calls for equality between the two).</p>
<p>As for women's political movements during the period, you had, for example, the Women's Guilds, which are discussed on pp. 215 - 226 in Cole's "A Century of Co-operation", as well as in "Caring &amp; Sharing: The Centenary History of the Co-operative Women's Guild" by Jean Gaffin and David Thoms (Manchester: Co-operative Union, 1983.), "Feminism and the politics of working women: the Women's Co-operative Guild, 1880s to the Second World War" by Gillian Scott, and "The Women's Co-operative Guild, 1883-1904" by Margaret Llewelyn Davies (Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland: Women's Co-operative Guild, 1904.).</p>
<p>I hope I've been of assistance.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm mildly unhappy about subdividing operas by Sullivan into those with librettos by Gilbert and those without. What's the reasoning behind this? Why shouldn't it be done for, say, Verdi and Boito, or Mozart and da Ponte, or Britten and Myfanwy Piper?</p>
<p>And I'm *very* unhappy about having an entry for Gilbert. Are we to provide entries for Cammerano, Piave, et al? --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuillaumeTell_4aa9.html" title="User:GuillaumeTell">GuillaumeTell</a> 20:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the speedy reply. I can just about stomach a Gilbert entry which consists only of a "see Sullivan" note, but I can see no reason whatever for listing the rest of his pretty-much-forgotten operas under his name - he is far from being a special case in this respect. As for the Sullivan entry, I still can't see why it needs to be subdivided. Anyone who is interested in G&amp;S can look at the entries in WP for either of them, if they really don't know what their collaborations were.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I might add that I have nothing against G&amp;S (and indeed know large swathes of it back to front, and wrote a thesis on Gilbert in my younger days), but, as far as Opera is concerned, I feel that more of a sense of proportion is required if a rather small tail isn't seen to be perceived as trying to wag a very large dog. Best. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuillaumeTell_4aa9.html" title="User:GuillaumeTell">GuillaumeTell</a> 21:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure about the addition of Gilbert in the corpus list - it would be nice if there were a similar page for librettists, where he could best be served. But I think he's a bit out of place as it currently stands. The subdividing of Sullivan, on the other hand, I think is perfectly valid - I often see "Gilbert &amp; Sullivan" and "Arthur Sullivan" treated separately. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertHerring_12d3.html" title="User:AlbertHerring">User:AlbertHerring</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbertHerring_a4ee.html" title="User talk:AlbertHerring">Io son l'orecchio e tu la bocca: parla!</a></sup> 22:47, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to your note on my talk page: Please do *not* put any Bab Ballads text boxes in the 13 extant G&amp;S operas. On esoteric articles like <i>Topsyturvydom</i>, if you want to get academic, fine, but on the 13 G&amp;S operas, you must pretend that you are a person who has never seen any G&amp;S and you want to understand basic G&amp;S info. Esoteric information like the Bab Ballads is a digression from what people want to know when they look at, say, the <i>Patience</i> article. There can be a short explanation in the Background section about <i>The Rival Curates</i>, and there could be a "See Also" to relevant WP articles, but I really think that a text box containing information from non-G&amp;S source material would detract from a newbie's understanding rather than enhance it. -- <a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 14:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, You put a comment on the talk page for <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>. I think all of these come from <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_Allcounties_1b31.html" title="User:Morwen/Allcounties">User:Morwen/Allcounties</a> so it might be worth putting your point to <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">User:Morwen</a> or raising it as an issue at: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_geography_6ecd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography">Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography</a>.‚Äî <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">Rod</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodw_6741.html" title="User talk:Rodw">talk</a></sup> 15:10, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
To reply&#160;: well, it would be presently very difficult to do this to the map at <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>. I appreciate it looks perhaps a bit unfamiliar, (especially without Wales); but this sort of presentation is not uncommon. Scotland need clipped because it is really quite large; and therefore including it on a map would reduce the level of detail available to depict England with (these maps are quite small in the infobox, after all). The option of including coastline of non-England bits, whilst keeping most of Scotland clipped, is worthy of consideration, but I didn't much fancy doing this without also including <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pas_de_Calais_06f0.html" title="Pas de Calais">Pas de Calais</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, etc&#160;: also then you end up with no natural border&#160;: presently the images could easily be made background-transparent and set in whatever border you like. Contrary to some rather hurtful allegations made against me, this wasn't any kind of nationalist political POV pushing&#160;: it seemed sensible to show subdivisions within their parent grouping&#160;: and for better or worse the 4 parts are treated separately for local government. Also, it would be really quite odd for the locator maps of Scottish council areas to depict Kent, for example, and likewise Wales. So symmetry also implies England should be shown alone. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 15:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, it's a Tricky One. To be honest, if I was doing them from scratch today, I'd probably do it differently, and try to include all non-England coastlines within the area covered by the box, but at the time I didn't. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
