<p>Hi DS, as one of the other game players has stated as a comment to another user/administrator Dimes: "This is a real game. and whilst the rules written in a slightly tongue-in-cheek manner (i.e very verbose language was used) it was the best way to describe a relatively complex game.</p>
<p>I agree it is unreferenced, because we invented the game! How else will it get referenced without a start point at which to document it?"</p>
<p>I don't agree at all that this is a vandalous act, just an attempt to get more people interested in a game that many people around the world already play with some variations to the rules, these are simply our versions of the rules of "the advert game" as some call it an in true wikipedia style other users are free to edit and add to our page as they see fit</p>
<p><a name="Firstly" id="Firstly"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdamwjeffers_b162.html" title="Edit section: Firstly">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Firstly</span></h2>
<p>As a matter of protocol, when you leave a message on someone's talkpage, you should sign it. This is done by typing a row of four tildes, thusly: ~~~~. This will (when you're logged in) automatically create a link to your userpage. No harm done, it's a simple mistake.</p>
<p>Next, I do apologize for accusing of you being a vandal so quickly; the problem is that we get a lot, a lot, a <i><b>LOT</b></i> of vandals who create garbage articles, and sometimes even link them to each other, creating elaborate little webs of bullshit. We track them down via their User Contributions and delete their articles, yes, but we have to notice them first. And the idiotic articles you created about Dave inventing Robot Discotheque and so forth... those really didn't help. (More in a few minutes.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 15:25, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdamwjeffers_b162.html" title="Edit section: That's fair">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">That's fair</span></h2>
<p>Ok I agree the articles about myself and dave were just idiotic fun on my part and you were right to delete them. But we are serious (although still with a fun frame of mind) about getting the rules of "Boner!" published on this site. And plans are being drawn up for a website as my friend mentioned. However this may take a while and we would really appreciate it if you would allow the rules of "Boner!" to stay to use as a reference to anyone who asks about the game (sport) or anyone who simply stumbles accross it on this site.</p>
<p><a name="Okay" id="Okay"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdamwjeffers_b162.html" title="Edit section: Okay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Okay</span></h2>
<p>(First, sorry for the delay. Was doing things here that involved not being at the computer.)</p>
<p>Here's the thing, Adam. You want to use Wikipedia to make the Boner Game known to people? That's not what Wikipedia is for - as detailed in <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a>, for instance (in particular, "Wikipedia is not for original thought").</p>
<p>"I agree it is unreferenced, because we invented the game!", you said.</p>
<p>There's a very simple, very important rule for what to do if you want to write a Wikipedia article about yourself or your personal pet project.</p>
<p><i><b>DON'T.</b></i></p>
<p>Wikipedia isn't a starting point for things to become notable, it's a central repository of information for things that already <i>are</i>. Not necessarily famous, but noteworthy.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be "I'm Adam Jeffers and I want a Wikipedia article about myself!", it should be "who's this Adam Jeffers I've heard so much about? There should be a Wikipedia entry about him... oh, there isn't one yet? Let me see what I can find about him online, and then I'll make one myself."</p>
<p>It's the difference between setting up a webpage for yourself, and someone else (someone who doesn't know you) setting up an Adam Jeffers Fan Page.</p>
<p>We have to be strict about this: if we let people use Wikipedia for that sort of thing, it would very quickly become useless, because it would be hundreds, thousands, <i>tens</i> of thousands of articles about people's private games that they invented with their school friends and the stories they wrote that they never managed to finish and the pet names they call their girlfriends, and people would realize this, and no one would ever bother with it.</p>
<p>If your game deserves an entry, someone else, someone who isn't associated with you, will think so. Understand now? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 16:14, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
