<p>As far as I know, Hercules never wielded any gold mace described as "adamant" or "adamantine" in classical sources. Is this a Marvel creation?--Iainuki</p>
<p>Adamantine has been referred to on a couple of occassions in some sci-fi/fantasy novels featuring Conan The Barbarian, or Cimmerian whichever you prefer to call him. I know that Adamantine was at least mentioned in at least one of Robert E. Howard's original short stories featuring Conan. I admit that I'm not certain of the title of the short story, because it's been such a long while since I read it, or the name of any the novel in which Adamantine was mentioned because there are so damn many of them. In the novelization, Adamantine is referred to as a type of stone that's invulnerable rather than a metal. The story is set around a collection of warriors devoted to a long dead king transformed into Adamantine stone through sorcery to guard the tomb of this king for all eternity. The warriors are revived and begin wreaking havok and are invulnerable to all attack against it. However, this doesn't suggest "invulnerability" in the sense that it'd be indestructible to weapons used today or are used in comic books. Adamantine, at least in how Marvel Comics decided to use it, might be different than during the Hyborean Age, but the word itself existed long before Marvel Comics was around. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a></p>
<p>The history of the word itself is discussed at <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamant.html" title="Adamant">adamant</a>. Hesiod uses <i>adamas</i> to describe the sickle that Cronus castrates Uranus with in lines 161-162 of the Theogeny. However, nowhere in other original Greek or Roman sources that I'm familiar with does Hercules wield a club described as <i>adamas</i>, so I suspect this is a Marvel invention, doesn't belong in the main adamantium article, and thus I left it here.</p>
<p>You might add the notes on adamantine in Howard's Conan series to the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamant.html" title="Adamant">adamant</a> article, if you feel they're significant enough.--Iainuki</p>

<p>pepole,pepole what colonel wraith meant when he said is that the cage is "semi-unbreakable" is that it made from the similar alloy forging like wolverine's full pure adamantium but comparingly on a cheaper cost effective quality</p>
<p>bruce RIPPED-logan in half because even in the issue it self the doc.woman asks logan "i wonder is your joints are covered in adamantie" and as proven they are not because if they were he could'nt move smoothly then</p>
<p>even till this day the writers didn't sayed anything but if they will the explanation obvious sabretooth have one broken adamantie implant claw because it was accidently broken during forging proccess wich was rushed and sloppy</p>
<p>hulk also ripped adamantie-needle you are so cofused isn't it HE RIPPED THE SHELL OF THE NEEDLE YOU .....</p>

<p>Why exactly did my explanation of U Hulk tearing U Wolverine in half get reverted? It's the most probable explanation, and helps establish the unbreakability of Adamantium in both universes. ---mobn</p>

<dd>Probably because it violates a non-negotiable policy of Wikipedia called <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. Please read the policy, as the link will explain it very well; however, in a nutshell, what it means is that editors are not free to just add (even plausible) theories and speculation of their own, but should resort to reliable sources of information. Wikipedia is meant to reflect the well-researched spectrum of written human knowledge, and so sources and citations are very important.</dd>
<dd>Your edit was inappropriate, but since it seems reasonable, you should be able to find some appropriate sources perhaps that make the same statements. If you can find some notable figures in the comics community that has made similar statements, you are free to quote them. Probably just quoting some guy's webpage is not appropriate however. Since I'm not a comic person and not an editor of comic-related pages, I'll leave your edit, but be aware that it will probably get reverted by others upholding Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 03:57, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I reverted the edit, as explained in the edit summary, as it is speculation. I'm afraid that the problem is not whether it's plausible or not - the fact is that we don't know for sure why the Hulk managed to snape Wolverine in half. It's not stated in the comic, there's no evidence to suggest that the way adamantium is applied to bone is what you are saying. It's just your speculation, and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> as well as the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> policies apply.

<dd>It seems that if speculation is not allowed here, then the entire section of "Adamantium in the Ultimate Marvel Universe" should be removed. Some are speculating that the adamantium in Wolverine's bones were not broken, and some are arguing that any such speculation is not allowed. However, since there is a viable explanation for the metal not having been broken, which is backed up by Lindeloff having one character wonder what Wolverine's ligaments are made of, isn't it just as much speculation that the metal did break? If there is going to be a section for this, I think both "speculations" should be made, or leave that section out until the comic establishes one or the other. -- <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELannon_132c.html" title="User:Lannon">Lannon</a> 20:07, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite the same thing, as the section makes no definitive claims as to whether the adamantium did break or not - note the scare quotes around "unbreakable". What the section does point out is the evidence we've seen so far and presenting it straight to the reader, noting the controversy without drawing a conclusion either way or even leaning towards one, i.e. that's a NPOV. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 21:36, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've entangled myself in this discussion inadvertently, but I hope nobody minds my 2-cents...I think most of that section is fine, but the lead sentence "Recent events ... have shown" I don't believe <i>is</i> NPOV. In fact, the use of quotes around "unbreakable" in that context indicates to me that it is challenging the notion that Wikipedia is unbreakable. The sentence should be more along the lines of 'Recent events...may indicate ... that Adamantium is not quite "unbreakable"'. And I would think that if the writers write in some speculation into the story line (as it seems from Lannon's comment), I think it's worth mentioning at least without taking a side. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 02:37, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know, I'm quite satisfied with the section of the article. I don't see the article as really taking either side, simply reporting what's happened at this point in time, at least from my point of view. Ultimate Wolverine's skeleton is laced with Adamantium and he was ripped in half. Adamantium is supposed to be "unbreakable". It certainly seems to be in the mainstream Marvel Universe and everyone assumed it was the same in the Ultimate Marvel Universe. Whether ligaments were pulled apart or the metal itself was torn or whatever other theories are out there are simply that, just theories. All that's known for certain is that he was ripped in half and his skeleton is laced with Adamantium, so one has to conclude that Adamantium in the Marvel Universe isn't "unbreakable", at least until more is revealed as the mini-series progresses, or even if more is revealed about it. Changes can always be made in the section if more is revealed. But, until then, I say leave it as it is. However, I feel an addition should be made pointing out another difference of Adamantium between both universes. Within the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Wolverine is highly resistant to telepathy due to the presence of the Adamantium laced to his skull. Adamantium, within the mainstream Marvel Universe, doesn't grant Wolverine the same level of protection against psionic intrusion. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> (<a href="../../../o/d/i/User_talk%7EOdin%27s_Beard_27a3.html" title="User talk:Odin's Beard">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Odin%27s_Beard_47c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Odin's Beard">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I have to strongly disagree with the assertion that from the facts that 1) Wolverine was ripped in half and 2) His skeleton is laced with Adamantium, that "one has to conclude [Adamantium isn't unbreakable]...until more is revealed..." It's not a logically necessary conclusion, and it's just as much speculation as anything else, really. There is really only one conclusion from those two facts that is <i>not</i> speculation, and that is that Wolverine is not unbreakable because of his adamantium skeleton. Anything more is speculation, in my view, and I personally would require more than a blanket assertion that I have to conclude such-and-such in order to be convinced otherwise. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 06:15, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the real problem when it comes to Wikipedia articles dealing with fictional comic book characters, people view things differently based on what evidence is given. Artists and writers are free to pretty much do whatever they want to characters because of their personal view. From my view and interpretation of the information provided by Marvel Comics thus far, Adamantium isn't quite "unbreakable" in the Ultimate Marvel Universe. Now, of course, when more information is provided, then any necessary changes can be made. The article isn't set in stone, just like comic book characters themselves. The section dealing with Adamantium within the Ultimate Marvel Universe doesn't show favoritism toward any view, at least not in my opinion. I see it as just providing information based upon what's happening so far. Now, in this discussion area, I can state my personal opinion all that I want so long as I don't include it within the article itself. As I stated earlier, people are going to have different opinions on this particular issue even if Marvel Comics were to come right out and say that Adamantium within the Ultimate Marvel Universe isn't "unbreakable". Fans and insiders will still try to come up with an alternate explanation as to how Wolverine was ripped in half and just refuse to accept Adamantium, in either universe, not being "unbreakable".</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, what does this have to do with my comments? I'm saying that the article, as it currently stands, starts that section by saying that recent events have shown adamantium is not quite unbreakable. That's a clear assertion by Wikipedia that it is taking one side of this controversy. I'm saying that's not NPOV and should be changed. I undrstand that you are free to express your opinion on this talk page, but you have done so in defense of this POV statement by asserting that it is something one just has to conclude. In any case, I will change the sentence to not say "have shown" but merely "may indicate", as I am now convinced that wording is POV. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 00:36, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Evidently, the ones in charge of the site don't see it as it being a POV. I'm not trying to raise a stink over two words, but since you said that you're now convinced that the wording is POV, what makes you believe that you're right and not the one who wrote the section to begin with and those that've read over it and agreed with what was originally written? You say you're convinced that it's just opinion, I'm not. So, what makes your view any more relevant than my own or that of everyone else that's read over the section for the past month or so and not changed it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoa, chill. Just because no one picked up on it before doesn't mean that it's sacrosanct. If it's the choice of a more tentative phraseology, given the arguments for it above, I'd go for that phraseology, myself. Chan Ho's right - "shown" can be misconstrued as absolute proof. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 02:26, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm fine, I don't have a problem with anyone editing the section or anything like that. I said that some would see how the article is stated as suggesting that it's absolute proof and I pointed out that some don't. Chan Ho sees it one way, I see it as another. I'm just pointing out that no one has had issue with the section as it has been. I'm just defending my point of view as well. He says it's one way and changed it, I see it as another way and changed it back. *Shrugs* I'm not trying to make an issue out of it.</p>
<p>The fact that one of the Adamantium claws implanted in Ultimate Sabretooth's left forearm was somehow broken has been completely overlooked in the section involving Adamantium and it's questionable indestructibility within the Ultimate Marvel Universe. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a></p>
<p>The durability of adamantium in the UMU is irrelevant; Wolverine's soft tissues were rent asunder, not his bones. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkSoldier_63f1.html" title="User:DarkSoldier">DarkSoldier</a> 03:54, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then again, didn't the Wolverine in the zombie-verse have adamantium tendons and connective tissues as well?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd be willing to agree that it was probably his soft tissue being ripped apart, but the thing is, that's just my opinion. My opinion, nor the opinion of any other editor for that matter, has anything to do with what Marvel does with any of it's characters. Until Marvel says that's what happened, then it's just speculation. Even if Marvel does eventually confirm what happened, it doesn't negate the other instances involving adamantium in the UMU. Sabretooth's broken claw and the Hulk breaking an adamantium needle raise legitimate doubts as to adamantium being virtually "indestructible" in the UMU. As far as the Marvel Zombies event, I'm pretty sure his soft tissue wasn't laced with adamantium. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 00:05, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Concerning the needle in Ultimates #5, it is only said the needle is adamantium-tipped. I took this to mean it was designed to pierce the Hulk's skin, and not composed completely of adamantium. So when he broke the needle, he was breaking whatever the rest of the needle was composed of, and not adamantium.</p>
<p>So you're suggesting that only a tiny part of the needle, primarily just the tip, was composed of adamantium and the rest of the needle wasn't? That really doesn't make much sense to me. But, granted, they don't always do the sensible thing in comics or pay attention to little things like the laws of nature. But, it just seems rather....well..odd to have a needle with the tip composed of adamantium and have the rest of it be made of a conventional metal. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 00:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I seem to remember a few instances when Wolverine had to deal with "Adamantium poisoning". When the metal was removed from his body, his healing factor dramatically increased. This was explained that his body was always fighting adamantium poisoning and his healing factor was subsequently reduced. Also, when adamantium was put back into his body and Wolverine temporarily lost his healing factor, he received injections to counteract the poisoning. But non of the other adamantium recipiants ever mentioned poisoning. Is adamantium poisoning canonical? Writer oversight? An example of Wolverine's allergic reaction? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlGorup_b3f5.html" title="User:AlGorup">AlGorup</a> 16:11, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I recall the storyline involving Adamantium poisoning. I forget the exact issues off the top of my head, but the High Evolutionary constructed a device that effectively shut off the mutant abilities of every mutant on Earth, including Wolverine, which resulted in him slowly dying of Adamantium poisoning. It's similar to Omega Red in the past. In order to sustain his own life, Omega Red was forced to siphon the life energies of other beings to offset the poisonous effects that the Carbonadium implants had on him. While Wolverine was imprisoned within the Vault, which is a prison designed to house superhuman criminals, he did have to recieve some unnamed injections to help him stave off Adamantium poisoning because the area of the prison was surrounded by a type of energy field that nullified superhuman powers, even those that were mystical in origin like the powers of the Absorbing Man. So, as far as I know, Adamantium poisoning is considered canonical. It's fairly obscure since it's only been used during these two storylines, but I think it's canonical.</p>
<p>What's the scope of the poisoning? Why do we see only Wolverine suffering it? Wolverine is the most famous Adamantium implant. Also most of the other implants also have healing factors to compensate for it, but that leaves the other implants, such as Bullseye.</p>

<dd>Bullseye still has normal bones, allowing him to get away with a adamantitum spine. <a href="../../../t/-/1/User%7ET-1000_f0da.html" title="User:T-1000">T-1000</a> 17:23, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I remember reading, Adamantium poisoning was a slow and painful process. During the storyline where the High Evolutionary shut off the mutant powers of every mutant, Wolverine was shown in a couple of issues of the X-Men titles and his own series suffering some of the affects. For the most part during that time, Wolverine was an ordinary human with an extraordinarily high tolerance of pain. As to why only Wolverine was shown to be suffering from it, it was probably because he was the character on the Marvel roster to make monthly appearances that had Adamantium laced bones. I know Lady Deathstrike has an Adamantium skeleton as well, but she's almost completely mechanical now so I don't believe the High Evolutionary's machine would have affected her and I think the storyline occurred before Sabretooth recieved his second set of implants via the Weapon X Program. I recall that, after the H.E.'s machine was destroyed, Omega Red was shown in a panel screaming "YES!!" triumphantly because he felt his powers returning. Since Carbonadium is the Soviet's attempt to create Adamantium, I'd assume he suffered some ill effects but they just weren't shown. As for Bullseye, I honestly haven't got a clue. I might be wrong, but I don't know if Marvel has ever explained why Bullseye doesn't suffer from Adamantium poisoning. The best explanation that I can think of is that that Adamantium poisoning is fairly obscure and, since it's obscure, nobody at Marvel has deemed it necessary to do a storyline about it involving Bullseye. If they ever did, a simple answer as to how Bullseye withstands it would be to say that he gets some sort of injections on a regular basis, as Wolverine did while he was imprisoned within the Vault. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a></p>

<dd>I vaguely recall reading in one of the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe_ebb1.html" title="Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe">OHotMU</a> entries that Wolverine's bones are laced with Adamantium, but Bullseye's spine is reinforced with <i>Adamantium-Beta</i>, a compound as strong as Adamantium that does not inhibit the normal biological processes of bone. If this is (still) the case, then it would explain why Wolvie suffers from Adamantium Poisoning when his Healing Factor's nullified, but Bullseye, who has no Healing Factor at all, isn't bothered by it. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 17:38, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember part of a storyline that stated that Kitty Pride had difficulty phasing through adamantium. It caused her pain, nausia, and dizziness. But that's it. Only once. In one story where, by phasing through Sabertooth, she "discovered" that his bones possessed adamantium. Any other occurance that adamantium restricting/reducing phasing? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlGorup_b3f5.html" title="User:AlGorup">AlGorup</a> 16:23, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>She had a similar experience, I believe, in a confrontation with Wolverine while he was one of Apocalypse's Horsemen. It occurred while Wolverine was somewhere under the Xavier Institute while Archangel, Kitty, and I think Nightcrawler, were trying to apprehend him. She tried to phase through him, which would have shocked his nervous system, but it didn't quite work out the way she wanted. I think she experienced some of the similar symptoms she exhibited during the altercation with Sabretooth. She was holding her own for a while, she was using a sword and since Wolverine had trained her quite a bit, she was doing pretty well. She was, mostly, using her powers to phase most of her body so that when his claws hit her, they simply passed through her while using the sword offensively. After a while though, Wolverine's claws kind of....hmmm..well shorted out her phasing abilities enough to cause her to become solid. He rammed one of his claws through one of her feet. He managed to snap out of the conditioning before killing her. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a></p>

<p>I was catching up on some old Wolverine issues (v3. #170 - #180) and saw in one story that Wolverine's skeleton provided resistance to posession from an evil, magical entity (it was the issue w/ Michael Two youngmen of Alpha Flight rescuing Sasquatch and Puck). Any other instance of adamantium providing additional resistance to magical posession? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlGorup_b3f5.html" title="User:AlGorup">AlGorup</a> 14:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That could be due to Adamantium having iron in it, and iron often fracks up magic (in comics). <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 19:25, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None that I recall; from everything I've read, the only way to 'melt' it is to expose it to <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibranium.html#Antarctic_Vibranium" title="Vibranium">Anti-Metal</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 18:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't believe it can be melted other than by using Antarctic Vibranium. Adamantium is supposed to be able to withstand nuclear blasts without even getting scratched. How much heat is generated by a nuclear blast at ground zero? Whenever Adamantium is created, and however it's done, they have to keep it molten. I've read that it's kept in vats heated at 1,500 degrees Farenheit and can be poured into molds to create useful things but it has to be kept at that temperature. Once it cools and hardens, then it's almost impossible to do squat with it. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 00:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think that it's really acurate to label Uru being as durable as Adamantium. There are some examples, all of which are canon, in which Uru has been cracked and even outright destroyed. For instance, in Thor #450, a macically enchanted Rock Troll named Uroc possessed a body made entirely of Uru. His right hand was frozen in Liquid Nitrogen and was shattered after being hit with a single, ordinary bullet. Also, while I'm not exactly certain of the issue numbers, but I believe it was was somewhere between Thor(vol2) #14-25 Odin used his powers to repair damaged that Mjolnir had suffered in a storyline in which he battled a being named Enkrant. I've read when Adamantium was introduced, like back in the 1960's, Thor was able to barely dent a small cylinder of Adamantium after striking it with Mjolnir with all of his strength. Now, whether this has been retconned or not I'm not sure, since it happened roughly 40 years ago. However, as far as I know, Adamantium, at least True Adamantium, has never been broken, at least not within the mainstream Marvel Universe. The only, canon, instance I've seen in which Adamantium was destroyed in any way was during the whole Infinity Gauntlet storyline where Thanos used the Gauntlet's powers to practically turn Wolverine's Adamantium skeleton into a rubbery, sponge-like, substance. Adamantium is said to be able to withstand nuclear blasts without sustaining damage, and the instances I mentioned about Uru seem to show it capable of sustaining considerably less damage than Adamantium. Don't get me wrong, not trying to start any sort of debate or anything. However, in a nutshell, I've haven't read any Marvel publication stating Uru is as durable. I might be wrong, if I am let me know how so. Otherwise, the statement needs to come out. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 01:30, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
