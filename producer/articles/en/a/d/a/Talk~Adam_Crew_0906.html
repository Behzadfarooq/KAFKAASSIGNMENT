	    <p>It appears that I have not asserted the significance of this young man, which, as you must realize, is somewhat difficult to do when one is trying to provide a neurtral point of view. However, I assure you that his imporance in that art world cannot be understated. Mr Crew has begun turning out some of the most original and captivating work I've seen in quite some time. His technique is cutting-edge and serious collectors of art have begun to take notice. Young Crew has been touted as a future star in the world of contemporary art, and in a world where the finer arts are pushed aside for less enlightened forms of entertainment I cannot stress enough how important young, media-friendly stars are to the culture of current day art. It would be a shame to keep this young man away from wikipedia viewers across the globe.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> His talent or potential is not in question. But, I see no evidence of his <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a>. If you could post some significant independant reviews or list his awards it would go a long way towards establishing his notability. Wikipedia is not a forum for promoting promising artists. It is for those that have already acheived verifiable notability. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 18:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Very true, very true. I see what you mean.</p>
<p>I have a review from 'ArtisSpectrum' magazine:</p>
<p>"We all know Adam Crew’s subjects. They are beautiful, famous women who know how to strike a pose – Paris Hilton, Kate Moss, Natalie Portman. We immediately recognize the familiar faces and the expressions that have often decorated the covers of celebrity magazines. As we look on, however, Crew’s ink paintings start to change form and come alive. Suddenly, the familiar women become what they always were – glamorized strangers. We easily lose hold of Paris Hilton’s legendary squint as she turns into an unfamiliar pin-up girl. As we look on, Natalie Portman’s defiant face turns her into a teenage rebel. She could be a punk from the eighties or a rocker from the sixties. She is no longer Natalie Portman, she could be anyone. The way these portraits slip out from our reach speaks volumes about the nature of celebrity worship. Fascinated by the people in the public arena, Crew poignantly captures the ambiguity of their emotions, the inscrutability of their private selves, as well as our constant struggle to glamorize them or bring them down."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Er, ArtisSpectrum is published by the gallery that represents Mr. Crew. Normally we look for independant reviews. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 19:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, true independant art reviews are few and far between, as tradional magazines avoid any artists who's gallery does not pay significant prices for advertising space. Such galleries who can afford to do so tend to deal only with artists who have long-term notariety, ignoring those who pump the necessary young blood and enthusiasm into the artistic culture.</p>
<p>However, I do agree that reviews tend to add a certain amounts of legitamicy to an individual, ironicaly, so do sites such as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It was my impression that this website would be the ideal place for individuals to share and debate information not availalbe to them through static publications such as ArtForum, or ArtNews. The mass appeal of this site to me has always been the accountability of the information posted, as false and half-truths would be swiftly noticed and edited by knowledgeable readers within the site's community.</p>
<p>Awards and accolades are of course always nice, but to my knowlegde those who have firmly planted themselves within the art community, such as Mr Crew has, rarely have the need or time to enter such competitions. It is safe to say that to such artists a sale of work totalling thousands of dollars brings in much more sustenance and respect than would an award.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> As the former director of an art gallery myself, I fully understand your point. However, one of the key tenets of Wikipedia is that of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. Without it, we are basically taking the word of the author of an article that the subject is notable. In my experience, once an artist becomes notable, there is generally no real shortage of people willing to write a blurb about him or to promote a show for him in their gallery. It's hard to get to that point but that is what notability is all about. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 20:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I see, I see. Well, fortunately I believe Mr Crew has a show coming up within the next few weeks. Perhaps I can gather some more information and try again at such a time. Thank you for your help on this matter.</p>
