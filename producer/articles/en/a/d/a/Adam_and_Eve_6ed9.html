<p><b>Documentary hypothesis</b>: The <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_hypothesis.html" title="Documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a> is a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_criticism.html" title="Source criticism">theory</a> that the first five books of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, the Jewish <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>, are a combination of documents from different sources rather than authored by one individual. It had its origin in the interpretation that these five books contained many inconsistencies and apparent contradictions. For example, Genesis 1 says man was created after the plants and animals, but they interpret Genesis 2 to place the creation of man before the plants and animals.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The modern version of the hypothesis is that the chapters of Genesis which contain the Adam and Eve story are drawn from two originally separate texts, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priestly_source.html" title="Priestly source">Priestly source</a> and the <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahwist.html" title="Jahwist">Jahwist</a> source.</p>
<p>The "Priestly source" is held to be responsible for chapter 1 and the first four verses of chapter 2,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and the "Jahwist" to provide the bulk of chapters 2 to 4.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Despite coming first in Genesis, the Priestly (or "P") source is considered the more recent of the two. "Recent" in this context is purely a relative term: P is conjectured to have been composed at some period between the fall of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">kingdom of Israel</a> to the Assyrians in 722 BC, and the final conquest of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Judah_501d.html" title="Kingdom of Judah">Judah</a> by the Babylonians in 586 BC, with a possible date during the reign of king <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah.html" title="Josiah">Josiah</a> of Judah in the late 7th century BC. The Jahwist, or "J" source, is conjectured to have been composed in the kingdom of Judah before the fall of Israel (i.e., before 722 BC), but not before the late 8th century.</p>
<p>A hypothetical separate source, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Generations_5e2e.html" title="Book of Generations">Book of Generations</a>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> provides chapter 5 and a brief linking phrase at Genesis 2:5. As the name indicates, this source as reconstructed is concerned exclusively with lists of names, in the form X begat Y. It is believed to be older than both J and P, and to have existed in various editions. Differences between these unattested 'editions' have also been assumed because of alleged confusions in the Biblical genealogies; for example, chapter 4:17 to 18 and chapter 5:3 to 26 are taken as giving similar information, because the father of a <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamech.html" title="Lamech">Lamech</a> is named <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methusael.html" title="Methusael">Methusael</a> in the genealogy of Cain's descendants in chapter 4, and the father of Lamech is named <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methuselah.html" title="Methuselah">Methuselah</a> in the genealogy of Seth's descendants in chapter 5, although traditionalist clergy maintain that this is not a discrepancy, but two entirely separate genealogies.</p>
<p>The "<a href="../../../g/e/n/Generations_of_Adam_427c.html" title="Generations of Adam">Generations of Adam</a>", as Genesis 5 is called, uses a form of words implying the creation of more than a single man and woman: "Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The P source uses similar language: "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Only J has an unambiguous single male and female. J (chapter 2) begins in the same way as the other two sources, with God taking "adamah" (dust) and fashioning "adam", the word translated as "man" in Genesis 1 and Genesis 5. Only towards the end of chapter 2, when the first humans are about to be expelled from the Garden, does J cease referring to "man" and start writing about "the man". In Jewish belief of the time of Christ this was taken as signifying a personal name, Adam, and this tradition was adopted into Christianity.</p>
<p>Only J has a separate name for Adam's companion, traditionally written as "Eve" in English, from Hebrew “chavva,” meaning simply <i>living one</i>, or <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a></i>.</p>

<i>Enki and Ninhursag</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Sumerian myth the senior gods spent their time in leisure, while the junior gods laboured at digging the channels of the rivers and other tasks. Eventually the junior gods rebelled and threatened to overturn the heavenly order. The senior god Enki therefore fashioned the first men from clay, mixed with spittle and the blood of a slain god, so that men could work and the gods could rest. Originally Enki made seven men and seven women, but the numbers of mankind soon multiplied.</p>
<p>In another Sumerian myth the goddess <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninhursag.html" title="Ninhursag">Ninhursag</a> created a beautiful garden full of lush vegetation and fruit trees, called Edinu, in <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilmun.html" title="Dilmun">Dilmun</a>, the Sumerian <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthly_Paradise_3883.html" title="Earthly Paradise">earthly Paradise</a>, a place which the Sumerians believed to exist to the east of their own land, beyond the sea. Ninhursag charged <a href="../../../e/n/k/Enki.html" title="Enki">Enki</a>, her lover, with controlling the wild animals and tending the garden, but Enki became curious about the garden and his assistant, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adapa.html" title="Adapa">Adapa</a>, selected seven plants and offered them to Enki, who ate them. (In other versions of the story he seduced in turn seven generations of the offspring of his divine marriage with Ninhursag). This enraged Ninhursag, and she caused Enki to fall ill. Enki felt pain in his rib, which is a pun in Sumerian, as the word "ti" means both "rib" and "life. The other gods persuaded Ninhursag to relent. Ninhursag then created a new goddess named <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninti.html" title="Ninti">Ninti</a>, (a name made up of "Nin", or "lady", plus "ti", and which can be translated as both Lady of Living and Lady of the Rib), to cure Enki. Ninhursag is known as mother of all living creatures, and thus holds the same position as Eve. The story has a clear parallel with Eve's creation from Adam's rib, but given that the pun with rib is present only in Sumerian, linguistic criticism<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> places the Sumerian account as the more ancient.</p>
<p>By the Babylonian era, Enki's place was taken by Adapa Uan (the <a href="../../../o/a/n/Oannes.html" title="Oannes">Oannes</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berossus.html" title="Berossus">Berossus</a>), a human created by Enki as advisor to the first king of Enki's city of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eridu.html" title="Eridu">Eridu</a>. A 14th century BC tablet refers to Adapa as the seed of humankind. One myth recounts that Adapa broke the wings of the wind in anger at being disturbed while fishing, and was called to the heavens to answer for doing so. He was warned by Enki to apologise for his actions, but not to touch the food, in case it had been poisoned in revenge. The gods, impressed by his penitence, set the food and drink of immortality before him, but Adapa heeded Enki's warning and refused the food, thus missing out on immortality. The god who offered the food and drink of immortality was the wily serpent-god <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ningishzida.html" title="Ningishzida">Ningishzida</a>. In the Biblical account the serpent offers knowledge, but he also says to Eve that she shall not die.</p>
<p>As the food and drink of the gods originated on earth, somewhere on earth must lie the source of the food and drink of immortality, a Tree of Life. In the biblical account the fruit of knowledge of good and evil is consumed, not rejected, and the couple are punished by being expelled from the garden for disobeying God's command to not eat the fruit of that tree. Thus any derivation of the biblical account from Sumerian and Babylonian mythology involves the confusion of the tales of Adapa and Enki. Such a conflation may have been influenced by a story preserved in the prologue of <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgamesh%2C_Enkidu_and_the_Underworld_5b54.html" title="Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Underworld">Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Underworld</a>. In this tale, the goddess <a href="../../../i/n/a/Inanna.html" title="Inanna">Inanna</a>, who gains knowledge of sex by descending to earth and eating from various plants and fruits, transplants the huluppu tree from the Euphrates to her own garden, but a wicked serpent made its nest amongst the roots of the tree. This tale connects the serpent to the garden, and with the presence of Inanna, the theme of lust. Moving the story of Enki's rib to the start of the Biblical story would allow the failure to gain immortality to be seen as punishment for eating the fruit.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Edit section: Adam's rib">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adam's rib</span></h3>
<p>Anatomically, men and women have the same number of <a href="../../../r/i/b/Rib.html" title="Rib">ribs</a> - 24 (unless they have an extra bi-lateral cervical set of ribs). When this fact was noted by the Flemish anatomist <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vesalius.html" title="Vesalius">Vesalius</a> in 1524 it touched off a wave of controversy, since it was thought to contradict Genesis 2:21:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man" (<a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Genesis#2:21" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Genesis">Genesis 2:21</a>–22)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Controversy regarding the "rib" continues to the present day, regarding the Sumerian and the original Hebrew words for rib. The common translation, for example, that of the King James Version, is that <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אַחַת מִצַּלְעֹתָיו</span> means "one of his ribs". The contrary position is that the term <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צלע</span> <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ṣelaʿ</span></i>, occurring forty-one times in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, is most often translated as "side" in general.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>. "Rib" is, however, the etymologically primary meaning of the term, which is from a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triliteral.html" title="Triliteral">root</a> <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ṣ-l-ʿ</span></i>, "bend", cognate to Assyrian <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ṣêlu</span></i> "rib".<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Also God took "one" ( <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ʾeḫad</span></i>) of Adam's <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ṣelaʿ</span></i>, suggesting an individual rib. The <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> has <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">μίαν τῶν πλευρῶν αὐτοῦ</span>, with <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἡ πλευρά</span> choosing a Greek term that like the Hebrew <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ṣelaʿ</span></i> may mean either "rib", or, in the plural, "side [of a man or animal]" in general. The specification "<i>one</i> of the πλευρά" thus closely imitates the Hebrew text. The <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> form of the word is <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">עלע</span> <i><span title="Semitic transliteration" class="Semitic Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: none">ʿalaʿ</span></i>, which appears, also in the meaning "rib", in <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Daniel#7:5" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Daniel">Daniel 7:5</a>.</p>
<p>An old story of the rib is told by Rabbi Joshua:</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibylline_Oracles_7e94.html" title="Sibylline Oracles">Sibylline Oracles</a>, the name Adam is explained as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notaricon.html" title="Notaricon">notaricon</a> composed of the initials of the four directions; <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatole.html" title="Anatole">anatole</a> (east), dusis (west), <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arktos.html" title="Arktos">arktos</a> (north), and <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesembria.html" title="Mesembria">mesembria</a> (south). The Jews had their own <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrostic.html" title="Acrostic">acrostic</a> interpretation of the name Adam. In the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century.html" title="2nd century">2nd century</a>, Rabbi Yohanan used the Greek technique of notarichon to explain the name אָדָם as the initials of the words <i>afer</i>, <i>dam</i>, and <i>marah</i>, being dust, blood, and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gall.html" title="Gall">gall</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Torah (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 2:7), Adam is said to have been formed by God from "dust from the earth"; in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> (Tractate Sanhedrin 38b) of the first centuries of the Christian era he is, more specifically, described as having initially been a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golem.html" title="Golem">golem</a> kneaded from <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mud.html" title="Mud">mud</a>. (cf <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prometheus.html" title="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>) In the Torah, God is described, at Genesis 1:26, as breathing the <i>breath of life</i> into the nostrils of the first man, and this is usually interpreted in Judaeo-Christian circles as having brought life immediately to the first man.</p>
<p>At this point, in the Torah, God is described as causing a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and removing part of his body, usually interpreted as a <a href="../../../r/i/b/Rib_cage.html" title="Rib cage">rib</a> (though a more literal translation is non-specific, referring to "side"). Once a matron asked Rabbi José (Talmud<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>), "Why did God steal a rib from Adam?" "Steal?" replied the Sage. "If one were to take away from your house an ounce of silver, and give you in return a pound of gold, that would not be stealing from you." "But," persisted the matron, "what need was there for secrecy?" "It was surely better," replied R. José, "to present Eve to Adam when she was quite presentable, and when no traces of the effects of the operation were visible"<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/mhl/mhl05.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/mhl/mhl05.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Even in ancient times, the presence of two distinct accounts was noted, and regarded with some curiosity. The first account says <i>male and female [God] created them</i>, which has been assumed by critical scholars to imply simultaneous creation, whereas the second account states that God created Eve from Adam's rib because Adam was lonely. Thus to resolve this apparent discrepancy, mediaeval rabbis suggested that Eve and the woman of the first account were two separate individuals.</p>
<p>Preserved in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a>, and the mediaeval <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet_of_Ben_Sira_6e1c.html" title="Alphabet of Ben Sira">Alphabet of Ben Sira</a>, this rabbinic tradition held that the first woman refused to take the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary_position.html" title="Missionary position">submissive position</a> to Adam in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sex</a>, and eventually fled from him, consequently leaving him lonely. This first woman was identified in the Midrash as <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilith.html" title="Lilith">Lilith</a>, a figure elsewhere described as a night demon.</p>
<p>The word <i>liyliyth</i> can also mean "screech owl", as it is translated in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version</a> of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 34:14, although some scholars take this to be a reference to the same demonic entity as mentioned in the Talmud.</p>
<p>In the Talmud, Adam is said to have separated from Eve for 130 years, during which time his <a href="../../../e/j/a/Ejaculation.html" title="Ejaculation">ejaculations</a> gave rise to <i>ghouls, and demons</i>. Elsewhere in the Talmud, Lilith is identified as the mother of these creatures. The demons were said to prey on newborn males before they had been <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcised.html" title="Circumcised">circumcised</a>, and so a tradition arose in which a protective amulet was placed around the neck of newborns. Traditions in the Midrash concerning Lilith, and her sexual appetite, have been compared to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_mythology.html" title="Sumerian mythology">Sumerian mythology</a> concerning the demon <i>ki-sikil-lil-la-ke</i>, by scholars who postulate an intermediate <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian</a> <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> interpreting the <i>lil-la-ke</i> portion of the name as a corruption of <i>lîlîtu</i>, literally meaning <i>female night demon</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> Midrash goes even further and identifies a third wife, created after Lilith deserted Adam, but before Eve. This unnamed wife was purportedly made in the same way as Adam, from the "dust of the earth", but the sight of her being created proved too much for Adam to take and he refused to go near her. It is also said that she was created from nothing at all, and that God created into being a skeleton, then organs, and then flesh. The Midrash tells that Adam saw her as "full of blood and secretions," suggesting that he witnessed her creation and was horrified at seeing a body from the inside out. Ben Sira does not record this wife's fate. She was never named, and it assumed that she was allowed to leave the Garden a perpetual virgin, or was ultimately destroyed by God in favor of Eve, who was created when Adam was asleep and oblivious. It should be noted here, that both Lilith and the Second Wife are free from any curse of the Tree of Knowledge, as they left long before the event occurred.</p>
<p>Genesis does not tell for how long Adam and Eve were in the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_of_Eden_033d.html" title="Garden of Eden">Garden of Eden</a>, but the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jubilees_6fc9.html" title="Book of Jubilees">Book of Jubilees</a> states that they were removed from the garden on the new moon of the fourth month of the 8th year after creation (Jubilees 3:33); other Jewish sources assert that it was less than a day. Shortly after their expulsion, Eve brought forth her first-born child, and thereafter their second — <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain_and_Abel_df7c.html" title="Cain and Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>Another Jewish tradition — also used to explain "male and female He created them" line, is that God originally created Adam as a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermaphrodite.html" title="Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> [Midrash Rabbah - Genesis VIII:1]<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and in this way was bodily and spiritually male and female. He later decided that "it is not good for [Adam] to be alone", and created the separate beings of Adam and Eve, thus creating the idea of two people joining together to achieve a union of the two separate spirits.</p>

<p>Only three of Adam's children (<a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel.html" title="Abel">Abel</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth.html" title="Seth">Seth</a>) are explicitly named in Genesis, although it does state that there were other sons and daughters as well (Genesis 5:4). In <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jubilees_6fc9.html" title="Book of Jubilees">Jubilees</a>, two daughters are named - Azûrâ being the first, and Awân, who was born after Seth, Cain, Abel, nine other sons, and Azûrâ. Jubilees goes on to state that Cain later married Awân and Seth married Azûrâ, thus, accounting for their descendants. However, according to <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_Rabba_a4f0.html" title="Genesis Rabba">Genesis Rabba</a></i> and other later sources, either Cain had a twin sister, and Abel had two twin sisters, or Cain had a twin sister named Lebuda, and Abel a twin sister named Qelimath. In the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_Adam_and_Eve_with_Satan_69a4.html" title="Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan">Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan</a>, Cain's twin sister is named Luluwa, and Abel's twin sister is named Aklia.</p>

As the first man, Adam was traditionally a significant figure to whom was attributed prophecy and wisdom.</p>
<p>After Cain killed Abel, and was cursed to wander, Adam and Eve conceived a third child named Seth, who, with Cain, gave rise to the two family lines of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generations_of_Adam_427c.html" title="Generations of Adam">Generations of Adam</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Adam finally died at the age of 930 years, the traditional Jewish view being that he and Eve are currently buried in the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_of_Machpelah_09e3.html" title="Cave of Machpelah">Cave of Machpelah</a>, in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebron.html" title="Hebron">Hebron</a>.</p>

<p>Some branches of Christianity fully accept the tradition of Adam and Eve as portrayed in the Bible, and although some hold various views expressed in the Pseudepigrapha, they do not accept the later Jewish <i>Midrash</i>.</p>
<p>The story of Adam and Eve forms the basis for the doctrine of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a>, a doctrine that is held as true by many branches of Christianity, but is not shared by the Orthodox<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> or Congregationalist churches, nor by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> nor <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. "Sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned," said <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a> in his <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a>, writing in Greek about 58.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Augustine_of_Hippo_1143.html" title="St Augustine of Hippo">St Augustine of Hippo</a> (354-430), working with a Latin mistranslation of the epistle, understood Paul to have said that Adam's sin was hereditary: "Death passed upon (i.e. spread to) all men because of Adam, [in whom] all sinned".<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup> Original sin, the concept that man is born in a condition of sinfulness and must await redemption, became a cornerstone of Christian theological tradition, primarily in Western-rite churches.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, a system of uniquely Christian beliefs has developed from the Adam and Eve story. <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a>, which predates Christianity has become understood as a means of washing away the stain of hereditary sin in some churches. In other branches of Christianity, baptism is a means of washing away sins that were actually committed by the person being baptised. It is an identification with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a ceremony of spiritually washing one in the blood of the Savior, which was shed on the cross. In still other Christian traditions, this process is merely seen as a symbol of faith and also an initiation, or a public declaration of faith.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup> Additionally, the serpent that tempted Eve was interpreted by some to have been <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>, although there is no mention of this identification in the Torah. In fact, Genesis does not even hint at any of these readings, and their observance by many Christians has marked the religion's radical break from its parent.</p>
<p>Because Eve had tempted Adam to eat of the fatal fruit, some early <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fathers_of_the_Church_1e5c.html" title="Fathers of the Church">Fathers of the Church</a> held her and all subsequent women to be the first sinners, and especially responsible for the Fall. "You are the devil's gateway," <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> told his female listeners in the early 2nd century, and went on to explain that they were responsible for the death of Christ: "On account of your desert _ that is, death - even the Son of God had to die."<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup> In 1486 the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicans.html" title="Dominicans">Dominicans</a> Kramer and Sprengler used similar tracts to justify the <i><a href="../../../m/a/l/Malleus_Maleficarum_9720.html" title="Malleus Maleficarum">Malleus Maleficarum</a></i> ("Hammer of the Witches") that led to three centuries of persecution of "witches".</p>

<p>While the <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnostic.html" title="Gnostic">Gnostics</a> used scriptural texts as teaching devices, rather than viewing them to be literal accounts genuinely written by early patriarchs, this was the converse of what was true of what became official Christianity. The <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnostic.html" title="Gnostic">Gnostic</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nag_Hamadi_4ef0.html" title="Nag Hamadi">Nag Hamadi</a> text "<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_of_Adam_c7c8.html" title="Apocalypse of Adam">Apocalypse of Adam</a>", for instance contains the account of the enlightenment Adam received, for which certain angels became jealous. The "<a href="../../../t/e/s/Testament_of_Adam_5079.html" title="Testament of Adam">Testament of Adam</a>", for example takes a further step to produce a faked ancient prophecy, of events that had supposedly already occurred by the time it was published.</p>
<p>In certain forms of Christian <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> the creation of Adam as Protanthropos - the original man, had a very important place. The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_of_Adam_c7c8.html" title="Apocalypse of Adam">Apocalypse of Adam</a> suggests that Adam and Eve were originally conjoined in a single androgynous being both male and female and greater than the eternal angels and higher than Samael, the God of the Aeon and Powers that had created them. This seems to be what Irenaeus (I, xxix, 3) refers to when he states that the Aeon Autogenes (self-created Aeon) creates a true and perfect human Anthrôpos, also called Adamas, who has "Perfect Knowledge. In wrath of Samael, the God of the Aeon then separated Adam from Eve, causing their superior knowledge of God to flee from them.</p>
<p>The Perfection of the Protanthropos is also sometimes seen as a result of a non material emanation from God, called the Son of God and seen as the prefigurement for the appearance of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, who, even in Conventional Christian literature is often referred to as "The Second Adam". According to the Naassenes it is only when Adam and Eve are separated that they "sink" into material form. The Genesis verse, that "according to the image of God he made them, male and female he made them", implied that the first account of the creation of man and woman, according to Theodotus (<i>c.</i> 160), that both man and God were anthropogynous beings, later separated by God, the Father/Mother. As <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_Pagels_7e74.html" title="Elaine Pagels">Pagels</a> shows "The followers of Valentinus suggested that the Mother herself had encouraged the God of Israel to think he was acting autonomously, but as they explain, "It was because he was foolish and ignorant of his Mother that he said, 'I am (the only) God; there is no-one beside me'. (p.69) In the Secret Book of John, the creator of Adam and Eve, when he said: 'I am a jealous God and there is no other God besides me.' But by announcing this he indicated to the angels ... that another God does exist; for if there were no other one, of whom would he be jealous?... Then the Mother began to be distressed."</p>

<p>This is taken up in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manichaean.html" title="Manichaean">Manichaean</a> belief that the Protanthropos is seen as "the World Soul", (<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anima_mundi_%28spirit%29.html" title="Anima mundi (spirit)">Anima Mundi</a>), sent to fight against darkness. The "Fall" is then seen as the primordial man being delivered up to evil and swallowed in darkness, with the Universe as a whole now existing as a means of delivering the primordial Adam from Darkness. Here too the intercourse between Adam and Eve was seen as the way in which darkness overcame the light.</p>

<dd>"Mani said, 'Then Jesus came and spoke to the one who had been born, who was Adam, and explained to him (about) the gardens (of Paradise), the deities, Gehenna, the satans, earth, heaven, sun, and moon. He also made him fear Eve, showing him how to suppress (desire) for her, and he forbade him to approach her, and made him fear to be near her, so that he did (what Jesus commanded). Then that (male) archon came back to his daughter, who was Eve, and lustfully had intercourse with her. He engendered with her a son, deformed in shape and possessing a red complexion, and his name was Cain, the Red Man. Then that son had intercourse with his mother, and engendered with her a son of white complexion, whose name was Abel, the White Man. Then Cain again had intercourse with his mother, and engendered with her two girls, one of whom was named Hakimat al-Dahr and the other Ibnat al-Hirê . Then Cain took Ibnat al-Hirê as his wife and presented Hakimat al-Dahr to Abel, and he took her as his wife.'"<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Gnostics seem to have taken the Marcionite belief that the Wrathful Yahweh of the Torah and the loving Father of Christianity were two separate divinities. In their book "The Origin of the World" for instance it states:-</p>
<dl>
<dd>The heaven and his earth were destroyed by the troublemaker that was below them all. And the six heavens shook violently; for the forces of chaos knew who it was that had destroyed the heaven that was below them. And when Pistis (Faith) knew about the breakage resulting from the disturbance, she sent forth her breath and bound him and cast him down into Tartarus. Since that day, the heaven, along with its earth, has consolidated itself through Sophia (Wisdom) the daughter of Yaldabaoth, she who is below them all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now when the heavens had consolidated themselves along with their forces and all their administration, the prime parent became insolent. And he was honored by all the army of angels. And all the gods and their angels gave blessing and honor to him. And for his part, he was delighted and continually boasted, saying to them, "I have no need of anyone." He said, "It is I who am God, and there is no other one that exists apart from me." And when he said this, he sinned against all the immortal beings who give answer. And they laid it to his charge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was filled with anger. She was invisible. She said, "You are mistaken, Samael," (that is, "blind god"). "There is an immortal man of light who has been in existence before you, and who will appear among your modelled forms; he will trample you to scorn, just as potter's clay is pounded. And you will descend to your mother, the abyss, along with those that belong to you.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnostic.html" title="Gnostic">Gnostic</a> accounts also turned the identification of the serpent with Satan on its head, and the serpent was seen as the hero, particularly to <a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophite.html" title="Ophite">Ophites</a>, who was trying to help the couple gain knowledge to defeat evil Samael, whom the Gnostics saw as the jealous <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demiurge.html" title="Demiurge">demiurge</a> of the creation.</p>
<p>There is also the tradition that Satan refused to bow to Adam as a result of his exclusive love of God, and felt that bowing to humankind was a form of idolatry. This tradition informs the treatment of Satan in some forms of Christian <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">gnosticism</a>.</p>
<p>More extended versions of the fall of Satan exist in which he leads a divine war, which, while in works such as the Book of Enoch is recorded as being in heaven after Satan turns away from God.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> tells of آدم (<i><span class="Unicode">ʾĀdam</span></i>) in the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surah.html" title="Surah">surah</a> <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Baqara_ab37.html" title="Al-Baqara">al-Baqara (2)</a>:30-39, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-A%27raf_8b9e.html" title="Al-A'raf">al-A'raf (7)</a>:11-25, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Hijr_846a.html" title="Al-Hijr">al-Hijr (15)</a>:26-44, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Isra_814e.html" title="Al-Isra">al-Isra (17)</a>:61-65, <a href="../../../t/a/-/Ta-Ha_3609.html" title="Ta-Ha">Ta-Ha (20)</a>:115-124, and <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sad_%28sura%29.html" title="Sad (sura)">Sad (38)</a>:71-85.</p>
<p>The early Islamic commentator <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari_70f7.html" title="Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari">Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari</a> adds a number of details to the Torah, based on claimed <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> as well as specific Jewish traditions (so-called <i>isra'iliyyat</i>).<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup> Tabari records that when it came time to create Adam, God sent <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_%28archangel%29.html" title="Gabriel (archangel)">Gabriel</a> (Jibril), then <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_%28archangel%29.html" title="Michael (archangel)">Michael</a> (Mika'il), to fetch clay from the earth; but the earth complained, saying <i>I take refuge in God from you, if you have come to diminish or deform me</i>, so the angels returned empty-handed. Tabari goes on to state that God responded by sending the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html#Death_.28angels.29_in_religion" title="Death (personification)">Angel of Death</a>, who took clay from all regions, hence providing an explanation for the variety of appearances of the different races of mankind.</p>
<p>According to Tabari's account, after receiving the breath of God, Adam remained a dry body for 40 days, then gradually came to life from the head downwards, sneezing when he had finished coming to life, saying <i>All praise be to God, the Lord of all beings</i><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Having been created, Adam, the first man, is described as having been given dominion over all the lower creatures, which he proceeds to name. As one of the people to whom God is said to have spoken to directly, Adam is seen as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">prophet in Islam</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, Adam takes a prominent role in Islamic traditions concerning the fall of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>, which is not recorded in the Torah, but in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> which is used in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodox_4ce0.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> churches. In these, when God announces his intention of creating Adam, some of the angels express dismay, asking why he would create a being that would do evil. Teaching Adam <i>the names</i> reassures the angels as to Adam's abilities, though commentators dispute which particular names were involved; various theories say they were the names of all things animate and inanimate, the names of the angels, the names of his own descendants, or the <a href="../../../9/9/_/99_Names_of_God_in_the_Qur%27an_c3e2.html" title="99 Names of God in the Qur'an">names of God</a>.</p>
<p>When God orders the angels to bow to Adam one of those present, Satan (<a href="../../../i/b/l/Iblis.html" title="Iblis">Iblis</a> in Islam, a <a href="../../../d/j/i/Djinn.html" title="Djinn">Djinn</a> who said "why should I bow to man, I am made of pure fire and I praise thee more than Adam ever will"), refuses due to his pride, and is summarily banished from the Heavens. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_movements_within_Islam_48bd.html" title="Liberal movements within Islam">Liberal movements within Islam</a> have viewed God's commanding the angels to bow before Adam as an exaltation of humanity, and as a means of supporting <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, others view it as an act of showing Adam that the biggest enemy of humans on earth will be their ego.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>More extended versions of the fall of Satan also exist in works such as that of Tabari, and the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> commentator al-Qummi. In these explanations Iblis is sent against the jinn, who had angered God by sin and fighting. In such versions where Satan leads the battle on God's behalf, rather than his own, it is the pride and conceit resulting from his victory which results in his expulsion, since pride is seen as a sin. Islamic traditions further record that, in vengeful anger, Iblis promises God that he will lead as many humans astray as he can, to which God replies that it is the choice of humans - those who so desire will follow Satan, while those who so desire will follow God.</p>
<p>Eve is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, she is nevertheless referred to as Adam's spouse, and Islamic tradition refers to her by an etymologically similar name - حواء (<i><span class="Unicode">Hawwāʾ</span></i>) . In fact, although her creation is not recounted in the Qur'an, Tabari recounts the biblical tale of her creation, stating that she was named because she was created from a <i>living</i> thing (her name means <i>living</i>). The torah gives an etymology for <i>woman</i>, or rather the Hebrew equivalent (<i>ish-shah</i>), stating that she should be called <i>woman</i> since she was taken out of man (<i>ish</i> in Hebrew). The etymology is regarded as implausible by most semitic linguists. Interestingly, Quran blame both, Adam and Eve for eating the forbidden fruit. Some Muslims therefore interpret that this even does not pose a problem of women inferiority to men intrinsically. However, two hadiths about Eve seem to cast women negatively:</p>

<p>Many Biblical scholars consider Adam and Eve as an example of a story focusing on the teaching of perceived fundamental truths. In their interpretation, the narrative's purpose is to convey the importance and truth of sin and human rebellion in their traditions, regardless of historical accuracy. All, some, or none of the actual events of the narrative may have actually happened, or been <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embellishment.html" title="Embellishment">embellished</a>, although there is no real evidence of embellishment of this narrative in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic_Text_3b56.html" title="Masoretic Text">Masoretic Text</a>.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve are considered by evangelical Christian and Jewish <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalists.html" title="Fundamentalists">fundamentalists</a> as real historical people, as <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%205.3&amp;version=31" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%205.3&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">Genesis 5:4</a> records Adam within a genealogy.

This is taken to support a historical Adam by fundamentalists as some theologians interpret <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">Adam's sin</a> as a historical event that changed humankind. Others argue that Paul could be merely using the myth as a teaching method, or that Paul believed in Adam and Eve but was mistaken on this count. However, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> also made reference to the story of Adam and Eve, in Matthew 19:4,5. Adam is also listed in Jesus' genealogy in Luke 3.

<p><a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Renaissance_art_364d.html" title="Early Renaissance art">Early Renaissance artists</a> used the theme of Adam and Eve as a way to represent female and male nudes. Later, the nudity was objected to by more modest elements, and fig leaves were added to the older pictures and sculptures, covering their <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital.html" title="Genital">genitals</a>. The choice of the <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fig_tree.html" title="Fig tree">fig</a> was a result of Mediterranean traditions identifying the unnamed <i>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</i> as a fig tree, and since figs leaves were actually mentioned in Genesis as being used to cover Adam and Eve's nudity.</p>
<p>Another issue was whether they should be depicted with <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navel.html" title="Navel">navels</a>. Since they were created fully grown, and did not develop in a uterus, they would not have had the umbilical scars possessed by all born humans. However, paintings without navels looked unnatural.</p>
<p>In Northern Europe, the unnamed "Forbidden fruit" became considered a form of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_%28fruit%29.html" title="Apple (fruit)">apple</a>, because of a misunderstanding of the Latin "malum", where malum as an adjective means evil, but as a noun means apple. The <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larynx.html" title="Larynx">larynx</a> in the human throat, noticeably more prominent in males, was consequently called an <i><a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam%27s_apple.html" title="Adam's apple">Adam's apple</a></i>, from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in Adam's throat as he swallowed, and the name has stuck.</p>
<p>Some <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Church_Slavonic_09a4.html" title="Old Church Slavonic">Slavonic</a> texts state that the "forbidden fruit" was actually the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grape.html" title="Grape">grape</a>, that was later changed in its nature and made into something good, much as the serpent was changed by losing its legs and speech.</p>
<p>Other <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Christianity_17e5.html" title="Eastern Christianity">Eastern Christians</a> sometimes assume that the "forbidden fruit" was the <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fig.html" title="Fig">fig</a>, from the account of their using leaves of this tree to cover themselves.</p>

Among the survivors there are one Adam and one Eve. The resulting mankind holds them mythical. It is revealed that mankind has passed several times for a new creation, reproducing itself from pairs of Adams and Eves.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney_Rhyming_Slang_67b4.html" title="Cockney Rhyming Slang">Cockney Rhyming Slang</a> uses "Adam and Eve" to mean "believe" (e.g. "Would you Adam and Eve it?", meaning "Would you believe it?"). Unlike most cockney rhyming slang, both the rhyming and non-rhyming parts are typically used.</p>

As "Evangelion" is usually shortened to "Eva", the form of the name "Eve" in many languages, this creation myth parallels the Old Testament version.
