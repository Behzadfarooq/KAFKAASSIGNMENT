<p>My reference is a paper by Regina Grol, a staff member of the State University of New York<a href="http://www.esc.edu/ESConline/Across_ESC/Administration2.nsf/WebPeople/ReginaGrol" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.esc.edu/ESConline/Across_ESC/Administration2.nsf/WebPeople/ReginaGrol" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Further, the paper<a href="http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/mickiewicz/grol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/mickiewicz/grol.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is on a web site run by the university. The fact that the paper had been published in the Bulletin of the Polish Arts Club of Buffalo is irrelevant to the fact that this reference has the authority of the university. It says "there is some basis for the allegation of his mother's Jewishness" and "the Jewish origin of his mother is quite plausible". Clearly, this source does not regard the matter as gossip, but as something likely although not proved beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The Polish Government has a POV to deny Mickiewicz' Jewish background <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol9no1/halina.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol9no1/halina.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>; Wikipedia, in the interests of NPOV, should present all of the facts.--20.138.246.89 14:55, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is also this reference: <a href="http://www.dialog.org/art/art.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dialog.org/art/art.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> "Among very well known persons, with at least partially Jewish roots who have made great contributions to Polish culture, are Adam Mickiewicz, Julian Tuwim and Adam Michnik."--20.138.246.89 15:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol9no1/halina.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol9no1/halina.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> talks about Mickiewicz's relationship to Judaism and Jewish culture, not anything about his background or religion, and one person's paper hinting that the whole government of another nation is "secretly denying" a Polish national hero's Jewish ancestry is basically like accusing a whole nation's government of antisemitism. Sorry but wikipedia is not a haven for conspiracy theories, even if they are written by someone more than just a hobbyist. Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> guidelines does state that in the interest of NPOV we have to list every rumor or viewpoint printed on the internet, and "wikipedia is not censored" does not refer to the willful lack of citations to numerous viewpoints on the internet, but rather the "censorship" of profanity, pornography, etc. How exactly are we going to present this? "Mentor from the State University of New York Regina Grol states Adam Mickiewicz's mother may have come from a Jewish convert family"? No. Rumors have no place here and there are thousands of rumors on who could be Jewish. It's apparently a fad now. I've had this exact same discussion on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Iberian_Jews_da8a.html" title="List of Iberian Jews">List of Iberian Jews</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 02:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is farcical. I am not relying on the University of Michigan ref to establish his Jewishness; I have produced two other good sources for that. Still, as LaGrange refuses to believe that the State University of New York is a reliable source, let's try again:</dd>

<p>Reverted. There are good refs that his mother was a descendant of Frankist Jews.

<p>What is that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article does not state categorically that his mother was Jewish; it says that she may have been. Good sources have been produced to support that contention. Where good sources are in conflict, we are obliged by WP:V and WP:NPOV to report both of them.--<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownlee_60d2.html" title="User:Brownlee">Brownlee</a> 08:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well further reading reveals we are also obliged by WP:NPOV to not give undue weight.</p>
<p>"We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view, and views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented except in articles devoted to those views."</p>
<p>Therefore, because one "reputable" place gives us one viewpoint on the issue of who Mickiewicz's mother was, we do not report it with equal prominence to a more highly held one: that being that it his mother was from Polish nobility with a questionable background - nothing more nothing less. The minority viewpoints are promptly placed in the article as well. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 16:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly right. So we need to say that his mother may have been Jewish and not dismiss it entirely as misinformed rumour and speculation just because one source can be found that says so.--20.138.246.89 17:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Please, we are talking about Mickiewicz here - a man that became a legend yet during his life. It's normal that there were many rumours about him. Some ascribed to him alleged children - the number of his love affairs is still a matter of speculation - aristocrats claimed him a prince, and Jews claimed him a Jew (both claims weren't based on any real evidence). Even his death is uncertain. Some say that it was cholera, others that he was poisoned - both suppositions are disputed. Communists claimed him a socialist and erased all his connections with religion, while earlier all his connections with Towianski's sect were concealed by Poles. There were even various ideas about the date and place of his birth (i.e. in an inn on Christmas to alike his history to that of Jesus). Really, I heard rumours that Elvis is still alive!</dd>
<dd>The internet source by Regina Grol supporting the idea that Mickiewicz was a Jew is not a scholar historical work, only a summary of some other sources. There are again some rumours mentioned, no doubt to meet the interest of the local readers (i.e. an affair with an American feminist). The idea that Mickiewicz might have been a Jew came from his mother's name. But a name alone, and a one quite popular in Poland, is definitely not a proof good enough to built any assumption on it. Moreover it was later proved that the family of Mickiewicz's mother had nothing to do with Frankists. And if that wasn't enough his grand mother - the mother of his mother - was Orzeszkówna before she married Majewski. So the whole idea based solely on the sound of Mickiewicz's mother's maiden name is good only for trivia.</dd>
<dd>It's true that Mickiewicz was in Constantinople with Armand Levy whose task was to organise a Jewish legion (the plan was to make a sabotage among Jewish soldiers in Russian army), but earlier Mickiewicz tried to create a Cossack legion. Does it make him Ukrainian?</dd>
<dd>The first reference where author actually checked Mickiewicz's genealogy tree was "Adam Mickiewicz" by Konrad Górski, PWN, Warszawa, 1989. If there is another reference arguing with this one, or basing Mickiewicz's Jewish heritage on some solid evidence, I have nothing against adding it to the article.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 03:55, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Plus, there's some information already added stating that some people speculate his mother may have been Jewish. If you can find some information which either disproves it, or presents his genealogy, that could be edited too - changed to something like "Among Jews, he was seen as of a Jewish mother. Among Belarusians, he was a Belarusian native..." etc. Something more apropos to how many ethnicities/nationalities would like to claim him etc. etc.. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 04:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, its relevant to note that "Majewski" is the 29th most common surname in Poland today <a href="http://genealogy.about.com/cs/surname/a/polish_surnames.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://genealogy.about.com/cs/surname/a/polish_surnames.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. If, as the quotations above and on that page indicate, his mothers surname was the core of this rumor, this proves it isn't any typical Jewish surname. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 04:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Judaica_886e.html" title="Encyclopaedia Judaica">Encyclopaedia Judaica</a>, a standard reference, is unequivocal that his mother was Jewish. It is of course legitimate to note that other sources disagree; it is not legitimate to delete the reference.--20.138.246.89 11:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi 20.138.246.89! (btw perhaps you would consider registering and picking up a name we could address you with?) I'm not surprised that Encyclopaedia Judaica has his mother as Jewish, or many other references for reasons stated above. And I agree with LaGrange that it should be noted in the article that some sources claim him a Jew. However it doesn't make him Jewish, and the way it's stated in the article right now is rather confusing. Could you type in the exact quotation from the Encyclopaedia? Perhaps we might come up with an NPOV statement instead of flaming a revert war?--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 13:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What exactly is wrong with the way it is now anyway? ". Also, a rumor among Polish exiles was that Mickiewicz's mother was a descendent of a converted Frankist Jewish family, however genealogical research suggests the claim is "improbable" albeit possible." Everything in that sentence is verifiable. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 21:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is now, and what you quoted is perfectly OK with me. I earlier referred to a revert by 20.138.246.89 which I later reverted back having no response from him.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 22:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Mibelz has added a reference to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, together with a citation of the relevant text, further on in the article. It is inconsistent to delete this reference then ask for it. I suggest a form of words along the lines of "Some sources say that his mother was Jewish, the descendant of Fankists (EJ ref) but others dismiss this as a rumour (other source)." This seems totally NPOV. If it is acceptable to SylwiaS, I shall make the edit.--<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownlee_60d2.html" title="User:Brownlee">Brownlee</a> 09:49, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe it's just me, but when I click the reference (the little number one) nothing happens. It doesn't direct anywhere. I'm fine with this, but I'd like to ask you to make the changes to the other version, because every time you revert the names of places change as well. I assume it wasn't intentionally. Also, please can we keep it to the Nationality section only? If you notice, there is no other reference to his nationality in the biography section. If we add one there, there will be soon a new revert war about Polish, Latin, Belorussian, Tatar etc.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 10:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The little number works in this version. It links to the bottom where Mibelz's references were and have been for the last few days, so it completely baffles me why people are still reverting. People can adjust the sentence however tbey want, but need to make sure what is said is quotable from the sources listed. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 15:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No serious author supports the story to discuss it on sevral lines in the text. Encyclopaedia Judaica team apparently didn't study the problem, only copied the story - from where? Maybe simply the EJ is biased?</p>
<p>Mickiewicz (also father's family) is Ruthenian (Byelorus), Polonized. Majewska was either Polish or Tatar. Lithuanian means from Grand Dutchy, not ethnic. He might have had a Jewish ancestor. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 11:55, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Polish nationalists create lists of Polish Jews (sometimes false) which include, first of all, politicians and social activists. However, there is ONE specific exception to this general principle: prominent Polish cultural figures (poets, writers, artists, musicians, etc.) who were Jewish (or Jewish ancestry), such as Adam Mickiewicz, Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, Stanisław Lem, Teodor Parnicki, Tadeusz Kantor, Jan Kiepura, Henryk Wieniawski, and many others. Polish “true patriots” do not agree with these facts, so they permanently remove them from the Category: Polish Jews.</p>
