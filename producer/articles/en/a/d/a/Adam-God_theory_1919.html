<p>Brigham Young briefly explained the following regarding the divinity of Jesus Christ:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth, Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken-He is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later. They came here, organized the raw material, and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees, the apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is desirable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere, and planted in this earth. The thistle, the thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious weed did not appear until after the earth was cursed. When Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its effects, and therefore their offspring were mortal. When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family; and when he took a tabernacle, it was begotten by his Father in heaven, after the same manner as the tabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve; from the fruits of the earth, the first earthly tabernacles were originated by the Father, and so on in succession. I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell you the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the estimation of the superstitious and over-righteous of mankind. However, I have told you the truth as far as I have gone. I have heard men preach upon the divinity of Christ, and exhaust all the wisdom they possessed. All Scripturalists, and approved theologians who were considered exemplary for piety and education, have undertaken to expound on this subject, in every age of the Christian era; and after they have done all, they are obliged to conclude by exclaiming" great is the mystery of godliness," and tell nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael, these three forming a quorum, as in all heavenly bodies, and in organizing element, perfectly represented in the Deity, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of Young's contemporaries interpreted the theory as stating that <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam</a> was the God of this earth and the father of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and as interpreted, the theory was unpopular and confusing even among contemporary <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter-day_Saint_0bda.html" title="Latter-day Saint">Latter-day Saint</a> leaders such as <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Pratt_3316.html" title="Orson Pratt">Orson Pratt</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amasa_M._Lyman_354c.html" title="Amasa M. Lyman">Amasa M. Lyman</a>, and by the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> public at the time. The theory is especially confusing in light of other talks by Young where he differentiates between Adam and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

However, the theory has enthusiastic acceptance among several small <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_fundamentalism.html" title="Mormon fundamentalism">fundamentalist</a> organizations within the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_movement_08ed.html" title="Latter Day Saint movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>. Latter-day Saint <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologists</a> explain Young's comment in one of three ways: (1)&#160;Young meant that Adam was <i>the</i> God, but it was simply an incorrect pet-theory; (2)&#160;Young said the words attributed to him, but he did not mean that Adam was <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a>; or (3)&#160;Brigham Young never taught the theory, and the published writings were the result of a transcription error.</p>

<p>Young's earliest statements about Adam being God were made in the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850s.html" title="1850s">1850s</a>, during a period of revivalism known as the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_Reformation_0637.html" title="Mormon Reformation">Mormon Reformation</a>.</p>
<p>Young first mentioned this understanding of Adam as God in a sermon on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a>. This sermon was recorded or commented upon by several in attendance, and published in the private periodical <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Discourses_b0c1.html" title="Journal of Discourses">Journal of Discourses</a>, which reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken— He is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do ....

<dd>"It is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael....</dd>
<dd>"Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the Garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilford_Woodruff_1c3c.html" title="Wilford Woodruff">Wilford Woodruff</a> recorded part of Young's discourse as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I will now preach you another Sermon. There is one great Master and Head in all kingdoms &amp; g[overnments?]. So with our Father in Heaven. He is a Tabernacle. He Created us in the likeness of his own image. The Son has also a Tabernacle like the Father &amp; the Holy Ghost is a minister to the people but not a tabernacle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Who begat the Son of God? Infidels say that Jesus was a Bastard but let me tell you the truth Concerning that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were before any tabernacles were made. When our Father came into the Garden He came with his celestial body &amp; brought one of his wifes with him &amp; eat of the fruit of the garden until He could begat a tabernacle. And Adam is Michael or God And all the God that we have any thing to do with. They Eat of this fruit &amp; formed the first Tabernacle that was formed. And when the VIRGIN MARY was begotton with Child it was By the Father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton. I will tell you the truth as it is in God. The world don't know that Jesus Christ Our Elder Brother was begotton by our Father in Heaven. Handle it as you please. It will either seal the damnation or salvation of m[e/a?]n. He was begotton by the Father &amp; not by the Holy Ghost."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Samuel H. Rogers recorded a third account of Young’s discourse in his journal entry of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">16 April</a> 1852:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"April 16, 1852. Conference commenced on the 6 and continued until the 11, it was held in the new tabernacle, adjourned until the 7 of next October. We had the best conference that I ever attended during the time of the Conference President Brigham Young said that our spirits were begotten before that Adam came to the Earth, and that Adam helped to make the earth, that he had a Celestial body when he came to the earth, and that he brought his wife or one of his wives with him, and that Eve was also a Celestial being, that they eat of the fruit of the ground until they begat children from the Earth, he said that Adam was the only God that we would have, and that Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost, but of the Father Adam, that Christ was our Elder brother. The argument that he used to show that Christ was not begotten by the holy ghost was a caution to the Elders that when they should go to preach the Gospel, to be careful how they laid their hands on the sisters, for the reception of the holy ghost, lest the Holy Ghost should get them with child and that it would be laid to them."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, the sermon was commented upon by Young's assistant <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hosea_Stout_259a.html" title="Hosea Stout">Hosea Stout</a>, who wrote in his diary: "Another meeting this evening. President B. Young taught that Adam was the father of Jesus and the only God to us. That he came to this world in a resurrected [sic] body &amp;c more hereafter."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Young never fully explained the doctrine, and said that most would misunderstand his teachings in the matter. Speaking of the doctrine nine years later in the church's general conference, Young stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Some years ago, I advanced a doctrine with regard to Adam being our father and God, that will be a curse to many of the Elders of Israel because of their folly. With regard to it they yet grovel in darkness and will. It is one of the most glorious revealments of the economy of heaven, yet the world hold derision. Had I revealed the doctrine of baptism from [<i>sic.</i>] the dead instead Joseph Smith there are men around me who would have ridiculed the idea until dooms day. But they are ignorant and stupid like the dumb ass." <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Though Young referred to Adam as the “Father” in his 1852 sermon and thereafter, it is clear that Young did not equate Adam with “<a href="../../../e/l/o/Elohim.html" title="Elohim">Elohim</a>” (who modern <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormons.html" title="Mormons">Mormons</a> usually identify as <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a>) for he stated in his sermon that “Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael” were “three distinct characters”. Moreover, in 1873 he stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“We say that Father Adam came here and helped make the earth. Who is he? He is Michael, a great prince, and it was said to him by Eloheim, ‘Go ye and make an earth’…. Adam came here, and then they brought his wife…. Then he said, ‘I want my children who are in the spirit world to come and live here. I once dwelt upon an earth something like this, in a mortal state. I was faithful, I received my crown and exaltation.’” (Deseret News, p. 308 (June 18, 1873)).</dd>

<p>In his personal journal William Clayton recorded the teachings of Brigham Young given in the Nauvoo Temple on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">28 December</a> 1845. In these teachings Brigham Young clearly states that there are at least two persons named Adam.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Meeting at half past 10 o clock this day in the attic Story of the Temple, for those who could clothe themselves in the garments of the Priesthood. A very large congregation was present, the side rooms were some of them filled, a curtain was withdrawn and the other rooms besides the east room were filled. About 200 persons were present, clothed in preistly garments. President Young addressed the meeting, it having been opened by prayer by P. P. Pratt, and singing the songs of Zion, “The morning breaks the shadows flee” and “Come to me &amp;c. President Young came into the room at 1/4 before 12 M. He said he supposed those present were a part of those who had received their endowment, that they were those who desired to be wise and do honor to the cause they have espoused, and bring no reproach upon the character of him who has given us of the things of his Kingdom liberally. The keys or signs of the Priesthood are for the purpose of impressing on the mind the order of the Creation. In the first place the name of the man is given, a new name, Adam, signifying the first man, or Eve, the first Woman. <i>Adam’s name was more ancient than he was. It was the name of a man long before him, who enjoyed the Priesthood. The new name should be after some ancient man.</i> Thus with your ancient name, your modern name and the name that was last given you, you enquire concerning things past present and future. (Brigham Young, Intimate Chronicle 238-239 (William Clayton Journal) (28 December 1845))</dd>
</dl>
<p>If, as Brigham Young teaches here, Adam was named after “some ancient man” who held the priesthood and lived long before Adam did, then the identity of that more ancient Adam might help us understand better Brigham Young's teachings concerning Adam. If that more ancient Adam is God the Father, then all the mystery of Brigham Young’s teachings relative to Adam disappear.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, while Young was standardizing the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endowment_%28Mormonism%29_564c.html" title="Endowment (Mormonism)">Endowment</a> ceremony for use in the Saint George <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Mormonism%29_097c.html" title="Temple (Mormonism)">temple</a>, Young introduced as part of the Endowment the “Lecture at the Veil.” The final draft of the Lecture, made after Young’s death, is kept private in the St. George Temple. There are those who believe that Young’s personal secretary recorded Young’s dictation of the lecture in his personal journal. A portion of that journal entry reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Adam was an immortal being when he came. on this earth he had lived on an earth similar to ours… and had begotten all the spirit that was to come to this earth. and Eve our common Mother who is the mother of all living bore those spirits in the celestial world…. Father Adam’s oldest son (Jesus the Saviour) who is the heir of the family is Father Adams first begotten in the spirit World. who according to the flesh is the only begotten as it is written. In his divinity he having gone back into the spirit World. and come in the spirit [glory] to Mary and she conceived for when Adam and Eve got through with their Work in this earth. they did not lay their bodies down in the dust, but returned to the spirit World from whence they came.” (Journal of L. John Nuttall, personal secretary of Brigham Young, Feb. 7, 1877 in BYU Special Collections).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we apply Young’s 1845 teachings in the Nauvoo Temple to this paragraph, then the “Adam” spoken of in this paragraph may actually be the more ancient Adam, our Father in Heaven. In that case, there is no mystery in these teachings.</p>
<p>Prefacing the paragraph quoted, L. John Nuttall records in his private journal for Wednesday <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 that after serving that day in the St. George Temple and after taking his evening meal, he attended a meeting with President Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, Erastus Snow, Brigham Young Jr, I.G. Bleak, and E. M. Greene. (See paragraphs 1A and 1B below.) This meeting was held in President Young’s private winter home in St. George, Utah. During the course of the meeting, President Young gave some teachings which Nuttall later recorded in his personal journal.</p>
<p>It appears that Nuttall recorded President Young’s instructions on the 8th, not on the 7th when they were delivered. The claim that Nuttall did not record President Young’s instructions on the same night they were delivered is made by Fred Collier. Collier notes that, after Nuttall had written the first sentence of paragraph 1B, “[a]t this point Nuttal stopped writing for the ink beginning the next sentence is much lighter and the same as that used for his diary entry of February 8th.” Collier notes that Nuttall resumed his entry for February 7th with the word “Works” and continues with the rest of his journal entry as set forth in this section. It would appear that Nuttall wrote the majority of that entry on the following day, the 8th.</p>
<p>Six days before this private evening meeting, President Young had also given some instructions in the St. George Temple. Nuttall, who was serving at that time as the temple’s recorder, wrote down those instructions for safe keeping. (According to Nuttall’s journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 “President Young was present and gave some instructions not previously given, which I wrote for safe keeping and reference hereafter.”) It is claimed by some that the instructions recorded by Nuttall on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 included what has come to be called “the lecture at the veil” and that Nuttall and John Daniel Thomas McAllister had been specifically requested to record that particular lecture. It is further claimed that the teachings recorded six days later in Nuttall’s journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 are actually Nuttall’s record of the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 lecture. (E.g., G. Bergera, Conflict in the Quorum 258-260 (2002) Bergera states that President Young “dictated [the lecture] to one of his secretaries” and then sets out the text of Nuttall’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 journal entry.) Below we will see why this last claim is most likely not true.</p>
<p>Nuttall’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 journal entry begins as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>{1A} In the sealing room, in anointing where Josiah Guile Hardy and his wife Ann Lenston Hardy had their 2 anointings, also Matthew Clayton, also Sarah Johnson Macdonald anointed to A. F. Macdonald. His wife Elizabeth Graham Mc D. as proxy, Ranny Van Cott Macdonald was also anointed to A. F. Mcdonald, W. Woodruff anointing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this initial paragraph, Nuttall summarizes his activities of the day (performing various anointings in the St. George Temple) before he attended the evening meeting at President Young’s residence. Most writers who discuss “the lecture at the veil” do not quote paragraph 1A of Nuttall’s journal at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>{1B} After supper went to President Young's. Present Prest. Young, W. Woodruff, E. Snow, B. Young, Jr., I. G. Bleak, E. M. Greene and myself. Works in the temple being under consideration, Prest. Young was filled with the spirit of God and revelation, and said when we got our washings and anointings under the hands of the Prophet Joseph at Nauvoo we had only one room to work in, with the exception of a little side room or office were we were washed and anointed, had our garments placed upon us and received our new name.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not only do most writers who discuss “the lecture at the veil” fail to quote paragraph 1A, they also rarely quote the first two or three sentences of paragraph 1B. Instead, they most often begin to quote the Nuttall journal starting with the third sentence. Unfortunately, by omitting the initial portions of Nuttall’s journal entry, such writers obscure the fact that the words Nuttall records here was actually delivered at an evening meeting held in Brigham Young’s private residence and not in the St. George Temple. In any case, it was in the midst of these discussions concerning the temple that President Young was filled with the spirit of revelation and began to speak concerning the first endowment ceremony presented by the Prophet Joseph Smith at Nauvoo.</p>
<p>Because Nuttall also notes that at this private evening meeting several matters or “Works” concerning the temple were considered by those present, many writers have assumed that this journal entry contains the “lecture at the veil.” For example, Theorists Robert Black and Fred Collier both assume that Nuttall’s reference to the “Works” in the temple refers to what Black chooses to call “the sermon before the Veil.” Unfortunately, they give no reasons for this assumption. Similarly, most other writers simply assume, without discussion, that the text of this journal entry represents President Young’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 lecture delivered in the St. George Temple, despite the fact that Nuttall plainly states in the often omitted introductory sentences of his journal entry that this text was delivered on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 at the residence of President Young. This unquestioned assumption that this journal entry contains the text of Brigham Young’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 lecture at the veil is very surprising because there are <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-God_theory-nuttall-issues_07a5.html" title="Adam-God theory-nuttall-issues">several reasons</a> to question that assumption.</p>
<p>It therefore appears highly unlikely that the text delivered by President Young at his own residence on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 and penned by L. John Nuttall in his private journal represents the same lecture at the veil delivered by Brigham Young six days earlier (1 February) in the St. George Temple.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-God_theory_1919.html" title="Edit section: The Theory as a Doctrine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Theory as a Doctrine</span></h4>
<p>There is some controversy as to whether or not Young considered the Adam-God theory to be official church doctrine. At the end of his <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a> sermon, he stated, "Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation." (1 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Discourses_b0c1.html" title="Journal of Discourses">J.D.</a> 51). Nevertheless, in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, after a great deal of controversy concerning the doctrine, Young minimized the importance of the doctrine, stating that the "subject ... does not immediately concern yours or my welfare... I do not pretend to say that the items of doctrine and ideas I shall advance are necessary for the people to know" (October 8, 1854, Historical Department of the Church [HDC]).</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, Young also generally declined requests to elaborate on the doctrine. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Presidency_8f82.html" title="First Presidency">First Presidency</a> issued a statement, entitled "Instructions to the Saints", regarding various disagreements between Young and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_%28Mormonism%29_c23e.html" title="Apostle (Mormonism)">apostle</a> <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Pratt_3316.html" title="Orson Pratt">Orson Pratt</a> on many doctrinal issues. The statement was meant to clear up any questions concerning the official position of the Church on these various doctrinal disagreements. Contrary to the opinions of many, this official did <i>not</i> address the Adam-God theory. Instead, concerning Adam the statement said only that, "It is deemed wisest to let that subject remain without further explanation at present." (2 Messages of the First Presidency 222).</p>
<p>Although Brigham Young minimized the importance of this doctrine and declined to elaborate on the doctrine much further, there are those who contend that he continued to assert the doctrine until his death. They point out that in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, Young claimed that he had "never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call Scripture. Let me have the privilege of correcting a sermon, and it is as good Scripture as they deserve." (13 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Discourses_b0c1.html" title="Journal of Discourses">J.D.</a> 95.) Unfortunately they fail to also point out that Young did not have the opportunity to review and correct all his sermons concerning Adam. Nevertheless, in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, Young lamented, "How much unbelief exists in the minds of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which I revealed to them, and which God revealed to me—namely that Adam is our Father and God." (<i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Deseret_News_60a2.html" title="Deseret News">Deseret News</a></i>, June 18, 1873). No one before or since can claim to have fully understood Young's teachings on these matters.</p>
<p>After the death of Brigham Young, church leaders began to cast the various interpretations of this theory as mere speculation and denied that any particular interpretation was binding on the Church. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilford_Woodruff_1c3c.html" title="Wilford Woodruff">Wilford Woodruff</a>, then <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Church_%28Mormonism%29_20e5.html" title="President of the Church (Mormonism)">President of the Church</a>, wrote a private letter concerning Young's teachings on Adam, stating:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The doctrine was never submitted to the councils of the Priesthood nor to the church for approval or ratification, and was never formally or otherwise accepted by the church. It is therefore in no sense binding upon the Church. Brigham Young's ‘bare mention’ was ‘without indubitable evidence and authority being given of its truth.’ Only the scripture, the ‘accepted word of God,’ is the Church's standard (Letter to A. Saxey, January 7, 1897, HDC).</dd>

<p>During the life of Brigham Young and for some time later, many devout <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter-day_Saint_0bda.html" title="Latter-day Saint">Latter-day Saints</a> believed and taught that Adam was the father of Jesus Christ. For example, <a href="../../../h/e/b/Heber_C._Kimball_c728.html" title="Heber C. Kimball">Heber C. Kimball</a>, a member of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Presidency_8f82.html" title="First Presidency">First Presidency</a> under Brigham Young, stated that "there is but one God that pertains to this people, and he is the God that pertains to this earth — the first man. That first man sent his own Son to redeem the world..." (4 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Discourses_b0c1.html" title="Journal of Discourses">J.D.</a>, p.1). However, it is not clear that Adam is the "first man" to whom Kimball makes reference. Adam's father Elohim would also have been "the God that pertains to this earth" and existed before Adam, making Elohim the "first man" who sent his Son to redeem the world. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Q._Cannon_b9ea.html" title="George Q. Cannon">George Q. Cannon</a>, another member of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Presidency_8f82.html" title="First Presidency">First Presidency</a>, when asked by his son about the conception of Jesus by Mary, asked "what was to prevent Father Adam from visiting and overshadowing the mother of Jesus." (March 10, 1888, <i>Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon</i>) (at Brigham Young University). Again, Cannon could have been referring to Elohim by the title Adam because Elohim was the first man in relation to this earth.</p>
<p>There was also a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> hymn published in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a> entitled "We Believe in Our God", that stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We believe in our God the great Prince of His race,</dd>
<dd>The Archangel Michael, the Ancient of Days,</dd>
<dd>Our own Father Adam, earth's Lord, as is plain,</dd>
<dd>Who'll counsel and fight for his children again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We believe in His Son, Jesus Christ..." (<i>Sacred Hymns and Spiritual Songs for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i> p. 375) (Liverpool, 1856).</dd>

<p>It is evident, however that most contemporaries believed in yet another interpretation not widely referred to by modern Mormon apologists.</p>
<p>This theory states that as Adam stands at the head of the human family, he has become our god. For instance, "the Lord made Moses a god to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1) and as Paul was "as Christ Jesus" to the Galatians (4:14). In this way, Adam as our great progenitor, will preside over the human family as "father and God."</p>
<p>According to some researchers, "this was the interpretation of Brigham Young's statement advocated in 1853 by Samuel W. Richards, who, as editor of the Millennial Star and President of the Church in the British Isles, first published President Young's initial sermon on the subject (Millennial Star, December 10, 1853)."</p>
<p>Franklin D. Richards who took Samuel W. Richards place also promoted this interpretation (see MS, March 31, 1855).</p>
<p>Other presidents of the Church have also taught this interpretation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hebrew word "Adam" has as one of its meanings "Man" and may have been used by Young, as in his <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">28 December</a> 1845 speech in the Temple, to refer to God the Father (who in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants is described as possessing the name-title "Man of Holiness").</p>

<p>In any case, Young seems to have decided to let the issue rest and not to explain more. He stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whether Adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care of one moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or His Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species. (JD 4:217; see also JD4:271; 7:238; 7:285; 11:43, 268).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The world may in vain ask the question: "Who are we?" But the Gospel tells us that we are the sons and daughters of that God who we serve. Some say, "We are the children of Adam and Eve." So we are, and they are the children of our Heavenly Father. We are all the children of Adam and Eve, and they and we are the offspring of Him who dwells in the heavens, the highest Intelligence that dwells anywhere that we have any knowledge of. (JD 13:311. See also JD 1:238; 10:231; 13:309).</dd>

<p>As both Kimball and Young are revered as prophets, some apologists and devout <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormons.html" title="Mormons">Mormons</a> believe that two prophets cannot disagree on a matter of doctrinal interpretations and have interpreted Kimball's statement not as a denunciation of Young's teachings, but as a denunciation of how some of Young's contemporaries interpreted his teachings.</p>
<p>Some have argued that the LDS church leadership does not openly discuss the historical evidences of Adam-God being taught because it may undermine their claim that the President of the church will never be allowed by God to lead the church astray. If Young could be wrong about this matter, then the church President today could also be wrong in his teachings — in fact, he could be wrong about President Young being wrong. Those who believe this feel that to avoid this inevitable conclusion, the LDS church leadership have chosen to ignore the matter as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Adam-God doctrine, in various forms, however, is still accepted by many post-Utah-migration period <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saint</a> splinter organizations.</p>

<p>Many apologetic and devout Mormon scholars have debated Young's precise meaning. Some think he meant that Adam was an eternal God-like being who was placed on this earth with a celestial body and the literal (physical) father of the human race (because of his parentage and immortal body Adam would thus be <i>a god</i>, and a literal Son of <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloheim.html" title="Eloheim">Eloheim</a> born with an immortal body without blood - as opposed to Christ who was born "in the flesh" as a mortal being), who chose to partake of the forbidden fruit, <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_%28religion%29.html" title="Fall (religion)">Fall</a> and mortality.</p>
<p>In Mormon theology, Christ is the only begotten Son of God "in the flesh." (5 Brigham Young Addresses, ¶12 (7 October 1866)) But Adam is also considered a Son of God, and therefore a "god" in his own right, due to his actions in premortality and in the Garden of Eden. Because Adam, an immortal being, partook of the forbidden fruit he became the "first flesh" or first mortal on earth, just as God had planned. And as the "first flesh", he is considered the mortal father of all mankind, including Jesus.</p>
<p>Many Latter Day Saints believe this is what <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a> meant by his teaching of two Adams - that it took one "god" to bring mortality into the world (Adam), and a God (Christ) to make immortality possible. "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive... And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit" (1 Cor. 15, see also Romans 5:19, Luke 3:38). In essence the second Adam undid what the first Adam did - one was the father of us through mortality, and the second the Father of us all through his atonement and resurrection.</p>
<p>Because his actions are believed to be in accordance with the Will of God in the garden of Eden, Adam is revered in Mormonism rather than scorned for the Fall, as is prevalent today in mainstream Christianity. It has been explained that the fall had to be the result of a transgression of mankind, rather than the result an act of God, so that mankind could not blame an unjust God for their fallen state.</p>

<p>To complement the above view, some Mormons also claim that Brigham Young used the name "Adam" for two distinct entities. It is argued that Brigham Young often distinguished between "Father Adam", referring to the God of the Universe, and "Adam" or "our father Adam", referring to Adam, the first mortal man. In many of Brigham Young's controversial discourses, including the alleged "Adam-God" discourse, he attempted to make that distinction that there were two Adams. For example, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">28 December</a> 1845 Brigham Young made an explicit reference to a "more ancient" Adam after whom Michael received the name Adam. "Adam’s name was more ancient than he was. It was the name of a man long before him, who enjoyed the Priesthood." (Intimate Chronicle (William Clayton Journal) 238-239 (28 December 1845)). On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">25 April</a> 1855 Brigham Young spoke of Adam (Michael) as having lived for a long time with another Being whom Brigham Young explicitly calls "father Adam." "Well, you see from this that when you and I have been with and lived with the Lord, we shall know his voice. If father Adam were to come into this house and you were to see him go back and forth, would you know him? No, you would [ever] mistrust it was him unless he revealed himself. But by the time that you have lived with him [father Adam] as long as Adam had before he came here, you will know him and recognize his footsteps, but reading the history will not teach you these things." (3 Brigham Young Addresses ¶7 (25 April 1855))</p>

<p>Regardless of interpretation, the mystery of Young's teachings in regard to exactly what he meant in the few statements he made on the subject apparently died with him and his close associates.</p>
<p>Most scholars believe that the few statements about the theory are inadequate to properly understand what was meant by the teachings.</p>
<p>Although not necessarily an apologetic view, some have also argued the Adam-God theory was influenced by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Crossfield (also known as the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet_Onias_61be.html" title="Prophet Onias">Prophet Onias</a>) claims to have received revelations that go into more depth about the Adam-God doctrine. These revelations, and many others, are to be found in the "Second Book of Commandments". This collection of revelations was first published in 1969 as the "Book of Onias". The few members and supporters of the "School of the Prophets", set up by the authority of these revelations, are the only ones who accept Robert Crossfield as a prophet. Other <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> groups, Latter Day Saints in general, and the current LDS church authorities do not accept his claims.</p>
