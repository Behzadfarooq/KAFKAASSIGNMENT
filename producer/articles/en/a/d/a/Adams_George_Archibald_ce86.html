<p><b>Sir Adams George Archibald</b>, <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George_9fff.html" title="Order of St Michael and St George">KCMG</a> , <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada_1efd.html" title="Queen's Privy Council for Canada">PC</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a> – <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>) was a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> lawyer and politician, and a father of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Confederation_dbec.html" title="Canadian Confederation">Confederation</a>. He was based in <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> for most of his career, though he also served as <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Governor_64a0.html" title="Lieutenant Governor">Lieutenant Governor</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> from <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>.</p>
<p>Archibald was born in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truro%2C_Nova_Scotia_e41c.html" title="Truro, Nova Scotia">Truro</a> to a prominent family in Nova Scotian politics (one of his relatives was Samuel G.W. Archibald, who had served as the province's Attorney General from <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>). He studied science and medicine for a few years, and subsequently articled in law and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in January <a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a>. Archibald held a number of local offices over the next decade, and was appointed a probate judge in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Political_career" id="Political_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adams_George_Archibald_ce86.html" title="Edit section: Political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Archibald was elected to the Nova Scotia legislature in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> as a supporter of Joseph Howe's governing <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_Liberal_Party_ad45.html" title="Nova Scotia Liberal Party">Reformers</a>, topping the poll in the two-member riding of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester_County%2C_Nova_Scotia_75d5.html" title="Colchester County, Nova Scotia">Colchester County</a>. Once in the legislature, Archibald frequently took positions that were opposed by other members of the Liberal caucus. He supported elected municipal governments, for instance, and was a vociferous proponent of taxation for a state-run school system (regarded by many Nova Scotia Liberals as an unnecessary expense). Archibald also supported reciprocity with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and opposed any efforts to expand the province's electoral franchise.</p>
<p>Archibald was re-elected in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a>, and was appointed <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">Solicitor General</a> of Nova Scotia on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>. His term in office was cut short by a sectarian quarrel in the legislature, which occurred after the President of the Charitable Irish Society was dismissed from his government job and charged with treason. The Liberal government had previously been supported by a majority of the province's <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> population, but in early <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a> eight Catholic Liberals and two Protestant Liberals from Catholic ridings defected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Nova_Scotia_9e2d.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia">Conservative</a> opposition, which was then able to form government. Archibald was forced to resign his position on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a>.</p>
<p>In the provincial election of <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a>, Howe's Liberals were returned to office on a platform of defending Protestant interests. This was essentially a cynical appeal to popular prejudice, and no significant actions were taken against the province's Catholics following the election. Archibald did not run, but was nevertheless appointed <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> in Howe's government on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>. He returned to parliament following a by-election victory on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>. In his new capacity, Archibald was a leading proponent of provincial railway development, even following the economic downturn of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1862, Premier Howe was appointed Imperial Fisheries Commissioner by the British government. Archibald succeeded him as Liberal leader, although Howe continued to serve as Premier until the next election was called.</p>
<p>In early <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, Howe's outgoing ministry passed a bill which re-introduced property qualifications for voters. The bill did not become law before the provincial election of May 1863, however, and it was largely due to the bill's unpopularity that Archibald's Liberals were dealt a crushing defeat. The party won only 14 seats out of 55, though Archibald was personally re-elected in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester_South_a03e.html" title="Colchester South">Colchester South</a>.</p>
<p>Despite serving as leader of the opposition from 1863 to 1867, Archibald frequently sided with the Conservative ministry against his own caucus on important legislative initiatives. He supported the education tax plan put forward by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Tupper_5d5c.html" title="Charles Tupper">Charles Tupper</a>'s government, although it was opposed by most members of his own party. Archibald was later the Nova Scotia Liberal Party's representative to the first conference on Canadian Confederation, held at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlottetown%2C_Prince_Edward_Island_3ede.html" title="Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island">Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>. Following the conference, he was the <i>only</i> member of the Liberal caucus to support Nova Scotia's entry into confederation.</p>
<p>Archibald faced a leadership challenge from anti-confederate <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Annand_dad1.html" title="William Annand">William Annand</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, but emerged victorious. When Nova Scotia joined the new nation of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>, Archibald was appointed Secretary of State for the Provinces in the cabinet of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Macdonald_c0d0.html" title="John A. Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a>.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's political system was transformed by the debate on Confederation, and its concurrent provincial and federal elections in September 1867 were fought by Confederation and anti-Confederation parties, rather than by Liberals and Conservatives. The Confederation Party suffered a massive defeat, and Archibald (despite spending a very large sum of money) was defeated by <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_McLelan_23bc.html" title="Archibald McLelan">Archibald McLelan</a> in the riding of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>. He resigned his cabinet post on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_30.html" title="April 30">April 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>.</p>
<p>Popular opinion in Nova Scotia subsequently shifted in favour of Confederation, particularly after one-time anti-confederate Joseph Howe joined Macdonald's government in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>. McLelan followed Howe to the Confederation side, and was appointed to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_c1b3.html" title="Canadian Senate">Senate</a> in August <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>. This allowed Archibald to run for the riding in a by-election, in which he defeated <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal</a> Frederick Pearson, 1585 votes to 1230. Archibald was by this time a Liberal-Conservative, and continued to support the Macdonald government in parliament (though he was not re-appointed to cabinet).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, Archibald gave a speech in favour of conciliation towards the leaders of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_River_Rebellion_63f8.html" title="Red River Rebellion">Red River Rebellion</a> in Manitoba. This was noticed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George-%C3%89tienne_Cartier_fa73.html" title="George-Étienne Cartier">George-Étienne Cartier</a>, who was the <i>de facto</i> leader of the Canadian government while Macdonald was recovering from a serious illness. Cartier asked Archibald to become the first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Territories_ca27.html" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a>. Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.</p>
<p>Archibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara_Falls%2C_Ontario_2b17.html" title="Niagara Falls, Ontario">Niagara Falls</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province's first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province's <a href="../../../m/%C3%A9/t/M%C3%A9tis_people_%28Canada%29_c92c.html" title="Métis people (Canada)">Métis</a> population and recently-arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Boyd_fd0e.html" title="Alfred Boyd">Alfred Boyd</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc-Amable_Girard_133d.html" title="Marc-Amable Girard">Marc-Amable Girard</a>, a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province's <i>de facto</i> Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.</p>
<p>Despite opposition from many of the province's Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province's electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Christian_Schultz_4b21.html" title="John Christian Schultz">John Christian Schultz</a> led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz's opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in Winnipeg and St. John.</p>
<p>Archibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Joseph_Clarke_5035.html" title="Henry Joseph Clarke">Henry Joseph Clarke</a>, James Mackay and Thomas Howard — a group which balanced the province's ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.</p>
<p>Archibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province's Métis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Riel_1dd7.html" title="Louis Riel">Louis Riel</a> after an armed Métis band had defended the government against <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenian.html" title="Fenian">Fenian</a> invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another Métis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Godschall_Johnson_9433.html" title="Francis Godschall Johnson">Francis Godschall Johnson</a> as his replacement on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a> that Archibald returned to <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>.</p>
<p>Archibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway Company</a> in February <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_W._Johnston_2690.html" title="James W. Johnston">James W. Johnston</a> initially received this appointment, but had to withdraw due to ill health). This position required much less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>. After <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.</p>
<p>Archibald served as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>, when his second term came to an end. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>, he became President of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century Acadian expulsion later in the year.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_McLelan_23bc.html" title="Archibald McLelan">Archibald McLelan</a> was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. McLelan had resigned his Senate seat in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a> and subsequently returned to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and, ironically, Archibald was once again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, eighteen years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. He did not run again in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a> due to ill health, and died the following year.</p>
