<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Oates_4c5c.html" title="Edit section: Playing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing career</span></h2>
<p>Oates initially did not have much hope of an NHL career, until <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute_4b45.html" title="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> offered him a scholarship. He played for the college from 1982 to 1985, where he was a major contributor to RPI's 1985 <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Men%27s_Ice_Hockey_Championship_df95.html" title="NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship">NCAA Division I championship</a>. Oates eventually graduated with a Management degree from RPI in 1991. As of the end of the 2004-05 season, Oates still held school records for most assists in a season (60, 1984-85), most points in a season (91, 1984-85), and most career points (150). He is third on the school's all-time list for most assists per game (1.53) and tied for third all-time in career points (216).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Rensselaer's NCAA championship season, Oates signed as an undrafted free agent with the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Red_Wings_4b91.html" title="Detroit Red Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>, with the richest rookie contract up to this time at $1 million over four years. Although the team's second <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_%28ice_hockey%29.html" title="Centre (ice hockey)">centreman</a> behind <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Yzerman_a978.html" title="Steve Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a>, Oates solidified his reputation as an elite NHL playmaker with the Red Wings, and by his last season with the club <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988-89_NHL_season_ca47.html" title="1988-89 NHL season">1988-89</a> he was scoring at an almost assist-per-game pace. However, he was traded to the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Blues_%28hockey%29_a7a7.html" title="St. Louis Blues (hockey)">St. Louis Blues</a> after the season along with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_MacLean_%28hockey_player%29_cd1a.html" title="Paul MacLean (hockey player)">Paul MacLean</a> for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Federko_b7cf.html" title="Bernie Federko">Bernie Federko</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_McKegney_42a6.html" title="Tony McKegney">Tony McKegney</a>.</p>
<p>Oates prospered in St. Louis, where he teamed up with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Hull_4913.html" title="Brett Hull">Brett Hull</a> and became part of the "Hull n Oates" tandem, a reference to the musical duo of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_%26_Oates_704b.html" title="Hall &amp; Oates">Hall &amp; Oates</a>. Due in no small part to the excellent playmaking of Oates, Hull had three consecutive seasons with at least 70 goals, including the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990-91_NHL_season_bea9.html" title="1990-91 NHL season">1990-91 season</a> when Hull scored 86 (a record for right wingers) and won the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart_Trophy_a49d.html" title="Hart Trophy">Hart Trophy</a>. Oates also had a spectacular season, as he had 90 assists and 115 points in only 61 games, earning him a NHL Second Team All-Star. However, as Oates was paid far lower than his market worth, he held out for much of the next season until he was traded to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Bruins_3d6f.html" title="Boston Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> in return for <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Janney_7f3e.html" title="Craig Janney">Craig Janney</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephane_Quintal_b316.html" title="Stephane Quintal">Stephane Quintal</a>.</p>
<p>Oates had perhaps his best seasons yet in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992-93_NHL_season_27d6.html" title="1992-93 NHL season">1992-93</a>, as he scored a career-high 45 goals, 97 assists and 142 points to finish third overall in regular season scoring behind <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Lemieux_d7a3.html" title="Mario Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_LaFontaine_fbcc.html" title="Pat LaFontaine">Pat LaFontaine</a>. Oates' 97 assists were more formidable than his totals in his St. Louis years, considering that he did not have a bona-fide sniper playing alongside him the whole season, as Bruins sniper <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cam_Neely_ccd8.html" title="Cam Neely">Cam Neely</a> was injured for all but 13 games during the season. The next season, Oates again finished third with 32 goals, 80 assists, and 112 points, behind <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Federov_e609.html" title="Sergei Federov">Sergei Federov</a>.</p>
<p>Oates played with Boston until the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996-97_NHL_season_9699.html" title="1996-97 NHL season">1996-97 NHL season</a>, when he was traded on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Capitals_5675.html" title="Washington Capitals">Washington Capitals</a> with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Ranford_c8f9.html" title="Bill Ranford">Bill Ranford</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Tocchet_a456.html" title="Rick Tocchet">Rick Tocchet</a> for <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Carey_6d52.html" title="Jim Carey">Jim Carey</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/s/Anson_Carter_111f.html" title="Anson Carter">Anson Carter</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Allison_1603.html" title="Jason Allison">Jason Allison</a> and Washington's 3rd round choice (Lee Goren) in the 1997 Entry Draft, in a blockbuster move near the trading deadline. Oates helped lead the Capitals to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> Finals the next season, but failed to win as the Capitals lost to the Red Wings, Oates' first NHL team. Oates had a few more productive seasons with the Caps, leading the league in assists in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000-01_NHL_season_89c5.html" title="2000-01 NHL season">2000-01</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001-02_NHL_season_cacd.html" title="2001-02 NHL season">2001-02</a>, both feats were done in the two seasons leading up to his fortieth birthday which also made him the oldest player to do so. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">January 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Oates became only the eighth player in NHL history to earn at least 1,000 career assists, a tribute to his playmaking skills.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002-03_NHL_season_9a68.html" title="2002-03 NHL season">2002-03</a>, Oates made his second trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, this time with the <a href="../../../m/i/g/Mighty_Ducks_of_Anaheim_8cb7.html" title="Mighty Ducks of Anaheim">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a>, but again his team was beat out, this time in seven games by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Devils_e3e5.html" title="New Jersey Devils">New Jersey Devils</a>. His career looked to be over after the season, but on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Oilers_2a78.html" title="Edmonton Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> desperately needed a center, and signed Oates to a contract. However, the season was a disappointment as he scored only two goals and 18 points, although the Oilers stayed in the playoff hunt until the end of the season. Oates announced his retirement on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> after his team was narrowly eliminated from the postseason</p>

<p>Next to Gretzky, Oates is considered one of the most creative and effective playmakers in the modern NHL era, as Oates had more assists than any other player during the 1990s except for Gretzky. Brett Hull and Oates united to form a high-scoring tandem for three years, with Oates supplying the playmaking for Hull, who was a natural sniper. During those three years, Hull's goal totals were 72-86-70. Outside of the three season, when Hull was not centered by Oates, he never surmounted the 60 goal mark.</p>
<p>Despite his skillful playmaking, strong face-off win percentage, and impressive scoring statistics, Oates never won the Stanley Cup in his career. He was also well known as a clean player, being a six time finalist for the <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Byng_Trophy_46dc.html" title="Lady Byng Trophy">Lady Byng Trophy</a> but losing to <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Turgeon_b5df.html" title="Pierre Turgeon">Pierre Turgeon</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Francis_ba2a.html" title="Ron Francis">Ron Francis</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Sakic_0d56.html" title="Joe Sakic">Joe Sakic</a>. He finished third in regular season scoring three times (1990-1991, 1992-1993, and 1993-1994), but only made the postseason All-Star Second Team in 1991. The other two seasons near the top, Oates narrowed missed out because players that finished ahead of him in the scoring place also played <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_%28ice_hockey%29.html" title="Centre (ice hockey)">centre</a>. Oates's lack of honours meant that he was often underrated compared to his peers.</p>
