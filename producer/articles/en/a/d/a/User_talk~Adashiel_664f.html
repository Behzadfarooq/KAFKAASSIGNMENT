<p>Hi, I reported vendalism by user DengXiaoPing (or Peng - sorry I am forgetting the spelling)on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_c3eb.html" title="Eastern Front">Eastern Front</a> page twice today. I noticed on his talk page he had a warning about this page prior to my report.</p>
<p>You responded that this is a content dispute rather than a case of vandalism. I agree in part, but only in part. I think it began as a content dispute, but this has gone on for a couple months. User Deng posts the same edit over and over, and reverts those who delete it. I think it is worth noting that a bunch of other editors have removed his edits; it isn't just me. Users Michael Z and Ksenon have also reverted identical edits from deng several times. Deng hasn't got a clue what he is writing about, which makes it doubly difficult to reason with him. You can see the consensus of edits is against him.</p>
<p>I guess I don't know when a content dispute, over the same content over and over, becomes vandalism, but this guy is ruining the article. I appreciate anything you can do to either block him or explain to me how this can otherwise be sorted out. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 19:07, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You reverted an anonymous spelling correction from "blackcurrent" to "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackcurrant.html" title="Blackcurrant">blackcurrant</a>".

<p>I have an idea why I might be blocked. Seeing how I primarialy use this website from my high school, I share an IP adress with the entire school. Well, I herd through the grape vine that a freshman changed Thomas Jefferson's name within the Thomas Jefferson article to something along Thomas "Jungle Fever" Jefferson. This is probably one of many things that the students have done. More than likely, they are holding a chat within the Matoaca High School article disscussion. As much as it hurts me to say this, I think our IP address should stay blocked. Knowing the delinquits in this school, the vandalism would only persist and get worse, like some sort of virus. If you know of any way to block the IP but allow certain persons to be unaffected within the IP, I would be grateful to hear them.</p>

<p>I'm afraid whoever this is from my school is at it again. I've written an e-mail to my sysadmin and I'm patiently awaiting a reply. I've got their contribs page bookmarked, hopefully in an effort to stem the vandalizations as quickly as possible.

<p>Eh, not going to raise a big stink about this, but your closing of that AfD was a bit irregular. Three comments to keep, one by a user who created the article and admitted he was biased, and one of those keep comments your own, it really would have better to let someone else close it.

<dd>No, like I said, I have no intention of pressing this anywhere beyond a simple discussion with you. I just think you need to reconsider closing AfDs like that in the future. How would it have looked if I'd closed it as a delete?

Thanks, I did, but I highly doubt that it will do any good. The editors on the abramoff page and the admins that they have on their side want their say to be the ONLY SAY. So there is little chance we will get a fair shake on this. But since they have blocked the page any interested reader will be able to see that our edits were reasonable. And the fact that the page is blocked just shows how we were bullied by the blockers.62.0.142.2 23:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No longer applies, as this <a href="http://cgwiki.comicgenesis.com/index.php/Comic:Dragon_Kingdoms" class="external text" title="http://cgwiki.comicgenesis.com/index.php/Comic:Dragon_Kingdoms" rel="nofollow">comic's</a> article has been deleted. Also, I am leaving Wikipedia. Why should I stay in a community that allows such a huge log of deletions to take place? It's not so much the deletion of the article (it only ever drew 30 hits, a sign that no one wants to bother coming here looking for webcomics), but the fact that this is going on with over a DOZEN other comic's articles, and how happy everyone seems to be over it. Congratulations, your community has lost another article writer and webcomic browser. I'm going to look at Comic Genesis or Comixpedia, now. After February 28, I will no longer come here. Apologies to Adashiel and any one else that <i>might</i> care. --Videowizard2006 23:14, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, kudos for the edit summary using <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>. Second, I understand your issue with relisting, and although there's been some discussion of on the page since it was my prompting I though I might expand on it here a bit.</p>
<p>The last time I asked for a discussion to be extended<sup title="Needs citation">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup> it went to a <i>clear</i> delete, which could be seen as me angling to get this deleted as well. But really, if extendig the debate gets that result, isn't that consensus a desirable outcome no matter what our personal feelings are? Even if the currect AfD goes to no consensus, it will be a <i>more convincing</i> no consensus, if that makes sense. Multiple nominations make for messy cases. An example: <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf_Only_Inn_56e1.html" title="Elf Only Inn">Elf Only Inn</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elf_Only_Inn_66c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf Only Inn">Afd 1</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elf_Only_Inn_2_076d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf Only Inn 2">Afd 2</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elf_Only_Inn_%283rd_nomination%29_786f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf Only Inn (3rd nomination)">Afd 3</a></p>
<p>In a more radical vein, if something had gone to a certain number of participants and was still a "no consensus" I'd like to see an "intermission" where the arguments to date are summarised and the floor is opened again "fresh" as it were. Just thinking aloud, really, but we've already got CSD and PROD to help clear out the easy stuff, so we should be able to have better debates on the ones left over...<br /></p>

<p>So there really are some people who care about the webcomics medium here!</p>
<p>I was so disappointed when I first logged on... I found so much resistance from people who seemed to not only "not care" about webcomics etc, but actually seemed to be AGAINST them...</p>
<p>I just checked your userpage, and it did give me some hope... I was thinking of only bothering with non-webcomics articles in the future, because of the whole attitude I saw here (my first edit involved the main "webcomics" article to include self-referential ones - at least Checkerboard Nightmare remained there, it's really an important comic even today, regardless of the fact that Straub updates it only "when there's something to say").</p>
<p>I just joined today, but I thought highly of wikipedia long before I did, and was disappointed with the community soon after I joined... At least now I know it's not everyone...</p>
<p>Still, I think I will be editing non-webcomics articles here from now on (there's always comixpedia), i just wanted to say thanks for "restoring my faith in mankind" for the day. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunnyDee_4be3.html" title="User:BunnyDee">BunnyDee</a> 14:40, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know what you're talking about, but as this IP is coming up as mine, I can say very clearly that I've never posted or edited on Wikipedia EVER, prior to this response. I find it very offensive to be looking up information and to suddenly be greeted with some kind of silly threat like this. And in fact this computer has not even been in operation for months. If you're going to be some assholish watchdog, be clear about who you're accusing. And for the record I don't have a wiki account because I don't post/edit/anything other than read articles.</p>

<p>Good evening Adashiel. You have marked the SopeGirls section, pointing out something I had never realized before. When I made the SopeGirls section, It was mainly because they have quite a fan listing for their site, and have hit several high ranks on webcomic listing sights. It accrued to me, that those who view the comics, or those who hear about the sope girls, may know nothing of the group at all, or how they got started. It would be very easy to say "Just Wikipedia sopegirls, you will find all the information you need." I am trying to keep the article with as much redolence to other articles on Wikipedia, keeping with the Wikipedia spirit and style. What is it about the article that needs to be added to keep it on Wikipedia? What do we need to make it? I checked all the articles you sent me, and quickly saw on the Web section, that the group is not "big time" But they are quickly grow in all skill, talent, and popularity.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I can do to keep this article up.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I Will just have to wait a couple of years to see if they are still going, and if they are, and have won several rewards, Then I will try again, But until then, there is always room to go. At least they are not a dead comic. And thanks for the other site! I will deffanantly consider adding them to it.</p>

<p>If the problem is that the comic is too young, that's fine and I won't add any more and allow it to be deleted.

<p>Adashiel, I recently discovered that Tick Acey is on his 20th comic. I think you should update the deletion reason now, for he has at least twenty comics. Thanks, Comic Master.</p>
<ul>
<li>20 episodes is still a tiny number. Most of the webcomics we do have articles for have hundreds and even <i>thousands</i> of strips. In any case, it's not just the number of strips, it's also about how well-known it is. Do a Google search on "Tick Acey" and exclude Wikipedia results and you get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22tick+acey%22+-wikipedia&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22tick+acey%22+-wikipedia&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">five returns</a>. See <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for our notability guidelines to get an idea of what it takes to make it. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<strong class="selflink">t</strong>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 11:44, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the article 'Blademaster' which was deleted had seven comics, not one. 'The Bldaemaster' is either a completely different character, placing it, not Blademaster, at one, and if it is the same character, placing him at eight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why didn't you bring this up in the AfD itself? You could've done that, you know. It still wouldn't have enough to meet our <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines, which is orders of magnitude more important than the number of strips. However, if you want to try resurrecting the article on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, you can. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<strong class="selflink">t</strong>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 11:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I edited the page itself saying that is was either a continuation, or a completely different character to 'The Blademaster'. Will try resurect.</p>

<p>As I am still new to many of the features of Wikipedia, I am not totally sure if I am writing this message in the correct place. I persume this is the right place to write the message, but I apologise if it is not.</p>
<p>I have recently been given a message stating that I have been adding "nonsense" to Wikipedia. I depend upon Wikipedia as a useful tool to research certain topics, and to generally browse. I may edit certain pages, especially to correct mistakes and update information on pages regarding soon-to-be-released albums; however I would never delierately vandalize a page, I despise people who carry out this unhelpful act, and I completely resent the fact that I am an accused of being a perpetrator.</p>
<p>I understand that I may have received a message that did not apply to me, due to the sharing or changing of IP adresses; and if this is the case, I apologise for the angry tone of this message. I have created an account, in order to avoid such a misunderstanding. However if this is not the case, I would like please more details regarding the alledged vandalism, in order to therefore edit any unintentional "nonsense", and resolve the issue.</p>

<p>I have editted the Bench 37 article. I can understand your claims that it is nothing but a vanity article, but would like to dispute that. I simply like to keep a running summary of the comics history in an easily readable, editable, and accessable format. Wikipedia is all that and more. Yes, I am the comic's author, but I have tried my hardest to write from a neutral point of view. I would like to assure you that writing this article was not an attempt to make myself a Greg Dean or Scott R. or Brian Clevinger. If you would like to continue this discussion, please write back. If you still want to delete the article, I will grudgingly accept your decision. You <i>are</i> an admin, and you must be an admin for a reason. I just wanted to make every effort possible to work something out in a mature fashion before it came to something like that.</p>

<p>box or the similar one for "policy"? Anybody can delete these, or put similar ones in any Wiki. It does not mean that all that appears there is automatically policy or guideline. It just means what appears there is whatever a bunch of people have gotten used to, and nobody is left who is willing to get into an edit war over anything substantially diffenent. There is no official statement from Wikipedia on either of these matters. That's in your imagination, sorry. Feel free to prove me wrong. I'd like to see it, of course. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">Sbharris</a> 21:58, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, I am now educated on the various spaces of WP. However, my point I'm afraid still stands. WHO decided that policy on wikis should apply only to n.0 wikis, and no others? We have no verifiable reference for it. Perhaps when the policy was crafted, it was meant to exempt Talk and User papers and nobody thought about n.4 material-- epecially material which is treated exactly like main Wikis, as witness the redirect. We don't know, and THAT is the problem which I'm tying to get addressed. But being blocked by you. I'm asking you to give it more thought.</dd>
<dd>The main problem is there is no way of knowing where eny given Wiki policy or guideline comes from. Too often, policies are assumed to eminate from Wales himself, but I find after checking that this is almost never the case. A standard of verifiability on policy and guideline wikis would clear such things up. Thus, the {citation} tag on WP:V is fully appropriate, and I ask you return it. It makes people think, and that is its purpose. Perhaps you yourself have never thought about the exact origin of specific Wiki policies and guidelines, and are just now doing so? <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">Sbharris</a> 20:12, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to take a pass on this one. You've got some good points, but learning to live with the chaos that is Wikipedia is just part of getting the job done. Wikipedia is not unlike a giant herd of cats, and quite a few of them are rabid, so a fluid and highly malleable framework is pretty much the only way to do things. Policies and guidelines pop into existence seemingly from out of nowhere all the time. If they work, we run with them. If they don't, we run <i>over</i> them. It's just not something you can pin down with citations. We leave that for the content itself. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<strong class="selflink">t</strong>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 21:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can I quote you the next time somebody reverts one of my edits on the basis of some statement in a Wiki on a policy or a guideline, which is being taken as Holy Scripture? Really, exactly what you just said above needs to be stated somewhere in <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>. So why not be bold and insert it?

<dd>Well, I'm basically just paraphrasing <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. That's not to say we don't have persistent rules, some of which are very stringent, but tracking their progress and documenting them thoroughly? I can't imagine how you'd do it. I can't imagine <i>why</i> you'd do it.

<p>You're right this article needs work. After taking a look at this and trying to think about how to best rewrite it, I'm leaning towards merging it (cutting most of it) and redirecting it to <a href="../../../s/v/e/Svetlana_Chmakova_a22c.html" title="Svetlana Chmakova">Svetlana Chmakova</a> . I'd rather have one decent article than two stubs that are redundant.

<p>Just for the record, I think we're actually in agreement that only the most significant comics should be covered by wikipedia. It may be true that your ideas for inclusion covers maybe 5% of all webcomics and mine covers only 4%, or that your "Big league" encompasses quite a bit of my "minor league." As I'm sure you know well by now, I think the best way to make this encyclopedia useful and spam-free is to require that articles be based on reliable sources. I don't want to assume that the comics i read are important just becuase they are important to me or my firends. Sometimes I feel like your inclusion criteria is based more on feelings than facts, and this occasioanlly frustrates me. You do lots of other plainly great work here, but some of your AfD comments about what you "feel to be a notable subject" and how you "believe a subject is sufficiently important for an article" just seems to encourage the atmosphere of "Keep, I love this comic" we see from others. I don't know, does that make sense? I mean, like with the more minor webcomics on Keenspot, I see no reason why Wikipedia needs to host their lengthy character bios and episode guides if no reliable publication has ever even mentioned them. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 21:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand the original reason for deletion, but my suggestion and argument is that the original article didn't contain completely accurate or complete information, and shouldn't have been listed as a webcomic at all. I've made a more detailed explanation here: Talk:Pon_And_Zi (with relevant reference links). Just to be clear I'm not spamming, I'm letting you know that I'm also leaving this exact same message with King of Hearts, another admin involved in the Pon And Zi deletion.</p>

<p>I think you sent that vandalism message to the wrong person. I have not visited any WWI article, much less even edited any article in the last 4 months. If I wished to edit anything, I would have logged on as my account Nerion. I'm not pointing fingers, but please be sure you have the right person before you send off a vandalism note. --66.109.234.187 Nerion 21:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There was no mistake. The warning message dates back to October of last year and at the time it was indeed vandalizing.

<ul>
<li>Why did you close this AfD early? The nominator had changed his mind, but several other users had voted to delete and had not changed theirs. This was out of order; early closures should be reserved for cases where there is near unanimity and where it is obvious what the outcome will be, which clearly was not the case here. It is also somewhat impolite to close a debate that you yourself had participated in. Please do not do this again: arbitrarily deciding that the voices of many of those participating in a discussion shall not be heard is hardly in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:01, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The nominator withdrew the AfD and provided links as to why he didn't feel the discussion should continue.

<p>I understand why some of the paragraphs might be deleted, but I feel the one there now deserves to stay. It has a credible citation and is entirely factual and proven. The reason I used a forum as a citation for the other was because it was concerning that forum, though I understand the deletion.<br />
<br />
Also, it's probably worth adding that my IP has been banned from the CAD forums since I made those edits, despite the fact I've never even had an account there &lt;.&lt;<br />
