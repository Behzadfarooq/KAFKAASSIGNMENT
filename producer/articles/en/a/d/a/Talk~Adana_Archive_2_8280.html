<p>Well, I would be happy if one of the <i>reverters</i> who was alerted by Khoi.. can tell me how an armenian source that is in armenian language can be accepted as an relevant sources, but Turkish one that is in english.

<dd>I dont know what source is being discussed here but my dear TDB, you have to understand that an Armenian souce, especially if its written in Armenian will have much greater credence to an Armenian than any other source (dont even mention Turkish!).

<p>Hasn't anyone considered doing something like splitting the "External Links" section into languages (i.e., labelling them "In <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>", "In <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>", "In <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_language.html" title="Armenian language">Armenian</a>", "In <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakota_language.html" title="Lakota language">Lakota</a>", etc. et al.)?

<dd>And TDB, there's a difference between adding text into an article based on a biased source, and adding a something to the External links section that is biased.

<dd>I believe it IS an issue! I cannot believe my link was removed because it has an Armenian source - as if Armenians are incapable of producing anything worthwhile on Adana! The text was just scanned from an excellent soviet encyclopedia - and placed on a wiki where I hope to get help translating it to English so that more people can benefit from what it says. Meanwhile, to allow someone to remove the link because wikis are unreliable is ridiculous to the extreme! And to include a link to simply the map, when it is already on a page with additional information makes little sense. Why don't ppl leave the link be, see how it develops in English, and then if it seems like a rabid nationalist worthless document, remove it or warn people. But if you go through Armeniapedia.org - I believe the materials on there stand up for themselves, and frankly, I welcome Turkish edits there - on the same condition as I do Armenian and Chinese for that matter. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 03:50, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following sentences were recently readded:</p>
<dl>
<dd>After World War I, the Ottoman government gave the control of the city over to Allied forces. The Armenian gangs armed by the Frech invasion forces were terrorizing the city and more Armenians were settled in the city from eastern provinces by a French policy to create a lesser Armenian state.</dd>

<p>The source provided is <a href="http://www.adana.gov.tr/?sayfa=3&amp;alt=tarih&amp;dil=en#i%FEgalkurtulu%FE" class="external text" title="http://www.adana.gov.tr/?sayfa=3&amp;alt=tarih&amp;dil=en#i%FEgalkurtulu%FE" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Although I respect this attempt at providing a source, it seems doubtful as per <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources guidelines</a>, not only due to the quite poor and obviously directly translated English, but also as a result of phrases used in the source like "just like during the Crusades", "crucifying the Turks", etc.</p>
<p>I think that, if the sentences cannot be backed up by other sources, or at least rephrased so as to avoid somewhat POV terms such as "terrorizing", it would probably best be removed.</p>
<p>Let me also say that I do not necessarily disagree with the information presented: it may well be fact, and it may well not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">French Army Armenian Legion in Adana and Anatolia</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/may_2003/history003.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/may_2003/history003.html" rel="nofollow">An Armenian source</a> states that France formed an "Armenian Legion" and this Legion fought in Adana (and other places) to create an independent Armenian state there. It even mentions "In May 1919, the Armenians declared Cilicia, independent and an Armenian Governor was appointed in Adana." Off course the source also uses wording like "murderer, robber, barbarian Turk", but I'm willing to accept the source in this case so no problem&#160;:)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haydjampa.org/Dossiers/HayLegion/p2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.haydjampa.org/Dossiers/HayLegion/p2.htm" rel="nofollow">Another source in French</a> mentions that "Il sera créé, à Chypre, une «&#160;Légion d’Orient&#160;», à recruter parmi les volontaires d’origine ottomane, qui s’engageront à servir, comme auxiliaires, sous les drapeaux français, pendant la durée de la guerre, pour être employés en Turquie d’Asie (Arménie occidentale)." This says in short that: Ottoman Armenians were recruited by French to combat in Anatolia. Against Turks off course.</p>
<p>It also says "Les sujets ottomans recrutés en Amérique par les comités arméniens et syriens seront reçus par l’autorité militaire à Bordeaux et à Marseille. Les frais de voyage d’Amérique en France de ceux, dont l’engagement sera accepté, seront remboursés aux comités recruteurs." which means there are committees which recruited these soldiers and reimbursed by French goverment for travel expenses. Good NGO work.</p>
<p>In Wikipedia, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Legion_2dc3.html" title="Armenian Legion">Armenian Legion</a> refers to a group in WWII and not this legion at all.</p>
<p>There's another site <a href="http://legionarmenian.free.fr/" class="external text" title="http://legionarmenian.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://legionarmenian.free.fr</a> which has a photo of this Legion in Mersin in front of a demolished Ottoman building (what they were doing there I don't know). The site is in Russian but maybe some of our Armenian friends can help us translate.</p>
<p>I'll do some more research and add this info to Adana article. I think no one will contest the sources then.</p>

<dd>That's well-done research. I'd say fit it in somehow, rephrase the word "terrorizing" somehow, and we've got all that we need (in my opinion, at least). Good work. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 14:56, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I think some of it could be correct in this sense: probably Armenian recruits were sentimental because of 1915 and Cilicia issues and they were mostly volunteers without any formal military training. Maybe the "terrorizing" issue rose from there? Anyway you're right some rephrasing would be better. --<a href="../../../g/o/k/User%7EGokhan_2b6b.html" title="User:Gokhan">Gokhan</a> 15:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Eupator, can you help with this Russian source? I wondered what it's saying. At least a small help would be nice! Btw I think if you start this French Armenian Legion article, then we can mention a small bit in Adana article and link to the real thing. Another point, the french document mentions "syriens", probably these are <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrians</a> right?

<dd>The <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Adana" class="external text" title="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Adana" rel="nofollow">Soviet-Armenian text</a> section on this period is brief (at least what I've translated is, but I think this is it). "The Armenian population of the city and province of Adana were subjected to massacres in 1908 and 1915. During the 1915 Armenian Genocide in the province there were 37,000 Armenian victims (according to Lepsius). On August 4, 1920 Armenians declared an independent Cilicia - which included Adana - which was very short-lived. The Armenians who fled Adana settled in Lebanon, and some founded a "New Adana" (Նոր Ադանա) suburb in Beirut." This is an exact translation, the text did not have phrases like "Terrorist Turks", or other racist nonsense. I think it is a pretty reliable source, but then again, that will have to be decided by consensus - and on the whole of the article. You can't use it as a reliable source for one thing (Armenians declaring independence), and then ignore it as a source for massacre numbers... --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 03:17, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, I sometimes wonder what if none of these imperialist countries (Russia, France, United Kingdom, Germany, etc) hadn't stick their hands in Ottoman Empire and hadn't incite each against other.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My "explore adana" site</span></h2>
<p>I added a link to an Adana website that I'm creating as a resource to foreigners visiting or plannng to visit Adana. The reason I am creating it is that I have have seen the sites that are mentioned in the external links section and found most of them to be irrelevant, outdated, or unflattering of Adana. I was disappointed when my site was promptly removed by Khoikhoi as "spam". There are three other websites that I seem to be "personal" and "advertising" websites. I think that if you check out my website, you'll see that it's a helpful contribution to the external links section of this site (especially if you look at when some of the other websites were last updated.) The website in question is "A visitor's guide to Adana" <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/exploreadana/" class="external free" title="http://www.squidoo.com/exploreadana/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/exploreadana/</a></p>

<dd>Hi Jake. Like I said, you are more than welcome to add content (for example by uploading some of your pictures) to articles, but adding external links is generally discouraged. Here's why: we don't want Wikipedia to turn into a directory of links, Wikipedia doesn't grow that way, and it's against policy to use Wikipedia as a platform to promote your website. Feel free to remove the three other links that appear to be personal and advertising. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 02:14, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
