<p>Finding himself on Earth and unaware of his own past, Adam-X found himself working for a gentleman by the name of Martin Strong. During his time working with Martin Strong, Adam-X developed a friendship with a fellow mutant by the name of Michelle Balters.</p>
<p>When Michelle Balters fled from Strong Industries – a plant, based outside of Denver, where mutants were supposedly taken good care of, Adam-X was sent to track her down and bring her back in.</p>
<p>Adam-X was unaware that Martin Strong, with the funding of Project: Wideawake, was working closely with a group of scientists in the hopes of exterminating the “X” gene that makes mutants.</p>
<p>The mutant team, X-Force, led by Cable stumbles across Adam-X’s pursuit of Michelle Balters and assumes Adam-X to be the bad guy. X-Force leaps into action – everything from Shatterstar with his sword, Rictor with his quake emissions, Boomer with her plasma bursts and Cable with his guns – none of them are able to get a beat on Adam-X, as most of them only see a blur of movement. That’s when Adam-X informs them that they have all been cut every so slightly, and ignites his power, rendering the entire team of X-Force unconscious, effortlessly.</p>
<p>Eventually, Adam-X and X-Force join together to combat Martin Strong, who they discover is a mutant himself. Membership to X-Force is offered to Adam-X but he declines, choosing instead to find his past and find who he is.</p>
<p>However, it would not be long before Adam-X would cross paths with one of the members of X-Force yet again. As it would turn out, Mr. Milbury (better known as Mister Sinister) hires Arcade to “test” Adam-X. At the same time Major Domo hires Arcade to get rid of Shatterstar. So Arcade decides to make the best of it – and pit the two of them against one another – in Murderworld.</p>
<p>After yet again, battling one another briefly – Adam-X and Shatterstar join forces and work their way through Murderworld and defeat Arcade.</p>
<p>Fate would next bring Adam-X to the Canadian Yukon wilderness where he was a witness to the crashing of Phillip Summers’ plane. Covering more than six miles in less than four minutes. While Adam-X is carrying Phillip Summers, the plane explodes sending them both over a small ledge.</p>
<p>Adam-X then uses his own mutant power to “heat” the blood of Phillip Summers, saving his life, until he finally manages to get him to a hospital, where he is greeted by Scott Summers and Jean Grey, both of which thank him for his efforts. Using Jean’s telepathy, Adam-X is able to share some of his memories with Phillip, showing him the ships he flew while with the Shi’ar.</p>
<p>During this time, Scott Summers (Cyclops) feels that his fractured family lines have been made stronger because of this near tragedy – Little does he know how terrifyingly right he is.</p>
<p>Adam-X is next seen with Captain Marvel scaling a mountain, headed for the ship that Adam-X has called home for the last two months – the Aerie. Unaware to both Adam-X and Captain Marvel that they were being watched by the Shi’ar agent, Davan Shakari (aka Eric the Red); he sends the Sidri Hunters to bring them in; however, Adam-X and Captain Marvel easily defeat the Sidri Hunters.</p>
<p>It his encounter with Eric the Red, where Adam-X learns the most about his past, as Eric the Red explains, “You are dubbed the Forsaken One, Adam – but that was a mistake on the Majestor’s part, those many years ago! Truly had you been rightfully admitted into the family, we would not be in this predicament today. Empress Lilandra sits on the Shi’ar Throne this day, only because Majestor D’Ken was driven made by his experience inside the M’Krann Crystal. She was not meant to guide the Imperium. You see, yours is the destiny of power – bred to introduce a hybrid, specific genetic potential into the Shi’ar Monarchy! Adam-X, you were born to rule the Imperium! Who else should be the heir to the throne – other than the living child of Majestor D’Ken?”</p>
<p>Adam-X however, uses his mutant power to “fry” Eric the Red, causing his body to apparently explode. From there, Captain Marvel and Adam-X part ways, wishing one another the best of luck.</p>
<p>Adam-X is supposedly still searching the Earth for more clues to his own past.</p>

<p>From X-Men #39 on, Adam was intended to be the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summers_brothers.html" title="Summers brothers">additional brother to Cyclops</a> once mentioned cryptically by <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Sinister_cc42.html" title="Mister Sinister">Mister Sinister</a> (Sinister mentioned that he didn't want Cyclops or "[his] brothers" to succumb to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legacy_Virus_77ea.html" title="Legacy Virus">Legacy Virus</a>), but the plans for this were dropped when <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Nicieza_5adf.html" title="Fabian Nicieza">Fabian Nicieza</a> left Marvel's various X-Titles in 1995 <a href="http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&amp;fldAuto=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&amp;fldAuto=67" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

While this origin was never confirmed in the comics themselves, Adam is half-human, and Katherine was the only known human woman in Shi'ar space at the time. <i><a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_%28vol._2%29_fc63.html" title="X-Men (vol. 2)">X-Men</a></i> #39 (Dec. 1994) featured a story about Adam discovering Philip Summers (father of Christopher Summers and grandfather of Cyclops and Havok) in the Alaskan wilderness and feeling an unusual connection to the old man.</p>
<p>Nicieza later confirmed that he intended Adam X to be the half-brother of Cyclops and Havok:</p>

<p>Nicieza left the X-Men office in 1995, and many of his plots were taken in new directions. With the emergence of the comic series <i><a href="../../../x/-/t/X-Treme_X-Men_3206.html" title="X-Treme X-Men">X-Treme X-Men</a></i> in 2001, the reappearance of the character X-Treme was made even more unlikely, due to the likelihood of confusion. Except for a brief appearance in Nicieza's aborted <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_4d40.html" title="Captain Marvel">Captain Marvel</a></i> series (1995), he has not been seen since.</p>
<p>While it was always intended that Adam X is in fact the "<a href="../../../s/u/m/Summers_brothers.html" title="Summers brothers">third Summers brother</a>", the idea has been retconned in favor of a new character introduced by <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Brubaker_519f.html" title="Ed Brubaker">Ed Brubaker</a> in the mini-series <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/X-Men%7E_Deadly_Genesis_cbbb.html" title="X-Men: Deadly Genesis">X-Men: Deadly Genesis</a></i>: <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan_%28Marvel_Comics%29_1501.html" title="Vulcan (Marvel Comics)">Vulcan</a>. Yet, like Adam X, Vulcan does have a mysterious connection to the Shi'ar.</p>
<p>However, Adam could still be the brother to Cyclops and Havok mentioned by Sinister (since he was intended to be their half-brother on their <i>mother'</i>s side, he would never have been a "Summers brother" despite the fan-term). Sinister mentioned only "your brothers." In addition, Vulcan, in-stasis and believed dead while the Legacy Virus was a problem, could not have been the brother mentioned by Sinister. Also Sinister never says how many brothers Scott and Alex have, so they may have more than one other brother. Adam, being a brother to the Summers, could explain Sinister's interest in him earlier on.</p>

<p>Adam is a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27ar.html" title="Shi'ar">Shi'ar</a>/<a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> hybrid, and as such possesses the traits and abilities of both species. His strength is slightly superhuman, and his endurance is many times that of a normal human. Adam's reflexes are far superior to both human and Shi'ar.</p>
<p>In addition to being a <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a>, Adam is also a mutant with the power to "flash fry" an enemy. He can cause the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrolyte.html" title="Electrolyte">electrolytes</a> present in <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygenate.html" title="Oxygenate">oxygenated</a> blood to ignite, causing the person to burn from the inside out. Any person with an open cut becomes a target for him. To this end he carries Shi'ar blades, known as <i>Thet’je</i> blades, to cut his enemies and thus oxygenate their blood. Adam uses a trigger word of "Burn" to activate his power and his eyes will glow with a reddish light.</p>
