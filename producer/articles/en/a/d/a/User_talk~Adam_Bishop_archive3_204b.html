<p>Hi, I edited 450 where you added Honorius suppresses gladitorial games. Honorius died 27 years before this date. So I suspect you meant another date. Maybe you could follow this up. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidzuccaro_27b1.html" title="User:Davidzuccaro">davidzuccaro</a> 00:29, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm working on articles related to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_game.html" title="Card game">card games</a>. One article - <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuffling_playing_cards.html" title="Shuffling playing cards">Shuffling playing cards</a> - should be moved to simply <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuffle.html" title="Shuffle">Shuffle</a>, since that term can apply to any style of cards, not just standard <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_card.html" title="Playing card">playing cards</a>. That page is a redirect now, but it has edit history, so I can't move it myself.

<p>I put that in there so that people could see the differences between succeeding wars. I know that there are probably plenty of wars that aren't included in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wars.html" title="List of wars">List of wars</a>, which was where I was working from. I <i>do</i> plan to finish the series, unless you really want them taken out. Then again, would you prefer some kind of poll as to see the public opinion on the series? Some wars don't have pages yet. I don't want to finish the series and then have to revert everything. I'll delay continuation of the series until you can give me a final decision.

<p>I have excellent photos of the walls (if I say so myself), which I will add to the article when I get time. But why is it called <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walls_of_Byzantium_cadc.html" title="Walls of Byzantium">Walls of Byzantium</a>? So far as I know Byzantium didn't have walls, and if it did nothing survives of them.

<p>Hi. Thought I'd weigh in on the subject of Wikipedia's favorite pest. This situation has been going on for months, and everyone has been either making stubs or redirects out of the entries. I've done four today. Lately, he/she has taken to reverting existing articles to his/her idea of nonsense.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>

<p>I've been having trouble with this NB image:</p>
<p>(Image:Map of New Brunswick highlighting Kent County.png)</p>
<p>It was uploaded at a larger size than it should have been (4" sq.) and I've tried uploading new images (1" sq.) to save over it but it's not working and it consequently displays at low res and wastes space.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, can you delete the whole image and all revisions etc. to it and I'll re-upload sometime this weekend? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Hi Adam, overall I think your edits are good. I am taking a class on the First Crusades from a Harvard educated professor as the source. I do have some concerns which I will list below. I will make additions to the First Crusade as I have time and learn the material, cant help with the others for now.</p>
<p>1. "<i>Urban knew of Alexius' request beforehand, and had probably already begun thinking about a military expedition to the east.</i>" .. what is the source for this that Urban allready knew and was allready thinking about it? If so, how is it relevant? I think it's from EB1911 but a lot of EB1911 stuff is questionable in either fact or relevance. The important point to stress is that Urban wanted to heal the rift of the Great Schism by helping Alexius, and he wanted to end violence of nobles in Europe, those were his two main motivations. I think saying he allready knew it was coming is confusing and not relevant and questionable.</p>
<p>2. Deus lo volt! The correct spelling is Deus le Volt. This according to my Harvard teacher and according to the other teacher who posted in the Discussion page. What is your source for this spelling?</p>
<p>3. What was the reasoning for removing the below? I added it to show there were multiple reasons why people joined the crusade to explain who it was so popular it appealed to many diffrent people for many diffrent reasons, this is important stuff about the material versus religious benefit, how not everyone went for religious reasons and were forced to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crusaders also hoped to obtain material benefit. Historians believe this was not the primary aim of crusaders, but it did exist and some crusaders did very well, although most spent more than they earned which makes scholars believe money could not have been the primary motivation. There were <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal.html" title="Feudal">feudal</a> obligations, many crusaders went because they were commanded by their lord and had no choice. There were family obligations, many families had crusading traditions, or they were bound by blood to help a family member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. <i>Many were killed but they arrived largely intact at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in August.</i> .. this seems to be a point of contention, unfortantly I dont have an authoritative source to back it up at the moment.

<p>Hmm. I think mine is a ton better. "First dramatist" is bad juju. "First" anything is bad juju, and especially with "Dark Ages." Icky. Ok, here's what I think should happen: I'll get the dates from the old one and the external link (though, frankly, I'm suspicious of it) and do redirects from its title, plus the one that redirects to *it*. I got my title from the <i>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,</i> so I'm inclined to accept it in the absence of a reference. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:17, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>For your note on the reference desk, which reminded me of my good old days studying Early Modern English History at the graduate school at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Fraser_University_b6e7.html" title="Simon Fraser University">Simon Fraser University</a>, where, I am sorry to say, we played no Latin Scrabble, though I won a number of games of "early modern <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangman.html" title="Hangman">hangman</a>" with the only other student there in my period (the only rule was that one had to announce the language that the phrase was in, in advance).

<dd>Fascinating!&#160;:-) Thanks for letting me know. You're bringing back fond memories of paleography now (I must be in a nostalgic mood today) -- hours in front of the microfilm machines looking at account books. I hope you won't mind if I pop in now and again and ask what you're working on. I hope someday to take Latin (well, learn it -- "taking" it may or may not occur) and do some work in earnest in the medieval period, all of which fascinates me (though I think the centuries where it bridges out of late antiquity are always most intriguing because I find them most remote).

<p>Your block of me last night was not done in accordance with policy. I was in a content dispute and had made about 5 edits (of maybe 10 overall) regarding whether Google page count was appropriate in an article claiming notability. In retrospect, I agree it was probably not a useful entry to the page, but it was not vandalism. Nor was your block in accordance with policy that I can find. For comparison, see <a href="../../../r/e/x/User_talk%7ERex071404_a10c.html#TWENTY_reversions_in_one_day" title="User talk:Rex071404">User_talk:Rex071404#TWENTY reversions in one day</a>. No need to respond unless you just feel like it, I am not worked up over this. But, I do want to bring the following points to your attention:</p>
<ol>
<li>"If you find yourself reverting a considerable quantity of edits by the same user, due to <b>vandalism</b> or edits by a banned user, it may be appropriate to block the user or IP address."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Three_revert_rule" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Three_revert_rule" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> A content dispute is not vanalism.</li>
<li>"The situations when sysops are permitted to block users are given below. Blocks should not be used in other cases. In particular, blocks are not meant to be used against unpopular opinions, or one-off vandalism incidents."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bans_and_blocks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bans_and_blocks" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>"Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia. Such disruption is to be objectively defined by specific policies, and may include changing other user's signed comments or making deliberately misleading edits. <b>Users should be warned that they are violating policy before they are blocked.</b>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bans_and_blocks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bans_and_blocks" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>"Blocking may not be used to prevent a user from posting unpopular opinions. A content dispute between users should be settled on the article's talk page or on their own user talk pages. If it cannot be resolved that way, there is a clearly defined dispute resolution procedure to resolve contentious issues."</li>
<li>"These things are not vandalism, though they are sometimes called vandalism. They are therefore treated differently: ... Bullying, or stubbornness: Some users cannot come to agreement with others who are willing to talk to them on an article's talk page, and repeatedly make changes opposed by everyone else. This is a matter of regret — you may wish to see our dispute resolution pages to get help. However, it is not vandalism."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

I have had two former students of mine go to UWO, john [?] Ferris and . . . . .someone else, but I never really thought about it being in London.

<p>I notice that some one has gone around and changed the term "American" to "United States" in places where to me it seems . . . . . . . akward.

<p>I'm starting to look at the article. It looks good right now, so far as I can tell, but there are two things I'd like to do. One is edit a bit for diction and clarity-- there are a few overlong sentences, etc. The second is that there is a lot of additional useful online material that should be linked in, from <a href="http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/CATEGORIES/crusadeswarfare.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/CATEGORIES/crusadeswarfare.htm" rel="nofollow">De Re Militari</a> and from the book <a href="http://www.doaks.org/CRcnts.html" class="external text" title="http://www.doaks.org/CRcnts.html" rel="nofollow">The Crusades from the Perspective of Byzantium and the Muslim World</a>, published by Dumbarton Oaks.

<p>Really I speak latin well, Italic the best, spanish is my home speach, english and french so so, german "Ich habe alles vergessen" and so... let us speak in english, (sorry my wrongs). When I read in your latin user page "Adam Episcopus" I believed that you was a priest!!! When I saw your picture in your english user page I thought "Really is the youngest bishop than I know and without ring nor clergyman" jajajaja!!! All clear now! When you need a counceling or psicotherapy, here I am, but our speach will be all in latin, right? jejeje. Well, "Rv. Bishop": If you call me, I'll be.

<p>Hey there Adam, you were asking which episode did they say the character of Elaine Benes hailed from Towson, MD? It was in episode 8 "The Jacket". This is also the same episode where we learn a couple of facts about her family, such as her sister in St. Louis and an uncle who worked in the Dallas book depository with Lee Harvey Oswald.

<p>Hello. I selected your name at random from the administrator's list. I'm brand new here. I just created an account, and when I made my first effort at enhancing an article, I got the response that I had been blocked by AllyUnion for "vandalism, pov edits." I tried to E-mail this person by using the link but got the response that it was an invalid address. Since this is my first time here, AllyUnion's block must be a mistake. I tried to use the discussion page for technical help, but got the same block response. Can you help me? According to the block, my IP address is 64.12.117.8. Thank you.

<p>Hi, I saw you had a featured article candidate listed and decided you would be a good person to ask for advice. Do you see anything that could be changed at <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_skunk.html" title="Pet skunk">pet skunk</a> to improve its chances of becoming a featured article?

<dd>Hi, that article looks pretty good...I'm not sure what to say, I guess the comments on the talk page and on the FAC page have already said everything that occurred to me. It does read a little too much like a "how-to" rather than an encyclopedia article, but I'm not sure how to fix that. Adam Bishop 17:21, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, live and learn I guess.. It may end up vfd or moved to wikibooks eventually.. however I did learn stuff that'll help me later. Specifically, I learned:
<ul>
<li>To put a footnote after every fact (sometimes, looking back later, even I can't remember where I got stuff),</li>
<li>To use hidden comments in the code, in case there is important info that new users who don't know about talk pages need to see before editing, and most importantly,</li>
<li>To keep pet-related <a href="../../../h/o/w/How-to.html" title="How-to">how-tos</a> to about the length of How_to_care_for_a_pet_cockatoo, so that in the event of a vfd, I can always say "But the pet cockatoo article has been there since Sep 2003!"</li>
</ul>

<p>Adam, I posted in the /General board on the Middle Ages Project, and was wondering, does that show up in your watchlist automatically, or do you have to post there first?</p>
<p>BTW mutual congrats on First Crusade reaching Featured Article, it will help draw in more editors (hopefully that will be a good thing), and nice to be recognized. Most significant is the current Google Rank of 4; it is already one of the most popular sites on the Internet, I wouldn't be surprised if more people read it than read many books on the subject! --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 15:18, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I want to respond to this. I have never posed from 198.82.71.55, that is an IP from Virginia Tech which is a long distance from anywhere I've ever posted from. I'm sure you can confirm that easily. I did not post ANY abuses against <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a>, all I did was take a rant he wrote about Jerzy Kosinski on the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elie_Wiesel_d7b0.html" title="Elie Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> page and move it to the talk page. I noted why I did this (it was poorly written, clearly POV and just as long as the entire article on Wiesel when Wiesel's involvement in the whole business was peripheral at best. Even Cautious understands this since when he reinserted a reference to Kosinski he wrote only a single sentence. Somebody else wrote an italicized comment on the talk page after my comment calling Cautious "dimwitted", but that wasn't me. For this misunderstanding Cautious has called me a "notoric abuser" on my user page and bitched about me to admins rather than attempting to talk to me directly. This does not give me much confidence in wikipedia as a promising collaborative intellectual effort. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 04:43, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
