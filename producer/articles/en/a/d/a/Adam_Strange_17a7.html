<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Strange_17a7.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h3>
<p>Strange is an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeologist.html" title="Archeologist">archeologist</a> suddenly <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleport.html" title="Teleport">teleported</a> from Earth to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_science_fiction.html" title="Planets in science fiction">fictional planet</a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rann.html" title="Rann">Rann</a> through the "<a href="../../../r/a/n/Rann.html#Rann_Technology" title="Rann">Zeta Beam</a>." Called on to protect the planet from <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture.html" title="Extraterrestrial life in popular culture">extraterrestrial</a> threats using high-tech weaponry, Strange grew to care for the planet and its inhabitants, especially the blue-haired Alanna. Independently wealthy, he traveled Earth, intercepting the regular patterns of the Zeta Beam to defend Rann and be with Alanna.</p>
<p>Strange’s adventures were published in a several <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthology.html" title="Anthology">anthology</a> series in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">60s</a> and, although never a headlining character, he has had a consistent presence in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_universe_6a6e.html" title="DC universe">DC universe</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Strange_17a7.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h3>
<p>Created by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardner_Fox_9234.html" title="Gardner Fox">Gardner Fox</a>, Adam Strange is reminiscent of <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Rice_Burroughs_5e8a.html" title="Edgar Rice Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>'s <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carter_of_Mars_0114.html" title="John Carter of Mars">John Carter of Mars</a> series. Both characters have origins in which they are chased by threatening aboriginal peoples only to find themselves mysteriously transported at the last moment to distant planets where they become heroic figures. In Carter's case this was to Mars, while Adam Strange was transported to Rann, though the John Carter stories depicted a more raw sort of adventure that included swordplay, physical action, nudity, and bloodletting. These are absent from the Adam Strange stories, however both characters shared a longing to travel to a strange world with alien opponents to fight and to be united with a beloved woman who resided there.</p>
<p>Like most other (non-<a href="../../../e/c/_/EC_Comics_0443.html" title="EC Comics">EC</a>) comic book science fiction stories of the 1950s, the problems and their stories were contrived, the solutions often based on haphazard application of simple scientific principles. After the initial run in <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Showcase_%28comics%29.html" title="Showcase (comics)">Showcase</a></i>, they moved to <i><a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_in_Space_ad12.html" title="Mystery in Space">Mystery in Space</a></i> (#53-100, 102), drawn by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Infantino_ca41.html" title="Carmine Infantino">Carmine Infantino</a> and inked by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy_Anderson_4e2e.html" title="Murphy Anderson">Murphy Anderson</a>. He later appeared in <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_Adventures_7704.html" title="Strange Adventures">Strange Adventures</a></i> (reprints in #217 thru 244; new stories in #222, 226/227 text stories with illos).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Strange_17a7.html" title="Edit section: Costume">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Costume</span></h3>
<p>His costume was a red <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumpsuit.html" title="Jumpsuit">jumpsuit</a> with a crested helmet, worn with a white <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_pack.html" title="Rocket pack">rocket pack</a> that was fastened on by white cross-straps. Alanna wore one too, and the standard means of transport they used on Rann was to fly to scenes of danger together.</p>

<p>One spectacular, even award-winning, story, however, resulted from a continuity gaffe in the <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League of America</a></i> comic book, in which the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Allen_57cf.html" title="Barry Allen">Flash</a> mentioned him as a possible new member for the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a>. That group and he had not met, and when a letter to the editor reported this, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardner_Fox_9234.html" title="Gardner Fox">Gardner Fox</a> wrote a story showing how the JLA came to Rann and how Adam Strange got them out of the traps that <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanjar_Ro_e971.html" title="Kanjar Ro">Kanjar Ro</a> set for them there.</p>
<p>For years, the character was a regular presence in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>. By the 1980s, the acclaimed <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a> provided a more cynical reason for his visits to Rann. Apparently, the population of the planet -- the majority of whom viewed the Terran with contempt -- is sterile, and the real reason for Adam's presence is to be a breeding <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stud_%28animal%29.html" title="Stud (animal)">stud</a>. This new situation was further illustrated in a 1990 <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_series.html" title="Limited series">limited series</a> where Adam learned of the population's opinion of him and Alanna died giving birth to their daughter Aleea. In <i>JLA</i> #20 (July 1998), Alanna was revealed to be alive, and at the end of the story, she was reunited with her husband and daughter, albeit briefly as Adam was transported back to Earth soon after Alanna's arrival.</p>

In the series, Adam was prepared to relocate to Rann permanently when he was informed that the planet was destroyed and that he was blamed for its destruction. In fact, Sardath transported Rann to another dimension to save the planet from the cosmic being, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbreaker.html" title="Starbreaker">Starbreaker</a>, intent on destroying the planet. Adam, with the help of the <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega_Men_5ef1.html" title="Omega Men">Omega Men</a> and the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkstars.html" title="Darkstars">Darkstars</a>, among others, saved Rann and defeated the evil being.</p>
