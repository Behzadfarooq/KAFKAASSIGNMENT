<dd>Then we'll revert it, and if they persist we can always protect the page (deleting doesn't help here, as they can always just copy and paste the text in again).</dd>
<dd>My reply on both pages was done by copy and pasting the text to both, it may be a little more work but it keeps the discussion legible afterwards (as opposed to just replying on the person whom you're talking to's talk page which means the discussion gets split up into two parts, one with the replies and one with the responses and to read it back you have to interleave them again, or as opposed to just replying to people on your own talk page, which means the person you're talking to doesn't get a new messages indicator and has to check the user pages of all the users they've conversed with recently for replies (which I often end up forgetting and having a large watchlist means these things can easily go unnoticed)). You don't have to though, there are lots of people who chose for one of the less laborious methods. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 22:08, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I changed the template back to SockBlock; "Willy Wonka Bonka Tatonka" was a Mickey/Mr.LOL sock, not a WOW. Mickey is a regular vandal who focuses his vandalism on a few select editors who have blocked him for vandalism in the past; WWBT's only edit was to my talk page. His vandalism is usually of the "User:X is so gay" variety; I haven't seen all the Mickeys (there have probably been about 50 incarnations over the last three months), but I don't think he's ever done page move vandalism.</p>
<p>Since you made the change, I felt it was appropriate to let you know why I was changing back; I know I hate it when I do something useful and it is reverted without comment. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 06:08, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree the category Category:Wikipedia:Sockpuppets_of_Willy_on_Wheels should be removed. However, perhaps we should make a Template:WoW-suspected or something along those lines to mark the suspected sockpuppets as opposed to the ones that have actually vandalized (and then swap the category for Template:WoW). The problem for this would be the addition of unnnecessary user page creation, so I'm not sure what I'm proposing would be useful in the first place. Just a way to categorize the actual versus suspected socks, but I'm not sure it would be needed. Your thoughts? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Rock_8cd3.html" title="User:Adam Rock">Adam</a><strong class="selflink"><sup><span style="color:brown">Rock</span></sup></strong> 18:30, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmm. An interesting idea, but I'm not sure how much it gains us. The single WoW template/category serves well enough for both types of SPs (used, and sleeper). I just don't see the benefit we would gain from templaing them differently. It would also be quite a bit more work, especially moving the existing sleeper socks over to the new template. As for user page creation, we're already creating pages for every WoW sock, sleeper or used, so I don't see two templated as being bigger in that sense. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 19:06, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I just like the thought of categorizing the difference between a suspect and a proven guilty vandal, similar to the accounts on WP:ViP/WoW. That way people wouldn't ever have to list accounts there any more, and we could solely rely on Category:Wikipedia:Sockpuppets_of_Willy_on_Wheels and Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Willy_on_Wheels as links from WP:ViP/WoW. As it stands now, the list there is pseudo-comprehensive, and there's a constant need to update either ViP/WoW or add a {{WoW}} to the users listed. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Rock_8cd3.html" title="User:Adam Rock">Adam</a><strong class="selflink"><sup><span style="color:brown">Rock</span></sup></strong> 19:28, September 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you want to replace the ViP/WoW lists with the categories? Hmm. not sure that's a good idea. The lists in ViP/WoW provide quite a bit of information in a single place that cannot easily be reproduced in a category system. The dates of attack/block, for one. And the useful extra comments on a number of the ones that were used for attacks. There's just no way to show all that information for all the entries of a category. I may be able to be persuaded on this one, but at the moment, it just does not sound like a great idea to me.

<p>Well, since somebody messaged me about an edit that I would honestly never make, and looked in "my contributions" in the SuperDude username, I figured that Willy was trying to take over legitimate usernames to circumvent security.

<p>Hi. I've noticed that you're making use of political or religious <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">userboxes</a> on your user page. They can be a nifty way to share about one's personal preferences, but I realized, after a while, that they often detract from the real purpose of Wikipedia, that is, writing an encyclopedia. I'm inviting you to consider these words from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, the site operator:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc. userboxes and asking others to do the same. This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project. They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time. Will you help me?</dd>
