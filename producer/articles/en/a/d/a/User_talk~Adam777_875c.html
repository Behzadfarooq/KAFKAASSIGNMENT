	    <p>You're right, I went with the top towns by population, according to the Antigua &amp; Barbuda census. I'm not sure a Top 3 ranking makes much sense, in any case, and would argue that the amount of commerce done in Liberta and English Harbour outstrip that in Parham or Falmouth. (I think it would make sense to lump Falmouth and English Harbour anyway, as they flow into each other and share in supporting the yachting "industry.") I would be happy to continue this discussion. I just visit Antigua annually (since 1980) and if you live there, I would defer to you (and consider you very fortunate).</p>

<p>Hi. I am mentioning this here as I dont want this to get involved in the upcoming mediation regarding the TRNC. You recent additions to the history section are a direct copy and paste from Leonidas Koumakis's 'The Miracle a true story'. The information is pertient, though some parts of it arent neutral. However by doing a direct copy and paste you may be in violation of copyright. You might want to re-write that information or get a fair use agreement for it, as it is doubtful that another editor will let it stand. I will not touch it as I dont want to begin an edit war.

Why do you claim that they are not neutral? Prove it --Aristovoulos 12:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, My name is James and I think your views on the ocupation of cyprus are very biased. I have just read the disscussion page and it is not my or Aristovoulos's POV that TRNC is not a seperate state but a Fact. Let me show you why...</p>
<p>If england invaded north wales tomorrow and called it the english republic of wales (which is exactly what turkey did to cyprus) would you agree that it was a state/country? I doubt it, so please refrain from spreading lies</p>

<p>Maybe he has a biased view but you also do. You have stated have you not that though not recognised officialy you believe that TRNC is a state which IS a lie. It is in fact an ocupation of another country. The UN recognises this fact <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlogankid_69fb.html" title="User:Slogankid">Slogankid</a> 17:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh god not another one. The TRNC is a 'De Facto' state. The term de facto means - in practice (illegal or legal). Nowhere have I said or even suggested that the TRNC is a legal entity but 'In Practice' it is a self governing state/region/entity or whatever you wish to call it. WILL YOU PLEASE look up the definition of de facto. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a></dd>

<dd>*Sigh* another one lost to turkish propaganda. In fact, In Practise, Legal and Illeagal are totaly seperate things.

<dd>Oh dear god you cant even comprehend what is written. The term de facto is applied regardless of the legality or illegality of something, sorry but thats a fact look it up. Secondly if the TRNC isnt a factual state (and yes an illegal one at that) then what is it...make believe? If you cross the green line moving north you will find yourself in an illegal, self governing region which is self named the TRNC....now thats a FACT or do you dispute that as well? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 17:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>When in fact calling the TRNC a 'de facto illegal state in the north of the republic of cyprus' will suffice.Adam777</i></p>
<p>please explain why the two differ so much and you claim that it is a Greek POV when it is a "copy-paste" from the Security Council?</p>
<p>The "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" was self-declared. The UN considers TRNC as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal. It possesses an administration and infrastructure, located in the north of the Republic of Cyprus. The de jure Republic of Cyprus can not exert its authority over its northern third, because of the Turkish forces.</p>
<p>Pease read them both and explain.Aristovoulos 20:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would put 'illeagaly occupied area in northen cyprus' rather than an illegal state --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlogankid_69fb.html" title="User:Slogankid">Slogankid</a> 12:36, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dude, please, I did not bring any meat or vegie puppet to any wikipedia. Get your facts straight. The mediation asked for a poll when the mediation understood that there was an issue (at least from my side), get your facts straight again. Why is your intro different from mine? That is what i do not understand and ask you to explain.Why do you keep passionately resisting what the security council states on this dispute and keep accusing me with no evidence.If for any reason you do not want to give me the answer in wikipedia kust say so, drop me a line i will email you and you reply... honestly--Aristovoulos 22:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi LawrenceTrevallion, (I am also pasting this on Adams Talk page)</p>
<p>As you can see i am still trying to have a conversation with <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a>. As you also can see when Adam is questioned and has no answer he immediately changes the subject and accuses myself of being biased. Lets try to give Adam some more time, I need an answer on the following question from Adam, then we could discuss a poll.</p>
<p><b>Adams Intro</b> <i><b>"when in fact calling the TRNC a 'de facto illegal state in the north of the republic of cyprus' will suffice. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 19:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)"</b></i></p>
<p><br />

<p>lets give him some time..Aristovoulos 09:18, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam777, I want to know your opinion about putting the intro to a vote? I see nothing wrong with it if both sides agree to let the vote be binding. Let me know on the talk page. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrenceTrevallion_b945.html" title="User:LawrenceTrevallion">LawrenceTrevallion</a> 18:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My mediation is not binding, which is why I did not simply declare it and refuse any other suggestions. I cannot enforce my decision about "de facto" and Aristovoulos was still expressing concerns about it, which is one reason I decided to try a vote. The Cabal does not rule Wikipedia, though perhaps we will one day. &#160;:) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrenceTrevallion_b945.html" title="User:LawrenceTrevallion">LawrenceTrevallion</a> 01:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam stop accusing me and prove your accusations!!!!! Prove it or APOLOGIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I respect your opinions but not your accusations. I consider you a passionated person and i respect that too BUT NOT YOUR ACCUSATIONS.--Aristovoulos 16:29, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I think that both should have a citation. i added an exact number for the missing GCs. be sure that when a number (any number) will be provided for the TCs, i will add the citation i said. i've choosen the number 1619, not cause it is higher, of course, but cause this is the only "exact" number i found. there have indeed been found some remains, however, most of them have not been identified(DNA)/proven to be non-human bones/proven to be older than 1974 or recent. i would propose a double number: 15..-1619 (or maybe the first could be lower if coming from reliable source). honestly, i am not giving a source at the moment because i am too lazy to search and find the most valid one (hard to search 2,7 million google results <a href="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=missing+greeks+cyprus&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=missing+greeks+cyprus&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Regards --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 02:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am posting your comment here for continuity. Kindly keep the conversation here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nico the use of italics around the word turkish republic of northern cyrpus and your use of the weassel word 'styles' are POV and I have reverted them again. I corrected some text with a better use of English as well. We can discuss this like adults or you can continue to push POV edits on the cyrpus article - its up to you. The current version is neutral and anyone that isnt Greek would agree with me on that.

<p>Response:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't notice about italics. Never thought it would be considered POV, but don't mind normal font.</li>
<li>I removed 'styles' in my next edit (bad-English, not sure why it can be considered "POV" because I can't tell what it means; can you? -anyway I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyprus&amp;curid=5593&amp;diff=81814290&amp;oldid=81813964" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyprus&amp;curid=5593&amp;diff=81814290&amp;oldid=81813964" rel="nofollow">removed it</a>.)</li>
<li>I am more than willing to discuss, as an adult or even as a child if you wish&#160;:-). Haven't shown otherwise to anyone.</li>
<li>Call me 'sensitive' if you wish, but I consider...
<ul>
<li>Large headlines like "= Nico drop the POV =", as well as</li>
<li>text like "you can continue to push POV edits" (huh? <i>continue</i>? when did I edit that article again? apart from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyprus&amp;diff=80796435&amp;oldid=80789948" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyprus&amp;diff=80796435&amp;oldid=80789948" rel="nofollow">this</a> maybe?), and</li>
<li>"anyone that isnt Greek would agree with me" (implying that all Greeks are biased)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...do not exactly help in maintaining one's temper and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.</li>
<li>However, I am willing to put that behind me and cooperate to ameliorate the article. Just, please, be discreet from now on and assume my edits are sincere and unbiased, until proven otherwise. Let us not start on the wrong foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest, which doesn't concern our 'personal' e-relationship, we can discuss in the article talk if you wish. Ok?</p>

<dd>HI Nico. Well after going back over everything today I realise I overeacted. I honestly apologise, my main issue was those italics and it never even entered my head that it could be an ommission and not deliberate. I'll take a little more time when editing at work. I am honestly sorry.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also apologise for the 'All Greeks' dig, that was childish of me and in the calm light of day wasnt very friendly at all. I do try to keep neutral even though Im well aware I must miss the mark at times. The two items I did change - ie the 'Northern Part' is a small issue that as a native English speaker I picked up on, its a small matter of the flow of words, very minor. The second was 'self styled' now whilst this is exactly what the TRNC is the phrase 'self styled' implies a certain negative tone. Again thats a small issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So to recap - I overreacted and I will count to ten in future. YOu have my sincere apologies. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 22:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it is not POV. Your version violates, as I have already pointed out (on <a href="../../../t/r/n/Talk%7ETRNC_a17c.html" title="Talk:TRNC">Talk:TRNC</a> - there is a big discussion). In fact, calling it the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is Turkish POV - occupied Cyprus or northern Cyprus is more neutral. Finally, don't threaten me.--<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekleni_17fc.html" title="User:Tekleni">Tekleni</a> 16:39, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Undue weight doesnt apply. Greece and the ROC alone refer to the TRNC as 'Occupied Cyprus' pretty much the rest of the world uses the TRNC. This has been explained to you in the TRNC talk page and becuase of your nationalism you simply refuse to accept this, as it states in Undue weight We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view. You have not addressed why you need to extended the intro past being concise and neutral. The italics are POV please remove them (as you have yet to justify why they are being used). The past version was concise and neutral, your edits are CLEARLY desigend to push POV. Please re-word them or I will escalate this issue. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 16:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No state recognizes an entity called TRNC in northern Cyprus other than Turkey, egro presenting it as a fact is undue weight and Turkish POV. Even the liberal BBC calls it <i>the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</i> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1016541.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1016541.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The world (except Turkey) is in consensus that there is no TRNC, only occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus. I refuse to accept your wording - make a more neutral proposal if you want. In this case, Turkish POV is the extremely small minority POV.--<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekleni_17fc.html" title="User:Tekleni">Tekleni</a> 17:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what do these other countries call the entity that they dont recognise...that right they call it the 'TRNC'. Your ideas of neutrality are laughable at best. My suggestion is (again) to remove the italics, re-word the pov slant of 'regime' and 'styles' and then is no dissagreement from me despite your need to duplicate details in the intro that are found in the article. YOu still havent explained why you are using italics? Have a good weekend I wont be back on Wikipedia till next week. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 17:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No they don't call it the TRNC (provide proof of that - they use weasel words and avoid referring to it as such, but calling it something which <i>calls itself the TRNC</i> etc - see CIA World Factbook for an example <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/cy.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/cy.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - note the scare quotes). I'm using italics <i>in lieu</i> of scare quotes, which is what the UN and the CIA above uses (as I'm sure you're well aware) - I think they are more neutral that scare quotes. Also, regime and styles have nothing to do with neutrality - the governments of legitimate states (e.g. North Korea and Iran) have been referred to as regimes.--<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekleni_17fc.html" title="User:Tekleni">Tekleni</a> 17:25, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the flight is late so Ive got some time. Lets be honest here, you are using italics in place of scare quotes to push your pov. The comparison between IRan and North Korea is interesting as they are regimes where totalitarins hold power. The inhabitants of the TRNC get to vote for their head of state, so they have a democratic system in place. The use of regime is about as accurate as calling the government of Sweden a regime. Anyway I think this is part of a broader issue on Wikipedia that has arisen due people with extreme points of view pushing their version of reality onto others. I think its time to take the main issues to a formal mediation and see what they see. I have read through your arguments on the TRNC page and looked at your edit history, you obviously have a dislike for anything related to Turkey and arent shy showing that in your selective edits. I am of the opinion that it is a waste of time to debate with you for that reason and I am prepared to let a biding formal mediation handle that. Take care. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 17:43, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Read the bleeding article, why don't you. Just to summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only player to lead the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Lions_f459.html" title="British Lions">British Lions</a> on two tours.</li>
<li>84 England caps; England's most capped lock forward.</li>
<li>Lead England to world cup victory in 2003</li>
<li>Lead Leicester to back-to-back European cup victories</li>
<li>Lead Leicester to four (or five dependnig on how you count)</li>
</ul>
<p>It says this in the article. Now there are numerous sources that all say the same thing. Johnno was not no ordinary rugby player. I've seen him play. His leadership was phenomenal; Leicester were, nay are, a different team without him at the helm.
