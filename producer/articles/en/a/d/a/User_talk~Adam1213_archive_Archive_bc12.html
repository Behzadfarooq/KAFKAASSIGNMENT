<dd>Adam, you're sig is getting longer and longer. Not only does it take a lot of space and attract a lot of attention on the pages, it also takes a lot of space when someone wants to edit a page. With lots of long sigs, it becomes harder and harder to find the text you're looking for to edit. So please don't set a bad example for other (future) Wikipedians and make your sig way smaller: both in code and in appearance. Thanks! --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> 16:57, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll second -- or ninth or tenth, I guess -- this comment. Your signature is absurdly long, and quite apart from the trouble it causes others when trying to edit wikitext, makes you look quite ridiculous. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 06:37, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree. It is rediculously long and uses far too much code. It makes it hard to edit anything where you have left your signature.

<p>I ended up on your talk page somewhat randomly, but noticed this and thought I might comment; apologies if the intrusion isn't welcome. Anyway, one thing I've done with my signature is to put a <tt>&lt;span&gt;</tt> around it and set the span's CSS class to my username. That way, I can have my <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_monobook.css_4df7.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid/monobook.css">custom CSS</a> highlight my signature just for me. So I see my sig with a nice, green background, making it easy for me to spot my comments in pages, without being distracting to other people. Just a thought!

<p>There should be a page protection type that a group of users that remove vandalism a lot and admins can put on a page that lets users that are logged in only edit a page. This will help bring the ammount of vandalism down. (Signature removed because of the amount of markup it requires)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Adam, we rarely, if ever, protect pages except in extreme cases. Most administrators will not protect a page on request without looking very closely at the edit history, and without examining whether or not other forms of dispute resolution have been ineffective. In addition, changing whether or not anonymous users can edit is in fact a configuration issue which can only be altered by our developer team; not the admins. Who are admins to decide who can edit and who can't? We're not going to sacrifice our principles of open editing by anyone, especially not when vandalism can be dealt with rather swiftly.</dd>

<p>The script doesn't add content to an existing page. It will erase whatever is there before with whatever you give to it as input. Unless you use the <code>-e</code> option, that is.</p>
<p>I suppose it would not be terribly hard to do this; the script could capture and store the content of the editing textarea during its first visit to the target page when it gets the wpEditToken. Then, the script would need to be further customized to do whatever altering you want it to do to the text. Actually, if all you wanted to do was do something like add a standard template to the top or add something like a category to the bottom of a page, it wouldn't be too hard to improve the script to include "prepend" and "append" options. The script would have to save the original content, then output the prepend text, the original article text, and the append text. There's a variety of ways that could be done...</p>

<dd>Hi Cool Cat. Just cleaned your talk up a touch at the bottom, but that ain't why I'm here. Like to point out that JTK removed Adam's access because of an inappropriate comment Adam made which, as I understand it, caused JTK to worry about Adam's understanding of IRC precedents and of Freenode's guidelines on keeping things cool.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, I'm becoming worried that Adam still isn't getting it. I would love for someone to take him under their wing - hell, I'd do it myself. Can you maybe suggest to him that he needs to read up a few things and get some understanding of the wiki way into his head? If you want, refer him to me for informal mentoring or something; he's a clueless newbie who doesn't need to run into the wrong sort of trouble - we can sort it, no problems. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_Article_Help_Desk_86be.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured Article Help Desk">FAHD</a></i></sup> 01:32, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Adam; I noticed your message to me, quoted here:</p>
<p>"This message is regarding the article Cascade Range. Please stop. If you continue to vandalize pages, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia."</p>
<p>I am a contributing editor to the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia and sought to contribute to the Cascade Range, not "vandalize" it. The geographical description of the Canadian side of the range, and the Canadian perspective on its history, were missing from the article so I added them. Is Wikipedia exclusively for US content only? I grant that my verbal style is overwrought at points but I'm just trying to be complete.</p>
<p>Blocking me from contributing to Wikipedia will be a great loss, given the amount of new items I've added for various regions, streams and other items concerning British Columbia and its people(s).</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>The following is an example of the kind of error-ridden statements that were contained in the Cascade Range article; I have not yet fixed the following because apparently the Cascade Range entry is your personal turf - so it's your responsibility to make corrections. Quote:</p>
<p><i>Another major pass was cut by the Fraser River through mainly non-volcanic rocks in the British Columbian part of the range. This group of mountains are often called the "Coast Mountains" but are in fact structurally part of the Cascades. Mount Garibaldi and its associated group of volcanoes are in this part of the range.</i></p>
<p>Mount Garibaldi is a member of the Cascade group or family of volcanoes, but it is NOT part of the Cascade Range, nor are the Coast Mountains. Volcanic formations immediately north of Garibaldi, including the Black Tusk and Callaghan and Cayley and Meager, are NOT part of the Cascade family of volcanoes.</p>
<p>The only portion of the Cascade Range in Canada is to the south and east of the Fraser River, south of the Similkameen River and southwest of Merritt, and the notes I added to the Cascade Range article concerning its summits tonight are accurate and drawn from the [<a href="http://bivouac.com" class="external text" title="http://bivouac.com" rel="nofollow">Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia</a>]. See <a href="http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1362" class="external free" title="http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1362" rel="nofollow">http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1362</a> and <a href="http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1694" class="external free" title="http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1694" rel="nofollow">http://bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1694</a>. The Coast Mountains are a distinct geographic grouping (official in Canadian geography; the term "Cascades" is used in older legal language for certain terminologies, but it has long since been abandoned by academic geographers and the general public. The term Coast Mountains stretches from the Fraser to the Takhini, i.e. Chilkoot Pass.</p>
<p>The Fraser River is not a "pass" but skirts the border of the range. Even if the Coast Mountains <i>were</i> part of the Cascade Range (which they aren't, no more than the Cascade Range are part of the Coast Mountains) the Fraser would not be a pass. A pass has a summit and divides two drainages. Go find yourself a dictionary of geographical terms somewhere before you write any new articles.</p>

<p>Would you happen to know how to make a firefox extension using Javascript? It would be very simple and used to fight vandalism. The basic idea is to feed RC diff's into firefox, and let it determine which pages contain text (such as an obscenity) listed in a file. For pages that don't contain anything on this list, the tab is closed. The others remain open and ready to be examined. If you can't figure out how to hookup the IRC RC output into firefox, then it could be used with <a href="../../../c/d/v/WP%7ECDVF_3ebb.html" title="WP:CDVF">WP:CDVF</a> to open new tabs in firefox to be checked.

The reason is that redirects shouldn't crosspace (a redirect on article space should redirect to another article, not to something into Wikipedia: namespace). I recommned you not to create these redirects since they will be ether removed or pointed to somewhere else (as <a href="../../../c/v/u/Cvu.html" title="Cvu">Cvu</a> did).</p>
<p>You can read about the policy at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a> where it says under "When should we delete a redirect?"</p>

<dd>Hi, from what I understand things got out of control. This log does not look like the en-wikipedia-vandalism log as Karynn and AngryParsley do not show up there as far as I know.</dd>
<dd>I have in the passed also suffered from simmilar conversations. I had an Angryparsley declare me "a bad candidate for adminship" because of a conversation with him which he explained later that he was trolling. After the incident several IRC users have 'cooled' me down a bit so that I do not do something stupid like responding to him. The only way to keep a troll of is to ignore them.</dd>
<dd>Best practice would be to bail out of any such discussion ops dont like. IRC isn't generaly about who is right but more about an "op makes right". Please, please dont let people anger/intimidate you; just /ignore such people.</dd>
<dd>Tonikaku, I gave you a level 3 access as I do not see any valid/good reason for access removal. I do not want to fork the matter as that would be the best interest of the wikipedia project.</dd>
<dd>I understand several people are giving you a somewhat harder time, know that all they want to achieve is an Adam1213 whom would be an example to us all. Also realise some people appear to be <i>less friendly</i> towards newbies and generally expect them to be perfect so they point out even minor mistakes. This can be irritating at times but should not be interpreted as them hating you.</dd>

<dd>Well, first of all, I agree with your comment about Jews' aversion to killing. As you can see from AE's comments, many editors think I'm philosemitic. But I did suport the Religious persecution by Jews article because I think that all religious groupings have persecuted other groups, and that such persecutions are notable. As for your level ten rating in Wikipedia vandalism...well, if you change your vote on my RfA that's your business, not mine, but I've never even been in the Wikipedia vandalism IRC channel. How was I responsible for getting your level ten access taken away??? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 10:35, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>One) i didnt get your first almost warning, until after all my additions were done.</p>
<p>two) I thought any one could add to a wikipedia article.</p>
<p>three) these are facts about what the apostle paul, a jew, did believe about the criteria that made one a jew or not.</p>
<pre>
     and there are jews who believe Jesus to be the messiah, jews who think him a great teacher and jews who think of as a      heritic.

<p>1) christianity does not trace jesus to moses. And nobody jew or christian, links anybody to moses father, I'm not sure i'm following you. Jews and christians trace jewishness, originally, through the father's line to abraham. They, both also, link the messiah to king david through the father's line. so, by birth and through christ they believe they and christianity are jewish. just cause most don't believe this don't make it not true. its messiannic POV vs Treditional jews POV.

<p>Adam, the addition of differing viewpoints do not constitute vandalism.</p>
<p>I am really concerned about your understanding of the Wikipedia principles, as well as your comprehension abilities. I haven't seen you contribute anything to Wikipedia except in the area of counter-vandalism, and now I really wonder about those efforts as well. It looks like even your counter-vandalism friends are concerned about your presumptuous and underinformed actions.</p>
<p>Are you looking to add value to Wikipedia or are you looking to be some sort of hero? Good writing and good knowledge will get you further than attacking people whose viewpoints you don't agree with. Wikipedia is not a place for vigilantism. If you would actually research into how Wikipedia works you would see that there are plenty of systems in place to deal with problems and that there is no need for you to put on a cape and rescue articles from easily-cleanable stains.</p>

<p>Hi, i almost never use wikipedia, and i have NEVER added a single letter to any of it. Im not even signed in. i dont even know if i HAVE a sign-in. but when i came to wikipedia today to look up a musician, there was a link that said i have "messages" and then theres all these accusations of vandalism and that im going to be blocked. which i find shocking because i did nothing of the sort, and im not even 'signed in'. im really upset because it says that i 'vandalised' natalee holloway which is dispicable and insulting because i did no such thing. maybe you can help me be sending an email to bogdanawdwNOSPAMatNOSPAMaolDOTcom just take out the capital letters. i dont need robots stealing my ID since imaginary robots are also apparently vandalising wikipedia under my name i didnt even know i owned. thanks.</p>

[03:23:57] &lt;Jtkiefer&gt; all I want done is for him to drop the issue, to forget about ops and to continue like normal
[03:24:13] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; can I copy that last line to his talk page?
[03:24:29] &lt;Jtkiefer&gt; yeah, sure
</pre>
<p>Jtkiefer, says he is ready to forget about this given you agree to forget about it.</p>
<p>You may feel the need to seek "justice", however it probably is in the best interest of wikipedia to drop the issue. IIRC you do not seek some sort of punishment for Jtkiefer so I also feel you want to be left alone and be able to fight vandalism in the channel w/o interference.</p>
<p>I say lets forget about the issue and deal with <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. This conflict only benefits vandals as it distracts us (you, Jtkiefer, me and anybody else involved) to some extent to focus on the big picture.</p>

<p>I stopped putting in numbers a couple of months ago because it is a major chore to update them as this table gets bigger. The only wiki code markup code that generates numbers automatically are numbered lists and unamed links like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which would mean getting rid of the table and reformatting the data to a list. But if you are willing to do update it yourself on a regular basis... <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 02:35, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbered lists (using #) will not work unless I remove the table formatting and I put it into a list. But I prefer the table because it seperates the data into columns that are easy to read. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 02:49, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yup. I created my account using the name "FireFox" because that basically is who I am on the internet, always with two capital F's. At the time, I didn't know that <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirefox_461e.html" title="User:Firefox">User:Firefox</a> existed, but that came to my attention when I tried experimenting to signatures and my links took me to the wrong place...

<p>well as one of the "directors" I guess it's my duty to help solving this. I'm in the middle of a travel until next week so I'll see what I can do today as my net access is very limited. HOWEVER keep this in mind and repeat this 100 times to yourself:</p>
<p><b>IRC access (actually ANYTHING IRC) carries no relationship with Wikipedia (website) status</b></p>
<p>so even if you don't get your voice or status back (which it's unlikely I think, although most probably you'll be able to rejoin), remember that "being a CVU" means only that, it doesn't mean you get access or you get IRC priviledges. So please stop bugging people off or next time I won't be able to intercede by you, and the converse is true also: you <b>not having IRC access doesn't mean you're a worse or lesser contributor to wikipedia</b> -- ( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini's <small><sub>vandalproof</sub></small> page</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big>☎</big></a> ) 11:02, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, you can archive topics from your talk page and have the archive in order. I would only prefer if you put the oldest topics in your talk page in the archive, so that you would not leave any gaps in the time order of the topics. Just select some of the oldest topics on your talk page and put them in the archive. I would wish that you do not, however, archive a newer topic and leave an older topic in your talk page. It is confusing. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 06:55, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your suggestion to place those templates on my user page, thanks but no thanks. I would prefer to not clutter up my user page with template boxes like that, and it is already explained on the page about HTML and JavaScript. Also, you placing the actual templates on my talk page was putting my talk page into all their respective categories amongst other users with the templates on their user page. My page in the User_talk namespace in those categories were not what the templates were meant to be used for.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would also not like to use your AutoIt template which has neither been peer reviewed nor accepted by anyone. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaverocks_009d.html" title="User:Daverocks">Daverocks</a> 12:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I rebooted the bot, although I suspect ıt started working prior. I'll add that to the thıngs to do. Realise that wikipedia does die and when that happens I do not want the bot to restart.

<p>I don't know about mirc programming but in most programming languages reading or writing to files takes a while and uses CPU. I think that the bot does this. if it had the files contence as variables instead of reading files all the time it could go much faster and use less cpu --<span class="plainlinks" style="border: 2px solid #0000CC; padding: 1px;"><b><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam1213_226f.html" title="User:Adam1213"><font color="#FF9900">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam1213_226f.html" title="User:Adam1213">dam1213</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam1213_0029.html" title="User talk:Adam1213">Talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adam1213&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adam1213&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></b></span> 06:50, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Somewhat true, reading from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_disk.html" title="Hard disk">hard-drive</a> uses <i>more</i> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> but not all that much. Just a few extra <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instruction_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Instruction (computer science)">instruction</a> exchange in different levels of memory (including <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_side_bus.html" title="Front side bus">system bus</a>) and of course there is the delay due to hard drive read lag. However, in practice that isn't all that much infact all of it does not even take a second.</dd>
<dd>Keeping track of wikipedia requires quite a lot of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_access_memory.html" title="Random access memory">RAM</a> if you try to keep everything in memory. Just the list of IPs can suck up all the ram like there is no tomorow. The bot currently does not compare a given IP edit to <i>all</i> of the IP's stored. It follows a makeshift <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_search_tree.html" title="Binary search tree">binary search tree</a> model reading from a sorted system of folders and files (over several thousand files just for IPs. The bot does not even read admin lists, blacklisted pages if a minor edit is made by a user (NullC's bot covers sneaky vandalism so I dont worry about that as it requires direct access to wikipedia servers which I lack and NullC does not).</dd>
<dd>Also the now 700+ lines of admin lists would not fit in a single memory variable on mirc which at most holds 1000 characters. Anything above is delcared an overflow and is ignored. A lot of admin usernames have a decent lenght. So it would take a number of variables just to take care of that. Since the start of the bots lifespan we had about 200 new admins. The growing list will require more and more variables which is increasingly harder to implement and keep track of compared to overwriting a single file.</dd>
<dd>These are few of the many problems why I am hesitant to dump it all to memory.</dd>
<dd>The primary reason of bots speed is because of my very very slow internet connection. I am yet to convince Brion/Tim to allow me to host the bot on the wikipedia servers which would make the bot reliable however would also make it hard to update.</dd>
