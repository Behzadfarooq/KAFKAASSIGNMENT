	    <p>Cultural Values and Personal Ethics Paper Tracy D. Adams University of Phoenix</p>

<pre>
 The opportunities to expand corporate profits and establish long term relationships with international businesses are not limited to geographical terrains.  Advancements in technologies and an improved understanding of civilizations throughout the world triggered an economic evolution with unlimited trade and industrial opportunities.  Thus, giving marketers’ enormous opportunities to gain target markets in international territories, previously out of reach to corporate America.  Today’s business leaders must possess the ability to understand how personal values, organizational values, cultural values, and ethical dilemmas influence their personal and professional decisions during international business negotiations.  Negotiators are people, with build in personal values, that may or may not agree with other stakeholders involve in the decision making process.
</pre>
<pre>
 For example, during a University of Phoenix discussion thread, there were several heated discussions on the use of the English languish in Mexico during business negotiations between USAuto and AutoMex.  Some, students place high values on English as the primary languish during all business negotiations initiated by US companies.  Yet, other students believe the hoist nations languish should be prominent during negotiations on international platforms, regardless who initiated the conference.  As a result, the personal believes of decision maker can either benefit or stifle the negotiation process (Go to Class, Wk-3, Q-1).

 Abortion is considered a morale act “under certain conditions” for some people, yet deemed as a cruel murder and unnecessary action by others, in spite of the situation.  Therefore, when making a personal decision to vote, people who value a women’s right to choose will vote different then those who value pro-life constituents.  Who is right or who is wrong?  The answers are everybody and nobody.  Therefore, to rid us of this confusion, a higher organizational authority is necessary to layout our moral values and ethical guidelines.  
        
</pre>
<p>Organizational values will set the tone during personal and business negotiations. The US legal system has strict guidelines for jury selection and will ask specific questions to test the value system of potential juries. In other words, if a potential juror is against the death penalty, then that juror could be excluded from court cases were capital punishment procedures are evolved. Unfortunately, some potential jurors will lie and falsely confess their disagreement to the death penalty, as a means to get out of the often gruesome civic responsibility called “jury duty”, a classic example of a unethical personal decision making.</p>
<pre>
 Organizational values often surface during international business settings.  The USAuto and AutoMex business venture depicts an obvious difference of organizational values pertaining to labor relation.  USAuto views Mexico as a cheap labor pool and a means to cut manufacturing cost.  While, on the other hand, AutoMex classifies its Mexican labor force as a viable identity within the international business community (Resource).     
</pre>
<p>The world culture is a mold of millions of people structured with personal and organizational values. For example, a basic cultural value for all US citizens is the freedom of speech. But, China, a communist regime, punishes its citizenry for speaking against the government. Yet, China maintains its “status quo” as one of the largest international trade partners with the US. Also, US retailers like Wal-Mart sell products to millions of Americans every day, with made in China logos. Nevertheless, United States continues to have strong economic relations with a country that values the inhumane treatment of its citizens, a value opposite of the American dream of freedom and liberty. The US &amp; China business ventures are considered as unethical business relations by most democratic societies.</p>
<pre>
 Decision makers are faced with a hard decision between what is right and what is best for the organization.  Often, business leaders make unethical decision to maintain the competitive edge over rivals and enhance Profitability.  For example, several major US oil companies, took advantage of American consumers and hiked-up gas prices at the pumps, claiming that hurricane Katrina disrupted the volume of oil distributed to US territories.  However, when the corporate third quarter earnings reports got published, the oil companies made billions in profits as a result of the unethical price hike at American gas stations.   As a result, congressional hearings were call into cession to question the validity of the increase in consumer gas prices (Balz).  Also, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, persuaded some people to take advantage of kind hearted Americans and make unethical personnel decisions to steel money mark as relief aid.  People were collected aid money from concerned citizens who thought they were helping their fellow citizens in a crises situation, only to find out that the money was use for personal gain.  Eventually, the Government got evolved by providing a list of legitimate agencies establish to collect hurricane relief assistance.

<pre>
 The world of international business has created a new platform for decision makers to create opportunities to improve and achieve a higher growth potential.  Therefore, personal values, organizational values, cultural values, and ethical dilemma are factors that can not be ignored during negotiations.  People have different believes and value systems that filter into their organizational and cultural decision making processes.  This value system can cause ethical dilemmas to surface and hinder professional and personal negotiations.  As a result, governments and private organizations have developed a strict set of ethical codes and conducts in order to live a harmonies and peaceful life on earth.  A classic example of ethical codes or values developed at the highest level of authority is the Geneva Conventions, an ethical treaty directing nations how to behave during war and combat situations.  Therefore, Today’s decision makers need to consider the value systems use to form the ethical guidelines at the base of international business relations use to shape the global economic enterprise.
