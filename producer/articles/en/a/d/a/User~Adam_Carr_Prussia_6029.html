<p><b>Prussia</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <b>Preussen</b> or <b>Preußen</b>) was the name of a geographical region, first in the borderlands between <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and later stretching across northern <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>; the name of an independent state from the 17th century until <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>; and the name of the largest territorial unit within the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German Empire</a>, the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">German Republic</a> and the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> from <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.

<p>Prussia began its existence as a small territory in what is now northern <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, an area then being subject to German colonisation. By the time of its abolition it stretched across the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_German_Plain_dfe9.html" title="North German Plain">North German Plain</a> from the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> borders on the west to the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> borders in the east. At its greatest extend before <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> it included much of western Poland as well.</p>
<p>Before its abolition Prussia included, as well as what might be called "Prussia proper" (the regions of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Prussia_61be.html" title="West Prussia">West Prussia</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a>, which now lie in Poland and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>), the regions of <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomerania.html" title="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusatia.html" title="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanover.html" title="Hanover">Hanover</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein_b206.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westphalia.html" title="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse.html" title="Hesse">Hesse</a>, as well as some small detached areas in the south such as <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenzollern.html" title="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a>, the home of the Prussian ruling family.</p>
<p>Being predominantly a north and east German state, Prussia was overwhelmingly <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, although there were some <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> areas in the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland.html" title="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. This in part explains why the Catholic south German states, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, resisted Prussian hegemony for so long. Despite its overwhelmingly German character, Prussia's annexations of Polish territory in the late 18th century brought with them a large and troublesome Polish minority. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> this territory was returned to the newly reconstructed Polish state.</p>

<p>In the 13th century a German order of <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusading</a> knights, the <a href="../../../t/e/u/Teutonic_Knights_454e.html" title="Teutonic Knights">Order of the Teutonic Knights</a>, advanced eastwards from <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> into the Kingdom of Poland, where they created a semi-independent state, which eventually came to control most of what are now <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, as well as parts of northern Poland. From <a href="../../../1/4/6/1466.html" title="1466">1466</a>, the Knights had to acknowledge the sovereignty of the King of Poland and Lithuania. In <a href="../../../1/5/2/1525.html" title="1525">1525</a> the Order was dissolved during the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, and its territory, much reduced, became the Duchy of Prussia within the Kingdom of Poland.</p>
<p>The territory of the Duchy was at this time confined to the area east of the mouth of the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vistula.html" title="Vistula">Vistula</a>, near the present border between Poland and the Russian enclave of <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliningrad.html" title="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a> the Duchy was inherited by the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elector.html" title="Elector">Elector</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sigismund_of_Brandenburg_2648.html" title="John Sigismund of Brandenburg">John Sigismund of Brandenburg</a>, thus uniting Prussia and Brandenburg, a German state centered on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and ruled since the 15th century by the <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenzollern.html" title="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> dynasty, within the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. This state, known as Brandenburg-Prussia, although divided into two parts separated by Polish territory, was steadily drawn out of the orbit of the declining Polish state.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1701.html" title="1701">1701</a> Brandenburg-Prussia became the <b>Kingdom of Prussia</b> under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_I_of_Prussia_1f97.html" title="Frederick I of Prussia">Frederick I</a>, with the permission of the Holy Roman Emperor. Under Frederick II (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_the_Great_9da3.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a>), Prussia seized the province of <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a> from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, and defended it through the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Years_War_5730.html" title="Seven Years War">Seven Years War</a> which ended in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1763.html" title="1763">1763</a> with Prussia as the dominant state of eastern Germany. Prussia also acquired various territories in other parts of Germany through marriage or inheritance, including lands west of the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>.</p>
<p>During this period the formidable Prussian military machine and efficient state bureaucracy were founded, institutions which were to form the foundations of the German state until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. Prussia greatly expanded its territories to the east during the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">Partitions of Poland</a> between <a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_William_II_of_Prussia_2704.html" title="Frederick William II of Prussia">Frederick William II</a> led Prussia into war with revolutionary <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1792.html" title="1792">1792</a>, but was defeated at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Valmy_8e8a.html" title="Battle of Valmy">Valmy</a> and was forced to cede his western territories to France. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia_7406.html" title="Frederick William III of Prussia">Frederick William III</a> resumed the war, but suffered disaster at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Jena_9a39.html" title="Battle of Jena">Jena</a> and withdrew from the war after ceding yet more territory at the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Tilsit_8f95.html" title="Treaty of Tilsit">Treaty of Tilsit</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a> Prussia renounced this treaty and rejoined the war against <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napol%C3%A9on_Bonaparte_1ec9.html" title="Napoléon Bonaparte">Napoléonic</a> France. Her reward in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a> was the recovery of all her lost territories, plus the whole of the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland.html" title="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westphalia.html" title="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, as well as some other territories. These western lands were to be of vital importance because they included the <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhr.html" title="Ruhr">Ruhr</a> valley, centre of Germany's future industrialisation, and particularly the arms industry. Prussia emerged from the Napoléonic Wars as the dominant power in Germany, overshadowing her long-time rival <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>.</p>
<p>The first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between the forces of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, which wanted a united federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and the forces of conservatism, which wanted to keep Germany as a patchwork of weak independent states, with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> the liberals got their chance when <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutions_of_1848.html" title="Revolutions of 1848">revolutions</a> broke out across Europe. An alarmed <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_William_IV_of_Prussia_3d82.html" title="Frederick William IV of Prussia">Frederick William IV</a> agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. But when the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt_Parliament_ffc9.html" title="Frankfurt Parliament">Frankfurt Parliament</a> offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused, on the grounds that revolutionary assemblies could not grant royal titles. Prussia obtained a semi-democratic constitution, but the grip of the landowning classes (the <i><a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkers.html" title="Junkers">junkers</a></i>) remained unbroken.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_Germany_305a.html" title="William I of Germany">William I</a> appointed <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Bismarck_a556.html" title="Otto von Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> as Prussian Chancellor. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and the conservatives, by creating a strong united Germany, but under the domination of the Prussian ruling class and bureaucracy, not the western German liberals. He achieved this by provoking three successive wars, with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>), which gave Prussia <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein_b206.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>), with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>), which allowed Prussia to annex <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanover.html" title="Hanover">Hanover</a> and most other north German territories, and with the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> (the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Prussian_War_94d8.html" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a>) in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, which allowed him to force <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecklenburg.html" title="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Baden_2606.html" title="State of Baden">Baden</a>, <a href="../../../w/u/r/Wurttemberg.html" title="Wurttemberg">Wurttemberg</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxony.html" title="Saxony">Saxony</a> to accept incorporation into a united <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German Empire</a>, of which William I assumed the title of Emperor (Kaiser).</p>
<p>This was the high point of Prussia's fortunes, and had the country had wise leaders, Prussia's economic power and political status might have peacefully made her the centre of European civilisation. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_II_of_Germany_e096.html" title="William II of Germany">William II</a>, who became Emperor in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, was a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views and poor judgement. After dismissing Bismarck in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> he embarked on a program of militarisation and adventurism in foreign policy that eventually led Germany into the disaster of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The Prussian <i>junkers</i> and generals dominated the conduct of the war, so when it ended in defeat they had to accept responsibility. The Prussian monarchy was overthrown and Germany became a republic. The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> created a new Polish state and forced Germany to cede a large swathe of territory to it. <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a> found itself cut off from the rest of Germany by the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Corridor_837b.html" title="Polish Corridor">Polish Corridor</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> considered breaking Prussia up into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became the Prussian Free State (Freistadt Preussen), the largest state of the German Republic. Since it included the Ruhr and Berlin, it became a stronghold of the left, being governed by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany_0ed3.html" title="Social Democratic Party of Germany">Social Democrats</a> for most of the 1920s. Prussia's democratic constitution was suspended in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, marking the effective end of German democracy, and in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Goering_986d.html" title="Hermann Goering">Hermann Goering</a> became Minister-President of Prussia, a position he used to suppress all democratic opposition. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> regime abolished the autonomy of all the German states. Prussia continued to exist as a territorial unit until the end of the war.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> the armed forces of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> occupied all of eastern and central Germany.

The German population of the lost territories, up to 6 million people, was expelled. Prussia was formally abolished by a proclamation of the four occupying powers in Germany in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>.

<p>The idea of Prussia is not entirely dead in Germany. Since the <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reunification_of_Germany_107a.html" title="Reunification of Germany">reunification of Germany</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, there have been various proposals that two or more of the states of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecklenburg.html" title="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> should be amalgamated, and the new state be called Prussia. There does not seem to be much enthusiasm for this idea even among German conservatives, and the left-wing parties, who govern in these three states at present, (and until recently at the federal level) are firmly opposed to it.</p>

<p>As you see above, I have made various minor changes. Is there any way of moving this text to form the nucleus of a new article, with the text of the old one archived for merging? I suggest doing just that. --<a href="../../../t/w/e/User%7ETwenex_cdb9.html" title="User:Twenex">Twenex</a> 14:09, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
