<p>Joseph Smith, Jr., explicitly and openly taught a doctrine of Eloheim by at least the early 1840s which is the foundation upon which the Adam-God doctrine rests. This doctrine was that the Grand Council of the Gods was the meaning of the word Eloheim. Today, the Latter-day Saints teach 'Elohim is God the Father'. Which, while technically correct, is much less specific than Joseph Smith's more elaborate discourses on the subject. I have typed up exhaustive excerpts from Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith compiled by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Fielding_Smith_2ffa.html" title="Joseph Fielding Smith">Joseph Fielding Smith</a>, Church Historian and tenth President, on this subject in my user page: <a href="../../../j/i/z/User%7EJizzbug_Mormon_b66f.html" title="User:Jizzbug/Mormon">User:Jizzbug/Mormon</a>. Some of Joseph Smith's material on this matter should rightly be incorporated in this article somehow.</p>

<p>COGDEN - One issue I have with a recent edit is the statement below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 1877, while Brigham Young was, for the first time, recording and standardizing the Endowment ceremony for use in the Saint George temple, Young introduced the Adam-God theory to the temple as part of the Endowment's "Lecture at the Veil" (later removed)... (Journal of L. John Nuttall, personal secretary of Brigham Young, Feb. 7, 1877 in BYU Special Collections).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brigham Young approved (shortly before his death in 1877), and did not record nor write the Endowment ceremony down. Wilford Woodruff was given that task to write it down <i>while</i> president of the Saint George Temple, which was done <i>after</i> the dedication of the temple in April of 1877, a few months after the entry you referenced. The First Presidency felt it too sacred to write anywhere but in the "House of the Lord." Although I am unfamiliar with the journal entry, I'll take a look when I get a chance. Do you have a source where you've seen that? Please provide it in the talk page (or let me know it was your own research).</p>
<p>Also, please correct the statement about Young recording the ceremony and place it in its proper context - was he preparing some statements prior to the standardizations for Woodruff? The journal should shed light on this, because in the context you placed it it seems very odd, based on other comments made by Young about the recording of the Endowment. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 00:31, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, according to Nuttall, some portions of the ceremony were written down before BY's death, and transcribed by himself and J.D.T. McAllister. See the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In January 1877, shortly after the lower portion of the St. George Temple was dedicated, President Brigham Young, in following up in the Endowments written, became convinced that it was necessary to have the formula of the Endowments written, and he gave directions to have the same put in writing.</dd>
<dd>Shortly afterwards he explained what the Lecture at the Veil should portray, and for this purpose appointed a day when he would personally deliver the Lecture at the Veil. Elder J.D.T. McAllister and L. John Nuttall prepared writing material, and as the President spoke they took down his words. Elder Nuttall put the same into form and the writing was submitted to President Young on the same evening at his office in residence at St. George. He there made such changes as he deemed proper, and when he finally passed upon it said: This is the Lecture at the Veil to be observed in the Temple.</dd>
<dd>"A copy of the Lecture is kept at the St. George Temple, in which Presi-dent Young refers to Adam in his creation &amp;c.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I haven't personally seen Nuttall's journal, but these portions are cited in a few books and essays on the subject, so I assume the quotes are correct. The main non-online source everyone cites is <i>Unpublished Revelations of the Prophets and Presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>.

<p>So, is the account an 1892 account recreated as it was 1877, or an actual 1877 account? -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 21:02, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above statement looks like a re-creation of history (or a recollection) in 1892, from what I have been able to find, and therefore the accuracy is in question in light of other historical documents that Woodruff wrote the entire ceremony down. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:37, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just doubled the size of the article and then edited/re-organized. I also removed a sentence about Young stating that he had the doctrine revealed to him as I could not source it. Although I remember reading it, I must have missed the source. Also, he never presented it as official revelation, and he would have considered all of his beliefs as revealed truths, so that could get somewhat misleading and confusing to the reader. Let's figure out where it is appropriate to put back in. Anyway, am looking for some clean-up/help editing my work. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:37, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great work. I think it's turning into an excellent and fascinating article. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 23:50, Nov 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll have to find some of my sources (its all tucked in boxes somewhere) but I was quite fascinated by the statements by Brigham Young that led to this Adam-God Theory and also by the reactions that others have had to it. I'm impressed with the current content but I think there's some clarifying material that could be added. Let me present it superficially first and then I can find my sources. Note that this is my personal interpretation as understood from several sources and from my own personal discussions with (local) church leaders. It is important to remember that both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were adamant in their teachings with regard to the nature of God. One vitally important doctrine taught by both (I'll get sources) is that God the Father (<i>Elohim</i>) was once a mortal man. James E. Talmadge stressed this doctrine in Jesus the Christ as <i>the</i> reason for Christ's use of the epithet <i>Son of Man</i> to refer to himself. Also, there are old testament references to David being the father of the Messiah and new testament references to the <i>Son of David</i>, namely Jesus Christ. It seems to me, taking into account Young's myriad other speeches (it is quite ridiculous to view any one speech at one time as an autonomous object) that any direct or indirect reference to Adam as the father of Jesus Christ would be in a metaphorical form in the same way that David was also his father, using father as a loose term for ancestor. So now to break down the quote. <i>Celestial body</i> is an interesting term. I believe that Young meant celestial not Celestial but I have no proof. The bible states very clearly that Adam lived for several hundred years and it is definitely within Church doctrine that early prophets (and others) were explicitly instructed by God to have multiple wives. Adam's job in the baby making process is easy, Eve's is not (due precisely to the fall). It doesn't surprise me at all that Brigham would teach that Adam had multiple wives but I would say that these women became his wives <i>after</i> the Fall. Again, by the above analogy with David and the fact that Brigham says that Adam is <i>our father</i> I don't see how one can interpret <i>our father</i> as metaphorical and Jesus' father as literal in nearly the same breath. I'm not completely sure about the next phrase <i>the only God with whome we have to do</i>. However, there is one interpretation that is certainly consistent with Church doctrine. At the judgement day it is commonly said that man and woman will have to stand before God to be judged. Specific Church doctrine actually dictates that it will be more that just God, or possibly (I think I can find a reference for this) that it will be done by those Apostles who were alive while you were, or if there were none then ...? There is a definite reference in Doctrine &amp; Covenants that says that Adam presides over these and other Church meetings since he was the first prophet on the earth. So then in that sense, when it comes time to answer for your sins, it is to Adam (as a delegate for God) and to others as delegates for Adam that you will have to answer. The comment with regards to the comment about Mary and the Holy Ghost, I think there should be a note (I don't see one currently) that this was a direct statement against the teaching of that time (and the present) by many protestant sects that the Virgin Mary was impregnated by the Holy Ghost. The <i>very</i> offical Church doctrine is that Christ is the <i>literal</i> son of God, the Father, <i>Elohim</i> (not Adam). The 'first of the family' reference is probably a large source of the controversy but it seems to me that since Brigham was explicit as Joseph was about teaching that God <i>was</i> once a mortal man and <i>is</i> now an immortal man that he would most certainly qualify as the 'first of the human family'. Finally, the last sentence is definitely misunderstood. I think the best reference for this is the 14th installment of a series published (in the 70s I think) in the Ensign about Enoch called "A Strange Thing in the Land" by Hugh Nibley in which Nibley clearly references the teaching that Adam walked with God in the Garden of Eden and was taught explicitly by Him. So then both Adam and Elohim were in the Garden of Eden but only one was our <i>Father in Heaven</i> a term which I think makes more sense considering everything else that Brigham taught. Once I find my copy of Brigham's talk, I think it would be useful to incorporate a longer quote as well since I think some context provides a better understanding. I don't mean for any of this to be immediately included in the article but rather as fodder for discussion and revision and eventual inclusion. -<a href="../../../r/v/a/User%7ERvandam_0a2a.html" title="User:Rvandam">Robert Van Dam</a> 01:45, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look forward to your edits. I loosely believe (please call it a speculation) that Young was meaning something quite different than what he explained, just had a hard time explaining it. I think he meant that like us getting approval from JS (as head of our dispensation) we must get approval from Michael/Adam to go to heaven. In addition, Adam is a god on two accounts - first he is already exalted, like abraham; and second, he was the literal son of god (see luke and matthew's geneaology) but not the only begotton son <i>in the flesh</i> (meaning mortality). Adam was born to God in a celestial body and placed on the earth (hense God was in the garden) and had to choose to be mortal. A God fell (Michael) and a God overcame all (Christ). It took one god to get us into this mess of mortality and one God to get us back out. Both were sons of God (elohim). The Father could not be responsible for either decision, it had to be the sons' decisions. But I digress - I look forward to your edits... -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 16:35, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the section on "The distinction between Father Adam and Father Elohim" it is worth noting that that there is a different view - the word Eloheim was used by Brigham Young to denote a calling of 'head God', and when speaking of the Godhead before this world was formed Brigham seemed to indicate that the Eloheim at that time was Adam's grandfather God, whilst the Jehovah calling was fulfilled by Adam's heavenly Father. The idea of Jehovah being Jesus is a more modern idea, which James E. Talmage popularized - in the early Endowment Jesus had a small part seperate from Jehovah, and Jehovah spoke of Jesus as a seperate being. I'll go through my notes and get the references, before proposing any changes though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look forward to your notes/references. I'm personally unaware of such a change in the endowment - see <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/compare2.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lds-mormon.com/compare2.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/compare.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lds-mormon.com/compare.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (and even from my research into the Nauvoo/Endowment house version. I'm also unaware of any support for the idea that "Brigham seemed to indicate that the Eloheim at that time was Adam's grandfather God," although I'm familiar with where that idea is promulgated. I don't see any support for it historically. Would love to see your references, however, as this is a topic I've much-researched for many years. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 16:22, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Still trying to plow through my notes, but here is one of Brigham's quotes - "Elohim, Yahovah and Michael were father, son, and grandson. They made this earth and Michael became Adam." (Joseph F. Smith journal, 17 June 1871) Thus infering that Michael is the son of the Jehovah involved in the earth's creation (who of course could not be Jesus if this were true). I think I have a quote somewhere from Lorenzo Snow saying the same thing, I'll keep checking.</p>
<p>This idea was picked up by Bishop Heber Bennion in 1920 (Supplement to Gospel Problems, p. 8-9): "Elohim may signify the Father or Grandfather, or Great Grandfather - God or the Council of Gods, and Jehovah may be applied to any of them in the capacity or relationship of a son ..."</p>

<p>Also the line "Most scholars believe that the few statements about the theory are inadequate to properly understand what was meant by the teachings." needs to be qualified. The only serious scholars (non apologists) who seem to have treated the subject are Buerger and Turner, both of whom concluded that Brigham's teachings unambiguously equated Adam with the Father of our Spirits etc. Even some LDS apologists says that is what Brigham taught, but that it was just an opnion on his part (as pointed out earlier in the article).</p>

<p>Also, there needs to be a section on the quotes attributed to Joseph Smith on this doctrine, and showing Eliza R. Snow's belief in it. I'll work on it.</p>
<p>An example of a few -</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was Joseph's doctrine that Adam was God ... God comes to earth and partakes of the fruit. Joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him. (Brigham Young Papers, Meeting of Quorum of Twelve, 4 April 1860.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>President Young said Adam was Michael the Archangel and he was the Father of Jesus Christ and is our God and that Joseph taught this principle. (16 December 1876, Meeting of School of Prophets, Wilford Woodruff Journal.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Joseph said that Adam was our Father and God. (Brigham Young Papers, 14 May 1876.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I heard Joseph say...”Adam is the Father of our bodies. Who is to say He is not the Father of our spirits.” (John Taylor, 13 January 1880, L. John Nuttall Papers.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now regarding Adam: He came here from another planet - an immortalized being and brought his wife Eve with him - and by eating of the fruit of the earth, became subject to death and decay - was made mortal and subject to death. (Joseph Smith to Anson Call, John M. Whitaker Papers.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He taught us that God was the great head of human procreation - was truly the Father of both our spirits and our bodies. (Benjamin F. Johnson, October 1903, Letter to G.S. Gibbs, UR 61:18)</dd>

<dd>"According to one researcher on the subject, “those familiar with LDS history and practice are well aware that official doctrine must meet certain requirements which were not met by the Adam-God theory.

<p>It's very important to know who wrote this, because if it's just some Joe Schmoe on the internet, I'm not sure it's a valuable addition to the article, especially since it's a conclusory statement without an explanation as to <i>why</i> the researcher arrived at this conclusion. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 18:58, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Incidentally, I do disagree with some of <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobeyjaggle_1cf3.html" title="User:Tobeyjaggle">User:Tobeyjaggle</a>'s conclusions above, and I'll show why later. But for now, I'm going back to look at the journal entires and papers mentioned above by Tobeyjaggle. I will need time to get the primary documents in front of me, unless you have photocopies of them handy Tobeyjaggle? Or are you getting them from another source? Also, you may want to read another viewpoint that does not relate to either of the major camps at <a href="http://www.helpingmormons.org/Adam_God2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helpingmormons.org/Adam_God2.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also Tobeyjaggle, can you provide publications for the papers listed int eh reference set? If not, let's remove, as they will not seem like additional "resources" from scholarly sets/publications, but seem to be promulgated internet references (I know they are not, but you can't just have a date and an author - need where the work was accepted or published as well. ISBN numbers work good, or issue and date of specific publications. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 20:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps we could section it into scholarly, apologetic LDS, apologetic Fundamentalist, Protestant Christian etc.? I've added a few ISBN's, but some of the books don't have them, but are important references because they typify different approaches to the subject. For example - to not include Briney's book would be a tragedy - it is 658 page hardback tome by an LDS Church member containing virtually all the source material on the subject.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whenever I've seen a Wikipedia article get sectioned by POV, there has always been a problem. I think it's much better to organize the material either by date or by topic, and first set forth the primary sources, and then include the naturalistic, apologetic, fundamentalist, etc., interpretations. The advantage of doing this is that nobody can dispute the primary source material (such as, what is published in the <i>J.D.</i> or the Deseret News or somebody's journal)--it's the way it is, and nobody can change it. But at the same time, there is room for various people to reinterpret the primary source material to fit their viewpoints. But such reinterpretation does not disrupt the structure of the article. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 22:39, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree. and lets at least include a publisher for source material. Just a name and date is not adequate. I am flatly against dividing up the article into "differing" points of view - ie scholarly, aplogetic, critic, anti, etc. If we do, we'll open the door to Wikipedia becoming a proselytizing forum, or a pro/con forum on such topics. Wikipedia is not a message board. I am for providing as much direct quotes and <b>primary</b> document research as possible, along with the popular thoughts about it (both pro, con, and other) but then letting the reader decide. Once we try to interpret things that no two scholars agree on and place them as absoutes, we more out of the realm of being an encyclopedia into evangelizing our points of view. Wikipedia is not a place for primary research or a place for pushing ones point of view. That is why the article is as bland and neutral as it is currently. Let's put what we know, what we don't know, and why we know/don't know, and leave out the speculation. Let the reader decide. Sorry to be hard line on this, but I don't want the article turning into another <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon_51f1.html" title="Archaeology and the Book of Mormon">Archaeology and the Book of Mormon</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism_and_Christianity_2fc2.html" title="Mormonism and Christianity">Mormonism and Christianity</a> or (heaven forbid) <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Mormonism_ccb0.html" title="Opposition to Mormonism">Opposition to Mormonism</a> type debate and forum (you can read those page histories to understand what I mean).

<p>I have added some publishers to the list of references, and will try to get the full reference for every publication listed. I agree with the need for the article to be unbiased. Although it is better than most treatments, it still seems a little too weighted towards the 'official LDS Church position' if there is such a thing, and I worry that at the moment it doesn't full represent the views of those serious scholars who have weighed in on this subject, or of those who have alternative views. Some of the presumptions are disputable, whether we personally agree with them or not. I will help where I can though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Glad to have you on board. You can sign your posts with a date stamp by typing four tildes ~~~~. Although my personal view is only somewhat partially represented (as are most), I think the article does not give the LDS position, except where it is stated that the view of the church is that it is false doctrine. On the contrary, the article points out what is not known, and why theories on what was meant are a dime a dozen and there is too much that is unknown. But, we look forward to your help in improving the article. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:30, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am only just finding the time to catch up on this. I will jot a few notes below on some general criticisms I have about biases shown in the current article -</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"the doctrine was unpopular and confusing even among some contemporary Latter-day Saint leaders such as Orson Pratt and Amasa M. Lyman"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from Amasa Lyman criticizing the excommunication of someone because they didn't believe in the doctrine - which may just have indicated a disagreement with cutting soemone off solely for their beliefs - what evidence is there that he disagreed with the doctrine?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I probably knew this at some point, but I forgot. If you have good citations about what Lyman though, we should put them in, or discuss them here. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 22:06, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>"However, the Adam-God theory has been rejected as false doctrine by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to state when and by whom! Spencer W. Kimball in 1976? If so - that was over 100 years after Brigham first taught it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right. By S.W. Kimball in 1976. I don't see how the 100+ year gap is relevant, though. Kimball's denunciation of the doctrine in general conference is just as official (if not more so) as Young's preaching of the doctrine at general conference over a decade earlier. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 22:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The 100 year gap seems very relevant information to me - the reader is likely to ask "at what point was this condemned publically as a false doctrine?" I cannot see how a condemnation of a doctrine in 1976 can be more official than an approval of one in 1852 or 54. Some may indeed argue that neither is official because they weren't given in official First Presidency statements. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobeyjaggle_1cf3.html" title="User:Tobeyjaggle">Tobey</a> 16:28, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is subjective - Some early (1852-90) Mormons, Fundamentalists, and anti-Mormons would dispute this!</p>

<dd>I disagree. Young said that he would not expound anymore on the doctrine as it would be a stumbling stone to the Elders of Israel. This implies that not all of the information Young knew about it was taught. If it was "fully" taught then why were additional revelations on the doctrine given in at least two other fundamentalist sects (one at least is referenced in the article)? Wording can be improved, but it is important to note that Young admitted to sharing only a portion of the doctrine, but the doctrine in its fullest. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 00:03, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because he said that he wouldn't speak anymore on the subject does not necessarily mean that he felt he did not explain himself sufficiently in the past (or only taught an insufficient portion of the doctrine for us to understand what he taught properly), but could just as well mean that because he felt that so many didn't accept his teachings that he did not feel inclined to continue to teach them. Whether the two small Fundamentalist sects claim to have received additional revelations on this subjects seems irrelevant to me, it only indicates their view. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobeyjaggle_1cf3.html" title="User:Tobeyjaggle">Tobey</a> 16:28, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree. However, Church doctrine and gospel doctrine are different in nearly all Latter Day Saint sects. This is difficult to explain. He may have said that something is "good doctrine" but that does not mean it is Church doctrine. There is controversy about whether or not Young considered it church doctrine or a truth. He didn't clarify it as church doctrine in the Pratt/Young doctrinal clarifications in the Des News, and left it alone. Everything else was considered a final doctrinal pronouncement. This he did not. It is suspect because of these events and ideas. I'm not an apologist, but this is where the controversy comes into play, and readers should understand. Let's let the quotes exist for themselves. Please add in any you have. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 00:03, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This again is probably an incorrect date, based on his last major discourse on the subject. However, IMHO it should be modified to the date of the Orson Pratt/Brigham Young dispute.

<li><i>"Regardless of interpretation, the mystery of Young's teachings in regard to exactly what he meant in the few statements he made on the subject apparently died with him and his close associates.

</ul>
<p>Need to qualify this - most modern LDS Church members may believe the first sentence, but if we include scholars from other 'Mormon' groups as well as those outside Mormonism then the majority of scholarly treatments on this subject (including some from LDS Church members) conclude that he did teach that Adam was the Father of our spirits, and the father of Jesus Christ. So the above conclusion is untenable.</p>

<dd>I'm torn on this. I'm unaware of many "scholars" from "those outside Mormonism." Who outside of the Mormonism camp has written about this topic in an academic setting?

John Farkas might be considered a scholar in evangelical Christian circles too. Who else would qualify? Maybe Briney work - I'll have to look at it more closely. Interestingly all of these men conclude that Brigham's teachings were unambiguous and clear, that he did indeed teach that Adam was the Father of men's spirits etc. - even Turner who is a very orthodox Mormon and loyal LDS Church member. --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobeyjaggle_1cf3.html" title="User:Tobeyjaggle">Tobey</a> 16:28, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
