<p>Adam Faulkner was a headstrong and angry young man working as a freelance photographer. He was hired by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Detective_David_Tapp" title="List of Saw characters">David Tapp</a>, a discharged detective, to follow and photograph <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Gordon_%28Saw%29_686d.html" title="Lawrence Gordon (Saw)">Lawrence Gordon</a>, a doctor suspected by Tapp of being the <a href="../../../j/i/g/Jigsaw_Killer_78b5.html" title="Jigsaw Killer">Jigsaw Killer</a>. He was paid $200 a night. Adam managed to follow Lawrence, and took numerous photos, many showing him leaving motels where he had slept with his mistress, a student of his named Carla. Adam's occupation ended up getting him targeted by John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer.</p>
<p><a name="Adam.27s_test" id="Adam.27s_test"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Faulkner_1972.html" title="Edit section: Adam's test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adam's test</span></h3>
<p>After coming home and developing his photos of Lawrence, Adam fell asleep in his darkroom. He later awoke to find his entire apartment without light. He realized someone else was in his apartment, and used his camera flash to locate them. After letting it off, he was attacked and rendered unconscious by <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Young_6cb9.html" title="Amanda Young">Amanda Young</a>, the apprentice of Jigsaw, whom Adam had met previously in the lobby of his apartment.</p>
<p>Amanda brought Adam to a grimy industrial bathroom, where everything else had been prepared by Jigsaw for a complicated test. Chaining him at the ankle to a pipe, Amanda placed Adam on his back in a bathtub filled with water, and was told by Jigsaw to tie the key, made to unlock his shackle, to his ankle. However, she instead carelessly tossed it on his chest, and left the room after turning the light out.</p>
<p>After waking up in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traps_in_the_Saw_film_series_1788.html#Bathroom_trap" title="List of traps in the Saw film series">bathroom</a>, Adam discovered that he and his cellmate, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Lawrence_Gordon" title="List of Saw characters">Dr. Lawrence Gordon</a>, were the latest victims in a game created by Jigsaw.</p>
<p>Adam and Lawrence, chained to pipes on opposite sides of the bathroom, attempted to find a way out. Between the two of them sat what appears to be a dead man, face down in a pool of blood, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. After successfully obtaining the tape recorder from his hand, Adam and Lawrence soon learned what they need to do: Lawrence had to kill Adam by 6:00am if he wanted to save his family, and Adam had to do something about it. It was also revealed that the man in the middle shot himself after learning he had poison in his blood. Using clues from the tapes, they each found their share of items: Adam found a bag of photos and two rusted hacksaws, while Lawrence found some cigarettes and a one-way cell phone. The saws, as the two of them figured out, were not strong enough to cut through the chains; they were meant to cut through their feet.</p>
<p>Lawrence tried to figure out another way out without killing Adam, such as pretending to kill him by staging a fake death with a "poisoned" cigarette (poisoned by the blood of the dead man in the middle). However, Adam was electrocuted through his chain, proving the death to be false. Later, Gordon discovered Adam was hired to take pictures of him for Detective Tapp. Adam also showed him a picture of Zep looking out the window of Lawrence's house.</p>
<p>Soon enough, 6:00 rolled around, and Lawrence, desperate to escape and save his family, began sawing his own foot off before shooting Adam in an attempt to kill him.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Zep entered the bathroom and was about to shoot Lawrence. However, Adam, supposedly dead, knocked him over and both began to wrestle for the gun. Adam managed to get it out of Zep's hands. Then, Adam took the toilet lid and beat Zep to death with it. It was revealed Adam was only shot in the shoulder, only a wound rather than a fatal shot. Lawrence then told Adam that he had to go get help in order to avoid bleeding to death. Adam begged him not to go and leave him behind, but Lawrence left after telling Adam that he would come back for him. Once Lawrence crawled out of the bathroom, Adam attempted to find a key to his chain on Zep's person. However, all he found was a tape player that revealed Zep too was playing one of Jigsaw's games. Realizing that Zep wasn't Jigsaw at all, the man he thought was dead in the middle of the room stood up, peeled away part of a mask, and revealed himself to be the real Jigsaw, the one who placed them in the trap. He told Adam that the key to his chain was in the bathtub that he had awoken in. The key, however, went down the drain. Jigsaw said, 'Game over,' as he turned the light off and slammed the door shut, leaving Adam screaming, and soon to rot in the bathroom.</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_II_21f7.html" title="Saw II">Saw II</a></i>, it was revealed that Adam did in fact die, after Daniel and Amanda found his rotting corpse. This raised speculation that Lawrence didn't survive either, due to the fact he said he would get help but never did, seeing as Adam was now dead. Viewers concluded Adam had died of starvation, dehydration or the massive blood loss from his wounded shoulder.</p>
<p>It is gradually revealed throughout the movie series that <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Young_6cb9.html" title="Amanda Young">Amanda</a>, Jigsaw's apprentice, was the one who kidnapped Adam and placed him in the bathtub for Jigsaw as her first task. In a deleted scene, Adam was handing out flyers in the lobby of his apartment building when he met Amanda. He complimented her "rock star" hair and invited her to go to his buddy's band's show later that night, which she declined. Amanda later sneaked into his apartment in Jigsaw's pig outfit, ambushed Adam, and brought him to the infamous bathroom. Later, Amanda, shaken with guilt, returned to the bathroom. She assured Adam she was going to rescue him, but instead, suffocated him with a plastic sheet as way of mercy-killing.</p>
