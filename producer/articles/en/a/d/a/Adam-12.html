<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-12.html" title="Edit section: Story settings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Story settings</span></h2>
<p>The officers worked out of the Central Division of the LAPD, but the show used situations from real LAPD case files and thus was not set in any one area of the city. The title of the show is derived from the radio car unit number of the duo, 1 (for Central Division, though Rampart Division was actually used as the location), A(dam) to designate it as a two man patrol, and 12 to designate their patrol area. However, the moniker was generally thought to refer to the number of their "black and white" patrol car, and in recognition of this, beginning in 1971 the vehicles used were marked with the number 012. In reality, the LAPD patrol cars are marked with a unique five-digit shop number, with the last three on the top of each car (for rapid identification by police helicopters), and a two-digit number on the trunk representing the originating division.</p>
<p>The outdoor filming was done primarily in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Hollywood_43f5.html" title="North Hollywood">North Hollywood</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toluca_Lake_81f0.html" title="Toluca Lake">Toluca Lake</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_City_68e9.html" title="Studio City">Studio City</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Hills_6b23.html" title="Hollywood Hills">Hollywood Hills</a> sections of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> (and close to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Studios_23de.html" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> and the infamous studio backlot itself, which was heavily used during the first two seasons), although the exteriors of the station house were actually of the newly completed <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rampart_Division_6e9d.html" title="Rampart Division">Rampart Division</a> station of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Police_Department_cbf3.html" title="Los Angeles Police Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a>. However, in the pilot episode, shot in late 1967, the station shown is North Hollywood Division.</p>
<p>Like <i>Dragnet</i>, <strong class="selflink">Adam-12</strong> episodes were based on incidents in the actual case files from the LAPD. At the end of each episode the "names have been changed..." statement was shown (but not narrated) at the start of the credits.</p>
<p>Episodes from <i>Adam-12</i> and <i>Dragnet</i> have been used for training purposes by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_academy.html" title="Police academy">police academies</a> in the United States, especially when teaching recruits correct <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handcuffs.html" title="Handcuffs">handcuffing</a> procedures, as the camera often zoomed in closely when the officers were in the act of handcuffing suspects. As was <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Webb_05a7.html" title="Jack Webb">Jack Webb</a>'s practice, other minor facets of day-to-day police practices were also accurately portrayed, from hand signals used by officers to the methods used in field interviews, and even such minor details as routinely locking the doors of the patrol car before leaving it unattended to interview victims or witnesses.</p>
<p>A 1976 doctoral study by Joseph S. Coppolino at New York University concluded that police officers, peace officers and civilians all perceived the portrayals on <i>Adam-12</i> as realistically reflecting police work. However, the trend between TV and reality sometimes went in reverse. For example, Coppolino noted in his thesis that while it was not customary for police officers to remove their hats while in the patrol car at the time the series began, after <i>Adam-12</i> aired for a while, this became the habit of most officers. This could be seen as evidence of Marshall McLuhan's media theory that "we create it, then it creates us."</p>
<p>The police radio used on this series is an actual radio used by the LAPD in the 1960s and 1970s, with the call sign KMA-367. The dispatcher was also a real-life LAPD dispatcher, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaaron_Claridge_733e.html" title="Shaaron Claridge">Shaaron Claridge</a>. Claridge's typical page to Reed and Malloy of <i>"One-Adam-12, One-Adam-12, see the [man/lady/victim] at [address] about a [crime/incident],"</i> along with the response of <i>"One-Adam-12, roger,"</i> became a catchphrase ingrained in the American culture, and these same radio procedures are still in use at the LAPD today. Badges used on the show were actual LAPD shields -- numbers 744 for Malloy and 2430 for Reed -- which were lent by the Office of the Chief of Police, a practice that began when <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragnet.html" title="Dragnet">Dragnet</a> was on television in the '50s and '60s.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>In the pilot episode, seven-year veteran Malloy is planning to resign from the police department following the death of his partner, who was killed in the line of duty while trying to foil an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_robbery.html" title="Armed robbery">armed robbery</a>. Malloy is persuaded to stay on and train a new partner: rookie officer Jim Reed, fresh out of the police academy and a two-year stint in the army. Reed has a lot of potential but is green and overeager. At the end of the episode, Reed disobeys Malloy's direct orders but succeeds in arresting several armed persons. Malloy yells at him; however, the division's watch commander, Malloy's one-time training officer, reminds him he was once an eager young rookie much like Reed. Malloy takes it on himself to mold Reed into one of Los Angeles's finest, which, as evidenced by later episodes, he does.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">1971 Satellite</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A memorable <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> episode, "Elegy for a Pig," detailed Malloy's earlier relationship with his best friend from the police academy (Officer Tom Porter, played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Goddard_b767.html" title="Mark Goddard">Mark Goddard</a>), starting from the night he was killed and going back to their shared experiences before ending with his funeral. Among some of the novel features of the episode was that it had no music over the opening and end credits, and there was also no dialogue except for Malloy's narration.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the seventh and final season, plus the two-part series finale, it is strongly implied that Malloy will become the division's new patrol sergeant / watch commander and Reed will attain detective status after a successful plainclothes stint in narcotics.</p>
<p>A typical episode involved Reed and Malloy encountering people and places on their daily beat, with incidents ranging from humorous to deadly serious. Sometimes a common incident or theme is explored throughout the episode or incidents therein. Other episodes focused on mistakes of rookie, and sometimes more experienced, officers.</p>
<p>In later years, Reed completed his probationary period and was granted regular officer status, and Malloy was promoted to "Officer-3" ranking (one step below sergeant, hence the two chevrons and star patches on his shirtsleeves). Episodes centered on their maturing skills/relationship and their shared experiences. Both would be wounded in the line of duty, kidnapped, and held hostage (separately and together) and face disciplinary measures for mistakes. Car chases and shoot-outs occurred but with less frequency than in other TV series.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighter.html" title="Firefighter">firefighter</a>/<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramedic.html" title="Paramedic">paramedics</a> Gage and Desoto, Dr. Brackett, Dr. Early, and Nurse McCall from <i><a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency%21.html" title="Emergency!">Emergency!</a>,</i> another Webb creation, crossed over onto the show in a 1972 episode, "Lost And Found," in which Malloy and Reed assist on a hospital's telephone hotline (they try to locate and stop a distressed caller from committing suicide). This <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_crossover.html#Spin-offs" title="Fictional crossover">crossover</a> conflicts with an episode of <i>Emergency!</i> in which the paramedics and firefighters watch an <i>Adam-12</i> episode on TV. Confusingly, Reed and Malloy also appear in two scenes at the ER on the pilot TV-movie of <i>Emergency!.</i></p>
<p>After a long syndication run, the show found a new audience in the 1980s and 1990s on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_at_Nite_831d.html" title="Nick at Nite">Nick at Nite</a> and later <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Land_3c48.html" title="TV Land">TV Land</a>; however, the show has since been pulled from wide television distribution because Jack Webb's estate owns the rights to this series. It did air in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/j/DejaView_2701.html" title="DejaView">DejaView</a> in 2005-2006. The original series distributor <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Pictures_4290.html" title="Universal Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>, under license from the Webb estate, has released the first season of <i>Adam-12</i> on DVD and <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>A remake/update was attempted in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, starring <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Wayne_8d5f.html" title="Ethan Wayne">Ethan Wayne</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Parros_70f9.html" title="Peter Parros">Peter Parros</a>, and Miguel Fernandes, but this version entitled <i>The New Adam-12</i> ran for only one season in first-run syndication.

<p>Aside from appearing on other Jack Webb-produced shows, Martin Milner and Kent McCord have portrayed police officers on several other programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kent McCord made a cameo appearance on <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28TV_series%29_0877.html" title="Batman (TV series)">Batman</a></i> as a rookie policeman who wanted to give the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> a ticket for illegal parking.</li>
<li>Kent McCord made several appearances on <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragnet_%28series%29.html" title="Dragnet (series)">Dragnet</a></i> as various Los Angeles police officers; in one appearance his character was named Reed, but it's not certain whether it was the same Reed as the Adam-12 character.</li>
<li>In 1990, Martin Milner and Kent McCord were reunited in a show called <i>Nashville Beat</i>. Although their characters were not Malloy and Reed, they were police-partners who had been formerly based in Los Angeles.</li>
<li>In 1997 Milner and McCord also appeared as police detectives in an episode of <i><a href="../../../m/u/r/Diagnosis%7E_Murder_9055.html" title="Diagnosis: Murder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></i> entitled "Murder Blues".</li>
