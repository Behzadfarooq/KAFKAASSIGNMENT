	    <p>Hello and welcome! I noticed your work on moving "Baha'i Faith" to "Baha'i faith". As I understand it, "faith" is part of the name of the religion in this case, and so should be capitalised. I've checked a couple of reference books, and the <a href="http://www.bahai.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.org/" rel="nofollow">Baha'i web site</a> and they use this format. Would you object to me changing it back again? Regards -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> 09:23 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Ironically, you display the same kind of parochial fanaticalness as your Islamofascist opponents. Why don't you grow up and help us write a high-quality encyclopedia, instead of a propaganda piece. No matter how worthy your views are, this isn't the place for them. -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 11:44, 2003 Aug 10 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excuse me? Are you saying that there is a moral equivalency between Americans, like our troops in Iraq and the firefighters who died on 9/11, and the Islamofascists who dug all those mass graves in Iraq and flew those planes into the twin towers? That is a very twisted POV. It does not belong in encyclopedia articles. Facts, like the ones presented in my article, do. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeM_9a56.html" title="User:JoeM">JoeM</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Many people consider Americans to be authoring their own destruction, including the poverty-making debt traders in the towers on 9/11. You may not like that view, but it's out there, and it belongs slightly more than your advocacy of invading every country where anyone who dislikes the USA lives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Adam, given your conversation with <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeM_9a56.html" title="User:JoeM">User:JoeM</a> here you may be interested in helping improve <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense_conservative.html" title="Common sense conservative">common sense conservative</a>. While it is unlikely to act as a true troll bridge, it might at least exploit the wealth of references and discussions we've had with him. Might as well get something out of it.</dd>

<p>I do not think that we should liberate China through an invasion this minute (only because the Communist butchers in Beijing have nukes), but we should pursue regime change. We can do that by cutting diplomatic relations, vacating our embassy there, isolating them politically, cutting trade ties, and destabilizing the country by overtly offering moral support to, and covertly offering financial and logistical support to, forces operating in Red China determined to bring down the Communists and fight for freedom, liberal democracy, American values, and capitalism. We would also need to wage an all out economic war with Red China so that their economy would collapse. It would be easy for us to destabilize the country politically under those circumstances. China then could go through a transition like the Soviet Union when it broke up. Or there could be an internal revolution like the one that brought down the Ceausescu tyranny in Romania. One thing is clear though. We must break trade relations and quit the policies of "constructive engagement" with a Communist state of terror that violates inalienable human rights and builds up a bloated defense sector aimed at one day confronting the free world. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeM_9a56.html" title="User:JoeM">JoeM</a></p>
<p>It's all quite OK, but just one thing: <i>American values</i>? In China? Couldn't you please be more polite and call for democratic values (I guess those are the American values you are talking about)? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarco_Neves_4f1c.html" title="User:Marco Neves">Marco Neves</a>Marco Neves</p>

<p>If you're going to be doing a lot of <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_Ramla_8020.html" title="User:AdamRaizen/Ramla">these</a> with your bot, please could you use "per cent" instead of "%".

<dd>You can try to convince me or present me with an overwhelming consensus, but writing out the word "percent" seems strange to me. Notice that <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a>'s articles (see for example <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeley%2C_Colorado_6e93.html" title="Greeley, Colorado">Greeley, Colorado</a>) use grapes.

<dd>The consensus is to use 'per cent' or 'percent' and it has now been added to the manual of style.

Also note that the "when all else fails" part of the Manual of Style suggests copying the style of an existing article.

<p>Hi, Adam -- I just noticed that the Hebrew characters are backwards (that is, L to R instead of right to left). Can you get the bot to either reverse them or style them to read right to left (if that's even possible in WikiP.) I'm using Opera 7.11 on Windows 98, if that makes a difference. -- thanks! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarj_Tiefert_437d.html" title="User:Marj Tiefert">Marj</a> 04:33, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC) (Later: I checked HaAretz, and its Hebrew flows in the correct direction.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Hebrew characters are in logical, not visual order, so a unicode compliant program should recognize them as Hebrew and display them right to left. I'm using Mozilla 1.0 on Hebrew-enabled win98 and the names display correctly. Haaretz is in visual order. (It's also in iso-8859-8, not unicode.) -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a></dd>

<p>Another question - There's another page, Beersheba, in addition to the Beer_Sheva page created by the bot - can the content of other pages like this be incorporated into the page made by the bot, and not get over-written the next time the bot runs? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarj_Tiefert_437d.html" title="User:Marj Tiefert">Marj</a> 04:52, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I noticed that. I'm going to merge the bot's articles in with already existing articles manually, and Beersheba will get taken care of along with those. -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 05:53, 2003 Sep 21 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Adam, How do you make WikiPedia bots, exactly? I'm toying with the idea of massaging the INSEE &amp; IGN databases to stubify most communes in France (though I think I'd have to threshold them a bit, most of the 36000 are unimportant little villages). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 13:00, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My bot is written in <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_programming_language.html" title="Python programming language">Python</a> using ClientCookie. If you get your articles approved, I can give you the source, or help you out in other ways.</dd>

<dd>Interesting about 36000 "unimportant little villages", rambot added ~30000 articles, most of which are unimportant little towns, but maybe we want to be more conservative with regard to French villages on the English wikipedia. And I suppose that 36000 articles on fr.wikipedia would completely overwhelm it. -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 15:55, 2003 Sep 21 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any automatic improvements you can make into your articles are, well, improvements. The reason I made the changes, was that I had made a promise to myself to do a long bout of "weeding" new articles, since I felt I had been remiss in that area recently. I did extend the bout longer than I had originally intended, since I seemed to get into a definite flow, and thought of ever more things I could tweak in the israbot articles... I cannot say that I have edited more rambot articles than israbot ones, but the standards I have applied have been the same for both. To make the text more friendly to <b>human</b> readers. And that I will continue to do, when in my quirky pattern of editing things, I come accross them. As a matter of fact, I will probably do a bout of random page edits right now. Shalom and Salaam Aleikum!

<p>I think some consideration of significant figures and error bars might be useful in your Israbot articles. I faffed around with <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramla.html" title="Ramla">Ramla</a> as an example/proposal. The same also applies to Rambot, of course (possibly more so). I think two significant figures is probably best for readability. Wondered what your thoughts were. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<p>Also, is the raw data on Wikipedia somewhere? That'd save time if anyone wanted to convert Israbot stubs to use graphs, for example. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 10:01, 24 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was somewhat confused by your article on X-bar theory, as I've stated on the <a href="../../../x/-/b/Talk%7EX-bar_theory_3edc.html" title="Talk:X-bar theory">talk page</a>. I notice you said when you first wrote the article that it was <i>(a start, probably badly organized and slightly inaccurate.)</i> Would you object to my changing your analysis of the sentence "He studies linguistics at the university"? If so, I would very much like to hear your arguments. (I'm not denying the possibility that such arguments may exist; my own experiences have shown me that there's a lot of variation in how X-bar theory is taught even within the same linguistics department.) <a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.2.211.72.html" title="User:129.2.211.72">129.2.211.72</a> 05:04, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
