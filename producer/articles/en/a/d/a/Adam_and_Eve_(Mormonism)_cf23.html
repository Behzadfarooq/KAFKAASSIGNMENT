	    <p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, the Biblical account of Adam and Eve is believed to be partly literal and partly symbolic, with much meaning and clarification added in the Book of Moses (<a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_of_Great_Price_6f45.html" title="Pearl of Great Price">Pearl of Great Price</a>, Moses 3-5) and in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> (2 Nephi 2). Adam and Eve are believed to have been placed on earth from another sphere, according to Brigham Young.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The expression that Eve was formed from Adam's rib is symbolic: Adam's statement that she is "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh," acknowledges her as both a blessing for Adam and an equal partner, with neither fully complete without the other. (See 1 Corinthians 11:11)</p>
<p>When Adam partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil after Eve had partaken of it, he made a deliberate choice, knowing that this would eventuate their death but also knowing that they had been commanded to stay together and have posterity on the earth. Eve partook of this fruit through a deception by Satan, but she is viewed by Mormonism as having done a courageous thing by partaking of the fruit. She knew it would lead to their death but she also believed (rightly so) that there must be more to life than remaining in innocence in an Edenic garden. Both of them later rejoiced in the choice they had made to bring about the Fall as they were taught the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_of_salvation.html" title="Plan of salvation">plan of salvation</a>, including the plan for their redemption and the redemption of their posterity through the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">atonement</a> of Jesus Christ. (Moses 5:10-12)</p>
<p>Adam treated Eve as an equal partner in every respect, and relied on her advice. The intent of the statement that "he shall rule over thee" (Genesis 3:16) is rendered more clear in the context of how Adam treated Eve, and in the following statement written by Joseph Smith about the righteous use of power: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--." (Doctrine and Covenants 121:41,42)</p>

<p>Latter-Day Saints believe that the commandment Adam received, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19), and the seeming irony, "cursed is the ground for thy sake" (Genesis 3:17), are compatible and necessary blessings included in the plan of salvation for mankind. They are part of a needful "opposition in all things," (2 Nephi 2:11) in that they lead to both personal growth and fulfillment and a testing process for mankind's patience, endurance and faith. Faithful Mormons do not lament the need to work. Brigham Young taught "that it is never any benefit to give, out and out, to man or woman, money, food, clothing, or anything else, if they are able-bodied, and can work and earn what they need, when there is anything on the earth for them to do."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Speaking of the Church Welfare program designed to administer to the needs of the poor among them, the LDS Church presidency taught in 1936:</p>
<p>"Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self respect be once more established amongst our people. . . . Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership." (Conference Report, October 1936, Statement of the First Presidency, p. 3.)</p>

<p>Thus, the compounded sins of Cain included not only the murder of Abel after conspiring and following the advice of Satan, but also thinking that he could get gain and become "free" (from having to work) by taking over the flocks of his brother. (Moses 5:16-33) According to the Book of Moses, others of Adam and Eve's children as well as Cain "loved Satan more than God," and believed not the gospel but "began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish." (Moses 5:13) This carnality was taught them through the influence of Satan, who seeks to lead men and women "captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my (God's) voice." (Moses 4:4) Carnality was not an inherent trait of their physical body. The account of Cain shows how conditions of apostasy, carnality, and seeking gain through dishonest means for the purpose of idleness began on the earth through the pervasive influence of Satan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a righteous branch of mankind embraced the gospel taught them by Adam and Eve through their son Seth and particularly through a later descendant, Enoch. Through the teaching, faith and works of Enoch and his followers, "in process of time" the city of Enoch was established as a refuge from the wicked. This city became so fully compliant with gospel laws and brotherly love that "the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them." (Moses 7:18)</p>

<p>According to Latter-day Saint teachings, the examples of Cain and Enoch (and their wives) show examples of the fruits of good choices or the fruits of bad choices. Cain acted in self-indulgence, self-gratification, and conspiring to destroy the agency of others through deception and, ultimately, murder. Enoch acted in selfless followership of Jesus Christ. He used his agency to teach others in love, so that they would use their own agency wisely. Together, they worked to build up a Zion that was of "one heart and one mind," where the entire city "dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them." They benefitted from the righteous <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_priesthood.html" title="Melchizedek priesthood">priesthood</a> authority of Enoch and others. (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 5 &amp; 7)</p>
