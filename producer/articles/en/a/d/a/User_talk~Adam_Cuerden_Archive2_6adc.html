I said relatively ueless: There's a full spectrum between them, so they're only really useful at early teaching stages. It's the equivilent of looking at assembler computer code and an Operating system: You could look at both, but there's a full spectrum between them, and the operating system is, in the end, just a complicated final product of all the code. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 23:20, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would you rather use the terms "Special Theory" and "General Theory" as referenced in <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/creation_matters/pdf/2001/cm0605.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.creationresearch.org/creation_matters/pdf/2001/cm0605.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.creationresearch.org/creation_matters/pdf/2001/cm0605.pdf</a>? It is stated that almost all discussion of evolution is usually concerning the "General Theory" but when referencing <b>overwhelming evidence</b> it is almost entirely evidence supporting the "Special Theory." The kicker is: the inference that must be made is that the observed speciation (through information loss) is enough to generate genera, families, and phyla. Quite a leap of faith. <a href="../../../w/d/a/User%7EWdanwatts_84e2.html" title="User:Wdanwatts">Dan Watts</a> 01:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the examples in <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mendel.html" title="Mendel">Mendel</a>'s theory. Almost all of the observed cases of speciation, the <b>overwhelming evidence</b> (with the exception of plants which apparently, perhaps amazingly, tolerate polyploidy) still seem to fit squarely within the information loss mechanism. -- True, there are <b>hypothesized</b> polyploid speciation of insects, but evidence, <i>observed evidence</i>, is not so distributed. As you mentioned, an animal which got a polyploid genetic setup would likely not survive. As the medical literature shows, <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneuploidy.html" title="Aneuploidy">aneuploidy</a> gives rise to Turner, cri du chat, Down, Edwards etc. syndromes. (see the article) The likelihood of any gene-increasing mutation in animals being beneficial seems so slight as to be non-existant. And as is stated in <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/29/natsel.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/29/natsel.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>The enormous reproduction level of bacteria ... does not occur due to a rapid depletion of available food and moisture, and also an accumulation of toxic metabolic waste products in the animal's environment. Yet, the sheer number of bacteria produced should eventually result in mutations that will enable them to overcome even these problems. Evolution predicts that the organisms will eventually evolve so that their own waste products were not toxic. They might be expected to evolve selective membranes, toxic neutralizers or another means to protect themselves against the poisons. If bacteria have existed on earth for two-billion or more years-longer than most every other living thing-plenty of time should have been available for the necessary mutations to have occurred. As zoologist Grasse (1977, p. 87) notes, the question of why they did not evolve these innovations poses a major problem for evolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteria, . . . are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce the most mutants. This is why they give rise to an infinite variety of species, called strains, which can be revealed by breeding or tests. Like Erophila verna, bacteria. . .exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The bacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, is the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say the least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and then to choose as a material for this study a being which practically stabilized a billion years ago! ....[T]he mutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final evolutionary effect.</p>

<p>Hi. Our paths have crossed twice, once on the Boisseau arbitration pages, and now in connection with a copyedit to <a href="../../../w/2E/s/W.S._Gilbert_65cd.html" title="W.S. Gilbert">W.S. Gilbert</a> (Gilbert &amp; Sullivan being one of my interests, although I haven't contributed to those articles here because they are already in pretty reasonable shape). I think that from a grammatical/logical point of view, "Gilbert insisted that his actors knew their words perfectly and obeyed his stage directions" is confusing, because it suggests that Gilbert was insisting that his actors <i>historically knew, i.e. did know</i> their words, rather than that his actors <i>must (looking forward) know</i> their words, etc., which I believe is what is meant here. A grammar/style/usage expert, possibly <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a>, might be in a position to remember the technical name for this usage, and I find my proposed rewording to be a bit more idiomatic. I won't revert or make an issue of it, but it will be of interest whether anyone else expresses a view. Good luck with the article.

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I still think that "he insisted that they obey" reads more idiomatically: <i>at that time</i> he was insisting that they (then) obey, not that they (in the past) obeyed. As I suggested, running it by one of our copyediting experts might make the most sense; I am good with it either way.

<p>Hi Mr. Ceurden. I got your message. The opera you mention is in fact real. I am on eof the unfortunate souls who bought a cassette tape of the performance from Scott Ferrell in 2000. The only reason I thought it should be included was because I felt sorry for him. Based on from what I remember, he was talking about it almost nonstop and when it was over, I tried to be supportive and bought his tape. It was horrible. It was hard to hear and the singers you could hear were not very good. If you see fit to have it removed, then I cant stop you. I just wanted to be helpful. If its a citation query, ask Scott. I don't have his address but you seem to know who he is so maybe he can help you if you ask him.Boomdeehay 01:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help with this. I haven't forgotten my promise to deal with the redundancy in the opening sentence ("Banksia integrifolia... is a species... in the... genus Banksia.")

<dd>Sorry, not really. It's too long, and its all about the distribution. Ideally, the opening sentence should be specially crafted for the benefit of people who only want a one-sentence definition. So something like
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Banksia integrifolia</i>, commonly known as Coast Banksia, is a species of tree that grows along the east coast of Australia."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'd be happy with this; the problem for me is crafting the remainder of the paragraph around that. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 00:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think my edit exactly meets the case. It does not say "a bit", and it says that they had quarreled and does not say that they reconciled. You do not need to beat the point to death. I think it is crystal clear, but if you feel strongly, go ahead and add "and never reconciled." I think it's the other way around, i.e., if they *had* reconciled you would need to say so.</p>
<p>Also, I added a bit to the Brantinghame Hall stub, including some links to relevant websites and cats. -- <a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 03:22, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. I'd prefer it to go below the line for "Context and Analysis". Looking at it now on Firefox (I originally put it up while on IE), it looks a lot less crummy, but still not ideal.

<p>Yeah, it's looked good. It got a bit scary an hour ago - 3 reverts needed in 9 minutes, but one was, I think, just a test, and Test4 sorted the other one out.

<p>To which she replies "When these people address me, I am degraded indeed."</p>
<p>I'm reading this as a dodgy newspaper, or possibly semi-pornographic photographers....</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt the latter. Perhaps, like the Duchess in The Gondoliers, she is earning a living by endorsing "somebody's soap", i.e., advertising, and she feels degraded that she must make her living by these endorsements? The name "Scumley and Ripp" indicates that they are scum and ripoff artists of some kind, not pornographers, but it could be some kind of blackmail scam. Or, maybe it's just for a news item connected with her charitable work?

<dd>Sorry, I am late, as always. The templates are good for several reasons: one, they are consistent, two, if someone makes adjustments in the future, they will be reflected automatically, three, I believe your problems are just nitpicks. I believe templates look much cleaner and more organized. You should put there more info: publisher, location, chapters, etc. As for lead you can add major points of opera history: why does it start in 1600's? who were really really important people? were there any major shifts and changes in opera genre? etc. Or some summary/statistics of people: their nationalities, styles, etc. Background stuff. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 04:59, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why then do you not think that this much more important and equally tendentious point does not need citation out of interest? "Shakespeare is believed to have produced most of his work between 1586 and 1612, although the exact dates and chronology of the plays attributed to him are often uncertain"? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 12:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The central problem is that in the case of Shakespeare nearly all "scholarship" about his early life and much of his later life as well is based on "traditions", "beliefs", "historical research about people and places he might have had something to do with" etc, etc, etc. Therefore all the cites in the world will only refer to these guesswork sources. How valuable is that to the casual WP reader? The traditions about Shakespeare are very well entrenched and widely regarded. Would it not be better to simply make a general statement about this core problem in Shakespeare studies and then say in effect "all the following may or may not be true and has been believed for centuries..."? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 13:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, I noticed what you said about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_major_opera_composers.html" title="List of major opera composers">List of major opera composers</a> over on Moreschi's talk page. I really don't think it would be appropriate to include a history of opera or the story of the origins of opera in the lead there. That's not what the list is about as the title states quite explicitly. We already have perfectly good articles on those subjects and a link to the main <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">Opera</a> page is quite adequate. The lead must be concise. I don't think we should have to try to please every whim of any reviewer who happens to be passing by. Featured list (as well as GA and FA) reviewers should be held to the same assessment criteria when making their judgements as the editors are when creating their articles. Otherwise the whole system will break down in a welter of subjectivity. AFAIK our list meets the required criteria and should be passed accordingly.

<p>If there is really a POV dispute, there should be some kind of dispute going on. As far as I can see, there isn't anybody who is disputing the aims you and the other editors are setting out.

<dd>My opinion is that the changes that will be made will be mostly additions rather than editorial tweaking.

<dd>Ah, yes, ENO. They do G&amp;S (so does Opera North and SO and WNO), but the Royal Opera doesn't. The Merry Widow has been presented by at least two, and probably more, of the major international opera companies, and none of them have done any G&amp;S.

<dd>OK, I'll spell it out for you. There are a number of opera companies around the world that are regarded as major international houses - the Met, the Royal Opera, the Paris Opera, the Vienna State Opera, probably the major companies in Munich, Chicago, San Francisco, maybe one or two others. The Merry Widow is sometimes performed by several of them. G&amp;S isn't. That's all I'm saying.

<p>Adam, I don't understand. Why are you now saying that we should link to amateur G&amp;S groups' webpages? Have you listened to this university group's MP3s? Are they the only examples of G&amp;S music that should be linked to in the G&amp;S article? This seems inconsistent with our very clear consensus in the past to not include amateur group's websites.

<p>Although this article meets all of wikipedia's requirements for an article (except maybe verifiability), I realize that there is a train in motion (that I believe is attributed to negativity towards creationism, even though wikipedia is NPOV, and the poor start of the article) and nothing I do is going to stop it. After giving the appropriate verifiable sources and making it "more encyclopedic". How do I create an article for it? I can guarantee that I will get ridiculed if I edit everything and post it back in the same location, regardless of whether the article is perfect or not.

<p>Hi Adam, I have been trying to set up a second 'to do' box on the Opera Project page (as discussed recently), but have been having some diffiulties. Do you know how to set up two boxes with different text? My experiments are at <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_Laboratory_0e29.html" title="User:Kleinzach/Laboratory">User:Kleinzach/Laboratory</a> and include a <a href="../../../o/p/e/Template%7EOperaWIP_7a1a.html" title="Template:OperaWIP">Template:OperaWIP</a>.</p>
<p>I realize that I could simply add to the text in the other box, but ideally I'd prefer to have a different box in a contrasting colour to make it stand out more. Best. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 11:24, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks good - especially having a dedicated box for Composer(s) of the month. One problem however is the wording of the new box. Subprojects is ambiguous (re existing G&amp;S sub project) which is why I suggested 'Work in Progress' on the Talk Page. Also I think the quaver is kitsch!

<p>In the creationist orchard you and other believe I am misciting a certain passage. The sentence is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the years following Darwin, many <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationist.html" title="Creationist">creationist</a> attempted to reconcile the thing Darwin could not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the citation is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Darwin could not see how these observations could be explained by the prevailing view of his time: that each species had been independently created, with the species that were best suited to each location being created at each particular site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the citation because it explains that Darwin could not reconcile the religious belief of fixity of the species and his scientific observations.

<p>I have a question. After I left my last comment over at Evolution:Talk, I got to thinking about this... in fact, differing rates of reproduction in the organisms that carry different variations would be natural selection, which is just one (albeit the main) force in evolution. Founder effect and genetic drift for example, don't really involve differing rates of reproductive success. Am I correct? If that's the case, then it's a bit misleading to say in the intro <i>either</i> that "evolution refers to changes in the inherited traits of a population from generation to generation as a result of genetic variations and differing rates of reproductive success in the organisms that carry them" (my version) or "evolution refers to changes in inherited traits of a population from generation to generation due to some of these traits providing advantages for the organism that increase their relative reproductive success compared to the other possibilities" (Adam's version). Wouldn't it be better just to say "evolution refers to changes in the inherited traits of a population from generation to generation" (period) and then perhaps add another couple of snetences describing some of the main ways that those changes can occur... e.g., natural selection, genetic drift, etc. Or since it's just the introduction, have a sentence that explains natural selection as the primary cause of evolution, with other phenomena to be explained below.--<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveRickert_de95.html" title="User:EveRickert">EveRickert</a> 03:02, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With minimal effort I was able to find about another 15 or so publications that focus on exactly the same point as Gould's. None of these really explain it quite as well as I think we do, I think. Also since it is such a common theme in biology and evolution and so often misunderstood, it is worth examining carefully.

<p>I don't mind. I was confused when I thought you liked the original very technical version, which I suspect some people prefer. I actually would favor a basic abstract and introduction model, or executive summary and introduction model, rather than the "lead" method that Wikipedia uses. I think that eventually several should be presented and then each be commented on/debated/voted on etc. I just want to make sure in my entry in these proposals, that I do not make any horrendous misstatements or mistakes, given that I am not a biologist.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 04:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just trying to think in terms of simplification, thus making me dangerous in content area. However, thanks for considering my input and the kindness of reworking it for improvement. This is the first time I have made a suggestion that anyone has even remotely considered its inclusion. Makes me feel considerably better about the entire Wiki process. The Intro, is without question the hardest thing to write for any topic, so I appreciate the challenge and your courage. I suspect we could attack many of the following sections and reconstruct them in a more logical and readable form. In fact, the "meat" of the article would likely be much easier to clarify ... certainly you would have fewer objections to your suggestions. If you get a chance puruse the Intro article, we tried to provide a less technical version without misleading the audience. If you see areas for improvement, your skills would be appreciated. Also, If you know of any "general public" literature to add. list them on the discussion page. Best of luck with your efforts on turning the course of the Titanic. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom_Replicator_b58d.html" title="User:Random Replicator">Random Replicator</a> 20:17, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I might be unfair, but I am just realizing more and more clearly what the problem is. I have now watched SlRubenstein and Axel147 and a few others turn a short clearly stated argument in a proposed section into an incomprehensible confused mess. I have read evolution's most famous popularizers. I have looked at the history of the "fact and theory" sections of both the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> articles. Most of what has been written on this issue is awful, frankly. And the creationists are able to exploit that like crazy. I had always wondered why this was such a big issue, and now I am seeing that it is not just dogmatic confused creationists. It is dogmatic confused evolution scientists too. I see what has happened. Very clearly. I am from physics and mathematics. In mathematics and physics we have very clear precise reasoning. We have to. We are trained to. If a student is not careful and precise, they do not make it. "Natural selection" takes place and those unclear imprecise thinkers are weeded out. Biology and other fields do not necessarily select for the same things in their training. I know this since I have graded their papers and sat in class with them. This is not to say that they are not smart. They just do not think the same way. They are careless in their arguments. They are glib. This still works for them, but it does not work when you are trying to present a united front against some group bent on the destruction of the field. Do you know I have had creationists tell me that evolution scientists are in a cult? That evolution scientists are satan worshippers or doing satan's bidding? That evolution scientists are satanic demons? Do you know that creationists have told me that evolution scientists are infidels and blasphemers? That evolution should be excluded from schools? That evolution science should not be researched? that evolution scientists should be jailed or even executed? Now it is easy to just say that creationists are fundamentalist kooks. But they have won the battle in the public arena handily in the USA. By far. Many many more people in the public believe in creationism than in evolution. You cannot make a vague handwaving argument in that case. You will convince no one, especially the creationists. Evolution science is on a train ride to hell, taking the rest of science with it. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 12:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i noticed one of your posts concerning dwaves -</p>
<p><br />
from dwarf talk page:</p>
<p>Vandalism??? I may be being unduly suspicious, but I have remioved the bolded line in the following:</p>
<p>The dwarves had first been created and had quickened in Ymir’s flesh, and were then maggots; but now, by the decision of the gods, they got the understanding and likeness of men, but still had to dwell in the earth and in rocks. Many of the dwarves were said to be 'filthy' living in their own excrement, and hence smelling awful. Modsogner was one dwarf and Durin another.</p>
<p>We've had so many one-line edits of this sort that have proven to be vandalism that I think we have to be cautious. I have, however, put a message for the user in his talk page, and hope I am mistaken. Adam Cuerden 13:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

...this is quite possibly not vandalism, but unless you want to read the poetic/elder edda (all them norse stories), you cant be sure. as far as i remember ymir was the giant of which the world was made after death (slain by thor at oden's command)...so maybe revise your choice? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.84.132.193 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.84.132.193_29b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.84.132.193">contribs</a>) 01:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>An anonymous user has edited <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gender_Studies_332d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gender Studies">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Gender_Studies</a> and has edited its aims so that it reads (the following quote is taken from the talk page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Correct articles where the term 'gender' is overused, used incorrectly, or used pejoratively to pander to (what Christina Hoff-Sommers, Wendy McElroy and other more moderate feminists call) a "gender-feminist" POV.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct articles where the term "gender" is used (without reference to NPOV dictionaries and other NPOV sources) to replace the term 'sex' as a ploy to pander to "gender"-feminist POV. <b>Correct the usages so that the proper definition is used without regard to</b> UNTESTED and often invalid 'gender theories', so distinctions can be made between 'gender' and 'sex', and so that the usage reflects some sort of NPOV take on a highly loaded term. Just because some widely criticized academic fields have used totalitarian tactics to force 'gender' and censor the usage of 'sex', in US humanities programs is no indication of the validity of this politically-loaded term. Consult NPOV sources such as dictionaries, opponents of "gender"-feminists and NPOV mass media sources to balance 'gender' POV with 'sex' POV.</li>
<li>Correct articles where the term 'gender' is being used gynocentrically as a front for 'oppression'-feminist political, legal or cultural power plays. For example, in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> (Status) there is no mention that for the male 'gender', military mortality is 98% compared to 2% for the female 'gender' (in Iraq)...but other forms of far less serious female "gender" oppression are implicated (covertly and most disengenously) as having something to do with the gender "oppression" of women. This kind of blatant, gynocentric "gender" bias is no less POV than the other forms listed here.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Said user has further edited the talk page suggesting that (the following quote is taken from the talk page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect this project was created to pander to the points of view of <b>misandric, gender-ginning, 'patriarchal oppression' feminists (please see <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandry</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> ) who use the term 'gender' as a cunning, covert, and blatantly gynocentric weapon of war.</b> Many other more moderate feminists and non-feminists have challenged these blatantly gynocentric, and often misandric "gender feminist" ideologies. I insist on a non-sexist, non-'genderist', non-reverse sexist project...otherwise this project is just the usual type of cunning totalitarian tactic we see so much in other politically correct channels. To revert the above content just because none of the orginal authors of this project page like it is a POV stunt to have ones cake and eat it too. I am going to reinsert the content. I insist that before it is reverted again good NPOV reasons be provided. My aim here is some kind of GENUINE non-sexist, non-reverse sexist, and non-'genderist' NPOV...as may be shown well in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a> (drop in editor) 00:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that the term <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> (that is, the idea that at least some of the differences between the roles of men and women in society) is socially constructed, yet 'sex' (i.e. that any differences between men and women are essentially biological), at the very least, looks like misogyny|misoginist]] POV bias of the worst kind. Any assistance arguing against the point would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for editing the Gene flow section in the Evolution article. I at one time joined Gene flow with population structure but it was moved. I agree that the HGT and Hybridization should be in the Gene flow section. I haven't read your edits yet-family matters came up. I will start adding references once it takes shape. The evolution article has undergone drastic change and I am glad it is shortening, however I have some concern too much information is being removed and essential terminology has been removed. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetAgrippa_db63.html" title="User:GetAgrippa">GetAgrippa</a> 19:50, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You cut a paragraph from the Creationist/Evolution controversy article. I don't have an argument with that. However, I did harvardize some references, and these references may no longer be used in the article. As such, I propose that we at least flag them for deletion, if we do not delete them outright. E.g., <a href="#CITEREFAnderson2001" title="">Anderson 2001</a>, <a href="#CITEREFBergman2004" title="">Bergman 2004</a>, <a href="#CITEREFLong2004" title="">Long 2004</a>, <a href="#CITEREFSpetner2000" title="">Spetner 2000</a> are no longer relied upon as a reference. I'll flag them for now and leav it to your discression to delete them (or move them to the discussion).</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Cuerden,</p>
<p>I have just begun on Wikipedia. I noted in the Evolution talk section that the people who can edit the page seem to give more attention to "grammar" and "feel" than to supporting statements with citations.</p>
<p>This did not seem right for a true scientific artical in which Encyclopedic content must be verifiable. I read about the five pillars and the other Ideals of Wikipedia. I agree that they are a great foundation.</p>
<p>I would rather help than add to that problem some seem to have of focusing on beliefs rather than acting as an resource encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions for me?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this,</p>
<p>HFAS</p>

<p>Mutation rates vary enormously amongst varying genomes and species and has been problematic in devising molecular clocks such that a relaxed approach is often taken nowdays. I think that is one of the most interesting questions in evolutionary biology: Why some genome sequence is prone to change and why some organisms are hypervariable or resistant to change? I find induced mutagenesis interesting because that brings in a new dimension of the environment directly promoting genetic change and evolution. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetAgrippa_db63.html" title="User:GetAgrippa">GetAgrippa</a> 13:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't been around the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article for awhile; that one is so active I find it impossible to keep up given the amount of time I am able to contribute. It's like I go away for two days and there's 2 hours worth of new reading on the Talk page! I haven't been too active in any particular article since then, but I have taken an interest in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_biology.html" title="Conservation biology">Conservation biology</a> and I am trying to get a few more good editors involved, as well. I realied I don't actually know what field of biology you focus in, or whether you know anything about this topic, but thought I'd ask--or maybe you know of some editors who do.</p>
<p>There was some discussion about 6-8 months ago on needed improvements to the article, but for awhile now it has just been two editors, myself and another, and I think neither one of us has the expertise to substantively improve the article beyond a certain point. Also, there is disagreement on a few things, and without more qualified editors involved, it may become difficult to resolve some of the disagreements, and there is a risk that it may start to look like one or the other of us is trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">own</a> the article. I think it is just a situation with too few cooks, and I would like to see more qualified editors join in for awhile.</p>
<p>If this is a topic of interest to you, I hope you can find some time to work on it a little.--<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveRickert_de95.html" title="User:EveRickert">EveRickert</a> 21:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hope you're getting better. As you'll have noted, I've split the list of works off to a new article, and substituted a brief homily mentioning the works we've got articles about, though not <i>Variation</i> because unsure of what to say. Have had a bit of a struggle finding references covering all of the points, ended up using a couple of obituaries which mention most of the works, though not the barnacles and worms: think it's worth adding in <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/timeline.html" class="external text" title="http://darwin-online.org.uk/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">this timeline</a> which lists more works but lacks nice adjectives?

<dd>Better habit with regards to answering questions - it's far better to say "I will do so in the future" first. It isn't necessary to explain why you don't, but if you choose to, make it clear up front that you will do so in the future.

<p>Yes, it is run by the same people who run the less subtle parody of Landover Baptist (that's why Objective Ministries spends so much time attacking Landover and demanding it be shut down as blasphemy by the evil atheists). The parody is sublte but it comes through if one looks at the general pattern, see for example <a href="http://objectiveministries.org/gametheory/" class="external text" title="http://objectiveministries.org/gametheory/" rel="nofollow">|here</a> where some self-identifies as a "Game Theoretician". . Similarly, <a href="http://objectiveministries.org/kidz/" class="external text" title="http://objectiveministries.org/kidz/" rel="nofollow">here</a> they tell kids that if they meet an atheist they should tell their parants and pastor right away and that "Very advanced witnessing techniques are needed for these grouches. Let the adults handle them." Similarly, in the "Creation Science Fun Facts" they include the statement that Adam was missing a rib and describe Neanderthals as "Flood-cloud-related-rickets" which is a combination of the creationist claim that Neanderthals were normal people with rickets and the general phenomenon of using the presence of more water in the atmosphere(in some form or another) pre-Flood as an explanation of many different things. Finally, they claim specifically that the Bombardier beetle was made to be a refutation of evolution. For a really humorous set see the <a href="http://objectiveministries.org/mallmission/" class="external text" title="http://objectiveministries.org/mallmission/" rel="nofollow">Malls Of The Damned</a>. One of the real kicker's is their page about using Halloween to witness which includes the suggestion to dress up as various Biblical figures and recommends saying something like "BOO! I'm John the Baptist, and these are my many exciting exploits..." Finally, I don't think anyone would think that <a href="http://objectiveministries.org/antioccult/milton.html" class="external text" title="http://objectiveministries.org/antioccult/milton.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is anything less than a joke.

<p>The RfC page isn't really a place to air lengthy grievances against other users, and the Sciences RfC has subtopics that break the RfCs down by category.

The article isn't the clearest around (not my work) and if it gets developed later into more specific articles they can always take over the redirects and this can be the generic main article.

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">my ONLY contributions about evolution have been on natural selection talk page and those of Michael Johnson where we had a very amicable exchange of views which he decided to terminate yesterday. So it is not "lots of evolution talk pages," as you calimed. Just because someone questions the established dogma does make them a troll does it? or well maybe that is what a troll really is...? I don't really know what trolls or or where they live; maybe you can tell me? True scientists are supposed to question things, rather than base their views on a form of brainwashing with the views of the 'mother church.' Sadly, this latter description is a more accurate account of most 'science believers' and even of many so-called scientists who enjoy spouting their dogmas rather than doing a bit of freethinking. I prefer to think for myself, sorry if that offends.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Thanks Adam, I suppose my main issue is please point to the hard evidence that NS is a real thing and not just a theory. I think it is largely cooked up in the sense that people 'go fishing' for evidence to support a theory and do not see nature as it is, but see it very largely through the lens of a theory. This evidence arising from 'expectation of proof' is highly dubious in my view as it seems like evidence found to 'pin against' someone suspected of murder, rather than some incontrovertible evidence found without solicitation or expectation that merely proves pretty unambiguously who the murderer is. Do you follow? and please think about the subtle difference between those two grades of evidence. One would be regarded as good evidence in a court of law, and the other pretty shaky. thanks <a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_morrell_55ce.html" title="User talk:Peter morrell">Peter morrell</a> 08:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi Adam, your comment on this case, "I suppose someone sets a block or other punishment on one/both of them as they see fit, and put that in Conclusions?" is right on the money. Despite the official-looking nature of the page, it seems that pretty much anyone can make comments on the cases. Of course, only sysops can make blocks, and for whatever reason SSP gets barely any admin attention, which is why I said that if you don't take action I'm not sure who will. Your reluctance to make a block in a case where you're personally involved makes sense though, and maybe the thing to do is to post to ANI--you might get more of a response than <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive211_fc8e.html#self-identifying_sockpuppets.2C_block_requested" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive211">my post</a> did. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi Adam, I see you're engaged in some kind of campaign to purge WP of articles about homeopathy. I suppose that's your right, but would you mind putting in a tiny bit of effort to check whether the articles you are proposing for deletion might actually have some value? For example, Vithoulkas and Sankaran are without question the two most important homeopathic practitioners in the world today and a simple Google search would have confirmed that. I used to be an active editor, but I don't have time for it these days, so it's a little distressing to find that someone's going around trying to delete a whole string of articles just because the editor doesn't have a clue what they're about.

The article itself points to a huge collection of sources. Look up Vithoulkas in Google Scholar. Look for his name on any site that discusses homeopathy. He is nothing less than the most prominent homeopath of the last forty years, and this fact is self-evident from the existing article. As one example, I pointed you to the Swedish parliament's Right Living award page, which in itself would make him notable (although it would actually count as one of his lesser achievements). To suggest that Vithoulkas is not notable in the face of a vast array of information to the contrary borders on malicious editing. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 20:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>
