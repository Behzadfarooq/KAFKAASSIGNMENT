	    <p><b>Ada Ciganlija</b> (<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_language.html" title="Serbian language">Serbian</a> <i>Ada Ciganlija</i>, <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrilic.html" title="Cyrilic">Cyrilic</a> <i>Ада Циганлија</i> - pronounced in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> roughly as /a'da tsig'anliya/) is an island in the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Sava.html" title="Sava">Sava</a> river flowing through central <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> the capital city of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>. The island belongs to the Belgrade municipality of <a href="../../../%C4%8D/u/k/%C4%8Cukarica.html" title="Čukarica">Čukarica</a>.</p>
<p>The island's most noted landmark is a fountain: based on the famous <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_d%27Eau_528b.html" title="Jet d'Eau">Jet d'Eau</a> (water-jet), situated in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Geneva_cf68.html" title="Lake Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>. Belgrade one is also 140-metre-high and it was installed in 1996.The fountain is operating during the day all year round, except in case of frost and particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evening between spring and autumn and is lit by a set of lights.</p>

<p>It is located at the 4th kilometer from the Sava's confluence into the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> near the central parts of Belgrade. It has an area of 8 square kilometres. The island is largely used as a multi-faceted recreation zone by the citizens of Belgrade; it is most famously dubbed as the Belgrade's Sea (beogradsko more) because of its long beach. Its name is derived from the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_language.html" title="Serbian language">Serbian</a> word of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a> origin 'ada' roughly meaning a river island and 'ciganlija' an adjective form of 'cigan', meaning a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma person</a> or a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">gypsy</a>, thus the name of the island is roughly translated into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> as "Gypsy Island", this etymological expalanation may very well be a good example of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a>.</p>
<p>The island was proclaimed a national public good in 1821 by Prince <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo%C5%A1_Obrenovi%C4%87_951e.html" title="Miloš Obrenović">Miloš Obrenović</a> of Serbia by a royal decree, and is today managed by the municipal government via the Public Enterprise "Ada Ciganlija" (<a href="http://www.adaciganlija.co.yu/" class="external text" title="http://www.adaciganlija.co.yu/" rel="nofollow">JP "Ada Ciganlija"</a>), which maintains the grounds of the recreational areas and especially the beach and the Sava Lake. It is responsible for cleanliness, maintenance such as trimming of the underwater algae, public safety (life guards) etc. Even though the island is a public good, the island itself is not exclusively managed and owned by the city. There are numerous private entities who administer businesses and recreation facilities, as well as the golf course. Notably, many Serbian famous sports personalities have invested in this area.</p>

Sava Lake in wintertime</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ada Ciganlija is also a vast park and a major forested area. The most famous, and for most Belgradian's the most important feature of Ada Cignalija is the long beach along the Island's southern edge facing the so called Sava Lake (Savsko Jezero), 4.2 kilometers long. Most citizens of Belgrade swarm to this beach seeking refreshment during the hot summer months. The number of bathers at one time often reaches 300,000 in the peak season. It is by far the most popular public recreation zone in Belgrade. Besides the large adult swim area, there is also a closely supervised children's swimming area which is fenced off. There is also a special water skiing cable installed on one of the ends of the lake.</p>
<p>Ada Ciganlija features a tall sports observation tower and bleachers on multiple levels which is its most prominent structure as well and one of very few permanent solid structures. Ada Ciganlija has in the past been a host to a number of local and international water sporting events such as competitions in rowing and kayaking.</p>
<p>The very first <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_course.html" title="Golf course">golf course</a> in Serbia has been built on this island in recent years along with a golf club house, a golfing store, golfing school and a practice range. This golf course is also the seat of the first and so far only Serbian golfing association.</p>
<p>The island is home to the "Rowing Sport Club" and several rowing societies like VK <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partizan.html" title="Partizan">Partizan</a>, VK <a href="../../../c/r/v/Crvena_Zvezda_11ca.html" title="Crvena Zvezda">Crvena Zvezda</a>, and VK Grafičar. A <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing.html" title="Sailing">sailing</a> school and a club as well as all accompanying sailing facilities can be found on this island.</p>

<p>The northern edge of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island.html" title="Island">island</a> is lined with attached floating barges, or houses on the water owned by many Belgraders as a weekend refuge given this island's exceptionally quiet and green environment. Many city dwellers come to Ada to enjoy fishing excursions pickniks and barbeques with their friends and families.</p>
<p>Ada Ciganlija features several tuck shops, over 70 resaturants, bars and cafés as well as a café-cinema.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudist.html" title="Nudist">nudist</a> beach on the western edge of Ada, and a popular gay cruising area.</p>
<p>From the Ada's beach, as most Belgradian's like to call this island, stunning views of central Belgrade can bee seen. Belgrade sunsets are particularly beautiful when viewed from this spot.</p>
<p>At the extreme western edge of the so-called Sava Lake, there is a fountain resembling the one from <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> shooting water up several dozens of meters into the air.</p>
<p>During the summer months in the later hours, the city stages a spacial <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> light spectacle for those still present at the beach.</p>
<p>This Island also has an artistic <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a> workshop located at the eastern end of the island in the direction of the city.</p>
<p>At the eastern edge of the island there is also a 6 ha lake artificially enriched with rare specimens of river fish used mainly for recreational fishing. Before 1994, this area used to be a <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamp</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshland.html" title="Marshland">marshland</a>.</p>
<p>Ada Ciganlija also has a children's theatre featuring scheduled performances. There is also a <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robinson_Crusoe_f001.html" title="Robinson Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a> Island entertainment feature which stages self-themed performances.</p>

Ada Ciganlija and the Sava Lake (blue water)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ada Ciganlija is a unique <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecosystem.html" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> and an oasis in the urban area.</p>
<p>The thick forest on this island is usually described as '<a href="../../../c/e/n/Centenary.html" title="Centenary">centenary</a>' meaning it is very mature with fully grown and old tree varieties mainly oak, elm and wilow. This characteristic of Ada gives its visitors an illusion of being in complete wilderness because the noise of the city, whose central parts are in the immediate vicinity, is completely shut out by the thick forest. Most of the forest on the island is protected.</p>
<p>Areas of the island are populated by various members of the animal kingdom such as the fox, rabbit, deer as well as wild bore, and various amphibians, insects and birds. As the environmentalists warned that the island's <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biocoenosis.html" title="Biocoenosis">biocoenosis</a> has been changed to a certain extent, a new population of 60 rabbits and 100 <a href="../../../p/h/e/Pheasant.html" title="Pheasant">pheasants</a> was introduced into the island.</p>
<p>Ada Cigallija supports threatened birds such as the Pygmy Cormorant Phalacrocorax pygmeus, which winters in Belgrade in large numbers: more than 3,000 birds, as the ongoing research by the League for Ornithological Action (www.ptica.org) shows. That represents 5% of the European wintering population of this species, thus making Belgrade city centre an internationally important bird area! Pygmy Cormorants roost at and by the lower end of the Ciganlija Island – at the very site of the proposed bridge over the Sava River. Its column is planned to cover the entire island roosting site, at the same time creating a new, collision threat to both birds wintering in the area and those migrating along the river Sava because of its 200 high pylon that will be surrounded by numerous guy wires.</p>
<p>Some parts of the island are entirely wild with very little or no human presence, making this island unique in the European urban contexts.</p>
<p>Due to its independent ecosystem Ada Ciganlija is privileged with a particular <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microclimate.html" title="Microclimate">microclimate</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada_Ciganlija_0650.html" title="Edit section: Transportation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
<p>Although there are man-made land routes leading to the island, they are seldom used due to poor accessibility to the city's public transport system and main roads. There are regular boat transfer services taking people from Belgrade's river banks onto the island.</p>
<p>There is also a small 'tourist train' (not running of train tracks) touring on the island.</p>
<p>There is also an impromptu recreational marina on the island's downstream end. There are plans to expand this marina and make it permanent.</p>
<p>Boating in the lake as well as car traffic on land is strictly forbidden. There is a large parking lot on the city's side of the river.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada_Ciganlija_0650.html" title="Edit section: Modification, development and challenges">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modification, development and challenges</span></h2>
<p>Although naturally Ada Ciganlija is indeed a river island, through years (starting from 1967), and in order to protect Ada's environment and create a drinking water reservoir for the city as well as protect the swimmers, the city authorities have linked two ends of the island to the land on the southern side of the island in the direction away from the city, so technically today, Ada Ciganlija is a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula.html" title="Peninsula">peninsula</a> with multiple attachments to the land (three to be exact). Thusly created lake is of strategic importance to Belgrade as a reservoir of drinking water and is under the regime of the most rigorous environmental protection. The dams upstream are equipped with tubes through which water flows into the Sava lake, passing through a filtering system installed in a smaller artificial 'buffer lake', clean water thus streams into the lake and is pumped back out using electrically powered pumps at the downstream end, back into the river.</p>
<p>City and state authorities of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> plan to build a new bridge over the Sava river which is to cross over the eastern tip of the Ada Ciganlija island. The bridge is set to be a Belgrade landmark due to its imposing structure (the bridge tower 'needle' will be 200m tall), providing a direct land link to the island via the elevators as well as a planned <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_rail.html" title="Light rail">light rail</a> station that will stop mid-bridge to service passengers to and from the island. Many serious concerns were raised over building of this bridge crossing Ada for environmental and aestetic reasons. The bridge should start construction early in 2007.</p>
<p>Current challenges of the island involve its further planning and development in the context of protection of its environment as a unique oasis in Serbia's largest metropolitan area.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada_Ciganlija_0650.html" title="Edit section: Belgraders and Ada Ciganlija">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Belgraders and Ada Ciganlija</span></h2>
<p>For many years many citizens of Belgrade have had an uneasy relationship with Ada. Ada Ciganlija was often regarded in a sense as a 'necessary evil' as the only 'resort' available to masses of economically disadvantaged people during the economic hardship and wars of the 90's of the last century (and arguably still today). Use of this recreation area has always been free of charge and more than often over-crowded and regarded as having poor hygiene, due to a long time of Ada Ciganlija not having any proper facilities or institutionalized care. In recent years the city authorities and private investors have worked hard to change this image and ensure that this zone is properly maintained, has the proper infrastructure and appropriate commercial and recreational content. According to future plans Ada Ciganlija is set to become a prime sporting and recreation facility for Belgrade.</p>
