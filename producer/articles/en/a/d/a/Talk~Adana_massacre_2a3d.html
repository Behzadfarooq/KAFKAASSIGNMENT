<p>It appears that Coolcat has edited the page to add factual accuracy dispute comment onto this page without giving a comment as to why. Nor any effort to correct or verify the articly seems to have been taken. There are none of his/her opinions on the talk page neither. Can he post a comment related to this situation. Otherwise if no evidence can be given to the validity of factual accuracy dispute then it should be removed. Simply commenting it is disputed isn't enough. Meok 08:59, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well until then perhaps the accuracy dispute should be removed. Evidence, reasons as to why an accuracy dispute should be given. A "I will do it later" does not suffice. Particularly as the dispute related to the Armenian Genocide will likely and has taken a long time. Your work with that page does not have an end time in sight Meok 12:10, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If there are no references or sources why are you removing the "factual accuracy dispute" comment. Isn't it unfair? One can enter a fictitous but controversial event into Wikipedia but does not give any references, and there will not be any notice regarding the accurateness of the article, it is totally unfair. We are talking about "holocaust". This is a serious accusation. You cannot simply say that "Well until then perhaps the accuracy dispute should be removed. Evidence, reasons as to why an accuracy dispute should be given." This is not a game. I propose the opposite with your logic: Well until any references and serious sources are given "factual accuracy dispute" should stay. <a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 7.49, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Factual accuracy notice do not fit here. The position presented in that article exist, factual accuracy notice is used when there is a misrepresentation of a position. The POV notice is what I think you wanted to add. When the other version is not presented, or not as it should, it is a POV and not a factual accuracy notice. Once I have time, I will be working on this article. Regards. Fadix 17:13, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Holocaust, until now, is broadly used to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> itself. This is not a good terminology for this case of massacre - or genocide. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a></p>
<p>The word "holocaust" was used for the Armenian Genocide, before the Jewish Genocide. But I agree, massacre fits better with this article.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 22:50, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you have a reference for the use of the word "holocaust" to describe the treatment of the Armenians earlier than its use for the Jews?

<dd>No terms, whether "massacre" or "rebellion," are widely used in scholarly sources since there hasn't been much academic focus on this subject matter. My suggestion is to come up with a more neutral title so as to be inclusive of both Armenian and Turkish deaths. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but here we cannot agree. Many articles use the expression massacre, and the same point that there was a revolt is doubtful. As for refusing scholars on the ground that they are Armenian Americans, then no Jew should speak on the holocaust, which is absurd. I am sorry, but McCarthy remains too isolated to accept this view to the level of changing the name to the article. Also, he only cites it briefly, without explaining why it's a revolt and not a massacre, so we can't even use him to have an alternative version, unless he exposes it better elsewhere. But what thing is clear only academic sources should be accepted, ant they must not be in Armenian or Turkish (this is an English wikipedia)--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 00:41, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not refuse Armenian scholars, but I find it interesting that those who make this same argument also reject Turkish scholars. That is a blatant double standard. Both sides have their POVs. As for McCarthy, he is an academic source and as far as WP policy goes, he is perfectly fine as he fulfills the conditions of verifiability. Therefore to judge him would be POV. As such, we must come to some compromise since we are not agreed on either "massacre" or "rebellion" as far as the title goes. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 06:52, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dude, the fire was observable hundreds feets from there from Battleships stationed on the Sea from various countries. I don't understand what do you mean by non-Armenian or non-Turkish Works to give credence to a position. There has been various reports of the events, Gibbons, Helen Davenport. The Red Rugs of Tarsus: A Woman’s Record of the Armenian Massacre of 1909. New York: The Century Co., 1917 , one example. Raymond H. Kévorkian prepared volume ( LA CILICIE (1909-1921) DES MASSACRES D'ADANA AU MANDAT FRANÇAIS) contains various references from neutral parties, you will find from it loads of references on the event, including Ottoman government official statistics claiming a little over 600 Muslim deaths and 20,000 Christian deaths, mostly Armenians. There has been also works published of memoirs of those who saw the burning. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This doesn't conform to name conventions, what is called Adana massacre is about the death of at least 17 thousand Armenians(according to Ottoman sources) to 35 thousands according to other sources(such as Rummel figures). This is what this article covers, deaths of people can not be called rebellion. While the deaths of hundreds in Khojali in its entry is called massacre, tragedy and even genocide, I don't see anything called 'rebellion' or any other positions even thought the position vehiculed on that pages is more controversial in the academic world than the qualification of massacre in the cases of Adana. I don't see any mention of rebellion for the entry about Sebrenisca massacres while the Adana massacre costed two times more lives. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:08, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For anyone interested, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey_d997.html" title="Grand National Assembly of Turkey">Grand National Assembly of Turkey</a> website contains many revisionist documents apparently targeted at American audiences (one of them actually recalls American slavery to contextualize the events). I have cited one of these documents at the bottom of the article, and specified the page number that alleges Armenian aggression culminated in "17,000" Armenian deaths against fewer than 2,000 Turkish deaths. Your number of casualties may (correctly) refer to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana.html" title="Adana">Adana the city</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Province_93f1.html" title="Adana Province">Adana the Province</a>.</dd>

<dd>Incidently, the clash in the <i>city</i> of Adana was indeed a mutual struggle, though I am not certain that it could rightly be called a "rebellion", as it was not a struggle between the government and Armenians but rather a struggle between Christians and Muslims---the government was only very peripherally involved, largely in protecting foreigners. Even given the loosest of interpretations of the events themselves, without drawing any conclusions about which side "started it" in Adana, can one mob "rebel" against another?</dd>

<dd>In any case, there may be some confusion arising from the phrase, "Adana massacre", because Adana is both a province and a city within the province. The massacre occurred throughout Adana province, and indeed what occurred within Adana the city seems to be a very different story than the subsequent slaughters throughout the province.<a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDBaba_6a2e.html" title="User:DBaba">DBaba</a> 19:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We've discussed this before. We can't have another article called Adana rebellion because that would be a blatant POV fork. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 12:36, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but I don't think you understand name conventions. Let me repeat. Quantum mechanic and Super String theory are two different interpretation of the physical reality, but yet in the entry about Quantum mechanic you won't find any mention of 'also called Super String.' This entry is a main, regarding the death of about 20,000, it is not about what is called Adana rebellion, the rebellion stand for a position that maintains that the Armenians of Adana rebelled and not the death of those same Armenians. Also, there is even less justification to adding something such than adding 'also called Super String' in an article about Quantum mechanic because the also called is only used when it is a term which is used in parallel and not when it threats another thing. Now, who calls the deaths in Adana 'Adana rebellion?' Even McCarthy doesn't do so, what he does is that he justifies those deaths by claiming rebellion, but rebellion is not a parallel term for those deaths which the article is supposed to threat. That there was a claim for rebellion in Adana has a place in the article, but the Adana deaths are not also called 'Adana rebellion,' rebellion is the justification of the circunstance of those deaths, which is a different thing.</dd>

<dd>Well, I disagree because the inevitable result of this will be another article called "Adana rebellion" which will principally focus on the Turkish POV. Both these articles will end up as POV forks. If everyone is alright with that (despite it being <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">against</a> WP guidelines, then there's not much else I can say. But the fact remains that McCarthy and the Turkish writers do not refer to this whole series of events as a "massacre" but "rebellion." <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 02:12, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can count on my fingers the number of enought notable works that sibstitute to the massacre the term rebellion to refer to the deaths, and we don't have to creat another article, nothing prevent us to say in the article that the Turkish position places importances on a rebellion to explain those deaths, the thing here is that there artile is about the death and if we respect name conventions we will name it such. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:51, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At that time , armenians were attacting turkish people. And they were attacking defendless innocent people. they killed pregnant woman and opened her belly just for fun to check whether baby is male or female.</p>
<p>Do you want me to give another story? I have many. There was a guy and his neithbor was armenian. At that time, armenians captured him and they tied him to a tree. And they started to cut his children's ear. <b>They forced him to eat ears of his children</b>. They didn't killed this guy. Because they wanted him to suffer by thinking his dead childrens.</p>
<p>In adana, people ascaped to mountains to survive because armenians were cutting them.</p>

<p>Please, please, please!! before you revert the article, read the NY Times article that I provided. If you are in doubt of it's authenticity, which I am sure you will claim as being fake, ask a moderator before you do it. I don't want to engage in edit war when my source is reliable as I spent time researching it. If you have another source that disputes it, please put alongside mine, unless you can completely falsefy mine then you can provide that source (and I don't mean something from wikipedia, armeniapedia, or an armenian source, something on the same caliber as NY Times).

<dd>Oh, Oguz1. Oh no no no no no. You've quoted <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D12F63A5C13738DDDA00A94D1405B858DF1D3" class="external text" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D12F63A5C13738DDDA00A94D1405B858DF1D3" rel="nofollow">German Ambassador Bernstorff</a> in response to American requests that he use his influence to stop the killing of Armenians. And you've shamelessly cherrypicked this from among hundreds of articles elaborating (or alleging) Turkish atrocities.</dd>

<dd>I think if we concentrate really really hard, Oguz, you and I can think of a reason why a German Ambassador would try to justify Ottoman barbarism in <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWI_f5e9.html" title="WWI">1915</a>.<a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDBaba_6a2e.html" title="User:DBaba">DBaba</a> 10:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's why it is called <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Massacre_91e7.html" title="Adana Massacre">Adana Massacre</a> but, a <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitun_Resistance_%281895%29_5c5a.html" title="Zeitun Resistance (1895)">Zeitun Resistance (1895)</a> of an Armenian victory(!) when killed more than 20,000 Ottomans.</dd>
