<p>Myles Fairchild and his daughter Kimberly (Ashley Lyn Cafagna) moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> from <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantucket.html" title="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>, where Kimberly had been born and raised. They bought James (<a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Buchanan_681f.html" title="Ian Buchanan">Ian Buchanan</a>) and Maggie Warwick's (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Crampton_663c.html" title="Barbara Crampton">Barbara Crampton</a>) <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_3538.html" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a> style home because it reminded Myles of Nantucket. Although Myles claimed to the Forresters that they moved on a whim, it wasn't long before it was revealed that Myles pushed for this move because there was a company he was looking into that he refused to tell his daughter about. From the moment he met <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Forrester_69a6.html" title="Rick Forrester">Rick Forrester</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Young_88a5.html" title="Jacob Young">Jacob Young</a>), he didn't approve of him, but after a few conversations with Rick he began to think that maybe his first impression of the young man hadn't been accurate. It isn't long before Myles dropped in to see <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy_Alexander_8707.html" title="Macy Alexander">Macy Alexander</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbie_Eakes_51fc.html" title="Bobbie Eakes">Bobbie Eakes</a>) in the hospital, and was thrilled that she still remembered him - as her father. Myles was really Adam Alexander who, years earlier, had walked out on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Spectra_c5ca.html" title="Sally Spectra">Sally</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlene_Conley_a6d1.html" title="Darlene Conley">Darlene Conley</a>) and Macy when Macy was just a little girl. Adam couldn't stay away from Macy, and when she nearly drowned, he saved her. Macy was thrilled to see him, but wanted to know why he left when she was just a little girl. He explained that he had borrowed money from the wrong people to keep Spectra afloat (he told Sally it was from his cousin), and when the police came knocking, he testified against them. But because of who the men were, he knew that they would never let him be, so he left town without telling them where he was going. He begged her not to contact Sally, worried that the men who were after him were still out there, and would hurt Sally. He told her it had to be their little secret.</p>
<p>Just as Adam and Macy were repairing their relationship, Adam started to wonder what was going on in his daughter's life. She was staying out late, and all he knew was that she was involved with someone. When he found a soaked Kimberly at the door one night, he learned the whole truth -- Kimberly had fallen for Rick, who was engaged to <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Moore_130e.html" title="Amber Moore">Amber Moore</a> (<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Frantz_7d2f.html" title="Adrienne Frantz">Adrienne Frantz</a>), who was carrying his child. He forbade Kimberly to ever see Rick again, not wanting his daughter to associate with someone like that, much to the dismay of the Forresters, who had been using Kimberly to try to stop Rick from marrying Amber. Kimberly wasn't the only one he spoke with though; he also talked to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_Logan_bcd1.html" title="Brooke Logan">Brooke</a> (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Kelly_Lang_efd8.html" title="Katherine Kelly Lang">Katherine Kelly Lang</a>), <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Forrester_a5c8.html" title="Eric Forrester">Eric</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCook_4d36.html" title="John McCook">John McCook</a>) and Rick, telling them that there would be no relationship between Rick and Kimberly. At Macy's urging, Adam finally met with Sally for dinner. She threw him out, not even budging on forgiveness when she learned that he was the one who sent the mysterious check that had saved Spectra Fashions a few weeks earlier. Adam tried desperately to explain why he had to leave, but Sally could not forgive him, no matter what his reasons. He was devastated, and was initially unresponsive to Macy's requests to tell Kimberly the truth about their being half-sisters. He finally agreed after seeing Kimberly's devastation over Amber and Rick's marriage. Although the initial reaction was negative, Macy and Kimberly soon grew close.</p>
<p>Adam soon threw himself headlong into helping Spectra make a name for itself. When the Forresters' charity fashion show, in which Kimberly was modeling, turned into a debacle, he and Sally initially found it quite amusing, until Kimberly's dress was caught on a hook and ripped off in the back, humiliating her in front of the fashion industry. Adam was furious, convinced that the Forresters were trying to humiliate his daughter. That was soon overshadowed by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorne_Forrester_6c37.html" title="Thorne Forrester">Thorne</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/n/Winsor_Harmon_3f7a.html" title="Winsor Harmon">Winsor Harmon</a>) and Macy's break-up, and Thorne's soon-after association with Brooke. Adam and Sally were able to form a reconciliation of sorts. Although their romance was over, they were able to become friends, growing to care about all the children they had between them. Adam was pleased when it seemed like Macy and Thorne were re-uniting, but only because he wanted his daughter to be happy. When Thorne turned down Macy's proposal of marriage, Adam was furious that Thorne had hurt his daughter again. He was thrilled when Thorne and Macy returned from <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, legally married. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before Adam's past caught up with him. At a surprise party thrown for him by Sally, he admitted that the <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">mob</a> had found him. When Sally was shot by a bullet meant for Adam, he knew it was time for him to leave, and after rushing her to the hospital, left L.A. without saying goodbye to his daughters. He returned to Los Angeles to take Kimberly away with him after Thorne and Brooke finally married.</p>
<p>It was over a year before Adam resurfaced, this time in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. It turned out that he had managed to save Macy after the accident that had supposedly claimed her life, and they were living together in Italy. Adam kept encouraging Macy (who was now going by the name Lena) to marry Lorenzo Barelli (Luigi Amodeo) and to leave Thorne far behind her, but she couldn't. After Sally had a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_attack.html" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a>, Adam told Macy that her mother needed her more than he did, and after a tearful goodbye, he sent her home to Los Angeles.</p>
