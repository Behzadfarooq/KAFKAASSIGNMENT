<p><b>Adam Matthew Vinatieri</b> (born <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> in <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankton%2C_South_Dakota_1af4.html" title="Yankton, South Dakota">Yankton</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Dakota_9b0f.html" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a>) is an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placekicker.html" title="Placekicker">placekicker</a> currently playing for the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>. He is best known for his tenure with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, during which he played in four <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowls</a>, winning three of them. Vinatieri also won a championship following the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NFL_season_05ef.html" title="2006 NFL season">2006 NFL season</a> with Indianapolis. Vinatieri is the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and win four Super Bowl rings.</p>
<p>Vinatieri is generally considered the best <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clutch_%28sports%29.html" title="Clutch (sports)">clutch</a> kicker in the history of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>. Nicknamed "Automatic Adam" for his accuracy, and "Iceman" for his incredible poise under pressure, Vinatieri has converted several of the most pressurized field goals in NFL history, including game-winning kicks in the final five seconds of two Super Bowls. With his impressive professional resumé, many football analysts believe that Vinatieri will eventually land in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_81fe.html" title="Pro Football Hall of Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, a realm typically unfriendly to placekickers (only one pure placekicker, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Stenerud_713a.html" title="Jan Stenerud">Jan Stenerud</a>, is currently enshrined).</p>

<p>Vinatieri was originally recruited to kick for <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> and attended <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Military_Academy_177e.html" title="United States Military Academy">West Point</a> for several weeks in 1991 before deciding to return home to South Dakota.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Vinatieri_e0e0.html" title="Edit section: New England Patriots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New England Patriots</span></h3>
<p>In 1996 he was signed by the Patriots as an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undrafted_free_agent.html" title="Undrafted free agent">undrafted free agent</a> to be a place kicker. He played in New England for the first 10 years of his <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">NFL</a> career, during which he has played in four <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowls</a>. His first Super Bowl appearance was in his rookie season of 1996, when he played with the Patriots in their 35-21 loss to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXI_8936.html" title="Super Bowl XXXI">Super Bowl XXXI</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2001 playoffs, during a blizzard against the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> in the final game at <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxboro_Stadium_4086.html" title="Foxboro Stadium">Foxboro Stadium</a>, Vinatieri kicked a 45-yard field goal (that just barely made it over the crossbar) to tie the game 13-13 and send it into overtime. The Patriots then won the game on another field goal of 23 yards by Vinatieri. That 45-yard kick in driving snow is regarded as one of the greatest clutch plays (and greatest kicks) in NFL history.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXVI_39f0.html" title="Super Bowl XXXVI">Super Bowl XXXVI</a> he kicked a 48-yard field goal on the final play to give the New England Patriots their first Super Bowl victory, a 20-17 win over the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>. Two years later, and in an almost identical situation, he kicked a 41-yard field goal with 4 seconds left in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_7703.html" title="Super Bowl XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a> to boost the Patriots to another championship (after missing one field goal and having another attempt blocked in the first half). This time, the Patriots defeated the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_Panthers_5726.html" title="Carolina Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>, 32-29, making Vinatieri the first player ever to be the deciding factor in two <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> games (Vinatieri kept the balls used on both those kicks).</p>
<p>Vinatieri led the NFL in scoring in 2004 with 141 points (31-for-33 on field goals, and a perfect 48-for-48 on points after touchdown or PATs). His best game of the season came against the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>, against whom he scored 16 points (4 field goals, 4 PATs), and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Brown_5abd.html" title="Troy Brown">Troy Brown</a> on a fake field goal attempt (that pass gives him a career <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passer_rating.html" title="Passer rating">passer rating</a> of 122.9). He went on to score a field goal and 3 extra points in the Patriots 24-21 win over the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXIX_e869.html" title="Super Bowl XXXIX">Super Bowl XXXIX</a>.</p>
<p>To date, Vinatieri has kicked 19 game-winning field goals with less than one minute remaining (out of 20 attempts; his lone miss came in 1999), including those mentioned in the postseason. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, he had a career field goal percentage of 81.9 percent (263/321), fifth highest in NFL history. His career long is 57 yards.</p>
<p>He has a reputation as a toughnosed defender on kickoff returns. In his third season with the Patriots, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_NFL_season_d39d.html" title="1998 NFL season">1998</a>, Vinatieri made 6 tackles and 1 assist on 71 kickoff returns: i.e., he was directly responsible for stopping almost 10% of his own kickoff returns. Throughout his first 10 seasons, he made 20 tackles and 7 assists. 726 of his kickoffs were returned during those years, but only 2 were returned for touchdowns.</p>
<p>In his time in New England, he was very active in his home town and state which includes helping Christian athletes, D.A.R.E., and the Governor's Highway Safety Bureau. He was a spokesperson for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>'s teen anti-smoking contest, and also appeared in commercials for Boston-based pizza <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papa_Gino%27s_5f6a.html" title="Papa Gino's">Papa Gino's</a>. His hobbies include <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, riding <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycles</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golfing.html" title="Golfing">golfing</a>. He is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">married</a>, and has two children.</p>
<p>Vinatieri finished his 10 seasons with the Patriots as the team's all time leading scorer with 1,158 points.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Vinatieri_e0e0.html" title="Edit section: Indianapolis Colts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Indianapolis Colts</span></h3>
<p>After the 2005 season, the Patriots chose not to place the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchise_Tag_69a7.html" title="Franchise Tag">franchise tag</a> on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing him to become a free agent. He had visited with the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, but left without a contract offer. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Vinatieri signed with the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>, replacing <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Vanderjagt_ed36.html" title="Mike Vanderjagt">Mike Vanderjagt</a> who was signed by the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. Vinatieri was signed to a five year contract and received a $3.5 million signing bonus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the Colts called, I told my agent, `Let's not screw around,' " said Vinatieri, in his first extensive comments regarding his departure from New England. "I told him, 'If Indy is interested, let's get this done.'" ... Vinatieri said he has no regrets about not giving the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriots.html" title="Patriots">Patriots</a> a chance to counter the offer.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vinatieri has not missed a kick through the uprights in the <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_Dome_ad8c.html" title="RCA Dome">RCA Dome</a>. Even with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, Vinatieri was perfect against the Colts in Indy.</p>
<p>In the second round of the 2006 AFC playoffs, Vinatieri kicked a playoff record-tying 5 field goals in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Colts</a> 15-6 upset of the favored <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Ravens_9241.html" title="Baltimore Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>. The record of 5 field goals in a playoff game is one Vinatieri originally set himself against the Colts in the 2003 AFC Championship game.</p>
<p>The Colts reached <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a> after defeating the Patriots in the AFC Championship game. It was Vinatieri's fifth Super Bowl appearance, and his first with the Colts. The Colts defeated the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> by a score of 29-17. Vinatieri was 3 for 4 on field goals, and 2 for 2 on points after touchdowns. He missed a 36 yard kick wide left at the end of the first half--the third time he has missed a kick in the Super Bowl. Although the Colts scored 3 touchdowns, the snap for the first point after was bobbled by the place holder, resulting in no kick. Super Bowl XLI is his fourth Super Bowl victory. Vinatieri finished the 2006-07 postseason with 49 total points, an NFL record.</p>
