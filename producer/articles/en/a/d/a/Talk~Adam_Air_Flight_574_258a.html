<ul>
<li>Because the aim of Wikipedia is neutrality and to be non-denominational, I think the fact that this article specifically cites that there were 3 americans on the passenger list of this flight while offering no other citation of other nationalities in the opening paragraph is slanted and biased. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallamRodya_7ec9.html" title="User:CallamRodya">C A L L A M . R O D Y A</a> 04:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not at all. The foreigners on the plane just happened to be American. It is assumed the rest are Indonesian. This information is from an Indonesian press agency article. (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 05:09, 2 January 2007 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>In that case, it should be clearly noted that that of the passengers on board, all were of indonesian nationality except for 3 americans. nothing should be assumed. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallamRodya_7ec9.html" title="User:CallamRodya">C A L L A M .

<li>Sure, but the reference only referred to the Americans. You are welcome to find and cite a more comprehensive reference. (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 06:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li>I agree, this kind of blinkered reporting <i>always</i> annoys me. (It reminds me of the legendary newspaper headline after the sinking of the Titanic, "Ship Sinks, Aberdeen Man Drowns") -- 125.238.56.240 10:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>"The plane had 45,371 flying hours, and was last serviced and declared airworthy in December 2005.[11]"</p>
<p>Last serviced and declared airworthy in Dec 2005? I take that means a "C" or "D" major maintenance check, but airliners have minor servicing done on them in much more frequent intervals, plus they're checked every day and every flight and have to be signed off as airworthy every time. Could someone with more accurate facts please undate.</p>

<p>This article, however, had not mentioned the finding of the blackboxes of the flight KI0574. I have reviewed the article and if this article were to mention the finding of the blackboxes, it needs to be considered, if possible, redo the article (with the mentioning of the blackboxes). Thank You.</p>

<p>What do you mean by "disappear?" A plane doesn't just vanish. There is possibility that the plane crashed, or it landed on some mysterious uncharted island or something. Anyway, you can't just say disappear, you have to note somehow some possibilities of what may have happened and what the implications of the disappearance may be.

<dd>I agree, it is horribly vague, but thats all that we know. It is our policy (except I don't think its actually written, just the way we allways do it) not to specualte about accident/incident flights, even if thats what the media are doing, but instead to wait for hard facts. We know it vanished off radar screens, and we know it hasn't been found, therefore 'disappeared' is the best we can do. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 23:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I assume you mean in the opening paragraph, "...was a scheduled...". Well, that is standard for accident flights.

<p>This might be related to the Bermuda Triangle events. Many of the crafts that dissapeared around that region were not found, even after 50 years. It is possible the Bermuda Triangle phenominon just so happened to Flight 574, but like they say, innocent until proven. If this catches the eyes of paranormal investigators and cults, it is possible that end-of-the-world theorys would be formed. If this does have to do with the Bermuda Triangle and if air and sea vehicles really do dissapear there, then the explainations would be either A. Unknown natural phenominon, B. Extended range of the Triangle, or C. Extraterrestial abductions. All of these are unlikely but it is good to keep an open mind. --<a href="../../../e/i/y/User%7EEiyuu_Kou_cec8.html" title="User:Eiyuu Kou">Eiyuu Kou</a> 18:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

But out in Indonesia, the rational, likely explanation is that the plane has disapeared into the dense unsergrowth; it's a pretty wild part of the planet. Although if the plane remains undiscovered for some time, there will ineviatably be 'alternative' theories; some of them may become notable and require documentation - and it is possible yet (though also unlikely) for something to emerge to make them credible... <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 19:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am beginning to believe someone doesn't want to find this plane. I wonder why?Mrebstad 00:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Something you also need to remember, that in addition to the ELT (emergency locator transmitter), 95% of all CVRs (cockpit voice recorder) and DFDRs (digital flight data recorder) have pingers on them so that they can be located even underwater even after great impact as was the case with Valuejet in Florida and the Silkair 737 several years ago. Any military ship, both surface or submarine, should be able to pick up the pinging with their passive sonar system if the aircraft ended up in the water. These pingers are supposed to have a 30 day battery and survive at great depth.Mrebstad 01:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Day five, still no plane. It took a while, but it is finally starting to bother me. The problem is that the plane has multiple devices on it capable of emitting a signal, and they are virtually guaranteed to <i>all</i> be working let alone any one of them. They can take a lot, the examples you gave above prove this. There are reasons that a government might not want a plane found, but I'm gonna give it a few more days to turn up before I state any of them; I prefer to avoid conspiracies until there is some credibility in such explanations. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 07:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know what I'm thinking?! This is like the real-life comparison of the LOST series. This is ridiculous. But then again a British expert was quoted as saying it would be hard to find in the dense jungle in a BBC article. Several news articles suggested that the batteries of the pinging devices are running out quick; pretty much a chase. And uh as to conspiracy theory.. I wouldn't say the 'government' in particular because it has invited even the US forces to look for it... possibly another group =P Hahaha geez this is interesting. 58.178.215.97 10:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>And here is where I dislike the "anyone can edit" part of Wikipedia. We have a plane missing in a pretty rough section of the world, and we've already got people shifting their eyes and talking about government conspiracies, alien abductions, and the Bermuda Triangle. I particularly like the "what was on this plane that the government didn't want found?" Ooh, I know, maybe it was the plans for the magical earthquake generator the Illuminati used to cause the big tsunami! Roland Deschain 02:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Well, there is now a rational explanation turning up (which certainly pleases me, as I don't like conspiracy theories, but the continued lack of discovery was forcing me to consider <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_Air_Flight_655_6aeb.html" title="Iran Air Flight 655">something unthinkable</a>). The explanation fills all the gaps, and, while it can't go in the article as it is speculation, to kill any 'alternative' theories I'm going to state it here. The aircraft was 17 years old, acording to most sources. It had last had a full inspection something like a year ago; I'm hearing December 2005 as the last time. That made it highly likely to be riddled with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_fatigue.html" title="Metal fatigue">metal fatigue</a>. We know that on the night the aircraft hit stormy weather, and was forced to change course twice. Contact was lost shortly after the second change. On the second one, it was most likely steering back on course (having been going slightly off course as that route was easier). When it did so, it would put itself at an angle to the wind, leaving the rudder sticking up to catch the wind like a sail. To make matters worse, to counteract this, the pilots must use the rudder itself, forcing the aircraft to maintain a straight course. Something overstressed and gave way, and the tailfin assembly, including the ELT mounted near the tail, drops into the sea. The rest of the aircraft nosedives down (as aircraft usualy do after loss of the tailfin, with a handful of exceptions), and 'flies' straight down into land. This sort of impact would give a very compact debris field, and would be hard to locate. I hope this explains the disapearance well enough for now, and kills off any other theories.</li>

<p>The last known beacon coordinates (030 13’92’’ S 1190 09’17’’ E) cited from the Adam Air News Alert site make no geographic sense. The Wiki article should not cite the values as authoritative and indicate somehow that we are aware of the contradiction. Perhaps a registered user would like to put a "(sic)" in there.</p>

<p>Thank you Xiner, the latitude arcseconds value (92") should never exceed 59". Kind of like writing the time of day. The 92" figure suggests someone mistranscribed the correct figure in the Adam Air web page, and this brings into question what the value really was. Further, the source actually states the longitude is 1190 degrees, which exceeds the maximum value of 180 and is probably a typo of 119 degrees. This further suggests unchecked transcription errors at the source. Citing the figures unchallenged makes the Wiki article less credible, since it's an obvious misstatement. Incidentally, if the last known position is mistranscribed, that'll make it harder to find the airplane, won't it. (RadarDude)</p>

<p>The aircraft shown on wikipedia Adam Air Flight 574 page is the aicraft that is missing PK-KKW...look at the letters on the nose gear door and you will see KW which are the last two letter of the aicraft registration or aircraft ID. For further proof go to www.airliners.net and input PK-KKW and you will see that although the paint is a earlier livery, the nose gear door shows the letters KW for the last two letters of the aircraft ID.

<p>Your news story quotes are all very fine and good, but how do you account for the picture??? Are you saying that it has been altered (I don't care one way or the other. I didn't post it, All I care about is accuracy.). Again, you are quoting from the same people who told the world a bunch of false information, that they found the wreakage and that there were, to quote them, 12 survivors. Now I ask you, who are you going to believe???Mrebstad 04:01, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well okay, first of all I should be clear here that "the same people who told the world a bunch of false information" as you put it is a vague term by itself, because the false news actually came from rumours on the ground that rooted from a comment that one civilian had seen a plane with black smoke and low altitude which later on this info was confirmed by local village chief, police chief, and later governor... Now of course the media correspond to this by publishing the confirmed news. BUT as for this news... if you read carefully, this time the source is from managers of AdamAir themselves. And I also need to quote this sentence from the article to correspond with the picture: <i>"Badan pesawat ini bercat putih dengan tulisan ADAMAIR, dengan tulisan ADAM warna oranye dan AIR warna hijau. Cat oranye juga ada di bagian sayap, tapi sebagian kecil."</i> - "The body of this aeroplane has white paint with the letter ADAMAIR, with orange font for ADAM and green for AIR. Orange paint also presents near the wings, but only a little" and <i>Meski begitu, kata dia, pesawat itu dipasangi tulisan ADAMAIR plus logonya. "Pesawat itu satu-satunya pesawat kami yang masih bercat putih, belum kami cat," kata Gugi.</i> - Despite the case (hasn't been painted), the plane has been attached with the writing ADAMAIR plus the logo. "The plane was the only one of our planes that still retained the <b>white paint</b>, we haven't painted it," said Gugi. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.178.215.97_8236.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.178.215.97">58.178.215.97</a> (talk) 04:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>So, lets stop dancing around the issue. Are you answering my questions? How do you account for the picture??? Are you saying that the picture has been modified or tampered with??? Again, I don't care one way or the other, again I didn't post it and again I'm only interested in accuracy and accountiblity. Have you looked at the picture??? I used to be a journalist and I am a pilot and work for a major airline.Mrebstad 05:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Currently I have posted a query comment on the userpage of the uploader in the Indonesian wiki and am waiting for an answer. The orange photo might be another plane in AdamAir's armada. Don't be so sure, let's just put "This is the suspected missing plane" as the caption. Well as a former journalist you should be well familiar on how to handle confusing issues like this and to be portraying the news as accurate as possible to the public. Now when you have two contradicting news like this (and not to forget one is clearly more reliable as the managers said it themselves) I'll let you decide according to your professionality. Thanks, and yes I have looked at the picture on the airliners.net (as "the only one" that has mostly white paint). 58.178.215.97 05:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone else think that the ID on the photo could be KH instead of KW? The resolution of the photo makes it hard to distinguish. Looking at the list of aircraft operated by Adam Air, they do have planes with both IDs.

<dd>Oh yes that's true. I'm with you on this. I initially thought it was KM or something, but KH is the best. 58.178.215.97 06:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, the <b>uploader</b> has just spoken above. I am gonna change the caption. Thanks, Arisdp! 211.26.91.118 16:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Arisdp: Thanks Guy for stepping up to the plate and clearing up the mystery. To everyone else who wrote in: Thanks for taking the time to stop and think about this picture, but we (the world) seem to take everything the media puts out there as the truth and because they believe that they have some kind of power that if they say it it is the truth. I could not lie or mislead the readers that looked to me to be accurate and accountable for what I told them, that is one of the reasons I got out of the business. Just for the record: I was a journalist and I am pilot, but not professionally and I work for a major airline, not as a pilot, but in what I feel is more important to overall airline safety, the System Operations Control Center, where I oversee the flight planning, dispatching, flight following and yes, God forbid, putting into action SAR if needed for all the flights I am responible for. Having said all of that, I need to say that everything I have written on these pages are my own opinions and not that of the airline I work for.

<dd>They're currently tracking any cellphone numbers of victims from relatives and trying to call those numbers and with the help of the operators they will locate the signal. All of this is under one condition, i.e. at least one of the phones must be turned on for them to effectively locate the plane. So far they have only obtained 5 numbers, all of which have been switched off hours before the accident. One relative was shocked after receiving a blank sms from his kin (a victim) almost one day after the incident. But efforts to call the number back was useless and the corresponding operator (Telkomsel) suggested that it was a late sms due to their heavily congested network the previous day (a rare incident that was on the news as well). 58.178.215.97 10:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Previously there was a report of two distress signals, but the current news said that the plane did not send any distress signals (see the thread above and the Flight Chronology section). However, if you read the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_Locator_Transmitter_1546.html" title="Emergency Locator Transmitter">Emergency Locator Transmitter</a> article, it is a device which will send distress signal during emergency.

<p>Are you referring to the beacon signals? A plane travelling normally will be seen on radar and is visible to satellites. The articles are very specific in stating no distress signals were received from the aircraft. Kiarasexton 21:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay first of all the "no distress signals" statement means specifically for any means of calling for help from the pilots. We should reword it. The article that said no distress signals were called also indicated that there is ELT going on. And this <a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=8143&amp;size=A" class="external text" title="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=8143&amp;size=A" rel="nofollow">article</a> which is the translation of the Indonesian news cited for the ELT part, said that the ELT is switched on automatically when a plane crashes. 58.178.215.97 06:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Technical I cannot be sure but i have my doubts that there are no tools to locate the wreckage. Anyhow after the first days of search US and singapore admittedly involved with their more modern search methods. (satelites, infrared registering planes). And then there is the ongoing news of transmissions that are registered (those would be really easy to locate). Since it apparently doesn't exist i suggest a one button distress signal is installed in the cockpit of airliners.(yes i know blackboxes are standard material )</p>
<p>I have one more technical remark. I have been looking into plaincrashes a bit recently, mostly because they are so liable for being declared acts of terrorism, and already a while ago i noticed it is definetly 737's crashing the most. So i actually think these things have outlived their age(45k flight hours?23 years?), or even that they are rigged to explode, the recent african report suggested that, when a mullah or some such died, survivors had noticed a huge explosion inside but no evidence was ever found of sabotage. Also had not the public noticed, the suggestion was: the survivors would have disappeared, rather shortly after them getting on a TVnews, officials tried to declare there were no (such) survivors. Since this is a 737 too it caught my interesse. I am quitte sure were i an islamic exploiter of airlines i wouldn't use usian planes. The only way to check that is to regard the passenger lists of recent 737s crashing from a completely different point of view.212.187.41.61 18:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the 737 is the most popular aircraft type in airline service at the moment, with over 5,000 delivered, it is only natural that it should be involved in a greater percentage of accidents than other aircraft types. Add into this the fact that the majority of accidents occur in the take-off/departure and approach/landing phases of flight, and this skews the numbers even more, given that the 737 is a short range airliner which will typically fly many more flight sectors in a day than a longer range aircraft. Take a look at <a href="http://www.airdisaster.com/statistics/" class="external free" title="http://www.airdisaster.com/statistics/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airdisaster.com/statistics/</a> - it is from data up to the end of 2004, and I think it demonstrates that the 737 is not experiencing accidents at a greater rate than other aircraft types.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Age shouldn't necessarily be an issue either - a 20+ year old aircraft should be perfectly safe, provided it is being maintained to the appropriate standard. As for suggestions that 737s are rigged to explode, or being specifically targetted as an aircraft type by terrorists, I think they are highly unlikely... The simplest explanation is that the 737 is a very popular aircraft type, in use on a lot of operations where it will make several flights every day, and therefore is going to make up a greater percentage of accidents than a less popular and less well utilised aircraft type. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Moss_9678.html" title="User:Nick Moss">Nick Moss</a> 21:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not a viewer of the show myself. The point is that some discussion has been made concerning alien involvment with the plane's "removal," for lack of a better term. I sought to include a one line mention under the sub-category of "Speculations and predictions." --AWF

<li>Okay, sorry if anything I said offended you but in that case you can wait for users to comment on your argument here. But with your <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.54.97.193.html" title="User talk:65.54.97.193">reputation as a vandal</a>, how can one trust you? 211.26.91.118 18:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My "reputation as a vandal?" Sorry to disappoint, but only the subject concerning myself is the one surrounding this airline. I hold a dynamic IP, meaning it changes virtually every time I sign online, and I hold no user name for this site. In other words, those complaints are against <i>different</i> users. --AWF
<ul>
<li>Sounds reasonable, doesn't it chime in with Bermuda triangle style theories. Although it probably fell into the sea.
<ul>
<li>I must say, I'm in favour of removing the "Speculations and predictions" section altogether, we shouldn't be repeating speculation, and anything useful could be easily merged into another section.

<dd>the 737 isnt exactly a big plane compared to other jet liners.... ill raise the question again, what about a center fuel tank explosion (ie TWA 800) or a large bomb? unless this was the work of Zuess , i dont think that a lightning strike would have done the kind of damage do essentially "dissappear" the plane.... after all, all we have found is a few parts and a stabilizer... something wen horribly wrong here.. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESniperSarge_4608.html" title="User:SniperSarge">SniperSarge</a> 17:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with such theories is, it doesn't explain the fishermen's sightings of a low-flying, unstable aircraft (although I apreciate the locals haven't exactly been reliable so far). I'm willing to bet those unidentified objects <i>are</i> part of the plane - if not, then I'm prepared to count the explosion theory back in (as well as foul play, etc). Must agree it couldn't have been a lighting strike, though. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 17:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article incorrectly describes the role of this new team. The new team is a commission tasked to evaluate the safety and security of Indonesia's transportation infrastructure as a whole. It will not investigate individual accidents, nor will its scope be limited to aviation.</p>
<p>The Indonesian counterpart to the NTSB is the Komisi Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT), or in English the National Transportation Safety Commission (NTSC) which is part of Departemen Perhubugan (Ministry of Communications.) KNKT is the legal entity recognized to investigate aircraft accidents in accordance to International Civil Aviation Organization rules.</p>

<p>According to a yahoo report i saw last nite, they claim there that both were found.</p>
<p>any updates on cause of loss?</p>

<dd>Yeah, actually, there's a pretty strong theorie it was caused by poor maintenance.

<dd>Update: The server is up, but right now I'm in a hurry. Could someone check it out and...? The link provided by Blood Red Sandman does not seem to link to an article needed here, but it's probably no problem finding the right one.

<dd>Oh, great bloody Hell. The Jakarta Post has a nasty habit of linking different articles under the same hyperlink in quick succesion. As for how I found it, in a Google News search.
