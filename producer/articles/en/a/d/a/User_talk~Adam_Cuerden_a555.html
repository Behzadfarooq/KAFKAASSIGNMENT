<p>Oops. Sorry, thanks for fixing that.

<li>I don't think all the "major" templates have an icon, nor am I convinced this is a "major" template. My point is that this template shouldn't be another end run around guidelines. We have too many ways as it is for people to indicate that "this is not really a guideline since I don't like it". The question mark adds to that. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 07:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I added several links to a recent, detailed Mike Leigh interview about G&amp;S. Would you please fix the footnotes so that the repeated reference has the special "already referred to" style? Also, someone put in some info about Gilbert's pets in support of our prev. statement that his marriage was not loveless. I fooled around with the statement some but basically left it in. See what you think--you may wish to move part of it, or whatever you want. It is true that Gilbert and Lady Gilbert had a veritable zoo and loved animals, but that may not be relevant to the quality of their marriage. Hope you're doing well. -- <a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 01:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, can you please copy over some of the photos from the Italian G&amp;S article and Sullivan article to the English articles? There are great pictures of the young Sullivan (about 1860?) and of a mature Gilbert in his library. I couldn't figure out how to do it. I'm sure the copyright issues were considered when the articles were made FAs in the Italian WP. If not, they're either PD or fair use. -- <a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 20:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The AFD is an unsigned mess, hardly editors in good standing. However, he looks (barely) notable enough for an article, in that he's an author who's made it onto Amazon.

<p>Adam, if you can't answer my questions then I guess I shall have to ask someone else. The article on NS is bogus and is being protected falsely against good correction.

<p>Hi. Were you referring to the 'diffs' rather than the actual results shown to users? Here's a diff which looks like the software <b>might</b> add a paragraph break. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Sarfati&amp;diff=116184445&amp;oldid=116183930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Sarfati&amp;diff=116184445&amp;oldid=116183930" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</p>
<p>But unless it's in the middle of a "colon-indented" paragraph, no CR will be seen by our readers. You'll notice that in this message to you, I put a CR after each sentence, but <b>you</b> only see 2 paragraphs. A carriage return after a ref makes it easier for editors to distinguish the reference from the regular text. Maybe there's a guideline on this. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 12:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, negative reviews belong to References and text from them is being used "as is", but positive ones go to External links, and it is not allowed to depict those in the main text.

<p>Nice fix on the lead. I knew one of my fellow editors would come up with a graceful solution.</p>
<p>One question: do you think its necessary to say "early gene-swapping prokaryotic organisms" or could we replace "prokaryotic" with "single-celled"? Just in the interest of keeping "big words" out of the lead... --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveRickert_de95.html" title="User:EveRickert">EveRickert</a> 16:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, not all single-celled organisms are Prokaryotes, but all Prokaryotes are single-celled, so it would still be accurate if we just say single-celled. And we can't assume that someone reading the lead knows what "prokaryotic organisms" are. I'll give the edit a try and see how long it lasts...--<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveRickert_de95.html" title="User:EveRickert">EveRickert</a> 17:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oops! Edit conflict. Well, do with it what you will, and feel free to RV my change. But I did like the last sentence of your old version, "All organisms can be traced back by numerous speciation events to a common ancestor, or at least a common ancestral gene pool of early gene-swapping prokaryotic organisms (see common descent)," as a way of covering Valich's concerns while still remaining true to the references. It would be nice if you could keep that bit--though I think that giant list of refs in there can be pruned, especially since only one or two of them pertain directly to the sentence itself.--<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveRickert_de95.html" title="User:EveRickert">EveRickert</a> 17:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eve, There were five references that puportedly supported a statement that "all" species originated from a LUC, and this is incorrect. Then I edited it by stating: "While most species do have a common ancestor, the current view is that there never was a single last common ancestor because of the tremendous amount of gene transfer." I supported this with five citations, yet you inserted a tag for "citations needed," thus illiciting even more? Why? As I told Adam, the majority of journal articles and books are not available for everyone to view for free online. You can view parts of the journal references that I cited, and typed in by hand, on my home page.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Valich" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Valich" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] I also agree that there were far too many references, but the way the article is worded right now is even more confusing and inaccurate than the corrections that I had added. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValich_64b9.html" title="User:Valich">Valich</a> 07:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made a small change. I know of no one that uses the term "universal genetic code" because we have no proof that the genetic code, as we know it on Earth, is universal. There are many alternative plausible possibilities to the current genetic code, and Watson and Crick tried a host of others before finally stumbling on the correct 4-base, 3-code word, double-helix that pertains to life on Earth. Still, those other numerous genetic code possibilities have not been forsaken, because they may pertain to life elsewhere. Watson and Crick's trials-and-errors that led up to the correct one is a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>You wrote: "Various processes can bring genes from species back together long after those species diverged." I don't know what you are trying to say here? If I am uncertain, then? Are you eluding to HGT? If so, it's not stated in the correct context. Long after two species diverge, then they become unique species that can no longer interbreed: bring back their genes together. This is one definition of what constitutes a species. Whatever it is, you're disembodying the genes from the organism. Better use the phrase: "different genetic composition," or "species with a different genome sequence." But again, I don't know what you want to explain here.<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValich_64b9.html" title="User:Valich">Valich</a> 07:20, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are using an extremely out-dated term. Children in Junior High School, and even Elementary School today learn about genetics, and I have even have heard of them teaching PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) techniques in High School. Give the up-and-coming younger generation some credit. The word "Universal Genetic Code" is an old-fashioned name for the standard genetic code. It is no longer ever used. It was once thought that there existed just one, universal genetic code used by all living organisms. However, beginning in 1979, numerous non standard genetic codes have been discovered. Thus there is no universal genetic code and the phrase needs be avoided. I will chasnge this to genetic code and right an article about the universal code that states what I have written here. Don't use this term! It is clear that you must not be familiar with the pronciple behind biological, chemical evolution, else you would not be using this term. Whoever write the evolution article should know how it works. Please.</dd>

<dd>"Back in the early 1970s, evolutionary biologists did think that a given piece of DNA specified the same protein subunit in every living thing, and that the genetic code was thus universal," explains biologist Jonathan Wells, another Discovery Institute Senior Fellow. "This was unlikely to have happened by chance, so it was interpreted as evidence that every organism had inherited its genetic code from a single common ancestor. In 1979, however, exceptions to the code were found in mitochondria, the tiny energy factories inside cells. Biologists subsequently found exceptions in bacteria and in the nuclei of algae and single-celled animals. It is now clear that the genetic code is not the same in all living things, and that it does not provide 'powerful evidence' that all living things 'evolved on a single tree of life,'" concludes Dr. Wells, who holds a Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology from the University of California at Berkeley. He is author of the new book Icons of Evolution. A current listing of exceptions to the genetic code can be found at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c</a>.

It has also been suggested that due to lateral gene transfer, a tree may not be the best representation of the genetic relationships of all organisms." This citation should be added underneath the tree in the taxo box, as it was created and drawn along with it, and the alternative "Ring of Life" diagram should be added somewhere as well. Why do you consistently - chronically - refuse to even mention the notion about horizontal gene transfer, the up-to-date "Ring of Life" representation, and the clearly evident fact that phylogenetic trees cannot, nor ever will be rooted. The farther back you go in the tree, the simpler the species, the simpler the genome, the more lateral gene transfer occurred, to the point till where life began, and realize that there was never any LUCA.</dd>

This is 100% biased editing by you and it just cant go on. You claimed the article needed sources for verification, now you're entering what YOU understand (the way you want it). And just to answer your ridiculous editing (because it is), he is saying that Antibiotics should not be abused, and that they should not be the first means of treating an infection. Same goes for cancer and chemotherapy, he does NOT claim homeopathy can cure all cancer cases (he says "some cases", but those cases where the homeopathic remedy picture is "clear" as we call it (ie the totallity of the symptoms of the patient, clearly point to ONE homeopathic remedy, or if it is his 'constitutional' remedy).

<p>User:ElderStatesman is clearly a sock puppet of Everwill, his contribution history matches Everwills exactly. <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> says "<i>Do not use multiple accounts to circumvent a block.</i>" It also says "<i>Accounts operating in violation of this policy should be blocked indefinitely; the main account may be blocked at the discretion of any administrator.</i>" ElderStatesman is clearly evading a community ban and per <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> is to be blocked for circumventing a ban. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 04:06, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, a fellow Scot, a fellow scientist and a fellow Admin, I feel like I know you already! I'm writing to ask for some expert advice on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rare_Earth_hypothesis#Evolutionary_pumps|this" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rare_Earth_hypothesis#Evolutionary_pumps|this" rel="nofollow">interesting theory</a> within an article up for GA review. I've moved part of the article onto the talk page, as this doesn't match what I understand by the theory of punctuated equilibrium. Is this a real idea described in jumbled prose or simply nonsense? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 05:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>why did you delete the cited one paragraph quotation on "Parerga and Paralipomena"&#160;?</p>
<p>I was planning to expand the article, and the ONE PARAGRAPH quote was a place-holder.</p>
<p>Now I have to go and find it again, and type it out again.</p>
<p>There is no copyright violation when the SINGLE PARAGRAPH is CITED correctly, otherwise you had better delete the entire wikipedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Metadigital (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMetadigital_1b07.html" title="User talk:Metadigital">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Metadigital_5712.html" title="Special:Contributions/Metadigital">contribs</a>) 19:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
