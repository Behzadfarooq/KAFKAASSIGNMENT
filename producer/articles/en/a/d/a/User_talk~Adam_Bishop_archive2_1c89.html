<p>Yeah, people like Bertrand Russell are a bit tough. I think the points in favor of the policy Lord Emsworth and Adam Carr have been tirelessly pushing for are that a) it provides a uniform policy, so that we always know where articles on peers are to go; and b) except in a very small number of cases, it doesn't result in the person going to an article where they're unrecognizable. For instance, I think it'd be fairly clear to anyone that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell%2C_3rd_Earl_Russell_e5de.html" title="Bertrand Russell, 3rd Earl Russell">Bertrand Russell, 3rd Earl Russell</a> is the same as the philosopher, especially when <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> redirects there. As Lord Emsworth has pointed out, the problem with the commonly used, unambiguous name rule is that the most commonly used name for peers frequently isn't unambiguous (Lord Nelson, Lord Kitchener, all those Canadian Governors-General you were talking about), while the <i>simplest</i> unambiguous name (their proper name) frequently isn't commonly used. And then there's the issue of people who were "commonly" called different things over the course of a career. Given all the intricacy of it, I think setting a simple policy of using the highest peerage title would eliminate all the judgment calls that lead to complete inconsistency in these articles and make for a more professional set-up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 21:48, 10 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam,</p>
<p>I thank you very much for keeping an open mind about the topic of peers.</p>
<p>In general, one may assume that there are three ways of entitling a biographical article on a peer. I am going to use the example of "Lord Nelson" for the purpose of discussion. Now, we could use the following titles: <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Nelson_31ea.html" title="Lord Nelson">Lord Nelson</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson_b37a.html" title="Horatio Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, or <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson_5aea.html" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson</a>. The first form is entirely ambiguous. The question arises whether one is speaking about Horatio Nelson, or about his brother, William, the first Earl Nelson of Trafalgar. The second format could be used, but the problem is that few would recognize the title. The third is definitely the most useful format. Firstly, it includes the individual's birth name: Horatio Nelson. Secondly, it points out that he was a peer, and gives a clue to his identity as Lord Nelson. Finally, it is complete and accurate.</p>
<p>I am sure that people will argue that, for instance, such "antiquated appendages" are not necessary in cases such as that of Bertrand Russell. But the problem is that for a great portion of his lifetime, Russell was the Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, whether he used such a title or not. I think that the point is that we should think about what is more technically appropriate, not what is merely more common.</p>
<p>It is arguable that the addition of "3rd Earl Russell" will not cause further confusion to Bertrand Russell's article's title. It will, rather, only be more informative. There is, however, such a thing as being too informative. In such cases, the article's title becomes wholly clumsy and messy. See, for example, the present Duke of Hamilton and Brandon. We don't have: [[Angus Alan Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton, 12th Duke of Brandon, 15th Marquess of Douglas, 15th Marquess of Clydesdale, 15th Earl of Angus, 15th Lord Abernathy and Jedburgh Forest, 15th Lord Polmont, 15th Lord Machansyre, 15th Lord Aven and Innerdale, 12th Baron Dutton]], which would be rather exhausting and crude. Simply, rather, we would have <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_Alan_Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton%2C_15th_Duke_of_Hamilton_532a.html" title="Angus Alan Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton">Angus Alan Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton</a>, or, better yet, just <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_Douglas-Hamilton%2C_15th_Duke_of_Hamilton_2cf0.html" title="Angus Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton">Angus Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton</a>, applying the simple rule that the highest title be used. Thus, you can be rest assured that the matter will not be carried so far as to render article titles extremely awkward. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a></p>

<p>Adam, thanks for fixing the link to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summa_Theologica_b65d.html" title="Summa Theologica">Summa Theologica</a> in <a href="../../../1/2/7/1273.html" title="1273">1273</a>...are you sure about that date? I couldn't find anything in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> or the Summa's article to indicate 1273 for the date (the listing was there before I modified). I almost made the change you did, but then I wondered if this was some other work of Thomas's I didn't know. I'm assuming you're right, in which case thank you, but I'm wondering where you found the info?

<p>Hey, thanks alot for the advice. I have had a couple minor slip ups over the naming conventions of saints and popes and whatnot in the last couple days, and it makes me worry a bit just how many duplicate articles w subtley different names there are....

<p>Adam, Muriel tells me you a Latin scholar, so here is a question: If "Archidioecesis Melburnensis" is Latin for Archdiocese of Melbourne, what would the nominative form be - Melburnium? Melburnia? Should this be described as Modern Latin, pseudo-Latin or what? Would you have any idea why the "o" has been omitted in creating the Latin form? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 22:57, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A great list! I started comparing against OCD, added more people up to the end of "An". Interesting how many of the articles exist already, also interesting that OCD is missing many rulers. It occurs to me that a separate list for names from mythology, eponyms, etc, would be handy. Also, there are a handful of Greek speakers/writers of late antiquity that would be homeless otherwise, what think you of stretching scope to 500-600 AD? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 05:24, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing I forgot to mention; lately I've been leaning towards de-linking terms in the text annotating an article's entry, on the theory that the article will connect to everything, and it keeps the list from pointlessly appearing in the "links here" of every general article. Not critical either way, but something to consider. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 05:35, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>And something else - how did you make the dashes? I just did hyphens, at some point it should get a mass query-replace to consistentify. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 05:52, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the interest of forestalling messy edit conflicts, do you want to coordinate on list addition somehow? Alternate days, inuse notes,&#160;?? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 17:23, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>His nationality is as bad an issue as what to call the Oder, etc. Since Copernicus is actually pretty important, I've appointed myself guardian of real information about him.

<p>You asked the point of 'unpopulated professions', then signed your comment <i>Hypnoarchaeastrographologer</i>. Looks like you made my point for me. It's called 'having fun', a concept that seems to be increasingly divorced from being a Wikipedian the longer I spend with Wiki. That's very unfortunate; since we do this only for the personal satisfaction it brings, we should not lose the ability to laugh in the process. I knew this article would end up on VfD, and would get there in roughly the time it did. I was hoping it would provoke a chuckle or two before the delete vote was cast. It seems, however, that those who deem things 'patent nonsense' do so with pursed lips and furrowed brow. I have no wish to perpetrate hoaxes; if an article is there only to amuse, then it should clearly be identifiable as such. However, it should not be the trigger for invective either. Should I be allowed to post such material? I think so. I've contributed thousands upon thousands of words of text on a broad variety of topics since I first discovered Wiki, I've edited a large number of existing articles, and I hope to keep doing so (though I'm feeling a little discouraged today). <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 20:55, 2004 Mar 14 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, I think the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Greece_6a55.html" title="History of Greece">History of Greece</a> series is now in reasonable shape, don't you?

I don't know much about what, if anything, happened in Greece in this period. I doubt it is worth a separate article, but perhaps you could add some material to either the Hellenistic or the Byzantine article?</p>

<p>Good article. I'm glad someone else has written an article concerning Roman coins besides myself. I have a couple of questions about some of the details. "...replacing the gold aureus with the solidus", this coin is different from the coin introduced by Constantine (I've added some clarification to the article). "...a copper denarius worth two silver denarii, and a bronze nummus worth five denarii", how could a copper coin be worth two silver coins? I'm not sure of the specific coins which are being referred to, maybe the large silvered follis and its fractions? I don't have many good sources at hand (or time) at the moment. Maybe you could check your sources when you get a chance. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 22:41, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It <i>is</i> all really confusing. Take the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argenteus.html" title="Argenteus">argenteus</a> for example. In numismatics it refers to a specific denomination, however in ancient literature it is simply short for "argenteus nummus" (silver coin), which could refer to any silver coin. In the ever helpful <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Augusta_13dd.html" title="Historia Augusta">Historia Augusta</a> it is even used to refer to several different fictious coins. I may look into the specifics of the edict, eventually, if no one else does. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 23:05, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I ask why you reverted the anon on Muhammad? I thought his edits were very good (a number of typos in en &amp; ar). If it was, as I suspect, just the Makkah/Mecca issue, then I think you're doing his other changes a disserve. If "Makkah" was the problem, let me know and as a compromise I'll revert to his version and change them all to "Mecca". <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> 19:31, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, thanks for the clarification. I thought the article was in UK spelling but, on closer inspection, it's actually a Right Mess.

<p>Just to save time and confusion in the future, I've been trying to move television station articles for independent stations from their brand name to their callsign. Unbeknownst to me until just now, I've been doing it the wrong way, and as I'm not an admin, I can't move them properly myself. If it's not too much trouble, could I submit a list of brand name pages along with their callsign where they should be that you could move?

<p>Hi Adam, in the List of Byzantine Emperors talk page, you say this:</p>
<p>"I didn't really think of the consequences of this at the time, but when I divided the list into dynasties, I just made up "proto-Comnenid." They don't really belong to any dynasty, but there were Comnenids in it and they sort of ruled in a similar way to the actual Comnenids. But now that has been copied into other languages, and it is used on other websites that use Wikipedia information...so should we just leave it, or change it because it is unlikely to appear that way in a true scholarly publication."</p>
<p>I replied there but I'm reposting here becuase you wrote that a while ago and I'm not sure if you're still watching. What do you think of taking emperors who fall under the dynastic headings but who don't have even a tenuous relationship to them (many emperors were in-laws of their predecessors rather than blood relations) and making them indented, italicized, or otherwise marked out? Or, stretching the idea somewhat, since Byzantine emperors tended to succeed and overthow each other in dramatic and enertaining ways, what about adding a one-sentence explanation after each emperor explaining how he was (or was not) related to the previous emperor (i.e., "Son of Constantine IV", "Deposed Justinian II")? It's a project I'd be willing to undertake but since you have contributed a lot to this page I wondered if you thought it would make things too cluttered. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a>, 03:45 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! In Christianity it is common to refer to some people as "Saint...". It is not just Catholic, and it is found even in the New Testament (e.g. Philippians 4:21). Someone has moved <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a> to <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Peter_cc34.html" title="Apostle Peter">Apostle Peter</a>, and I would like to see the original more standard name restored. Both names have the potential to be POV; some people would see Peter not even as an apostle but as a public nuisance or a propagandist. Alas, someone had to fix the redirect, so now "Saint Peter" has a history of its own. Can you intervene? Thanks for your help. I guess I should acknowledge that the user <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERantaro_5e5d.html" title="User:Rantaro">User:Rantaro</a> (who may be <a href="../../../k/2E/m/User%7EK.M._0b08.html" title="User:K.M.">User:K.M.</a>) and I are at odds in the entry for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_cross.html" title="Christian cross">Christian cross</a>, but I think I can safely say that in this matter I am acting out of a concern for what is actually true.

<p>Glad you found Hugh Kennedy useful. I tried to help by going through your list and noting those castles which weren't crusader....although this is from memory only. As to having a single article...good idea, as some are little more than single towers. Some, however, merit their own article. There are a lot of obscure castles in the Nusariyah Mountains in Syria and Ross Burns: Monuments of Syria is a good place to start on these. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Ball_5435.html" title="User:John Ball">John Ball</a></p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments, and your indulgence.</p>
<p>I do understand the standpoint of yourself and RickK, this being the English Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The precedent exists throughout the Wikipedia when dealing with foreign articles that the local names, translations etc are used, so it is not something I am imposing as my will.</p>
<p>The crusader states are an interesting case in this respect because though based in the greco-turkish area, they were latin states with western European rulers (in the case of Achaea, French)</p>
<p>There is inconsistency in the way English-speakers by nature use foreign names, and the case in the list of Achaea is a case in point, where William is used in preference to 'Guillaume', but 'Jacques' is used in preference to 'James'.</p>
<p>I know it looks like duplication, but I would hope that the additions can be seen to go beyond mere repetition in at least part of the list, if only slightly.</p>
<p>Whether this stands up to scrutiny however is for the reader and those who wish to amend the text to decide.</p>
<p>Thanks again --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnArmagh_d26a.html" title="User:JohnArmagh">JohnArmagh</a> 04:39, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
