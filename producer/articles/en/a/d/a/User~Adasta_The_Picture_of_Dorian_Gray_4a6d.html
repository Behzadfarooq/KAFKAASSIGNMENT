<p><b>The Picture of Dorian Gray</b> is the only novel to be published by <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, and was first published as the lead story in <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lippincott%27s_Monthly_Magazine_df3d.html" title="Lippincott's Monthly Magazine">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</a> on 20 June 1890.<sup id="_ref-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> later revised this edition, making several alterations, and adding new chapters; the amended version was published by Ward, Lock, and Company in April 1981.<sup id="_ref-Publish_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Publish" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, who is the subject of a <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a> by the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a> Basil Hallward. Dorian is selected for his remarkable physical <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a>, and Basil becomes somewhat <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infatuation.html" title="Infatuation">infatuated</a> with Dorian, believing that his <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> is responsible for a new mode of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a>. Talking in Basil's garden, Dorian meets and speaks with Lord Henry Wootton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new kind of <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonism.html" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, Lord Henry suggests that the only thing worth pursuing in life is <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a>, and the fulfillment of the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senses.html" title="Senses">senses</a>. Upon realising that one day his <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> will fade, Dorian cries out, wishing that the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portrait.html" title="Portrait">portrait</a> Basil has painted of him would age rather than himself. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, plunging him into more and more debaucherous acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>, each <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> being displayed as a new sign of ageing on the portrait.</p>
<p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is considered a work of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_horror.html" title="Gothic horror">gothic horror</a> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a> with a strong <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faust.html" title="Faust">Faustian</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_9a90.html#Themes" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">theme</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gothic_Horror_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gothic_Horror" title="">[3]</a></sup> It also deals with the artistic movement of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decadents.html" title="Decadents">decadents</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a>, both of which caused some <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_9a90.html#Criticism" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">controversy</a> when the book was first published.

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The novel begins with <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Henry_Wotton_d2be.html" title="Lord Henry Wotton">Lord Henry Wotton</a> observing the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Hallward_e3f9.html" title="Basil Hallward">Basil Hallward</a> painting the portrait of a handsome young man named <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorian_Gray_1a8b.html" title="Dorian Gray">Dorian Gray</a>. When Dorian arrives at the London Studio he meets Lord Henry Wotton. Wotton's low musical voice enchants the lad as he stands upon a little dais in the afternoon sunlight. The constant flick and dash of the artist's brush melt away, as Lord Henry's doctrine of self-development corrupts Dorian's innocence. <i>"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it [..]"</i> murmurs Lord Henry. <i>"Resist it and the soul grows sick with longing."</i></p>
<p>Under the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian begins an exploration of his senses. He starts by discovering a brilliant <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actress.html" title="Actress">actress</a>, Sibyl Vane, who performs <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> in a dingy theatre, but although the theatre is a wretched hole of a place, her acting outshines it all. Dorian approaches her, and very soon, proposes <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>. Sibyl, who knows only his Christian name, and refers to him only as "Prince Charming", rushes home to tell her skeptical mother and brother. Her protective brother, James, tells her that if Prince Charming ever harms her, he shall find and shoot him like a dog!</p>
<p>Dorian then invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>. Sibyl, whose only previous knowledge of love was through the love of theatre, suddenly loses her acting abilities through the experience of true love with Dorian, and performs very badly. Dorian rejects her, cruelly saying that her beauty was in her art, and if she could no longer act, he was no longer interested in her. Once he returns home, Dorian notices that Basil's portrait of him has changed. There is a touch of cruelty in the mouth. After a close examination of the painting Dorian realises that his mad wish has come true - the portrait is ageing and will bear his sins while his own outward appearance remains unchanged. He decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but Lord Henry arrives in the morning to say that Sibyl has killed herself by swallowing <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussic_acid.html" title="Prussic acid">prussic acid</a>.</p>
<p>Dorian accepts his fate. Over the next eighteen years he experiments with every vice forbidden to man, mostly under the influence of a "poisonous" French novel, a present from Lord Henry. Wilde never reveals the title but his inspiration was likely drawn from <a href="../../../j/o/r/Joris-Karl_Huysmans_73f1.html" title="Joris-Karl Huysmans">Joris-Karl Huysmans</a>'s <i><a href="../../../%C3%A0/_/r/%C3%80_rebours.html" title="À rebours">À rebours</a></i> (<i>Against Nature</i>).</p>
<p>One rainy night, before he leaves for Paris, Basil arrives to question Dorian about the dreadful rumours of his indulgences. Dorian does not deny the debauchery, and endeavours to show Basil his soul. He takes Basil to the portrait, now hidden in the old nursery, which is revealed to have become monstrously ugly under Dorian's sins. In a sudden rage of anger, Dorian blames the artist for his fate, and stabs him to death. He then blackmails an old friend into destroying the body.</p>
<p>Dorian seeks escape from the deed he has done in an <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a> den. After being rejected by the proprietor, who calls him by the name "Prince Charming", he leaves. Sibyl Vane's brother,coincidentally in the same room, has been searching for someone named "Prince Charming" for 18 years. He follows Dorian out and attempts to shoot him; but he is deceived when Dorian asks to be thrust under the lamplight, and in the dripping mist tells James Vane that he would have been too young to have been involved with his sister 18 years ago—his appearance has not changed since. The sailor goes back inside the opium den, where the woman tells him that Dorian has not aged for the past eighteen years.</p>
<p>Whilst at dinner at Selby Royal, Dorian's country estate, Dorian sees Sibyl Vane's brother stalking the grounds and fears for his life. However, during a game-shooting party the next day James is accidentally shot and killed by one of the hunters.</p>
<p>After returning to London, Dorian informs Lord Henry that he will be good from now on, and has started by not breaking the heart of his latest innocent conquest, a vicar's daughter in a country town. At his apartment, he wonders if the portrait would have begun to change back, losing its sinful appearance, now that he has changed his ways. He unveils the portrait to only find that it has become worse: in his eyes were a look of cunning, and his face took on the subtle air of a hypocrite. Seeing this he begins to question the motives behind his act, whether it was merely vanity, curiosity, or seeking new emotional excess. Another sign appears in the portrait, the stain of blood that appeared with Hallward's murder grows brighter and spreads. He considers momentarily what this could mean, what act would be required to redeem him of this mark. Deciding that only a full confession would absolve him, but lacking any guilt and fearing the consequences, he decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience. In a fit of rage, he picks up the knife that killed Basil Hallward, and plunges it into the painting. Hearing his cry from inside the locked room, his servants send for the police, who find a bloated, ugly old man with a knife in his heart, and the portrait of Dorian, as beautiful as he was eighteen years ago.</p>

<p>In a letter, <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> stated that the main characters of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> are in different ways reflections of himself: "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps." <sup id="_ref-The_Modern_Library_Gray_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Modern_Library_Gray" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<li><b>Dorian Gray</b> - an extremely handsome young man who becomes enthralled with Lord Henry's idea of a new <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonism.html" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>. He begins to indulge in every kind of pleasure, whether moral or immoral.</li>
<li><b>Basil Hallward</b> - an artist who becomes <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infatuation.html" title="Infatuation">infatuated</a> with Dorian's beauty.

<p>The preface to <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was added, along with other amendments, after the edition published in Lippincott's received criticism. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> used it to address these criticisms and defend the novel's reputation.<sup id="_ref-Preface_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Preface" title="">[7]</a></sup> It consists of a collection of statements about the role of the artist, art itself, and the value of beauty, and serves as an idicator of the way in which <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> intends the novel to be read.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal
<p>the artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.</p>
<p>The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.</p>
<p>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.</p>
<p>All art is quite useless.</p>

<p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> began initally as a short novel submitted to <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lippincott%27s_Monthly_Magazine_df3d.html" title="Lippincott's Monthly Magazine">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</a>. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, a proprietor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit short novels for the magazine. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> submitted the first version of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, which was published on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">20 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> in the July edition of <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lippincott%27s_Monthly_Magazine_df3d.html" title="Lippincott's Monthly Magazine">Lippencott's</a>. There was a delay in getting Wilde's work to press whilst numerous changes were made to the manuscripts of the novel (some of which survive to this day). Some of these changes were made at Wilde's instigation, and some at Stoddart's. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> removed all references to the fictitious book "Le Secret de Raoul", and to its fictitious author, Catulle Sarrazin. The book and its author are still referred to in the published versions of the novel, but are unnamed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> also attempted to moderate some of the more <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoerotic.html" title="Homoerotic">homoerotic</a> instances in the book, or instances whereby the intentions of the characters' may be misconstrued. In the 1890 edition, Basil tells Henry how he "worships" Dorian, and begs him not to "take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me. The focus for Basil in the 1890 edition seems to be more towards love, whereas the Basil of the he 1891 edition cares more for his art, saying "the one person who gives my art whatever charm it posses: my life as an artist depends on him." The book was also extended greatly: the original thirteen chapters became twenty, and the final chapter was divided into two. The additions involved the "fleshing out of Dorian as a charater" and also provided details about his ancestry, which helped to make his "psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing."<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_ANoteOnTheText_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_ANoteOnTheText" title="">[8]</a></sup>The character of James Vane was also introduced, which helped to elaborate upon Sibyl Vane's character and background; moreover, the addition of the character helped to emphasises and foreshadow Dorian's selfish ways, as James forsees Dorian's character, and guesses upon his future dishonourable actions. Another especially notable change made for the revised edition is that whereas events in the latter half of the novel were previously specified as taking place around Dorian Gray's 32nd birthday, on 7 November; they were now specified as taking place around Dorian Gray's 38th birthday, on 9 November, thereby extending the period of time over which the story occurs.</p>
<p>Overall, cricital opinion of the book was poor, with the book gaining "certain notoriety for being 'mawkish and nauseous,' 'unclean,' 'effeminate,' and 'contaminating.'"<sup id="_ref-The_Modern_Library_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Modern_Library" title="">[9]</a></sup> This had much to do with the novel's <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoerotic.html" title="Homoerotic">homoerotic</a> overtones, which caused something of a sensation amongst Victorian critics when first published. A large portion of the criticism was levelled at Wilde's preceived <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonism.html" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, and how that distorted views of conventional morality. The Daily Chronicle of 30 June 1890 suggests that Wilde's novel contains "one element...which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it." Although the element is not named explicity, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoeroticism.html" title="Homoeroticism">homoeroticism</a> of the novel, especially of the first edition, seems the likely subject. The Scots Observer of 5 July 1980 asks why Wilde must "go grubbing in muck-heaps?” Wilde responded to such criticisms by curtailing some of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoerotic.html" title="Homoerotic">homoerotic</a> tendancies, and by adding six chapters to the book in an effort to add background.<sup id="_ref-Additon_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Additon" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Aestheticism is a strong theme in <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, and is tied in with the concept of the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_life.html" title="Double life">double life</a>. Although Dorian is <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonist.html" title="Hedonist">hedonistic</a>, when Basil accuses him of making Lord Henry's sister's name a "by-word", Dorian replies "Take care, Basil. You go too far"<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_XII_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_Chapter_XII" title="">[11]</a></sup> suggests that Dorian still cares about his outward image and standing within <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_morality.html" title="Victorian morality">Victorian</a> society. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> highlights Dorian's pleasure of living a double life, describing how Dorian returns home sometimes to look at his portrait, and, when looking at the disfigurement of the portrait, "[grows] more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul."<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_XI_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_Chapter_XI" title="">[12]</a></sup> Not only does Dorian enjoy this sensation in private, but he also feels "keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life" when attending a society gathering just 24 hours after committing a murder.</p>
<p>This duplicity and indulgence is most evident in Dorian's visits to the opium dens of London. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> conflates the images of the upper class and lower class by having the supposedly upright Dorian visit the outcast districts of London. Lord Henry asserts that "Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders...I should fancy that crime was to them what art is tu us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations", which suggests that Dorian is both the crimical and the aesthethe combined in one man. This is perhaps linked to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Louis_Stevenson_1096.html" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde_3fd8.html" title="Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>, which <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> admired.<sup id="_ref-Penguin_Intro_pg_xii_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penguin_Intro_pg_xii" title="">[13]</a></sup> The division that was witnessed in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, although extreme, is evident in Dorian Gray, who attempts to contain the two divergent parts of his personality.</p>

<p><a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> himself stated that "in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust." As in <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faust.html" title="Faust">Faust</a>, a temptation is placed before the lead character Dorian, the potential for ageless <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a>; Dorian gives in to this temptation, and indulges in it. Moreover, in both stories, the lead character entices a beautiful woman to love them and kills not only her, but also the woman's brother, who seeks revenge.<sup id="_ref-Faust_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Faust" title="">[14]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> went on to say that the notion behind <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is "old in the history of literature" but was something to which he had "given a new form".<sup id="_ref-Preface_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Preface" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faust.html" title="Faust">Faust</a>, there is no point at which Dorian makes a deal with the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">devil</a>. However, Lord Henry's <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynic.html" title="Cynic">cynical</a> outlook on life, and <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonistic.html" title="Hedonistic">hedonistic</a> nature seems to be in keeping with the idea of the devil's role, that of the temptation of the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure.html" title="Pure">pure</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent.html" title="Innocent">innocent</a>, qualities which Dorian exemplifies at the beginning of the book. Although Lord Henry takes an interest in Dorian, it does not seem that he is aware and calculating about his actions. However, Lord Henry advises Dorian that "the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing""<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_II_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_Chapter_II" title="">[15]</a></sup>; in this sense, Lord Henry acts as the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a>, "leading Dorian into an unholy pact by manipulating his innocence and insecurity."<sup id="_ref-Devil.27s_Advocate_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Devil.27s_Advocate" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The name "Dorian" has connotations of the <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorians.html" title="Dorians">Dorians</a>, an ancient Hellenic tribe. Robert Mighall suggests that this could be <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> hinting at a connection to "Greek love", a euphemism for the homoeroticism that was accepted as everyday in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. Indeed, Dorian is described using the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_field.html" title="Semantic field">semantic field</a> of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Gods_4616.html" title="Greek Gods">Greek Gods</a>, being likened to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adonis.html" title="Adonis">Adonis</a>, a person who looks as if "he were made of ivroy and rose-leaves." However, <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> does not mention any homosexual acts explicity, and descriptions of Dorian's "<a href="../../../s/i/n/Sins.html" title="Sins">sins</a>" are often vague, although there does appear to be an element of homoeorticism in the competition between Lord Henry and Basil, both of whom compete for Dorian's attention. Both of them make comments about Dorian in praise of his good looks and youthful demeanour, Basil going as far to say that "as long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me."<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_I_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_Chapter_I" title="">[17]</a></sup>However, whilst Basil is shunned, Dorian wishes to emulate Lord Henry, which in turn rouses Lord Henry from his "characteristic languor to a desire to influence Dorian, a process that is itself a sublimated expression of homosexuality."<sup id="_ref-glbtq_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-glbtq" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The later corruption of Dorian seems to make what was once a boyish charm become a destructive influence. Basil asks why Dorian's "friendship is so fatal to young men", commenting upon the "shame and sorrow" that the father of one of the disgraced boy's displays. Dorian only destroys these men when he becomes "initmate" with them, suggesting that the friendships between Dorian and the men in question become more than simply <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic.html" title="Platonic">Platonic</a>. The shame associated with these relationships is bipartite: the families of the boys are upset that their sons may have indulged in a homosexual relationship with Dorian Gray, and also feel shame that they have now lost their place in society, their names having been sullied; their loss of status is encapuslated in Basil's questioning of Dorian: speaking of the Duke of Perth, a disgraced friend of Dorian, he asks "what gentleman would associate with him?"<sup id="_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_XII_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DorianGray_Chapter_XII" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a>'s description of Mr. Isaacs, the manager of the theatre in which Sybil performs, has come under criticism. Although a minor character, there are several disparaging references to the manager, especially those related to his ethinicity, such as when Dorian calls him a "hideous Jew" and "a monster".<sup id="_ref-Hideous_Jew_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hideous_Jew" title="">[19]</a></sup> Dorian again attacks him soon after those comments, calling him an "offensive brute". Moreover, other characters also mention their distaste for the manager; Sybil says that "he is not a gentlemen", and that she "hates the way he talks" to her.</p>
<p>Christopher S. Nassaar, ex-Professor of English Emeritus at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_University_of_Beirut_ea3f.html" title="American University of Beirut">American University of Beirut</a>, suggests that <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde's</a>'s depiction of Isaacs is a reaction to the depiction of the Jewish community in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Eliot_fae2.html" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a>'s <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Deronda_559f.html" title="Daniel Deronda">Daniel Deronda</a>. It is possible that <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> was reacating against <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot.html" title="Eliot">Eliot</a>'s portrayal, as she favoured <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism.html" title="Naturalism">naturalism</a>, whilst <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> favoured <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aestheticism.html" title="Aestheticism">aestheticism</a>.

Some newer editions of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> have gone so far as to replace the word "Jew" with that of "man", or "manager". Nassaar goes on to say that there is "no trace of anti-Semitism in any of Wilde's other works" and, in his personal life, he had "several Jewish friends".<sup id="_ref-Jewish_Manager_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jewish_Manager" title="">[20]</a></sup> Moreover, these incidents could exist merely to further highlight Dorian's shallow personality, as the descriptions are often concerned with the man's actions, or with what he wears.<sup id="_ref-Summary_of_Chapter_4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Summary_of_Chapter_4" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>his fairy tales have been claimed to "encode the vision of an idealistic pederast, a man who loves beautiful youths; the style and content of his fairy tales offer a vision of love and beauty that urges a different aesthetic and moral relationship to the world and experience from other fairy tales for children." The pederastic ethos of the tales is claimed to evolve out of their focus on sensual experience and moral enlightenment.

G--What is the "Love that dare not speak its name"? W--"The Love that dare not speak its name" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as the "Love that dare not speak its name," and on account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so the world does not understand. The world mocks at it and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it. (Loud applause, mingled with some hisses.)</p>
