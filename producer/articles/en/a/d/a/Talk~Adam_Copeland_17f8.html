<p>"Edge and Lita's relationship was exploited on Raw when Lita turned heel and became Edge's valet. This was due to a negative reaction from fans for their affair and the fact that it led to Hardy's release. Edge and Lita did not continue their off-screen relationship and Edge has recently patched things up with his wife Lisa."</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><b>There is absolutely no proof that this is true and therefore, I have deleted it. The current status of Adam and Amy's relationship should stay as "unknown" until either Adam or Amy states conclusively either way that they are or aren't together and a link can be provided to back this up.</b></p>
<p>Adam has also divorced Lisa Ortiz. I have re-added this piece of information.</p>
<p>I'm just going to delete non-sensical comments even on here. If you've got something to say, back it up and speak properly.</p>

<p>Take any information that comes off of "Adam's" MySpace page with a pinch of salt. Unless it can be verified elsewhere, don't put it up. This MySpace seems to contradict everything he has said in interviews and should not be seen as the be all and end all of information. Wrestlers create MySpaces for a variety of reasons - gimmicks, publicity etc - and therefore, they do not always give an accurate picture of their actual lives and it may not always be them controlling said MySpace although its done in their name.</p>
<p>And just in case anyone thinks to have a dig at me, this includes ALL information that cannot be backed up with an independent quote from Adam.</p>
<p>Actually Ashley states on her official myspace (and it's proven to be hers), that Edge's Myspace is one of the few legit WWE myspaces.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I'm not denying that its "his" in the technical sense but there is some doubt that Adam actually controls the page etc so and you can't deny that its very gimmicky so I wouldn't add anything from there unless there's something else to back it up.</p>
<p>Good point, I have noticed that a lot of the info on the page contradicts interviews and his book. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillswitch_Engage_cada.html" title="User:Killswitch Engage">Killswitch Engage</a> 04:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)Killswitch Engage</p>

<p>Is this page about Edge|Adam Copeland or about <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Hardy_849b.html" title="Matt Hardy">Matt Hardy</a>? Most of the career and acomplishments of Edge are either glossed over quickly, or not mentioned all together, and instead we have a week by week account of every second Edge spends on TV and how it relates to the current Matt Hardy feud instead of a proper summary of his career. Matt Hardy's page is in sadly the same state. It's as if these two men did not exist prior to this last march when this current storyline began. Curious readers who wanted to look up these two and learn about them would come away without learning anything.</p>
<p>There should be a proper summary of Edge's career including all past highlights. The current storyline, like all others should be nothing more than a small summary along with the rest. If some are that eager to write about it, then why not give it it's own proper article as a great storyline, instead of hijacking two (possibly 3, if Amy Dumas' article is in similar shape) articles. --VampyreDark 07:15, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, well there's a lot of these type of articles with the same issue.

<p>The whole formatting and layout of this page could use a complete reworking. Sully's Gym should not be listed as a trainer, it's the name of the gym, not a person. Also, random facts are interjected into places they do not belong like his career and his upper summary. The recent happenings with Lita and Matt Hardy belong in a footnote at the bottom of this page, under a Recent Controversy heading... that is if they deserve to be mentioned at all. This is wikipedia, not The National Enquirer, or a place for fanboys to vent out.</p>
<p>I would edit this page myself, attempting to format all the data properly, but I fear some immature individual would ruin the effort. <i>(history states this comment was written by VampyreDark; please sign your comments)</i></p>

<p>Hey, i was wondering why edge isn't considered a triple crown champion??</p>
<p>because he never won the wwe title fairly</p>
<p>Yes he did. He had every right to use the money in the bank contract WHENEVER HE WANTED TO. Also, in the triple threat on RAW in July, it was NO DISQUALIFICATION. Edge hitting Cena with the belt was perfectly legal in that match. The stupidity of John Cena marks truly amazes me. -themachine42</p>
<p>When former WWE Heavyweight Champion Edge and superstar Shelton Benjamin were on CNN’s Showbiz Tonight promoting the Tribute To The Troops special, the female host mentioned the mortar attack that occurred while the stars were in Iraq. Things got uncomfortable fast when she mentioned the mortar that landed only 300 yards from the base while the wrestlers were at Camp Victory. After they aired the footage of the attack the host said, "Now, we all know wrestling is fake...big shocker, but what goes on in Iraq is real and"… Then she asked Edge how he felt about traveling to Iraq and he responded that this was his first trip because the first time the superstars went he had suffered a broken neck in the fake industry.</p>

<p>If Owen Hart can be called "Nugget" on his entry, then "Feces" for Edge is fair game. If you have not heard of the derogatory nickname, it is best that you not edit wrestling entries here.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the compliments directed at me, but unfortunately, Edge is not called that particularly name by fans in the arenas. Owen Hart was at least called that name by wrestlers on camera and known by that name by the majority of wrestling fans who would actually bring signs to the arena mentioning that nickname.

<p>i'm trying to improve; you keep taking factual info off.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. I'm just clarifying facts and making things into a neutral point of view. Matt Hardy referring to Edge by that name in online commentary is a fact. Edge isn't better known as feces - which is what you put in there on the same level as his Edge nickname, as if he was actually called that by ring announcers and such. The feces nickname is something Hardy came up with - and is a clearer fact than the vague idea of "certain wrestling circles" referring to him by that nickname. Thanks for understanding. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 21:43, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i will accept the current revision, but the circle of feces goes beyond matt hardy. do you read any "smark" websites? wrestling discussion groups?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not the issue at hand. Whether or not Matt Hardy refers to Edge as feces (and I know he does) is irrelevant. This is not appropriate in Wikipedia's role as an online encyclopedia. Many people, including famous people, refer to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> using derogatory nicknames online. His article states that some people do not like him, but does not quote specific insults. In a wrestling context, many people also refer to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Levesque_0190.html" title="Paul Levesque">Triple H</a> in a similar manner. If, for example, <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Styles_c25a.html" title="A.J. Styles">A.J. Styles</a> refers to Triple H as a "pompous ass" in a message board, would this be appropriate to place in Triple H's article? No.<br /></dd>
<dd>It is appropriate to report factual information about the affair, and to say that Edge is disliked by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Hardy_849b.html" title="Matt Hardy">Matt Hardy</a>, and by extension, some fans, but bringing up Matt's derogatory nickname for him is an attempt at passing off POV as factual report. This may even be an example of a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weaselly</a> statement.<br /></dd>
<dd>Also, the use of "Nugget" in <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Hart_bfff.html" title="Owen Hart">Owen Hart</a>'s article isn't a valid comparison. Hart was referred to as a nugget on WWE television by several persons, whereas "feces" is just a personal moniker for Edge created by Matt Hardy, and picked up by sympathetic fans.<br /></dd>
<dd>Finally, if you wish to have an article reflect what you feel is the best and most appropriate content, it would help your case if you were more polite about it. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrysaor_9112.html" title="User:Chrysaor">Chrysaor</a> 18:32, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've deleted all comments relating to it as it won't be agreed on what to put as the IWC cannot agree on the complexities with his relationship with Lisa and Amy. I don't think the opinions of wrestling news sites or Matt Hardy are valid sources as neither are reliable and neither are unbiased. I think its best the whole section goes rather than adding to speculation</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b></p>
<p>Any "information" that comes from wrestling news sites is not neccarsarily factual. There is no evidence he is reconciling with his wife - there was evidence on an Edge fansite that he is divorced as of November so just leave it at that rather than posting unfounded rumours</p>
<p>Again - I emphasise, stop posting unfounded rumours from so called news sites</p>
<p>I haven't heard anything about Adam and Amy breaking up or that he went back to his wife so I would like to know where these people are getting this information! There is no evidence that says that Adam is with his wife and not with Amy so could someone please put a source to these rumors! If you don't have a reliable source, not a wrestling site that produces incorrect infromation, don't post anything at all!</p>
<p>The status of Adam and Amy's relationship is currently unknown as neither have confirmed anything.</p>
<p>Lita and Edge have broken up. He's back with his wife. <a href="http://www.pwpix.net/superstars/e/edge/gallery/photoscans/1/" class="external free" title="http://www.pwpix.net/superstars/e/edge/gallery/photoscans/1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pwpix.net/superstars/e/edge/gallery/photoscans/1/</a></p>
<p>On Adam Copelands wifes own website, Lisa Copeland seemed pretty annoyed about the whole Edge/Lita thing. I'm pretty sure they broke up because she mentioned it a few times on site, but I don't have the website up right now for quotes. However, that's not to say they didn't work things out.</p>

<p>tradition? it makes the article too longand since when does traditon matter? it makes the page longer than it needs to be .. if he won it with christain then put how many times he has if he won it with somone else they list that but not every individual time he wins whats next everytime he shits? come on now<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThenewjackblackk_fe2a.html" title="User:Thenewjackblackk">Thenewjackblackk</a> 02:09, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you jackblackk. I have always wondered why people always do this. They always moan and complain about the articles being so long but then they have to list every title reign with every detail. What ever happened to just putting how many times they won it and a succession box?

<p>Edge has done the moves I added several times. He does the sleeper hold/rear naked choke to ground opponents all the time. Hes done the big boot several times, especially while he was "Mr. Money in the Bank". Hes done the back suplex as a counter to an opponent's sleeper hold or sleeper hold attempt. Russian Legsweep goes without saying as he has done that move all throughout his career. Hes done the german suplex and belly to belly suplex mainly when he was a singles face, and hes done the belly to belly once as a heel.

<p>I added that Edge is best known for being the most decorated tag team champion with a record of 12 tag team titles (or something to that effect), but I took a look and that's just for WWF/E. It doesn't include the other tag team championships he won in other promotions. Should we include them in the total tag team title amount? I know WWE promotes him as a 12-time tag team champion, but I'm wondering if we should go ahead and add all the others.

<p>For my edits, here is why I made them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge, on his 2001 singles run, originally called his lifting DDT the <i>Buzzkiller</i>, and I remember this because I thought he stole the name from Tajiri, the Japanese Buzzsaw.</li>
<li>Edge never called his <i>Half-nelson bulldog</i> the <i>Winning Edge</i>. I don't care if the game developers of SvR call it that, but thats not the official name. They probably named it such to differentiate from any other half nelson bulldogs they may have in the game.</li>
<li>Granted, the <i>COD - Concussion on Delivery</i> and <i>Impaler DDT</i> are not official names (I only added the COD one), but Joey Styles referred to the lifting DDT as such during his run as lead RAW announcer. I mean, he named Carlito's <i>Double knee backbreaker</i> the <i>Backcracker</i>, so I thought it would be at least worth noting COD. As for the Impaler DDT, JR calls any "devastating" manuvers (in the case of the DDT) a <i>devastating DDT</i> or <i>impaler DDT</i>. Not really worth mentioning since it is just his normal ramblings, but if you want to add it, go ahead. If you don't want COD in the list, then leave it out. However, buzzkiller stays as it was an official name. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Maxx_a7b5.html" title="User:James Maxx"><b><span style="background:lime; color:red">&#160;<u>Jลмєs Mลxx</u></span><span style="background:lime; color:blue">™&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Maxx_38e0.html" title="User talk:James Maxx"><b><span style="background:blue; color:yellow">&#160;Msg me&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James_Maxx_b0c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/James Maxx"><b><span style="background:aqua; color:fuchsia">&#160;My contribs&#160;</span></b></a> 21:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Edge called it the Impaler back when he was starting out too. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here is why I made the reversion and the new edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge has done the big boot several times throughout his career, and most recently at Tribute to the Troops against John Cena.</li>
<li>JR refers to the Back suplex, not as a Belly to back suplex, but just simply a back suplex, and if you look at the definition of Belly to Back Suplex, it says the move is also known as a back drop and back suplex.</li>
<li>Like I said last time, Buzzkiller is also an official name, which he used as the name for the lifting ddt when he started to use it.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b>, and strongly oppose this silly debate that continues to infest the entire pro wrestling section of Wikipedia. I proposed using an actual, objective system some time back to keep this from happening again, but was apparently ignored. Since someone posted on my talk page to point this out to me, I just thought I'd drop in. So, here I am, once again commenting on the general ridiculousness of people trying to index actual human being under acting names that they don't own. All of you who above said, "Support, per the nom." Nom what, exactly? Please actually look around Wikipedia, IMDB, and other reference works before making statements like that. The "nom", especially here, is to index under real names, except for a short few month period each year following the fifteenth or so debate like this over moving the articles.

<p>I corrected Edge's WCW ring name to Damien Stryker. It was incorrectly written as Damon Striker. However, as listed in "Adam Copeland on Edge", which is Edge's autobiography, he states, "I wrestled as Damien Stryker (my worst moniker to date)against Meng and Kevin Sullivan." (Page 75)</p>
