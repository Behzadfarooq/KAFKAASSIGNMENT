<dl>
<dd>my guess is, that "apple" is sometimes used generically to mean "fruit." Thus, the French word for potato is "apple of the ground" and I think people used to call tomatoes "love apples" -- in these examples you would do just as well reading "apple" as fruit. But I am speculating. One thing is certain: the Bible doesn't call it an apple! <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>

<p>Adam in Islam: <i>Adam was <b>sent to Earth</b> to live in the Garden of Eden, and was soon joined by Eve.

<p>Upon visiting the website cited for the Winston Churchill fact, there is only a vague reference and there doesn't seem to be any actual family tree. I'll admit I spent a limited amount of time there, but even then, the website is by no means a legitimate basis for this information. Furthermore, Adam is a mythical character, and whether or not he existed is debatable. If Adam did actually exist and was the first man, this piece of information is utterly useless. As anyone who is human would be related to him. Why Winston Churchill would be specified is beyond me. Just another note; Citing Adam as a real person fails to take a neutral point of view, as it acknowledges Adam as a real person and the origin of all humans, which is a religious view. 4/22/04 - <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelD_6cc1.html" title="User:MichaelD">MichaelD</a></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, Genesis does not state that Adam was the first man. This is an interpretation of what is stated. Genesis 1 states that that god created man. In Genesis 2, God creates Adam from the dust of the earth, but does not state that he was the first man. Elsewhere in the Bible, it is stated that Adam was the first man, it just isn't in Genesis. Reading Genesis 2 as if Adam were not the first man makes more sense than assuming that he were. 03:16, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Not true</b> The Genesis 2 account of Adam explicitly says "there was no man to work the ground (v.5)"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BS!!! it says that no one was tilling the ground yet, not that there was no man period!!!!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and then goes on to talk about the creation of Adam. Note that only the translations differentiate between "the man" and "Adam." The Hebrew word for "the man" IS "adam" and translations eventually use that as his name, usually in ch 3 v 17.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>MORE BS!!!! Adam was the first to til the "ground" which in Hebrew is "Adamah". His name is not an indication of being the first "man" but the first man to work/till the "ground." There is MASSIVE support in the Bible to suggest that man existed before Adam.--Endasil 15:02 EST 4 April 2006</dd>

<dd>Man is created at least twice in Genesis. First as male and female in the image of God -Genesis 1.27. This first creation of male and female is nameless, not referring to the man as Adam(man) but male. Then in Genesis 2.7 man/Adam was formed alone, with woman not coming along until Genesis 2.21-23. Also in the original Hebrew Elohim (God) created male and female in the image of God, while Yahweh (Lord) created Adam to till his garden (Genesis 2.15). There is scholarship to suggest these are two different Gods from older stories combined in Genesis.</dd>

<dd>Guys the Hebrew actually says Gen 2:5 וכל שׂיח השׂדה טרם יהיה בארץ וכל־עשׂב השׂדה טרם יצמח כי לא המטיר יהוה אלהים על־הארץ ואדם אין לעבד את־האדמה׃</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<p>which means: "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground." There was no man before Adam! Also, scholarly concensus doesnt say there are 2 Gods but there are two sources, yahweh souce and elohim source and that these have been used, howevern there are texts predating genesis with th phrase יהוה אלהים in. literally meaning "The Lord God". I suggest that you Learn Hebrew before arguing in future</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Man is created twice...There is scholarship to suggest these are two different Gods from older stories combined in Genesis..." That would be questionable scholarship. More commonly acceptable scholarship recognizes that the "two" accounts are merely a Hebrew scheme for rhyme of thought. It occurs repeatedly in the Tanakh, especially in the Psalms and Proverbs. We also recognize the liturgical, responsatory construction of the account. An American popular example of such a rhyme would be "Great taste. Less filling." The two statements are symbiotic, and again meant for a "liturgical, responsatory" dialog. They are not necessarily from two different sources.</dd>

<p>The story of Adam and Eve is an old Sumerian Story about evolution. The explanation is when humans lived in innocence like animals, they lived in harmony with everything around them. It was a veritible paradise...a garden of plenty and peace. The fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a metaphor for the development of our humanity and coming to consciousness. After Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, they became aware of themselves as humans and were then conscious of Good and Evil. They were no longer innocent, thus had forced themselves out of the paradise of Eden.</p>

<dd>that's splitting hairs. If you tell two accounts in sequence, will it be one or two accounts? Anybody must agree creation is mentioned twice. You can disagree whether that makes it "two accounts" or just "rhetorical or epic repetition".

<p>Yes, some people think that there are more than one account of creation in Genesis. And some people think that there is only one.

<p>Lolita is a better story, a bit less pornographic though. Anyway, it isn't really a question of the documentary hypothesis. There are 2 distinct accounts simply at face reading - it describes the creation of man, plants, women, animals, etc. twice, i.e. at two seperate locations. It is simply a fact that there are two descriptions of creation, i.e. two seperate occurances. The documentary hypothesis says that different people wrote it, at different times, in different books, which someone later stuck together. Others, mostly creationists, state that the same person (usually Moses) wrote it, at the same time, in the same book, writing it twice to present two different perspectives, or for other reasons of literary style.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to see why Ungtss is trying to claim that there is only one account - that the creation of man is only described once, that the creation of plants is only described once, etc. - despite the blatent evidence to the contrary - that there are two seperate occurances for each of these, once within 1:1-2:3 and once within 2:4-3:1.

<dd>I was going to make a new section but instead I'll add it here. Are there really two creation accounts in the bible? To me, it seems to say that God created the world, created the animals, and then created men and women. Then it says he created a garden in eden and Adam from mud. Does it ever actually say Adam is the first man? Couldn't Adam just be a man created by God to live in the Garden in Eden. This would explain the two stories and where Cain found his wife after he left. There could have already been people created by God and then Adam was created seperately. - <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzain_cd43.html" title="User:Kuzain">Kuzain</a> 06:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does not matter where Cain found a wife because there is no real record of <i>when</i> he found the wife. Adam and Eve were putting out offspring and more lineage for at least 130 years. It is more than plausible, and even expected, that everybody in Genesis 3-5 was well <i>inbred</i>.</dd>
<dd>Legitimate scholarship recognizes that the "two" accounts are merely a Hebrew scheme for rhyme of thought. It occurs repeatedly in the Tanakh, especially in the Psalms and Proverbs. We also recognize the liturgical, responsatory construction of the account. An American popular example of such a rhyme would be "Great taste. Less filling." The two statements are symbiotic, and again meant for a "liturgical, responsatory" dialog. They are not contradictory. They reinforce each other by discussing the same exact matter. They are not necessarily from two different sources. --<a href="../../../e/p/9/User%7EEp9206_d673.html" title="User:Ep9206">Ep9206</a> 19:30 EST 4 August 2006</dd>

<p>May I share a bit of insight. For years I had been confused while reading the creation of Adam and/or man in the first two chapters of Genesis. There are two trains of thought; the six creation days (Genesis chapter 1) and the creation of Adam (Genesis Chapter 2). It appears that both chapters refer to the same creation event. I believe that the Judeo-Christian Bible is all true; therefore I began to place all events into sequential order. As a result both chapters make logical sense. The condition of the earth (before any vegetation is brought forth)is developed in Genesis 2:4 - 2:24. The message is that before God planted anything in the ground, God made Adam, the animals and then Eve and they were meant to dwell in an eternal place, (the garden of Eden where they had access to the tree of eternal life). By inserting the complete Adam/Eve story in the creation story; both chapters merge into one complete story. The following is a short version of my findings:</p>
<p>Day 1 God made Light, it is not a natural light, but an eternal light, as described in the book of Revelations; according to the Christian Bible, Revelation 21:23 &amp; Rev 22:5. Day 2 God made heaven, Day 3 God separates waters that belong in heaven from waters that are below heaven. Then God separates from the water below heaven: (since there is no earth at this point) from the dry land. God calls the waters seas and land he calls earth. At the end of day 3 there is light, heaven and earth. Note there are no planets, stars, sun nor moon until day 4 of creation.</p>
<p>During day 3 of creation between Genesis 1:10 and 1:11 God appears to have done more on day three than is recognized by the casual reader. If one were to examine both stories, Adam and the garden of Eden is sequentially the firstt thing God puts on the earth. Before God plants vegetation He makes Adam. By inserting Gensis 2:4-24 between Genesis 1:10 and 1:11 both texts are bridged into a complete story. I am not a bible scholar, nor do I know Hebrew, but I do see that not only are both chapters Genesis 1 and 2 a story within a story, but run parallel to each other. For those who believe in the JudeoChristian Bible, this has not been an established theory.</p>
<p>It would be almost impossible for both faiths to agree on this hypothesis even though both faith communities have the same creation account at the beginning of their bible. An interesting fact besides the dispute of Jesus as being the Messiah: the Jewish faith believe that Genesis 1:26 God says, "Let us," is God referring to angels however the Christian faith community believe that God is referring to the Messiah and the Holy Spirit. Both faiths share Genesis creation story up to Malachi of the Tanakh and the Old Testament; but both faiths disagree on the word "us" in Genesis 1:26. As a result the literary world is left to take the possible ambiguity out of Genesis 1 &amp; 2 by logic.</p>
<p>To continue in the creation process, on day 4 God creates the sun moon and stars or planets. On day 5 He creates birds and fish, and on day 6 He creates animals, creeping things and finally man.</p>
<p>I don't claim to have all the answers, but this logical placement of scripture not only makes the creation account palatable, it also makes more sense.grdenlite</p>

<p>I very much disagree that this article has combined the JudeoChristian tradition and Islamic tradition. One, the two traditions just plain disagree. Eg, in the Qur'an Adam and Eve lived in Heaven, not Eden. Second, there is no clarification as to which</p>
<p>Combining the Jewish and Christian views are fine because they both believe in the Torah, but Muslims believe the Torah was corrupted and thus unreliable. The only difference between the Jewish and Christian is that the New Testament identifies the serpent as Satan where many (at least) Jews do not.</p>
<p>Also, whatever the name of the tradition that includes lillith should be edited into a sub section or another article. To weave her into every heading paints a deceptive picture of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim beliefs because very few believe in her.</p>
<p>We should not act as if different traditions are adding to a fuller understading of the story like different history books on the same event. They do not. Rather, they are several different beliefs. They should be respected individually, not lumped as a single set of contradicting ideas.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the history of the article, but it seems it's struggled a bit organizationally. I recommend a separate article for Islamic beliefs, Adam and Hawwa, after Eve's Arabic name, and moving the Talmud references to its own section(s) within <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>. Lillith has her own article and that article should be referenced, not copied here.</p>

<dd>there can be a separate "Islam" section; historically, the Quran is just a continuation of the tradition of the Torah, of course with modifications. Many Christians believe that the Torah is a collection of 7th century BC Isrealite tales and traditions, not any more or less "corrupted" than the Quran (which Christians will of course consider just a fanciful rehash of biblical tradition authored by Muhammad). We should give an overview of the various traditions, Torah, Christian, Muslim, medieval Jewish (Lilith), etc., regardless of what is "believed" by how many people; We can do a section specifically about people who literally believe in the Torah and nothing else, but the scope of the article certaily goes beyond that. From an NPOV perspective, I don't see how the Quran or the Ben Sira alphabet should get any less coverage. We can, of course, easily have <i>sub-</i>articles, specifically about Islam or Young-Earth Creationists, as long as they are summarized and linked from this article. I would argue, otoh, that discussion of Y-Adam and X-Eve are offtopic here. They are just good-naturedly termed after the Genesis characters, but have no topical relation; at best, they should go to the "See also" section. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that's a very good start. I like having the different beliefs chronologically. What do you think about Lilith? I noticed there's as much stuff on her here as on her own page! I think Y-Adam and X-Eve can stay but with brevity, as they have their own pages. They show that science does not support a single couple beginning the entire human race. I don't understand what Creationism has to do with this, except that they are one of several groups supporting historicity.</p>
<p>I think both the Torah and Qur'anic versions of the narrative should be given separate pages and referenced here since both can become quite large in the future and this is a very long article already. I also think the Sumerian myth should stay under Historicity. Perhaps that too should be given its own page as much of the content does not pertain to Adam and Eve and it appears someone looking for it via <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamian_mythology.html" title="Mesopotamian mythology">Mesopotamian mythology</a> would never think to look here.

If you claim to be a scholar then I suggest you investigate the Mundakopisad Upanishad. I will leave the message here for comment by scholars."A <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedic.html" title="Vedic">vedic</a> story told in Mundakopanisad (Vedic text) refers to two birds pearched on a Pippala (Ficus religiosa) tree. One eats the fruit while the other watches, the one who eats fruit represents the individual self "Jiva" because it has sensual pleasure(taste) the second bird does not eat(denies the senses) and represents the Supreme Reality "Atman" <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">sanskrit</a>. They are both on the same "tree of knowledge" this symbolises the one body. In the Bible "Jiva" becomes <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve.html" title="Eve">Eve</a> "Atman" becomes <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a> and Pippala becomes apple. This philosophical explanation for the origin Adam and Eve where Eve incurs sin for eating the fruit. "Jiva" in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">sanskrit</a> means "life" could also be the origins of the word "live". In short only the complete control of the five senses leads to the Supreme Reality or <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> whereas sensual pleasure incurs ultimate unhappyness or <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>. This theme runs through all the worlds main religions."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do you need scholarship to recognise arrant nonsense? You suggest that the allegorical meaning of the A&amp;E story equates to the MU story, but this isn't true: Eve does not represent the individual self, Adam does not represent the atman, the tree does not symbolise or represent the human corpus, and the story is not the need to control the senses. Your linguistic analysis is even more laughable: "jiva" is not the origin of either the Hebrew "Eve" or the English "live", the idea is a piece of psudo folk etymology with no foundation at all. If you put this rubbish back on the main page I'll cheerfully delete it.

<dd>Back to the basic structure Two creatures, a tree,a fruit, God,and "sin", this is worth investigating. Sorry I don't know what tildes are.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Added an indent to your post to keep it clear who's posting what).</p>
<p>I don't see the resemblances that you claim to see. 2 creatures - but in one they're two birds, in the other they'er not just 2 humans, but the very first humans (so that the real parallel wouldn't be with the MU, but with Manu). A tree and its fruit - but trees and fruit are universal, and it's hardly surprising that people weave them into stories. God - but Atman isn't any kind of god, Atman in a philosophical concept, the world-spirit. (Vishnu, Ram and Krishna are gods, but Atman is not). Sin - I see no reference to sin in the MU, I see a reference to the need to recognise that the world is illusion and that sense-impressions are deceptive. In the A&amp;E I see an allegory about the difference between man and the animals - man, unlike the animals, knows about good and evil. In short, I see no resemblance at all in the themes of the MU and the A&amp;E story.</p>
<p>If you're suggesting that the A&amp;E was influenced by the MU, or vice versa, this also is not correct. You say the word "jiva" is the origin of the English "live", which any linguist could tell you is not true; nor is "Atman" the origin of the word "Adam". Nor, for that matter, are the Upanishads part of the Vedas.</p>

<p>For Jiva may be its <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva.html" title="Viva">Viva</a> assuming a Latin origin of the Bible. If the argument is A&amp;E were first Humans literally I have no case, but if not this worth a serious look Sanskrit is the oldest known language.

<dd>The Bible was written in Hebrew, not Latin. Hebrew is a Semitic language, unrelated to Sanskrit, Latin and English, all of which are Indo-European. (See <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_families.html" title="Language families">language families</a>). So you'll find many - in fact the vast majority - of words in the three IE languages are related/similar - for example, Sanskrit "yoga" is the same as English "yoke", with similar meaning (a discipline, a control - for people in Sanskrit, for animals in English). Any time you came across a word in English of four letters where the last letter is an /e/, try saying it with the final /e/ pronounced as an /uh/ sound, and a Sanskrit word might suddenly pop out. The most basic words are the easiest to recognise - words for mother, father, words for the numbers, words for parts of the body.</dd>
<dd>The name given as "Eve" in English translations of the bible is something like Hawa in the original Hebrew. Eve is not very close to the real word, which means there's no point finding Sanskrit origins for Eve - Eve isn't the real name of the lady. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 12:28, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, the only link I found to support the claim was identical to the wording in this article. Unless someone comes up with much better proof -- i.e., from a middle-eastern linguistics department of a respected school, this just seems like more folk etymology gone awry. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 11:03, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Nöldeke ("Z. D. M. G." xlii. 487), following Philo ("De Agricultura Noe," § 21) and the Midrash Rabbah (ad loc.), explains the name as meaning "serpent," preserving thus the belief that all life sprang from a primeval serpent." This would be Theodore Noldeke (1836-1930), prominent German Semitic scholar. I can just picture him, big bushy beard and snuff-flecked waistcoat, staring seriously into the camera. I have a feeling, however, that more recent scholarship may have been done on the question. (The quote comes from the online Jewsih Encyclopedia).<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 11:12, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want a FAR better source than that. The odds of the triliteral for both being the same is very slim -- that is not how Semitic languages work. For example, in Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, etc., book, read, writer, etc., have the same triliteral as they represent similar ideas. Besides, as the letter "nun" (n) in both languages represents a snake*, and Eve doesn't begin with an "n", it'd be pretty nigh on impossible.</dd>

Perhaps coincidentally, there are some examples of iconography depicting Lilith with a snake wrapped around her." Quite apart from a natural wish to defer to Jim's undoubted formidable grasp of Semitic languages, I really couldn't see the point being made by having this sentence(s) in there - the Torah was written in Hebrew, not Aramaic, so what's the relevance? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 10:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Reducing the indents in the name of legibility). Sorry, but I don't get the relevance of nun to the argument. Are you saying that if Eve's name meant "snake" it would start with a nun? Are you saying that because it's h-w-h (two different /h/-es I gather) and not n-w-n it can't mean snake? Wish I could recall what the Arabic for snake was. Being Arabic there's probably fifty different words for the beastie. Trilateral roots, ah yes. Like n-y-k, for example, that's a good one. Got a nun in it. Doesn't mean "snake", though. No nun should ever have a nyk. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 11:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone jumping pretty quickly to conclusions here with little evidence. Having more than word with the same or similar meanings is a rather common phenomenon, I'm sure you've come across it in English occasionally. Targum Onkelos, the standard Jewish Aramaic translation, translates <i>snake</i> in Genesis 3:1 and the rest of the story, and in Numbers 21:9, and probably elsewhere, as <i>hivya</i>, חויא, which is quite plausibly related etymologically to <i>Havva</i>, חוה. Open up any Mikraot Gedolot if you want proof.</p>

<p>I've noticed that a large amount of the existing article can be organised under the heading "Later traditions", meaning later than the account given in Genesis (i.e. the Hebrew Torah). I've tried to draw this material together in a way that clarifies the general "flow" of the article. I haven't made much major change, but I have depeted a few sentences that deal with material now included in the "Narrative" section.

<p>OK, you told me twice to yake it to talk and keep my pov off the page... But the Documentary Hypothesis is itself just a pov, not a proven fact... The way people go on so confident as to exactly what each alleged "source" contained, you'd think they'd found an actual copy of it laying about in their attics... Folks, this is just some 19th century "Enlightened" people who decided to pull God's Word apart because of the fact that it says YHWH in some parts and ELOHIM in others, and totally ran hog wild with it... If you look at the very top of my talk page, there is better evidence that documents really known to have existed were used as sources for Genesis, without having to invent some that never existed for explicit purposes of propagating points of view... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 01:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not POV, sorry...I know it disputes your Bible inerrancy beliefs, but it's essentially a scientific theory that is holding up quite well.</dd>
<dd>19th century? Huh? You might wish to read up on the concept.</dd>

<dd>You're welcome. Your own is no less evident from your home page. Yes, the J E D P stuff was thought up in the 19th Century, just read the article, thanks, and I was right. Also, the hypothesis is not universally accepted, and won't be until you dig up an actual copy of your J, E, D, or P. I see there are a number of scholars who dispute the whole thing, much as some people would love to keep saying it is universally accepted as "Gospel", it just isn't. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 01:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And there are scientists who dispute evolution (also a still-extant therory that started in the 19th century), the big bang and other accepted scientific theories, so what? There will always be someone who disputes any accepted theory.</dd>
<dd>BTW, the cite you found was quite good. One note: we're using standard footnoting, so the best way to put in a cite is to put {{ref|thenameoftheref}} (i.e., {{ref|orthodox}} next to the sentence in the aricle you're referencing and the save the page to see what number that becomes. Then go to the Notes section and put in {{note|thenameoftheref}} [URL of site] in the appropriate spot the so ref and note numbers match up.</dd>
<dd>Finally, as I'm agnostic/realist, I have no real POV on this other than that the article be the best that it can be, and that explanations represent majority viewpoints like the Documentary Hypothesis (which is accepted by non-dogmatic Biblical scholars and linguists). If you want to argue that the Documentary Hypothesis is incorrect, go to that article's discussion page and have a blast) Oh, I read your account re Jubilees -- interesting, but hardly supported by many (if any) scholars. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 14:24, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is gradually improving, so there's no need to argue unnecessarily here, but I'd just like to point out in response that if you acknowledge that some scholars dispute the hypothesis, then it's a little premature to define it as "accepted". It seems kind of exclusionist, as if to pretend that the disputers don't exist or don't count, or are, if you will, "excommunicated". A hypothesis is only "accepted" by those who accept it, as long as it's all just guesswork and conjecture. BTW I too would be surprised if my view of Jubilees is supported by any scholars, since it hasn't been peer reviewed, and this isn't the place for that. That's why it's staying on my talk page. The DH article looked balanced enough to me already when I casually glanced at it, so I'm not likely to go in there and upset it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Early on in the article is a link to Textual Analysis/Documentary Hypothesis. That article, which you noted looks "balanced", begins, "documentary hypothesis is a hypothesis proposed by <i><b>many</b></i> historians and academics in the field of linguistics and source criticism that the Five Books of Moses (the Torah) are in fact a combination of documents from different sources rather than authored by one individual..." (emphasis mine), thus that only <i>many</i> support it means that <i>some</i> oppose it. As we have that link, there is no point in re-noting that fact in this article. There is a certain burden on the reader to check out linked and/or referenced notes. (BTW: I forgot to use "Nowiki" above -- the tips on how to add notes should look better now).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Likewise, I changed "Western Christianity" to "Christianity" as I see no point in creating a schism in the intro (or in the article, for that matter).</dd>
<dd>I think you misread this: "...modern textual scholarship (the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_hypothesis.html" title="Documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>) continues to analyse the story's many layers, identifying, for example, suggestive parallels with ancient <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_mythology.html" title="Sumerian mythology">Sumerian mythology</a>." It mearly notes that the analysis has noted the parallels, so the addition of "although this is disputed" is both syntactically incorrect, and completely unecessary.</dd>
<dd>As to this edit, "Chapter 2 tells <b>what appears to be</b> another version of the story of the Creation. Before the plants [OMIT "and animals"] had grown, God...". It doesn't "appear to be", it is. Second, see Genesis 2:19 -- God creates the animals for Adam, <i>after</i> Adam is created.</dd>
<dd>I restored "pseudepigraphal" as I believe it to be the more accurate word. I realize that the only other book in this category is your beloved Jubilees, but that doesn't change the facts. Calling it deuterocanonical (second canon) is not really accurate, as it is accepted by only a minority of Christians, and at that is treated nuch like the apochrypha -- not canonical, but worth looking at. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 20:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're completely wrong. The Ethiopian Church most definitely counts Enoch and Jubilees as among the Deuterocanon, the term "Pseudepigrapha" is reserved for those books believed to be spurious that are NOT in anyone's canon, like Jasher. Do not use POV pushing terms like Pseudepigrapha to refer to the EOC canon.</dd>
<dd>The other edits are POV pushing, I'm trying to restore NPOV. Not everyone sees things your way, not everyone agrees that they are irreconcilable accounts in Chaps. 1 and 2, it's time you realise that there more than just your own POV out there when it comes to these questions and therefore, very neutral language is absolutely required, that means it can list the various schools of thought and attribute them, but it does not appear to be taking sides or endorsing any one viewpoint . <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:09, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, you must be very careful not to attribute things to the text of Genesis that aren't there. Chap 2 says God made man BEFORE THE PLANTS HAD GROWN. It most certainly says NOTHING about "before He had made the plants and animals". That's a twisting of the actual text. You can even check it in Hebrew if you like. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:15, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like the RSV (and perhaps other English translations) have deliberately twisted the Hebrew of Gen 2:4-7 to make it look like all one sentence and the same paragraph, with verse 7 beginning with a "then" clause to make it appear as if the time frame given in verse 4 applies to verse 7. That is NOT an accurate representation of the Hebrew. There is no need to resort to such mistranslations to force a contradiction, when the Hebrew has none. Even the KJV is far more accurate to the actual Hebrew here. Verses 4-6 are one sentence. Verse 7 begins a new sentence. No mention of animals in any translation, at any rate. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:27, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your arguments regarding the use of the offensive "pseudepigrapha" versus the NPOV "deuterocanonical" to describe The Book of Enoch are tantamount to saying, "Oriental Orthodox Churches are a minority, therefore their viewpoint isn't worth any consideration and should be excluded".

<p>This section is starting to look good, but I think it still needs more work. I hadn't reaised that the Orthodox church also didn't accept the doctrine of original sin - so it seems it's unique to the Western Christian tradition, the Catholic and Protestant churches.

<dl>
<dd>While I cannot speak for the LDS or Judaism, the statement about the Orthodox Church is somewhat misleading. It is true that the Eastern and Western Churches have some differences regarding original sin. Nonetheless, more careful research of the subject should allow clarification of this point. The V. Rev. Antony Hughes' article, cited in the entry, uses "Ancestral Sin" almost synonymously with "Original Sin" to make the point of the difference between the East and the West - that difference being the issue of inherited guilt. The Orthodox Church, with all Christians, does believe that humans are born into sin. The difference is simiply that Orthodox teaching does not attach a sense of guilt to that fallen state. 4 Feb. 2007</dd>

<p>Codex, fill me in on why you want this paragraph at the top of the Christian tradition section: "Some branches of Christianity fully accept the tradition of Adam and Eve as portrayed in the Bible, and although some hold various views expressed in the Pseudepigrapha, they do not accept the later Jewish Midrash." I'd rather just start with how the Christian tradition developed - how the doctrine of original sin started, the Christian attitude to women, etc. Differences between Judaism and Christianity can be built into the text, not put separately like this. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 12:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I made some edits to erconcile Codex and Jim's conflicting ideas - my basic principle was to quote direct from genesis wherever possible, thus avoiding accusations of distortion as far as possible. Another principle in this section is to state what is in each chapter of Genesis, without trying to reconcile chapters or verses or to provide explanations. This chapter is intended to provide an introduction to the contents of Genesis 1-5, as they erlate to Adam and Eve, to an ideal casual reader - one who is intelligent, curious, and potentially cmpletely uninformed about the contents of the Bible: a Hindu, for example, or a Chinese reader. Please bear that "ideal reader" in mind when editing this section. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 00:08, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's starting to look better, but it's too bad you used the RSV which as I said above, totally invents a "when then" clause that is not in Hebrew in 2:4-7. Maybe the best thing would be to put that verse in the original Hebrew (I've seen this done on many articles where the translation is controversial) and then give the correct translation, not a mistranslation. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:19, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does sanity run in the family? Nothing created a when/then clause. Additionally, we are not putting a verse in Hebrew in here -- it does not belong, and given that very few people speak or read Hebrew, it would merely turn off the average reader. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 01:15, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think putting Hebrew in the main body of the article would create too much work for "the common reader" - bearing in mind we're aiming at the level of a reader who is intelligent and curious but without background in the subject. I think it could go in a footnote if you feel this would be useful. Also, about the RSV, I was under the imperssion that the RSV was faithful to the Hebrew at the expense of the Greek - i.e., wherever there was a clash, it favours the Hebrew? Anyway, I won't fight that one - by all means find an English rtanslation that you feel is authoritative, but you'll need to be able to cite your authority. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 01:08, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about this slightly shorter version: "In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew ... the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed..."

<p>Note that Verse Four is all one sentence, but the RSV inacurately makes a new paragraph start in the middle of the verse, in order to form its artificial "When... Then" clause.

<dd>Yes, it does seem to have more punctuation than most Hebrew versions, which is a problem.

But every Hebrew version I have in my possession, even the ones with no other punctuation, marks where the sentences end, and none put a full stop in the middle of verse 4, only at the end of it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 02:02, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you've just reverted to the RSV, complete with the artificially contrived "when-then" clause that breaks Verse 4 into two parts, and is not supported by <i>any</i> ancient version.

<p>New information to write a summary: (A summary should be short)<br />
The Almighty formed Adam out of the dust of the earth, breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and have him dominion over all the lower creatures <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><br />
. He created him in his own image, and having pronounced a blessing upon him, placed him in a delightful garden, that he might cultivate it, and enjoyed its fruit. At the same time, however, he gave him the following injunction: "Of the tree of knowledhe of good and evil thou shalt not eat; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."<br />
The first recorded exercise of Adam's power and intelligence was his giving names of the beasts of the field, and fowls in the air, which the Lord brought before him for this purpose. A short time after this, the Lord, observing that it was not good for man to be alone, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and while he slept, took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh; and of the rib thus taken from man he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her, daying: "This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man". He also called her name <i>Eve</i>, because she was the mother of all living.<br />
This woman, being seduced by the tempter, persuaded her husband to eat of the forbidden fruit. When called to judgment for this transgression before God, Adam blamed his wife, "whom," said he "THOU gavest me" and the woman blamed the serpent-tempter. God punished the tempter by degradation and dread, the woman by painful hopes, and a situation of submission, and the man by a life of labor and toil; of which punishment every day witnesses the fulfilment.<br />
As their natural passions now be came irrigular, and their exposure to accidents great, God made a covering of skin for Adam and for his wife. He also expelled them from his garden, to land around it, where Adam had been made, and where was to be their future dwelling; placing at the east of the garden a flame. which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>I removed the following paragraph because it contains too many inaccuracies and falsehoods:</p>
<p>"In the early centuries of the Christian era, a whole system of uniquely Christian beliefs was created from the Adam and Eve story. Christians tended to the belief that sex somehow formed the original sin; <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a> was introduced to wash away the stain of hereditary sin; and the serpent that tempted Eve was interpreted to have been <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>. The story in Genesis does not even hint at any of these readings, and their observance by Christians marked the new religion's radical break from its parent."</p>
<ol>
<li>Which early Christians ever stated that "sex" was the Original Sin? Sounds like something maybe Tertullian (who later defected to Montanism) or Augustine would have come up with; at any rate, it's hardly anything Christ taught, and so is questionable as a so-called "Christian teaching", early or otherwise.</li>
<li>According to the Gospels, Baptism was introduced by John the Baptist and Jesus. As Jesus said, it's a ceremony he himself performed, as an example of what he wants us to perform. It was hardly necessary for him to "wash away the stain of hereditary sin". People who understand and believe these doctrines generally take a dim view of people who don't understand or believe them, trying to explain them to us.</li>
<li>The original wording was correct. Anyone who gets that the serpent was Satan incarnate, is getting that from some source other than Scripture. This is not a "uniquely Christian belief" and should not be so described. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:03, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Both of you have added the paragraph, but it doesn't really matter WHO added it. it's full of falsehoods, I haven't seen any source for them or any attempt at a response to my numbered objections above in a language I can understand; and the fact that the statements in the paragraph are logically false does not imply that whoever added them is deliberately lying; I could assume good faith and suppose you just don't know any better. The statements are still factually false. I apologize for saying "surreptitious" but by that, at the time (last night), I meant that you made about ten edits that were shuffling around footnotes, and buried in their midst, you made one edit that significantly altered the content of the previous article with hardly any comment at all, as if noone might notice. But I shouldn't have assumed that was being sneaky, so again, I apologize for saying "surreptitiously". Now aside from all that, could someone please address my points 1, 2, and 3 in English, regarding the objectionable / borderline offensive paragraph that was silently added? thanks <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 01:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but citing a Roman Catholic encyclopedia that might allege that some Protestants thought concupiscence was the Original Sin doesn't cut the mustard. If any Protestant or anyone else ever said such a thing, you should be able to cite exactly who it was. AFAIK No Church has ever held such a doctrine, no Church Father has, no Christian writer has, but yet you are pushing it in the article as a "uniquely Christian doctrine" which is hardly the case. That will have to be reworded, because it is simply a falsehood to call that a "uniquely Christian doctrine" when no Christians have ever even said any such thing. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your statement that "<b>no</b> Christians have ever even said any such thing" is absurd in the extreme. Not only is such a statement utterly unprovable, it has been, and remains, the belief of many Christians -- especially in the US -- that concupiscence <i>is</i> original sin. It does not matter if it was doctrine (although it was in early protestant churches), it merely matters that Christians believed it. Did you even bother to notice that the way I worded it implies that the belief is incorrect? Just because your church never believed something hardly means that other churches didn't. Why are these concepts so difficult for you? Try to get your head out of your religious beliefs and accept that many do not believe as you do.</dd>

<p><b>Support</b> Adam was a very important character in the Bible and it follows that a page should be created solely for Adam.</p>
<p><b>Support</b>, and create a separate page for <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve.html" title="Eve">Eve</a> as well. Although there are many cases where having a conjoined, unified page is beneficial, primarily where the two individuals have little or no claim to fame outside of their shared history and relationship together (e.g. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castor_and_Pollux_83c2.html" title="Castor and Pollux">Castor and Pollux</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain_and_Abel_df7c.html" title="Cain and Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulus_and_Remus_a434.html" title="Romulus and Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>), this is clearly not the case with Adam and Eve, who regularly are referenced and discussed <i>outside</i> of each other's context. In fact, Eve, if anything, is even <i>more</i> commonly discussed outside of the context of her pairing with Adam than Adam is, so I would oppose splitting off a separate article for Adam unless the same was done for Eve. The simple fact is that there is more than enough, a thousand times more than enough, information available to expand into daughter articles. Why not keep "Adam and Eve" around to describe most of the information that would be redundant if we had to copy it to two different articles mostly unchanged, and treat "Adam" and "Eve" as daughter articles for providing further details and information that is specific to each of those characters? (Though for that matter, it might make more sense to just move the "Adam and Eve" story to a daughter article of Genesis, since it clearly discusses that Biblical passage in general, not just two specific characters in the Bible.) I don't see what possible harm that could do, and it could have some huge benefits for allowing the articles to expand organically, rather than trying to artificially . <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, for example, has a dozen or so articles devoted to all the nuances of his life; not even allowing <i>two or three</i> for mythological figures as major as Adam and Eve is just silly. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 11:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I attempted to move the section about the Islamic Prophet Adam to a <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_%28prophet_of_Islam%29_b49f.html" title="Adam (prophet of Islam)">new article</a> but was essentially reverted because it was a major change without discussion. So, here's the discussion...</p>
<p>This article has a fundamental flaw. Namely, we have one topic (that would be "Adam") being merged into a different topic (that would be the story of "Adam and Eve"). Therefore, when one wants to reference Adam without referencing the story of Adam and Eve, they cannot. The fact of the matter is, it is possible (at least in Islam) to talk about Adam without talking about Eve. What has been done here is the equivalent of redirecting <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bono_ac17.html" title="Sonny Bono">Sonny Bono</a> to <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_and_Cher_b22d.html" title="Sonny and Cher">Sonny and Cher</a>. Yes, the two are often associated with each other, but no they are not one and the same. And yet for some reason that logical falacy is applied here. Nevertheless, I am not going to propose a huge split into two or three articles. But when someone is trying to find information about the Prophet Adam in Islam, they shouldn't have to read an long article that is largely irrelevant to the subject. Thus, I moved the Islamic section in accordance with that. This isn't a "featured" article or even a "good" article. And so the demand to first discuss a change that in reality isn't all that major and controversial is unfounded. I kept the intro to the section in this article and referenced the newer one. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 23:51, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note the title of the article, Adam and Eve. Given that title, it takes two to tango. The whole piece needs to stay. As noted on your user page, the link can remain for those seeking to learn about Adam's place in Islam, but unless you're going to create a separate article for Eve, the whole piece, to repeat myself, needs to remain. I understand your fervor as a new convert, but as we are trying, even in the face of constant opposition, to create a featured article. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 00:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jo, I wasn't intending to insult you, I'm sorry if you took it that way. I was merely noting that converts tend to be the most fervant about their religion (and I know a few converts to all three of the Abrahamic religions), which to me merely indicates that they've made a concious decision to amend their beliefs, rather than just sort of believing what they were spoon-fed from birth. I've already noted that I admire what you were willing to put up with to get to where you are now on your journey.</dd>

There are many details about Adam which are in the Quran and not in the Bible. So I think this detail should be discussed, but some information about Adam and Eve in Islam kept in this article too. I agree with Joturner that it is possible to discuss Adam without discussing Eve in Islam.

<p>The template showing the geneology from Adam to David was removed because the article is about <i>Adam and Eve</i> and not Adam. This was <i>exactly</i> the problem I was discussing earlier. No one seems to want to create an article for Adam the person (because apparently he is <i>always</i> mentioned with Eve) and yet someone is removing a template on the basis that it's not relevant to Adam and Eve. Certainly we can keep this article, but there definitely needs to be an article devoted to just Adam where this information specific to Adam can go. And saying that adding this template will mean we have to add a template for other religions is just plain incorrect. That's not a violation of NPOV. If you really think that is necessary, we already have <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProphets_in_the_Qur%27an_79dd.html" title="Template:Prophets in the Qur'an">Template:Prophets in the Qur'an</a> (which doesn't really belong here thanks to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_%28prophet_of_Islam%29_b49f.html" title="Adam (prophet of Islam)">Adam (prophet of Islam)</a>) and so that's two out of the three main <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Abrahamic religion">Ibrahimic religions</a>.

<p>I support having the template "Adam to David" here - nowhere else to put it. The entire article, as I see it, should be used to gather together all the information about Adam and Eve available in Genesis - that means the creation of Adam and Eve, the story of the Fall, and the small amounts of information on their children and deaths (Adam's death anyway). There are already articvles on each of these separately - <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Creation_6597.html" title="The Creation">the Creation</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fall_3b68.html" title="The Fall">the Fall</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generations_of_Adam_427c.html" title="Generations of Adam">Generations of Adam</a>. The trick is going to be how to say anything in this article that isn't said elsewhere. I think this can only be done by being faily general in this place, and redirecting readers to the more specialised, detailed articles (which would include the Adam Prophet of Islam article - this is the essential reason I support the creation of that article). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 08:06, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not just hypothetical. The alleged source documents J, E, etc are all completely unattested and were invented in the 19th century.

<p>Codex, can you please keep the Genesis 2 argument in the relevant section - the one immediately before this one. Not that I matters I susppose, but I like to keep things tidy. Now for your fist point: it might surprise you that I ahve no quarrel with your statement that the various texts proposed by the DH are unattested. I simply feel that once this has been stated once in the section, there's no need to go on and on about it. (I prefer to say that they're hypothetical, or reconstructed, but all these adjectives amount to the same thing: J and E and the erst are theories - I have no problem with that).</p>
<p>Your second point, regarding the meaning of Genesis 2, I can't agree with. I can accept that you are right about the when/then construction, but there remains the sequence of events set out within Gen 2 - it quite clearly has man first, then plants, then animals. This sequqence is independent of the wording or punctuation at Gen 2:4. This isn't just my personal POV, it's accepted by reputable scholars. Can you suggest a way to resolve this? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 04:44, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have proved cites in all 12 languages I can read (and in multiple versions) that show that <i>all</i> of the translations say the same thing.

<dd>No, you haven't proved that all translations say the same thing, because they don't. The RSV artificially cuts 2:4 right in the middle, and makes the second part the beginning of a long sentence with a "When" clause in 2:5, paralleled by a "then" clause in 2:7 to make it seem as if all three verses refer to the same timefrme -- which is all a good strawman, but not a bit of it is in the Hebrew Word. Even the KJV is far more faithfully translated with regard to the actual Hebrew, it correctly keeps 2:4 intact as one sentence, and does not introduce a "when-then" clause in the following verses, but keeps the events in proper sequence. There are no words appearing in the Hebrew that correspond to "when" or "then", they were wrongly added by the RSV. Don't say you've "proved" anything when these are crucial differences for your (mis) interpretation. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:19, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've made an edit that eliminates all "when/then" contructions. BUT, the idea that Gen 2 has man created before the plants and animals doesn't come from the placement of a full stop. It comes from the sequence of the entier chapter: man is created, then a garden with trees, then finally animals. You haven't attempted to address this. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 14:30, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's only a forced interpretation that makes this into a contradiction of Genesis 1. There is no contradiction of Genesis 1. In the seven days account, it says God "created" animals and mankind on day 6. The verb in 2:19 is totally different where it says God "formed" animals on that same day specifically so that Adam could name them; it does not in any way imply that God had not already created animals before Adam on that very same day (the 6th day). Likewise, as for plants, Chapter 1 clearly says God "created" them on the third day. This certainly does not suggest that God was therefore incapable of "planting a garden" with trees on the sixth day, as verse 2:8 says God did. The only reason anyone would infer such a thing that isn't stated, is to try to force the text to contradict itself. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:08, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What can I say, except that I can't agree? To me it seems quite clear that Gen 1 is telling one story, and Gen 2 is telling another. They have different objectives - Gen 1 is telling a story about how God carried out the Creation, Gen 2 is telling a very sophisticated and beautiful parable of man's moral nature. The only reason for refusing to see and admit this is an insistence on seeing the bible as a pedestrian and simplistic account fit for Sunday schools, without any true religious content. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 15:32, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's your interpretation, but the Churches that hold it as Scripture have a different interpretation, and your authority or any other scholar's authority to interpret is not greater than theirs. Of course the scholarly views should be mentioned, but crowding out opposing viewpoints and mentioning only theirs just isn't NPOV. And that was a really weak response anyway; why exactly could God not plant a garden with trees on the sixth day, if He had already created plants on the 3rd day??? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This should be fun. A new editor (to whom we extend the welcome mat) says that Adam's rib was actually a penis. As to the merits of this idea I have no opinion. But I would ask the editor to provide a full reference (make a footnote refering to full bibloigraphic information). On a personal note, I don't think the Hebrew of Genesis actually refers to a rib at all - it talks about taking from the man's side, which sounds odd in English (you almost have to take <i>something</i> from somone's side - you can't just 'take'). I imagine the rib came about be cause non-Hebrew-speaking Greeks and later readers felt there was a gap that needed filling. (In the text, not in Adam). Anyway, it's an interesting addition, but very controversial, and needs to be moer strongly supported with references. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 01:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Codex removed the addition on rib-penis. Codex, I don't think the editor was being a vandal, although like you I'm not happy with having this in the article - sounds very far-fetched to me. Still, he quotes a source, and it could be checked by someone with access to a good library. I'll paste it in here so others can comment if they wish. Quote: <i>Biblical <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> does not have a word for <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>. Some scholars (Gilbert and Zevit 2001) have suggested the story is an explanatory myth to explain the absence in human males of a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Baculum.html" title="Baculum">baculum</a> (a bone many male animals have in their sexual organs). In this theory, the description of the missing bone as a "rib" would be a <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a>. (In light of the fact that men and women have the same number of ribs). Biblical Hebrew often uses euphemisms for sexually related matters elsewhere, such as the term "to know" (to have <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnal_knowledge.html" title="Carnal knowledge">carnal knowledge</a>) and "thigh" (as in, to place one's hand on a thigh as an oath) in place of "genitalia".</i></dd>

<dd>Greets, both. I think I'm the new editor on the article. The story of Adam and Eve has been interpreted many ways - fact, moral story, etiological (origin) myth, and so on. I dont see much controversial about recording that it's also been speculated to be a euphemism. A second source would be interesting, but I think for an article on A&amp;E, it has a place to mention this is one interpretation (although not presently a majority one). I won't disagree with the comments that another source would be good, it would help, if only to show its a minority idea rather than a tiny-minority idea. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> (<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a>) 18:02, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you provide full details for your source - book or article title, publisher, etc? We might be able to put it in the Textual Analysis section under a suitable subheading (Highly Speculative Hypotheses comes to mind).

<dd>I looked up your on-line references and am now more inclined to inclued something, although not the same paragraph you originally posted. In fact I did add a new subsection under the "Textual Analysis" section, titled Adam's Rib. But Codex blew an editorial fuse and removed it. As you might gather, this entier article is extremely contentious, and it's very delicate getting new material accepted (and referring to Codex blowing fuses isn't going to help my case either - ah well, I blew a fuse myself recently over on the Noah article, so we're all human). Anyway, as Codex objects to your material as being "fringe" (and I agree, really), it might be better if I put it in a sandbox first.

<dd>(Later)Sorry, some idiot is preventing me from using the sandbox, deleting text as fast as I put it up. I'll put my proposal here:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Subheading)+++ Adam's rib +++(all proposed paragraphs bullet-pointed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite popular belief to the contrary, men and women have the same number of ribs (twelve pairs). The misconception that they do not is probably due to the verse at Genesis 2:20, "[T]he Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and brought her to the man."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If this verse was not attempting to explain a non-existant difference between males and females, what was it trying to do? One theory is based on a continuation of the Sumerian myth of Ninhursag and Enki. Ninhursag was angry with Enki and caused him to fall ill. Enki felt pain in his rib ("ti"), which is a pun in Sumerian, as "ti" means both "rib" and "life. The other gods persuaded Ninhursag to relent. Ninhursag then created a new goddess named Ninti, (a name made up of "Nin", or "lady", plus "ti", and which can be translated as both Lady of Living and Lady of the Rib), to cure Enki. Given that the pun of "life" with "rib" is present only in Sumerian, linguistic criticism places the Sumerian account as the more ancient.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An alternative, or possibly complementary, explanation was advanced by Scott Gilbert, professor of biology at <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swarthmore_College_d010.html" title="Swarthmore College">Swarthmore College</a>, and his colleague Ziony Zevit in a paper published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics in 2001. Gilbert and Zevit noted that humans (or at least male humans) are almost unique among mammals in lacking a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Baculum.html" title="Baculum">baculum</a>, a bone which stiffens the penis during intercourse. Their theory is that the story of the creation of Eve from Adam's "rib" may have been intended as an explanation of this missing bone. Prudishness and linguistic necessity (ancient Hebrew lacks a word for "penis") may have led the authors of Genesis to use "side" as a euphemism for penis, while the word translated as "rib" is not actually as specific as in English. They suggest also that the reference to "closing up with flesh" the place from where the bone was taken may have been an explanation of the "raphe", or seam of flesh on penis and scrotum, as a surgical scar.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Gilbert"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/a/Talk%7EAdam_and_Eve_4e67.html#endnote_Gilbert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/a/Talk%7EAdam_and_Eve_4e67.html#endnote_Gilbert" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></sup></span></li>

<dd>The problem with the theory itself, other than being a tiny minority view (unless other sources can be found) is that it presupposes a knowledge of anatomy that I'm not sure would have been extant 2500-2700 years ago. Unlike the Greeks, I don't think the Jews were known for their anatomical knowledge (although I may be wrong about this) in the sense Gilbert and Zevit propose. I don't have a problem with the thesis' inclusion, if we can find more cites, and if the paragraph is shortened, but there seem to be a number of questions to answer before we include it. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 11:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, I can clarify one aspect of the above questions. The state of knowledge would certainly have been more than adequate. Read Jarred Diamond's prize winning book <i>Guns germs and steel</i>, in which he traces the state of human knowledge of everyday objects in the natural world to many millenia prior to human written history. My strong impression is that most academics working in that field would agree that humans prior to 2000 BCE, who were intimately aware of their gross bodies (insofar as these could be felt, or were seen during injury), would have most certainly been aware that males and females had equal numbers of ribs, and that human males lacked a bone which many other animals did not. The suggestion of the paper is, that this might have formed the basis for an etiological myth, in which the baculum (denoted by the same word "rib" which can indicate any supporting structure) is taken from a man to make a woman. But certainly if this was a traditional myth of some kind, the state of knowledge at the time of writing down, was certainly more than adequate. By 1000 - 3000 BCE, humans had emerged from foragers, to hunter-gatherers, to tribes, to city-states, to small regional kingdoms and horse drawn warfare, had invented mummification, writing, and a variety of surgical procedures including to the skull. For example <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trepanning.html" title="Trepanning">trepanning</a> was practiced in neolithic times and by the ancient Egyptians. To suggest that they were somehow still not aware that humans lacked a baculum and many other male animals had one, and wonder why, or had not yet developed enough knowledge of the natural world to notice that men and women had the same number of ribs, would need some defending in that light. As for Pico's edit, I like that approach, because it opens up the entire legitimate question "What was it referring to if not a rib", rather than just reporting one paper, which is probably better. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> (<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a>) 13:10, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's leave the contentious Professor Gilbert and his euphemorib out of it for the monent, and make a subsection in Textual Analysis on Adam's Rib dealing just with the fact that men and women do have the same number of ribs, and with the possible connection with the Sumerian myth. That much is both interesting and well-accepted. In other words, just the first two bullwt points from the proposal above. (My concern with including the Gilbert hypothesis is one of balance - it's a new and untested idea, superficially plausible though it is, and I think to give it a whole paragraph in Wiki is more prominence than it merits). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 23:45, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks like shoddy linguistics... It's main strength relies on the argument that the Sumerian myth is older because in Sumerian, the word "ti" means both wife and rib... give me a break, Sumerian is a monosyllabic language with a limited number of syllables, I'll bet if you look up a simple utterance like "ti" in the SUmerian you'll find dozens of meanings... We have already noted parallels in every language that are unique to only that language and not the others, like Aramaic words for Eve and Snake. THe whole question is far too complicated to be unravelled with something as non-substantial as the word "ti" meaning "wife" and "rib" in Sumerian. At any rate, this meets the very definition of "Original Research", unless you cite an actual scholar who did this "research", and not yourself. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:09, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It can't be both monosyllabic and have a limited number of syllables (unless the limit is one). Besides, it isn't monsyllabic, nor is it a simple language (in all honesty, the earlier languages were more complex as they tended to be agglutinative, had more persons, few if any preposition and a more complex verb structure). In any case, it is not unlikely that <i>"ti"</i> meant both rib and life. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 00:04, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the article on <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_language.html" title="Sumerian language">Sumerian language</a> on Wiki, Sumerian was agglutinative - you can't be agglutinative and monosyllabic at the same time. On the other hand, it also says Sumerian had a large number of homophones (there's a hint that it may have been tonal). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 08:10, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know it's not technically monosyllabic, but words can be broken into their components of one syllable that have meaning. And every language has a limited number of syllables that are formed from its repertoire of sounds, but Sumerian is exceedingly small (yes, good evidence for tonality there!). I know the syllable "a" means "water" for instance, but it also has dozens of other meanings. I haven't looked up "ti" yet, but I'd be willing to bet it can mean a lot of other things, besides just "life" and "rib"... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:08, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Hawwa means "living", and is connected to "hayy", life. So says our article. "Hayyawanet" means "animals" - living things. (An Iraqi friend once caused great alarm to her daughter by telling her that they didn't need to go to the zoo, as the roads were full of 'hayyawanet'). One word for "snake" is "hayya". (Arabic never has one word for anything - never settle for less than twenty, that's the motto). Anyway, the point of all this is, I begin to doubt that a word "Hawwa" can be related to "hayy". Wrong trilateral. "Life" and all its cognates have the trilateral h-y-y, or seem to. (I'm not a linguist - my knowledge of Arabic comes from experience, not study). "Hawwa" seems to have a different trilateral, maybe h-w-w.

<dl>
<dd>In Ethiopian languages life is "Hiywot" or "Hiywet" (different transliteration, not different sounds), which may indicate a h-y-w pattern, but I'm just speculating here. Life in MSA is hayaa(a? not sure how to add in a ta-marbuta after a long alif) = Ha – Ya – Alif – Ta-marbuta (not the root but the letters). In semitic words with a ta-marbuta in arabic, the corresponding Ethiopic (i.e. in all Ethiopian Semitic languages) word always has "t," and the same "Ha"s (i.e. the early Ha in the abjadi order, not the late one) in the word, so they seem to be cognate, implying the h-y-w pattern. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom">Yom</a> 13:38, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Hebrew, you have Heyeem (ie, Chaim), in Aramaic Heyeen; these are both singulars that are plural in form.

<dd>BTW, The Anatolian languages are definitely Indo-European instead of Semitic, but their words for "life" look like they start with similar roots, eg. Hittite Huytumarsha, Luwian Huytwalahi...

<dd>Eh...I seriously doubt it. "walahi" really just means "and upon it." <i>We</i> + <i>'ala</i> (ayin – lam – alif-Maqsura) + <i>hu</i> (indicates third person singular it, or him). "On it" is then in MSA <i>'Alayhi</i> (alif-maqsura becomes a <i>ya</i>, and the weak <i>damma</i> or "u" sound of the <i>hu</i> is overcome by the <i>ya</i> sound and becomes <i>hi</i>). "Walahi," then is probably just a variation from '<i>alayhi</i> than a separate evolution. The initial <i>waw</i> is kinda of weird though if it is to be included in some sort of "life upon it" (or similar) phrase, since it would go at the beginning of the clause (and not in the middle). That's just my inexpert opinion, though. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom">Yom</a> 01:53, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is from the wiki on sin: "The most common formal definition is an infraction against religious or moral law. Colloquially, any thought, word, or act considered faulty, shameful, harmful to oneself or to others, or which alienates self from others and especially from God, can be called a sin."</p>
<p>Yet this article says: "St Paul was not being true to the Hebrew of Genesis, which nowhere mentions the words "sin" and which does not say that Adam was punished with death. (Adam's transgression in Genesis 3 is disobedience, not sin, and he is expelled from Eden not in order to die, but so that he may not eat of the Tree of Life and become immortal).[19]"</p>
<p>Call me biased, but it seems to me that Wikipedia is more unharmonious about sin than St. Paul. If "any thought, word, or act considered faulty, shameful, harmful to oneself or to others, or which alienates self from others and especially from God, can be called a sin," then how isn't Adam and Eve's disobedience of the command not to eat of the tree a sin?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if they can't eat of the tree of life then they can't live forever and therefore will surely die. So it would be <i>reasonable</i> to conclude that since Genesis says they were banished from the garden so they couldn't eat of the tree of life then it was also so that they would die (Romans).</p>
<p>If I'm simply misunderstanding then there may still be a problem of clarity in this section. Metricdatabase 17:44, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're quite right of course - sin is disobedience to God, who is the source of moral law. But the point the article is making is that while St Paul's interpretation is theologically sound, the word "sin" isn't used in that part of the story in Genesis. What the section on Christian tradition is trying to do is to rtace the development of the idea of sin over time, from the interpretation given by Paul, who identified diobedience to God as sin, through Augustine, who brought up the idea of "original sin" (I.e., that Adam's transgression qwas hereditary), and then the identification of sin with sex in much Western culture (not an identification made by the CHurch itself, but by many preachers particularly in the Protestant tradition). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 23:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is a completely false and unbiblical "tracing" and since only the most ignorant at any given time could ever have believed such a preposterous thing, it is highly questionable if it belongs here in a Biblical story. In the Bible, God Himself only declares certain sexual behaviours to be against His Law, not ALL sexual behaviour, and anyone who says the Bible says otherwise, is misrepresenting the Bible. Aside from that, if any groups ever really believed this, they probably would have gone the way of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker.html" title="Shaker">Shakers</a>.

<p>How about shortening this whole thing to something like, "The fall of man forms the basis for the christian doctrine of original sin. For more, see the article on original sin."

I am a reasonably mainstream Christian, and I have done a certain amount of reading concerning the history and such with a special focus on issues regarding marriage, sex, and procreation, and the idea that this sort of interpretation of original sin is common in the mainstream is new to me. There's good evidence that it was common among the Gnostics, the Albigenses, and the Shakers, but if you're going to say it is also common among groups traditionally considered orthodox, I think you'll really need to provide a credible source. I second the call to cut the section in question entirely, and provide a link to the original sin article, by the way.</dd>

<p>An astounding assertion was made that many jewish scholars of ancient times denied the actuality of the Adam and Eve narrative. This, in my opinion, staggering claim cannot be passed off without actual quotes of "ancient jewish scholars". <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShykee_1b57.html" title="User:Shykee">Shykee</a> 23:22, 4 April 2006 (UTC)Shykee</p>

<dd>Off the top of my head, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo.html" title="Philo">Philo</a> is one. The Talmud is pretty unanimous that Adam originally had two faces, male and female. Do you think Rabbis believed God created a man with two faces only to seperate them?

<p>It strikes me that the section concerning Christianity's historic interpretation of Eve's transgression as justifying the subjection of women is, as a whole, taken out of context. The idea that Eve's sin means women must be subject to their husbands is part of a larger allegory used by Christians (especially early Christians) to conceptualize the relationship between husband and wife. The Fall of Man is set in parallel with the rising of Christ. As Christ is the Second Adam, so there is a second Eve -- alternately Mary, and the Church conceived of as the Bride of Christ (of whom Mary is the exemplar). When Tertulian says that sin entered into the world through woman, his audience could have been expected to understand also that salvation entered the world through woman. As Eve was taken from the side of Adam, so the Church (and Mary by extension) was given new birth by the wounds of Christ (one of which was in his side, incidentally). The Second Adam and Eve represent an ideal for Christian marriage. The Church is obedient to Christ, but Christ gives His life for the Church, and unlike Adam, refuses to separate himself from the sins of His beloved. Adam blamed the Fall on the woman, but Christ, who could truly have placed the blame entirely upon the woman instead took the whole punishment of sin upon Himself. Thus the contrast between the First Adam's actions and the Second Adam's actions reveal the scope of the conversion which the Christian husband is supposed to aspire to. He is supposed to be changed from the selfish First Adam into the Selfless Second Adam.</p>
<p>All of this to say... the actual doctrine that Tertulian and the other Church Fathers spoke of when they referenced the story of Adam and Eve was much more nuanced and, frankly, more foreign to modern minds, than the doctrine presented here. In the article as it stands, we have a very linear presentation of what was (and still is in some areas of Christianity) a pronouncedly non-linear doctrine, and the article ignores the greater part of the doctrine in order to point out a small part of it which happens to be problematic to modern Western minds. The fact is, the idea that Eve fell first was not used as a justification for the subjection of women for the very simple reason that the subjection of women needed no justification at the time. It was the norm in the whole world until the past two centuries or so, and almost completely uncontroversial. Rather, the doctrine of Eve's fall and subjection to Adam was used as part of a larger allegorical system for understanding the relationship between husband and wife, and, more than that, between Christ and His Church.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.110.220.141 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.110.220.141.html" title="User talk:66.110.220.141">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.110.220.141_92ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.110.220.141">contribs</a>) 20:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Also, concerning the Witchcraft tract mentioned in the same section... Since this section is presumably meant to present the mainstream interpretation of Adam and Eve among Christians, why is a book that was condemned by the authorities mentioned? It seems unnecessarily inflamatory.</p>

This article should be used for most of the information <i>shared</i> between the two, but there's sufficient information that is primarily relevant to one person or the other (such as Adam's status in Islam, Eve's affect on the history and mythology of women, etc.) to <i>easily</i> justify separate articles. Preventing the creation of such articles will stunt this topic's ability to grow organically and to analyze Adam and Eve in more detail on their own, as well as causing article bloat and disorganization. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:09, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There seems to be at least a strong minority view in favour of this split. I suggest that, as a first step, you try creating two new sections under these titles.

<dd>Alright, how about we create two prototype pages, Talk:Adam and Eve/Adam and Talk:Adam and Eve/Eve? (And perhaps a third, Talk:Adam and Eve/Adam and Eve, to work out how the top-level page will look after we're done?) Then when they grow large enough for full-fledged articles, we'll simply move them to article-space. I probably won't have much time to help with such an endeavor, but if that's what it takes to get work started on the much-needed daughter articles, that's better than nothing. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 14:36, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Leave Adam separate, as he's one of the most significant mythological figures in existence in the largest religions in the world, and we could literally fill dozens of pages with highly noteworthy information about him; "Adam and Eve" should be reserved for the information which an Adam and an Eve article would share (e.g., the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis), to avoid redundancies.

<dd>Certainly there are (even in Genesis itself, in the "The Adam" of the first Creation account), but that's beside the point. First, this is not purely an issue of "How often are Adam and Eve discussed exclusively?"; it is primarily an issue of practical concern, as the sheer <i>amount</i> of information about both figures necessitates having as many distinct articles about them as possible, lest important information be excluded due to space concerns. If our <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> article can have <i>ten</i> distinct daughter articles for providing the many significant details which would not into the top-level page, is it really so much to ask to have <i>two</i> daughter articles for Adam and Eve, one for each member of the pair?</dd>
<dd>Second, there aren't many ancient writings about <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scylla.html" title="Scylla">Scylla</a> that do not mention <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charybdis.html" title="Charybdis">Charybdis</a>, yet even relatively minor mythological entities like those have separate articles. That two characters are frequently mentioned in the context of one another, or are strongly associated with one another, in no way implies that they cannot have distinct articles of their own; else we'd not have distinct articles for, for example, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades.html" title="Hades">Hades</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto_%28mythology%29.html" title="Pluto (mythology)">Pluto</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dis_Pater_5c03.html" title="Dis Pater">Dis Pater</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orcus_%28mythology%29.html" title="Orcus (mythology)">Orcus</a>. If we can have dozens of articles on different <i>aspects</i> or <i>representations</i> of a single mythological figure, how can you argue against having even <i>one</i> article for a clearly distinct, and monumentally important, mythological figure like Adam? One could argue that, next to Jesus (and <i>possibly</i> Abraham), Adam is the <i>most famous figure in the entire Bible</i> (and the most famous of all in the Tanakh); yet we are reluctant to give even a single article to present information specifically concerning him alone, while absurdly minor Biblical figures like <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammishaddai.html" title="Ammishaddai">Ammishaddai</a>, <a href="../../../i/z/e/Izehar.html" title="Izehar">Izehar</a>, and <a href="../../../z/a/a/Zaavan.html" title="Zaavan">Zaavan</a> get distinct articles aplenty?

<dd>Inefficient. It's so obvious that we'll desperately need a separate article about Adam <i>eventually</i> (probably as soon as anyone takes the time to expand the information we have on him), that it would be silly to artifically merge the two. In the long run, it will take a lot less time to have them separate from the start, so we can keep in mind the best way to balance the three articles in coordination as they organically expand, rather than to mess around with constant remergings and which will cultivate inconsistencies and redundancies and waste time unnecessarily. That a daughter article is low-quality is a reason to <i>improve</i> it, not a reason to merge it back into its parent article: the only reason to do that would be if Adam was not a significant mythological figure.&#160;:) Moreover, as you correctly point out, the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a> article is pretty poor too; by your logic, we should merge it back into <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> until someone takes the time to improve it. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Adam and Eve story covers five themes: the dualistic nature of humankind as mind or spirit ("breath" of God) and body (the "dust" from which Adam is fashioned); the derivative nature of woman as social being (fashioned from the man's "bone"); the relationship between moral awareness ("the tree of knowledge of good and evil"), self-consciousness and other-consciousness ("they saw that they were naked"); the connection between material scarcity (in the sweat of they face shalt thou eat bread") and psychological alienation ("he drove out the man.."); and the virtual impossibility of returning to the natural state of humankind ("the Garden") from the socio-economic state ("East of Eden").</p>
<p>The symbolic architecture is complex, employing the common Biblical "breath/blood/flesh/bone" symbol set (subsets of the underlying mind/body dichotomy) and&#160;; the "serpent" symbol (representing bodily, physical or material desires being a creature of the "dust"); and the "tree/fruit" symbol set (representing action and consequence).</p>
<p>The Adam and Eve story is notable for its use of the reversal device (as in the woman being "born" out of the man), which is designed to emphasise that the story is concerned with the origins of the social rather than the natural order.</p>

<p>I have seen abundance evidence from good scholars that "rib" in the story should be translated "side." I've incorporated some into the article. I have yet to find any reason to think "rib" is better except that most Bibles still translate that way. My only estimation (personal) is that they continue translating this way because it's tradition. I realize that it's not WP's place to decide who is right, but to merely represent others. But who do we represent? Should wikipedia follow the majority who don't back up their translation or the minority that have overwhelming support? --<a href="../../../e/p/h/User%7EEphilei_3ebf.html" title="User:Ephilei">Ephilei</a> 05:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have two main reasons for reverting. One, this subsection was created because some editors were complaining that the article as a whole gave too much attention to Adam and not enough to Eve - hence this paragraph about the creation of Eve, The new edit turns it from a note about what the Genesis story says about that, into a scholarly discussion of the meaning of certain words in Hebrew. Probably accurate in its own right, but it moves us away from the purpose of the paragraph. Second, Arthur Custance...I'd never heard of him, so I looked him up. Turns out he was a Canadian scientist with an amateur interest in OT thrology. Widely read, intelligent, but not, I must say, a scholar, biblical or otherwise, as he never submitted anything to peer erviwe and was never published in any scholarly forum. He's a interesting example of the autodidact, but not a quotable source. (And finally, the quote from the rabbi is simply irrelevant, although it couold be summarised and put into the Traditions section).<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 02:49, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>can you at least tune down the rhetorics? You preach NPOV, reverting to a version with things like "Some scholars who are evidently unaware of the original Hebrew"? That's classical spinning. It is only Wikipedia's voice, that is, <i>yours</i>, that makes so terribly much of the distinction of "rib" vs. "side". The text goes on to say that "Biblical scholar Arthur Custance recognizes the correct translation of 'side' instead of 'rib,' but still posits a connection with the Sumerian myth", so <i>how on earth</i> can you defend the "who are evidently unaware of the original Hebrew" potshot? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so fast. The Amharic Bible, for instance, has a word meaning "bone", ie it states that God took one "bone" from Adam's side. Assuming that this bone, or whatever was taken, was a rib, is much like assuming that the forbidden fruit was an apple. There is nothing in the Hebrew to specify what was taken, so it's an assumption. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Amharic Bible is just as irrelevant as the KJV here. This is about the Hebrew text. Which has "God took one of his <i>tsela</i>". Now don't be ridiculous and suggest that this might mean "God took one of his flanks" (what does that even mean?). Your cherished WP:NPOV is subject to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and as long as you cannot present a discussion that is based on the Hebrew text, we don't even have anything to discuss.

<p>A <i>tsela`</i> was taken, which means "rib". I think now that we've established that the term for "rib" in Daniel 7:5 is the Aramaic form of the <i>same word</i>, that cognates of the word in other Semitic language mean "rib", and that it is from a root meaning "to be bent", we have established beyond reasonable doubt that the godswordtowomen.org simply doesn't known its ins or outs.

<p>Normally I'd just do this myself, but since this article has a lot going on constantly, I propose this: Seperate the Jewish section into two parts: what's in the Torah and what's in Talmud and other traditions. The reason is that 1 all Jews believe what's in Torah, but not everything else 2 Christians believe what's in the Torah and no other Jewish source.
