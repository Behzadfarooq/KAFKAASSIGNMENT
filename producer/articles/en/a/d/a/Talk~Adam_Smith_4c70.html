<dd>It means that he gave up his scholarship at Oxford and left the university. I think that, technically, at Oxford, an "exhibition" is a somewhat less generous grant to a student than a "scholarship." But it's the same idea. -- User:Eb.Hoop 11:00, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This reads inconsistently:</p>

<p>I think that the answer is "Both". The Public, American or British, are generally for free trade where they think it doesn't harm them, and for mercantilism, particularly its protectionist aspect where they think that it benefits them. For examples take a look at the historical UK Corn laws or the present day US/Canadian softwood lumber dispute, the US/Vietnamese catfish saga or the current debate about IT outsourcing to India, where the "Public" have been or are divided over the merits of free trade versus protectionism. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a></p>

Adam Smith was a philosopher through and through! He was known as such throughout the 1700's long before the popularity of his <i>Wealth of Nations</i> took over. Smith's 1759 <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> was not a one-time folly, abandoned after the Wealth of Nations in 1776. Smith worked on new editions of both books continually up till the 1790's. I encourage anyone interested to read Dr. James Otteson's 2004 book, <i>Adam Smith's Market Place of Life</i>. Otteson goes to great lengths explaining exactly how Smith saw the interaction of communities; and how individuals naturally and spontaneously build up codes of bahavior and morals. Only later did Smith extrapolate that theory into economic realities and principles. To look at Smith simply as an economist is to regard him only as half the man he really was. I have yet to see biographies or fans of Smith who have dared to fully understand both facets of this influential man. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltharian_278b.html" title="User:Eltharian">User:Eltharian</a>, 19 March 2006</p>

<p>The last edit by 146.151.30.214 doesn't seem to respect <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. I'm not sure whether everyone considers <i>corporate structure, government run by business interests, and economic emphasis on business rather than on workers</i> as today's capitalism. But there is some valid point (not rechecked by me, tough) in mentioning that Smith never used the term capitalism...</p>
<p>It also <b>does</b> make sense to show differences between Smiths thoughts and some of his followers. I guess this is what the editor did intend. But this doesn't belong to the very first paragraph.</p>
<p>Here's the bigger part of the change.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is often cited by pro-capitalist ideologies as helping to create the modern academic discipline of economics and providing one of the best-known intellectual rationales for <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. However, Smith never used the term capitalism in any of his works as it did not exist in his time, and in fact opposed much of what today is considered capitalism, such as the corporate structure, government run by business interests, and economic emphasis on business rather than on workers.</dd>

<p>Could someone with more Smith knowledge than me, make this into its own sub-section? I will revert this change in a few days if it is still there...</p>
<p>I deleted then statement that Marx agreed with the iron law of wages as this is incorrect.

<p>I will delete the following passage, recently added by <a href="../../../w/k/_/User%7EWk_muriithi_6a20.html" title="User:Wk muriithi">Wk_muriithi</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even if it was possible to impose the implicit moral contract discussed above, it is unlikely that Adam Smith theory would ever work. This is because invisible hand only work in a perfect market, a condation that has never occured and will never occur. Some of the problem that makes the market imperfect are:-
<ul>
<li>Information asymmetry - Its impossible for example, for even sophisticated buyer to be all knowing even where there is reasonable competition. A good real life example of this is in microprocessor market. Corporations can be assumed to be sophisticated buyers and are the main consumers of microprocessors. Despite this, Intel has been able to sell its inferior microprocessors at a higher price than its competitor, AMD.</li>
<li>Natural monopoly - Some business like telecommunication, utility (water and power) railway are natural monopoly. Markets tend to badly at it. Witness the electricity fisco in USA sometimes back.</li>
<li>Externality - Business tend to produce too much negative externalities (eg pollution) and too little positive externalities (eg research). Adam Smith argument ignore this facts and his theory is therefore not sustainable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aside from problems with the grammar and the POV tone of the proposed addition, nowhere in WoN does Smith posit a perfect market. His work is largely descriptive, studying how markets had historically worked in Europe and elsewhere. The famous "invisible hand" in WoN refers primarily to the observation that there is an unplanned connection between specialization/trade and the creation of wealth. I suspect that the author of this passage has limited first-hand knowledge of what Smith actually says in his book. For a recent critique of the common, incorrect use of the term "invisible hand" by free-trade critics, see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Smith_aef6.html" title="Vernon Smith">Vernon Smith</a>, "Human Nature: An Economic Perspective," <i>Daedalus</i>, pp. 67-76, Fall 2004. - <a href="../../../e/b/2E/User%7EEb.hoop_35ce.html" title="User:Eb.hoop">Eb.hoop</a> 15 Jun 2005, 15:45 (UTC).</p>

<dd>I concede that i am a tad too opinionated and my spelling leave a lot to be desired. I am however surprised that you seem to be asserting "invisible hand" has nothing to do with pricing. I quote from the article</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the main points of The Wealth of Nations is that the free market, while appearing chaotic and unrestrained, is actually guided to produce the right amount and variety of goods by a so-called "invisible hand." If a product shortage occurs, for instance, its price rises, creating incentive for its production, and eventually curing the shortage. The increased competition among manufacturers and increased supply would also lower the price of the product to its production cost, the "natural price."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Boy, that sound to me like the supply - demand curves i see a lot in economics books. The curves attempt to demonstrate how market achieve optimal price. Are you for real when saying this has something to do with specialization? Would you be more specific on your understanding of what of what "invisible hand means? And if your assertion is true, don't you think the above paragraph is misleading and should be fixed? Can someone comment on this?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the paragraph from the article you quote is misleading. In WoN, the "invisible hand" refers generally to the fact that the people participating in a free market system achieve results for themselves and for society that are never part of their conscious motives. The price mechanism is one aspect of this general phenomenon, but it is not the only one, or even the most important in Smith's thinking. Smith's central point in WoN is that specialization and division of labor dramatically increase productivity and are the source of all wealth. Specialization is possible only if trade allows people to exchange what they specialize in making (e.g., pins) for everything else they need (e.g., food).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the relevant quote from Vernon Smith's article: <i>When Smith uses the metaphor of the invisible hand, he is referring to the essential insight that people in markets achieve ends that are not part of their intention; i.e., people achieve more efficient arrangements induced by the specialization-exchange nexus than is possible without that nexus. The more common, inappropiate, interpretation is illustrated in the following quotations from <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stiglitz_b30e.html" title="Joseph Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a>: "The argument of Adam Smith ... that free markets led to efficient outcomes, 'as if by an invisible hand,' has played a central role in these [information economics] debates ... The set of ideas that I will present here undermines Smith's theory and the view of government that rested on it. They have suggested that the reason that the hand may be invisible is that it is simply no there - or at least it is palsied."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having read WoN, I agree with Smith that the common perception (repeated by Stiglitz) that the "invisible hand" refers simply to efficient pricing is quite wrong. Smith was arguing at a far more fundamental level that people like Stiglitz are today. We tend to forget that most of what Smith writes about in WoN is now received wisdom in economics and uncontroversial even to free-market skeptics like Stiglitz. I notice that the Wikipedia article on the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_hand.html" title="Invisible hand">invisible hand</a> does a better job that this biography of explaining what Smith was talking about. - <a href="../../../e/b/2E/User%7EEb.hoop_35ce.html" title="User:Eb.hoop">Eb.hoop</a> 20:38 17 Jun 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Thanks for response. I think you are in better position to understand what invisible hand means as you seem to have read WoN. I was basing my argument wholly on the above paragraph, but since you say its wrong, then my argument is consequently weak. And yeah, my skeptism on the WoN thing is heavily influenced by Stiglitz. He seem to think its bull.</dd>

<dd>doesn't mean a whole lot. Translating it into more straightforward English, it says, "Smith often wrote fluently and persuausively, but rhetorically."

So what we're left with is "Smith wrote persuasively"--which is probably better to cut, since it's more opinion than fact.</dd>

<p>I deleted the last sentence of the following paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Smith vigourously attacked the antiquated government restrictions which he thought were hindering industrial expansion. In fact, he attacked most forms of government interference in the economic process, including tariffs, arguing that this creates inefficiency and high prices in the long run. This theory, now referred to as "laissez-faire", influenced government legislation in later years, especially during the 19th century. However, Smith criticised a number of practices that later became associated with laissez-faire capitalism, such as the power and influence of Big Business and the emphasis on capital at the expense of labour.</i></p>
<p>What does "emphasis on capital at the expense of labour" mean? In free-market capitalism, firms allocate capital and labour to maximize profits. Is the criticism that they held too much capital at the expense of profits? Or is it that some firms under laissez-faire capitalism had attrocious working conditions and poor human rights by today's standards? The former is what's implied by the statement, though I think the latter is what's meant.</p>
<p>I think the statement needs both clarification and justification (sources, please) before being added again.</p>

<p>Woah. Um, sorry about that. I didn't type that.&#160;:S Either my accounts been hacked or someone on my computers been using my account. Either way, I'll change that now. Thanks for bringing that to my attention Ran. Sorry about that.

<p>changed "influencing the writings of Marx and later economists." to removed Marx. as anyone who has read both knows, Marx was clearly not influenced by Smith!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I presume that's a joke! Much of Marx's Capital (and other writings) are based on Smith's (&amp; Ricardo's) theories; Marx criticises quite a lot of Smith and Ricardo, but accepts a lot of it too. I've reinserted a link to Marx (specifically Marxian economics). For more, see <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxian_economics.html" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economics</a> which stresses the vital intellectual link between Smith and Marx. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 20:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on <i>in popular culture</i> information. I started that last year while I raised <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> when I created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a>, which has become a <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a>. Recently I also created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great</a> out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.

<p>I am removing text which claims that Smith is the third Scotsman to feature on a Bank of England note. Firstly, this fact is uncited, and secondly, it was directly contradicted by the existing reference (the news article from the BBC News website). <a href="../../../n/z/s/User%7ENzseries1_473b.html" title="User:Nzseries1">Nzseries1</a> 15:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
