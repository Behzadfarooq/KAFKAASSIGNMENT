<p>Although your work on communism-related subjects is often neutral (your article on <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Brezhnev_ff56.html" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, e.g., is particularly good), this article read at times like a Cold Warrior tract. (The tone of Cold Warrior tracts differs from the tone of encyclopedic entries.) I decided to NPOV the article (noting some of Everyking's comments on the talk page), although I knew that this opened me up to outlandish charges that my motivation for toning down one set of biases was the opposite set of biases. But this did not concern me. Everything that I added to the article is within the realm of well-established fact and reasonable discourse of the subject at hand, and I'm sure that this will be evident to the other editors of the article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 20:56, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

I've had a change of heart after reading the asinine arbitration committee "ruling" chastising you for being the "the more impolite of the two" while not banning Krusty from editing the LaRouche article. The ruling sends a message that crackpots and cranks will determine the editorial direction of select articles if they can muster more time and persistence than a professional historian. So, I've come to the conclusion that adding balance to an article about an overall repugnant regime (responding to some of the mild criticisms regarding neutrality on <a href="../../../p/e/o/Talk%7EPeople%27s_Republic_of_Poland_b536.html" title="Talk:People's Republic of Poland">Talk:People's Republic of Poland</a>) is unhelpful if it deepens a wedge between legitimate contributors who should instead focus attention on vandals like Krusty.

<p>No matter how civilly you phased the question, you're begging the question and the innuendo smacks of McCarthyism. But even though I dislike the way you're framing the question, I'll go ahead and answer it. As a <i>method</i> I oppose analyzing politics and international affairs in a moralistic framework, while you argue vigorously that even encyclopedias exist in a moral universe. As evidence of our diverging perspectives with respect to the articles on which we clashed, I opposed the Iraq War and the Bush administration's stance on the DPRK. I hope that you are reasonable enough to realize that these aren't uniquely "Stalinist" positions. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:47, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

If he is right then I will have to modify some of the views I expressed above about the history of the word's usage. (Adam 14:12, 19 Jun 2004)"</p>
<p>The D.C.

Also the Israeli Holocaust Museum cites me on their web site re the word "H/holocaust".</p>
<p>I am not too swift with computers: my attempts to change the Wikipedia article titled "Holocaust" re the explication/history of the "H/holocaust" word were unsuccesful. [Wikpedia: "The word Holocaust (Greek for "a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering") was introduced in the late 20th century to refer to the attempt of Nazi-ruled Germany to exterminate those groups of people it found "undesirable"... Shoa in particular is used by many Jews and a growing number of Christians due to theological discomfort with the literal meaning of the word Holocaust. These groups believe it is theologically offensive to imply that the European Jews were a sacrifice to God. It is nonetheless recognized that most people who use the term Holocaust do not intend such a meaning."]</p>
<p>Perhaps you can pass this message on to the main writer of the "Holocaust" article.</p>
<p>Jon Petrie jon_petrie@yahoo.com</p>
<p>FROM THE DC HOLOCAUST MUSEUM CITED WEB PAGE: &gt;&gt;&gt;FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS... What is the origin of the word "Holocaust"?</p>
<p><br />
The word holocaust comes from the ancient Greek, olos meaning "whole" and kaustos or kautos meaning "burnt." Appearing as early as the fifth century B.C.E., the term can mean a sacrifice wholly consumed by fire or a great destruction of life, especially by fire.</p>
<p>While the word holocaust, with a meaning of a burnt sacrificial offering, does not have a specifically religious connotation, it appeared widely in religious writings through the centuries, particularly for descriptions of "pagan" rituals involving burnt sacrifices. In secular writings, holocaust most commonly came to mean "a complete or wholesale destruction," a connotation particularly dominant from the late nineteenth century through the nuclear arms race of the mid-twentieth century. During this time, the word was applied to a variety of disastrous events ranging from pogroms against Jews in Russia, to the persecution and murder of Armenians by Turks during World War I, to the attack by Japan on Chinese cities, to large-scale fires where hundreds were killed.</p>
<p>Early references to the Nazi murder of the Jews of Europe continued this usage. As early as 1941, writers occasionally employed the term holocaust with regard to the Nazi crimes against the Jews, but in these early cases, they did not ascribe exclusivity to the term. Instead of "the holocaust," writers referred to "a holocaust," one of many through the centuries. Even when employed by Jewish writers, the term was not reserved to a single horrific event but retained its broader meaning of large-scale destruction. For example:</p>
<p><br />
You are meeting at a time of great tragedy for our people. In our ... deep sense of mourning for those who have fallen ... we must steel our hearts to go on with our work ... that perhaps a better day will come for those who will survive this holocaust. (Chaim Weizmann, letter to Israel Goldstein, December 24, 1942)</p>
<p><br />
What sheer folly to attempt to rebuild any kind of Jewish life [in Europe] after the holocaust of the last twelve years! (Zachariah Shuster, Commentary, December 1945, p.10)</p>
<p><br />
By the late 1940s, [I think late 1950s] however, a shift was underway. Holocaust (with either a lowercase or capital H) became a more specific term due to its use in Israeli translations of the word sho'ah. This Hebrew word had been used throughout Jewish history to refer to assaults upon Jews [NOT TRUE], but by the 1940s it was frequently being applied to the Nazis' murder of the Jews of Europe. (Yiddish-speaking Jews used the term churbn, a Yiddish translation of sho'ah.) The equation of holocaust with sho'ah was seen most prominently in the official English translation of the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, in the translated publications of Yad Vashem throughout the 1950s, and in the journalistic coverage of the Adolf Eichmann trial in Israel in 1961.</p>
<p>Such usage strongly influenced the adoption of holocaust as the primary English-language referent to the Nazi slaughter of European Jewry, but the word's connection to the "Final Solution" did not firmly take hold for another two decades. The April 1978 broadcast of the TV movie, Holocaust, based on Gerald Green's book of the same name, and the very prominent use of the term in President Carter's creation of the President's Commission on the Holocaust later that same year, cemented its meaning in the English-speaking world. These events, coupled with the development and creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum through the 1980s and 1990s, established the term Holocaust (with a capital H) as the standard referent to the systematic annihilation of European Jewry by Germany's Nazi regime.</p>

<p>The LaRouchians aren't anti-capitalists. They're program is completely removed from Marxism. They share some methods with the Healyites and Spartacists but the ideology is quite different. If they are Trotskyists they are crypto-Trotskyist and the accusation is highly speculative unless there is evidence of internal documents that only senior cadre are privy to that spill the beans and no such evidence has come to light even though there are former members who would have access to such info if it existed.AndyL 11:19, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, "maintaining attitudes and habits of thought from their Trot days" is somewhat different from saying "he is in fact still a Trotskyist, and that his ideology is a combination of Trotskyism and LaRouche's own paranoid delusions and fantasies". I agree that they are obviously greatly influenced by the methods and forms of Healyism (for instance) but they aren't ideological Trotskyists in that they completely reject most if not all of Trotsky's ideas - oddly, they still retain a bit of an interest in Rosa Luxemburg though - but I think any "Trotskyism" died out when LaRouche started recruiting people from the PL. As for fascism, they seemed to be headed in that direction in the mid 1970s and with some of their rhetoric in the early 1980s and not having a racial theory does not preclude them from being fascists - Mussolini and the Italian fascists did not have a racial theory either and were not anti-Semitic, at least not until late in the game when what was left of Mussolini's Italy became a satellite of Nazi Germany. King, however, seems to get the fascist label from Newman who was engaging in hyperbole and is not exactly a sound theorist. I do think LaRouche is more of the right because of his capitalism, identification with elites rather than with workers and the "masses" etc. The particulars of his program are, however, a grab-bag - whether his idolisation of FDR and New Deal economics is cynical or genuine I am unclear about but his economic program is centrist, even slightly left of centre. His social program, which is not explicitly stated but is hinted at when you examine LaRouchian views on sex, women, gays, "the counterculture" etc seems to be on the right.</p>
<p>You should try to get a hold of "On the edge: Political Cults Left and Right" by Tim Wohlforth. From what I've seen from the book it seems to have the most incisive analysis of LaRouche. AndyL 16:51, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it is rather unreasonable of you to remove my material "The legacy of Whitlam". It was not eulogistic and I am right about the legislation (check your facts!!!). What I offered was interpretive, yes, but certainly was a fair evaluation of his three years in office and the consequences since. It would have been nice of you to discuss this with me before the deletion. I certainly didn't intrude on the main body of the article.</p>

<dd>You might be perfectly right about the Who Cares status of most photos. I also suspect that photos fairly obviously taken by individuals of their own dogs &amp; stuffed onto wikip w/out copyright fall into the category of "wow one of my photos is in the encyclopedia!" I suppose the motivation for winnowing things out is to avoid the one case where some sensitive type decides to sue for some imagined harm or loss of income... It's a shame that the definition is narrowing, because there are sure an awful lot of good photos uploaded, incl. by pro photogs, who prefer a different or noncommercial license, which makes a lot of sense to me. But I don't know enough about copyright law to know what waters the WP is wading into. I'm leaving things in the articles until an outcry arises or it becomes obvious it's a copyvio. Meanwhile, I like having an organized photo repository. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 00:52, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, Adam:</p>
<p>I'm glad I could pass myself off as Korean, but actually I'm just a boring, 3rd-generation Anglo-/Russo-Canadian! I learned several months ago to spare myself the stress and avoid getting into heated debates (like the endless revert war that transpired at <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Jong-il_a8a4.html" title="Kim Jong-il">Kim Jong-il</a> that you were apparently referring to)...although as an admin, I may end up back in the limelight (though hopefully as a referee rather than as a protagonist).</p>
<p>In reference to contributors, if by "anonymous" you mean "not logged in," I couldn't agree more. &lt;rant&gt;Unfortunately, even if we ignore the usual POV issues, some of the most attrocious and inexplicable edits are made by people from anonymous IP addreses. Twice in 2 days now, I have had to make extensive fixes to 2 of "my" pet articles (<a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_SkyTrain_edd3.html" title="Vancouver SkyTrain">Vancouver SkyTrain</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_of_Korea_b39a.html" title="Rulers of Korea">Rulers of Korea</a>) that were mangled by people who hooked up from anonymous IPs and inserted inexplicable typos, unresearched half facts, and the like. The more new contributors the better, I say, but it's really sometimes exasperating.&lt;/rant&gt; (If, however, by "anonymous" you mean "not using one's real name," then you may be in a small minority among Wikipedians these days!)</p>
<p>One more issue: I know <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">User:WhisperToMe</a> has been raising your (and others') ire—I've seen the evidence on various talk pages. I think he's improving. As for the business of having so many variant romanizations, etc., on various articles, yes, it was out of hand. I introduced tables into various Korea-related articles to move all the variant spellings in different scripts out of the article body, so that each article does not start off with a long, unreadable first sentence. &lt;rant&gt;Hopefully, the tables will discourage people from adding <i>yet more</i> almost invariably incorrect romanized spellings for articles, since each table preemptively lists the <b>authoritative</b> spelling of the term in the 2 official romanization systems (along with whatever idiosyncratic spelling the article's title actually uses), so someone can't come along and add yet another spelling and claim it's legit. I have at least convinced Whisper to stop using Yale Romanization, a <i>third</i> romanization system and horrible abomination that only linguists perversely insist on using.&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry for venting my spleen like this, but I gather you have somewhat similar views on these issues, and I do admire your iconoclasm.

<p>Karski</p>
<p>Yes, it was Belzec that he may have visited. I don't think the revisionist attack should be mentioned, but I will look up the Jerusalem Post article mentioned in the revisionist article (Interview by Emie Meyer, Jerusalem Post, week ending June 28, 1986, p.9) to see what is really there. It will take a few days. Here's my guess: Bauer's suggestion about the labor camp was made to solve the problem of matching Karsk's observation of "Belzec" to the facts otherwise known about it. <b>Btw</b>, did you see my note at <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Carr_Drafts2_0e23.html" title="User talk:Adam Carr/Drafts2">User talk:Adam Carr/Drafts2</a>? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 07:26, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only pic I could find on the web is located <a href="http://polskaludowa.com/biografie/jpg/Rokossowski.jpg" class="external text" title="http://polskaludowa.com/biografie/jpg/Rokossowski.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The page it's no is copyrighted, but I doubt the picture is as most probably it is from some Polish government publication from early fifties. Anyway, I asked Paweł Rudzki, the mayor of this museum and he replied that all materials on his site can be used freely with the link to his site provided. Too bad I couldn't find any bigger pic. That's probably because Rokossowski in Poland served as a so-called <i>C/o Pole</i> (<i>Pełniący obowiązki Polaka</i> in Polish), which ment that he felt more of a Soviet officer than a Pole and he used mostly his Soviet uniform. The funny thing is that he (together with hundreds of other Soviet officers transferred to the Polish Army) was forced to wear Polish unifor which he tried to avoid. That's why even newspapers mostly published his pics in full gala - meaning the Soviet uniform with a christmas tree of orders and medals...

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>I tried to consider which parties are liberal parties. Most liberals in Europe wouldn't consider the Liberal Party of Australia as a liberal party, but see it as a conservative party, like the UK conservatives. I know it is the result of the orginal liberal current in Australia combined with others. On what issues outside the economy the LPA can be considered liberal? Gay rights?, position towards immigrants etc. I see that confirmed by the adherence of the LPA to the International Democratic Union, the co-operation of conservative parties world wide. On the other had I still see a difference between social democrats and liberals. See the discussion in the article <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, the paragraph on Liberalism and social democracy. As far as I can see the Australian Democrats come quit cloese to the left wing of European liberalism. Considering the Progressives I might have been to fast, but if it is a party between the Democrats and the LPA, it might be a right label. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Gangulf</a> 16:27, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

We do it for many other countries, so why is Thailand less and should it have all of it's history written in two articles? I think the current setup is right. A <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Thailand_fbd7.html" title="History of Thailand">history of Thailand</a> page which leads to a short narrative history that you wrote. And then seperate more specialistic articles about Ayutthaya and so on. I totally disagree that we should put it all in one place. Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, Lopburi, Haripunchai, Nakhon Sri Thammarat and many others were kingdoms/principalities in the territory of what we call Thailand today. Not even all of these principalities and kingdoms were Thai. Many were Thai, but you have Mon kingdoms, Malay kingdoms, Northern Thai kingdoms (the Thai themselves consider them seperate) and Khmer kingdoms. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a></dd>

<dd><i>They were an integral part of Siamese history and should be treated as such</i> I do not contest this. Otherwise I would have contested their entry in the history of Thailand article. I didn't do that! I think both Mark and Andy will not contest that either. What we do contest though is that the histories of these periods are "rich" enough to be written about extensively in seperate articles. Instead of just a short entry in the History of Thailand articles. So much more happened. For instance the powerplay between the Burmese kingdoms, Lannathai, Lan Xang and Ayutthaya. This alone warrants it own articles. These are important episodes which shaped Thailand into what it is today. <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 09:02, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And as said before - this not an history book, but an encyclopedia, and as an online encyclopedia one which finds many reads with a short attention span. So someone interested in the history of Thailand might first read the very short section in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, then the more detailled overview in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Thailand_fbd7.html" title="History of Thailand">History of Thailand</a>. And then eventually plunge into one of the very detailled articles on on of the main periods of history, or one of the local kingdoms, or on one of the important historical events. For example the Paknam incident (which I want to write about once I can get the book covering it in detail) warrants a detailled article on its own, but of course also needs to be mentioned shortly in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Thailand_fbd7.html" title="History of Thailand">History of Thailand</a> and a bit more detailled in History of Thailand after 1786. You cannot force a topic which has enough noteworthy details that warrant a whole book about it into one article without either loose details or scare of those who want the overview. So most of the text you added IMHO belongs into the detailled articles like <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayutthaya_kingdom.html" title="Ayutthaya kingdom">Ayutthaya kingdom</a>, instead of converting those to redirects. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:12, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that the LaRoucheys are difficult to deal with, but please try to avoid totally writing off their points.

And, in the absence of a hard arbcom ruling, which we are clearly in the absence of, there's not really any way to deal with this article beyond compromise.

<p>While I understand your views on Herch, and I'm not entirely unsympathetic to them, the arbcom declined to do a substantial ban on him, which means that he is as much a bona fide editor as you or I.
