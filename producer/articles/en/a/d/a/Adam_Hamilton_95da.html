<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Hamilton_95da.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Hamilton was born in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrest_Hill%2C_New_Zealand_9097.html" title="Forrest Hill, New Zealand">Forrest Hill</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southland%2C_New_Zealand_e6a6.html" title="Southland, New Zealand">Southland</a>. He originally trained to become a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_minister.html" title="Religious minister">minister</a>, but later decided not to pursue this course. He married Mary Ann McDonald in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, he and his brother started a grain business in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winton%2C_New_Zealand_56ba.html" title="Winton, New Zealand">Winton</a>. In <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, he was rejected for service on medical grounds.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Hamilton_95da.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1919_8db0.html" title="New Zealand general election 1919">1919 elections</a>, Hamilton was elected to Parliament in the Southland seat of Wallace, standing as a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Reform_Party_4b81.html" title="New Zealand Reform Party">Reform Party</a> candidate. His brother was also elected, winning the neighbouring seat of Awarua from <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Ward_aed2.html" title="Joseph Ward">Joseph Ward</a>. The brothers then sold their business, although Adam Hamilton remained active in the Southland agricultural sector. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1922_1995.html" title="New Zealand general election 1922">1922 elections</a>, the brothers were both defeated, but they regained their seats in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1925_b085.html" title="New Zealand general election 1925">1925 elections</a>. Adam Hamilton retained his seat until his retirement, although his brother was defeated again shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>When the Reform Party formed a coalition with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_e4dc.html" title="United Party (New Zealand)">United Party</a>, Hamilton was made Minister of Internal Affairs. He also served, at various times, as Minister of Telegraphs, Postmaster General, Minister of Labour, and Minister of Employment. He was not popular in these roles — <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> had resulted in high levels of unemployment, and Hamilton was often criticised for the government's failure to improve the situation. He was also criticised when the Post and Telegraph Department <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamming.html" title="Jamming">jammed</a> a pro-<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour</a> broadcast on a private radio station. Hamilton denied knowledge, but his reputation was nevertheless damaged.</p>
<p><a name="Party_leader" id="Party_leader"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Hamilton_95da.html" title="Edit section: Party leader">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Party leader</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, after losing power to the Labour Party, Reform and United agreed to merge, creating the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Party_f015.html" title="New Zealand National Party">National Party</a>. Despite his somewhat tarnished public image, Hamilton was selected to lead the new party, taking over from interim leader <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_William_Forbes_d09e.html" title="George William Forbes">George Forbes</a>. Hamilton was essentially a compromise candidate — Forbes and his main opponent, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Coates_1764.html" title="Gordon Coates">Gordon Coates</a>, refused to serve under each other, and the Coates faction backed Hamilton as an acceptable alternative. Forbes himself is believed to have preferred Charles Wilkinson, but Coates (formerly the leader of Reform) was determined to have a fellow Reformist as leader. Hamilton was duly elected, although only by one vote.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of his appointment, many did not see Hamilton as the National Party's real leader. He was frequently accused by being a puppet of Coates, with suggestions even being made that Hamilton was merely holding the position until Coates built up the strength to take it himself. Hamilton was not particularly charismatic, and did not inspire great loyalty from his colleagues. He was also closely associated in the public mind with the Depression era.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1938_6ccf.html" title="New Zealand general election 1938">1938 elections</a>, Hamilton and the National Party were harshly critical of the Labour Party government, accusing it of promoting <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> and of undermining the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. The campaign was seen by many as alarmist and negative, and Hamilton's own performance was criticised. On election day, National was heavily defeated.</p>
<p>The National Party's defeat weakened Hamilton's grasp on the leadership somewhat, but any debate was cut short by the onset of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, Hamilton suggested that Labour and National should form a wartime coalition, but this was rejected by Labour leader <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Fraser_6d1d.html" title="Peter Fraser">Peter Fraser</a>. Fraser did, however, agree to establish a six-person "War Cabinet". This cabinet would control New Zealand's military endeavours, while leaving domestic concerns to the regular cabinet. The War Cabinet would consist of four Labour MPs and two National MPs. Hamilton and Forbes were National's two representatives. Participation in the War Cabinet was fatally damaging to Hamilton's leadership of the National Party, however, as many National MPs argued that he could not be party leader while serving on a Labour-led council. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">25 November</a>, a vote of 13 to 8 replaced Hamilton with <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Holland_581f.html" title="Sidney Holland">Sidney Holland</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Hamilton_95da.html" title="Edit section: Later career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later career</span></h2>
<p>Hamilton remained a part of the War Cabinet, and was eventually joined by Holland (despite the original claims that a National Party leader could not be in Cabinet). In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, however, National withdrew from all co-operation with the Labour Party. Hamilton, along with Gordon Coates, protested this move, and ceased attending National <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucus.html" title="Caucus">caucus</a> meetings. Both Hamilton and Coates then rejoined the war administration despite condemnation from their party colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually, Hamilton managed to gain rapprochement with the National Party, and he contested the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1943_0e64.html" title="New Zealand general election 1943">1943 elections</a> as a National candidate. He did not seek re-election in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1946_379d.html" title="New Zealand general election 1946">1946 elections</a>, choosing to retire from politics.</p>
<p>Hamilton died in <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invercargill.html" title="Invercargill">Invercargill</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">29 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>.</p>
