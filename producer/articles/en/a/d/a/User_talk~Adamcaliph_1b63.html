<dd>It's good to see another Muslim user as there are many articles related to Islam in need of NPOV'ing.

<p>Adam, as you've probably figured out, Zereshk is extremely unhappy with me, and stopped any work on the Shi'a article because he could not have a free hand. There was one thing I thought that he was uniquely fitted to write, and that one thing is still missing: an account of the Shi'a clergy, the various ranks, how they are attained, how the scholars are supported, etc. For us non-Shi'a, the difference between an Ayatollah and a Grand Ayatollah is mysterious. Is the ulema or clergy something you could explain? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:31, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Asalaamu 'alaykum Zora. I hope you are able to read this. I have never actually directly written to another member as yet, so I hope this is the right place to type. It would be good to include a page about Shi'a clergy and the details that you mentioned. However, it will take me time to even begin because I am very busy. But I will definitely try to gather what I can. By the way, where are you from and what does UTC mean? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamcaliph_0603.html" title="User:Adamcaliph">User:Adamcaliph</a> 01:37 GMT, 6 Jun 2005.</p>

<p>Hullo Adam. Usually people reply to messages on the other user's talk page. You'd click on my name and then go to the talk page. I think it's a dumb and confusing system myself -- it's nice to have everything together, so you can see all the replies. Anyway, I am an older woman with a daughter in college; I live in Honolulu, Hawai'i. I grew up on the U.S. mainland, in Oregon. I spose the best description for me would be counter-cultural intellectual. I am a Buddhist, even though I was raised as a Christian. I've been reading about Islam ever since 9/11. My response to things is to read, so when I wanted to figure out why those strange people would want to kill me, I went to books. I figure the best way to understand Islam is to try to understand what's TRUE about it. In spite of all the evil done in its name, there has to be something true at the heart. All this makes me sound kind and nice, but Zereshk will tell you that I am tigress in defence of what I see as good prose and my understanding of NPOV. Be warned &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:14, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>P.S. UTC means Universal Time Code, and it's the new, PC name for GMT, Greenwich Mean Time. Greenwich time implied "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves". UTC just means "we're sticking with this convention because we've used it for so long and 00:00 just happens to be midnight at Greenwich, U.K."</dd>

<p>Hello Zora. Sorry; I found your "User" page but could not find your "User Talk" page. It's sometimes difficult to establish the scope of political correctness. I personally try not to fall into the habit of using "A.D." because I accept Jesus as God's prophet, not as my "Lord". Unfortunately, in England, political correctness has become an embarassing nuisance where the Christmas break may eventually be referred to as the "Festive" season. Ironically, it seems that no religious group in England has objected to the label of "Christmas". Do we refrain from using the term "North" Pole merely because it may be inferred that the centre of human civilisation is midway between the two ice caps and that such usage implies a sense of antropocentricty? However, I too am very sensitive to definitions; and it is the lack of proper defintions that has caused the most amount of damage to people's perceptions of Islam. I commend you for referring to authentic books before resorting to chain-mails and poorly argued Internet debates. Nice to meet you. [[User:Adamcaliph 03:14, 9 June 2005 (GMT).</p>

<p>I dunno if you'd be interested, but we have a "situation" at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a>, with one editor, AladdinSE, insisting that the Sunni version of events is the one to be adopted. He is prepared to revert endlessly to maintain his control of the article. Striver is complicating matters by providing his own Shi'a-centric version. I'm trying to deal with a centuries-old religious schism in an NPOV fashion. Can you help us to work towards an NPOV version? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:36, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, I've rewritten those two articles. I'd like your opinion. You could especially help with the Abu Lu'lu'ah article, because I have a feeling that there's a Shi'a POV in this matter that's not represented, and I can't find anything on the web about it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:29, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you have added "His birth and family life" when it was "Birth and family life". That's actually worsening the style. If you read featured article biographies they don't use the pronoun since it's implied. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Borlaug_653f.html" title="Norman Borlaug">Norman Borlaug</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dee_d7cc.html" title="John Dee">John Dee</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_N._Page_50f6.html" title="William N.

Heinlein</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Butler_Yeats_9515.html" title="William Butler Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> are just some featured pages that back me up. You have also created some really small sections that probably shouldn't have been broken up, not to mention a tendency to add "persecution" and other things trying to hammer in a certain POV. Persecution will be noticed for what it is in NPOV writing, making a header is deciding for the reader instead of presenting to the reader... which is not what we should be doing. I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasan_al-Askari&amp;diff=24725015&amp;oldid=24722028" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hasan_al-Askari&amp;diff=24725015&amp;oldid=24722028" rel="nofollow">this</a> fixes it up some. I wasn't sure what to put for knowledge. It's too abstract, if he was a fiqah you might want to put "Career as fiqah" <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 12:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good, his just is cluttery. As for persecution... well, it's a broad persecution of the people I believe (I haven't really read it). This is talking about a period of his life as persecution... which, the whole period I don't think should be classified as such? It was the period in Baghdad, or... it wasn't all persecution and there are mixed accounts. I think it's something that should be about a part of life in the header and then talk about the conditions of the Imams in the text. I don't really disagree that they were persecuted, from what I know they were, the other Muslims often sucked a lot in regards to treating Shia (and still do in Saudi Arabia and all). However, I think putting that as the header is not proper since it's not an overarching non-arguable thing like life under the Ummayad, or life in Baghdad. It's an arguable and non-simplistic point and headers should be simplistic truths. Does that seem to make sense? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 20:08, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
