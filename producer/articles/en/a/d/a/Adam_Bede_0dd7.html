<p>The story's plot follows four characters rural lives in the fictional community of Hayslopeâ€”a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>.

<p>The importance of the <i><a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrical_Ballads_fb6b.html" title="Lyrical Ballads">Lyrical Ballads</a></i> to the way <i>Adam Bede</i> is written has often been noted. Like its model, Adam Bede features minutely detailed empirical and psychological observations about illiterate "common folk" who, because of their greater proximity to nature than to culture, are taken as emblematic of human nature in its more pure form. So behind its humble appearance this is a novel of great ambition.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre_painting.html" title="Genre painting">Genre painting</a> and the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> arose together as middle-class art forms and retained close connections until the end of the nineteenth century. According to Richard Stang, it was a French treatise of 1846 on Dutch and Flemish painting that first popularized the application of the term realism to fiction.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> And certainly it is with <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flemish</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> genre painting that George Eliot's realism is most often compared. She herself invites the comparison in chapter 17 of <i>Adam Bede</i>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Praz_9592.html" title="Mario Praz">Mario Praz</a> applies it to all of her work in his study of <i>The Hero in Eclipse in Victorian Fiction</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Immediately recognized as a significant literary work, <i>Adam Bede</i> has enjoyed a largely positive critical reputation since its publication. An anonymous review in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Athenaeum_39c5.html" title="The Athenaeum">The Athenaeum</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a> praised it as a "novel of the highest class," and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> called it "a first-rate novel." Contemporary reviewers, often influenced by nostalgia for the earlier period represented in <i>Bede</i>, enthusiastically praised Eliot's characterizations and realistic representations of rural life. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The whole country life that the story is set in, is so real, and so droll and genuine, and yet so selected and polished by art, that I cannot praise it enough to you." (Hunter, S. 122)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, in early criticism, the tragedy of infanticide has often been overlooked in favor of the peaceful idyllic world and familiar personalities Eliot recreated.<sup id="_ref-enotes_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enotes" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other critics have been less generous. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_James_3a8a.html" title="Henry James">Henry James</a>, among others, resented the narrator's interventions. In particular, Chapter 15 has fared poorly among scholars because of the author's/narrator's moralizing and meddling in an attempt to sway readers' opinions of <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> and Dinah. Other critics have objected to the resolution of the story. In the final moments, Hetty, about to be executed for infanticide, is saved by her seducer, Arthur Donnithorne. Critics have argued that this <i>deus ex machina</i> ending negates the moral lessons learned by the main characters. Without the eleventh hour reprieve, the suffering of Adam, Arthur, and <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> would have been more realistically concluded. In addition, some scholars feel that Adam's marriage to <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> is another instance of the author's/narrator's intrusiveness. These instances have been found to directly conflict with the otherwise realistic images and events of the novel.<sup id="_ref-enotes_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enotes" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<li>Lisbeth Bede: Lisbeth is married to Thias Bede, and is mother of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> and Seth.

She is worried about either of her sons getting married because she is afraid that this will render her useless in the household.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Mr. Martin Poyser (the younger): This dairy farmer is a jolly man whose only hard words are reserved for farmers who do not do their jobs well. <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> is his niece, and, being very fond of Adam Bede, Martin hopes that the two might marry.</li>
<li>Mrs. Poyser: Mrs. Poyser is an excellent dairy farmer. She speaks her mind quite strongly and can be hard on her family, but generally she is fairly wise.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty Sorrel</a>: <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> lives on Mr. Poyser's dairy farm because she is his niece.

She does not have many attractive personal qualities, however, and is very vain and selfish.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah Morris</a>: Dinah is a quiet, pious young woman who is a Methodist preacher. At the beginning of the novel, she lives at the Poyser Farm because she is Mrs. Poyser's niece.

<li>Molly: Molly is the Poysers' housemaid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Donnithorne family
<ul>
<li>Arthur Donnithorne (the Captain): The Captain is the heir to the estate of his grandfather and therefore is the future landlord of many of the characters in the novel. At only twenty-one, he is a healthy, attractive boy who has very little self-control. He is in love with <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> Sorrel.</li>
<li>Squire Donnithorne (the old Squire): The old Squire is the Captain's grandfather. He is a formal old man who dislikes his grandson and who is disliked by most of his tenants because he manages the land badly.</li>
<li>Miss Lydia: Miss Lydia is a formal woman who is Arthur's aunt. Arthur surmises that his grandfather will cut her off in his will to improve Arthur's inheritance, despite the fact that Miss Lydia has waited on the old Squire for his whole life.</li>
<li>Mr. Casson: A stout man, Mr. Casson has been a butler for the Donnithornes for fifteen years.</li>
<li>Mr. Craig: Mr. Craig is the Donnithornes' gardener. He is in love with <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> Sorrel, but his first love is hot house plants. He is vaguely Scottish; Eliot says that this is because "all French teachers are Parisian and all gardeners are Scottish."</li>
<li>Mrs. Best: Mrs. Best is the Donnithornes' housekeeper.</li>
<li>Gawaine: This young nobleman is a friend of Arthur Donnithorne's, whom he often dines with.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The Irwine family
<ul>
<li>Parson Irwine (the vicar): The old vicar is a comfortable sort of person who has remained a bachelor for his whole life. He is not religious in an intense way, and he is respected and well liked by his parishioners. He takes very good care of his mother and invalid sister.</li>
<li>Mrs. Irwine: The parson's mother is a stately old woman. One can see her good breeding in the noble cut of her face and chin. She has no patience for unattractive people. She encourages her godson, Arthur, to marry a "handsome" woman.</li>
<li>Miss Anne: The vicar's invalid sister has a very small role in the novel, usually being too sick to leave her bed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Burge family
<ul>
<li>Mr. Jonathan Burge: Mr. Burge is the master carpenter whom <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam Bede</a> works for. Many people expect <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> to marry Mary Burge so that he can become partners with her father.</li>
<li>Mary Burge: Mary is in love with Adam Bede. She is a sallow-faced, unremarkable girl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wiry Ben: Wiry Ben is a joker who works in the shop with the Bede brothers. He thinks that his solo dancing is very good.</li>
<li>Chad Cranage: Chad, the town blacksmith, has an extremely silly wife.</li>
<li>Chad's Bess: Chad's wife is extremely buxom and red cheeked. Like Hetty, she is extremely vain and wears gaudy earrings, which Dinah's preaching convinces her to take off temporarily.</li>
<li>Joshua Rann: The village shoemaker is very proud of his skills on the fiddle and plays at the Chase while Wiry Ben dances.</li>
<li>Timothy's Bess: Timothy's Bess should really be called after her husband, who is Sandy Jim. She is the cousin of Chad's Bess.</li>
<li>Sandy Jim: Sandy Jim is a local man who also works in Mr. Burge's shop.</li>
<li>Will Maskery: A contentious wheelmaker, Will Maskery was a lot less responsible until he "found" Methodism.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Honour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Honour</span></h3>
<p>Honour is an ancient theme with special resonance in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">mediaeval</a> times, which is fitting in a novel set in a town that has an almost <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudal</a> landlord. There are two types of honour in this novel: that of females, and that of males. Female honour is fairly passive and relies entirely on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chastity.html" title="Chastity">chastity</a>. If women lose this chastity, they are helpless to regain their honour. Male honour is more complicated and more active. Honor is tied up in their profession, land, and overall identity. When <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> runs away as a young boy because of family unhappiness, he chooses to return partially in order to maintain the honor of his family by keeping it economically afloat. He knows that the only way to provoke Arthur to fight is by insulting his honour, so instead of reproaching him, he calls him a coward.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Love">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Love</span></h3>
<p>The novel includes a few examples of true love based on mutual attraction. One positive example of mutual love is the relationship between <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> at the end of the novel. But it takes others around them to work out their feelings for them, showing that it is not only mutual love that is important, but also a mutual love that is recognized and supported by both of the families of the lovers. Indeed, society matters for love; in other relationships, the complicating factor is always socioeconomic class, because the novel is set in a time period when marriage was more of a contract than a romantic affair. This problem extends to both men and women. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam Bede</a> is expected to marry Mary Burge merely because it would be an advantageous business proposition. Afterwards, he could become partners with her father, a man who had been his boss. What is more, there are two class-related barriers to a love affair between Arthur and Hetty. The first is obvious: Arthur cannot easily marry someone so far below his social class. The second is more subtle: it is unclear whether <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> would be as attracted to Arthur if it were not for his wealth. When she does dream of their future together, she imagines the luxuries that he could provide her with, rather than the life that they could have together. There is even an impediment to Adam's courtship of Hetty, a pair who might seem to be of the same social stratum. Before his promotion to steward of the forest, some townspeople say that <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> is reaching too high trying to land the niece of a large dairy farmer.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Nature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nature</span></h3>
<p>Nature is a constant presence in all of Eliot's novels. Unlike many romantic novelists, she does not make the weather correspond directly with her principal characters' moods or feelings. Rather, she comments on the sort of injustice that the weather always seems to be at its most beautiful when man is going through a particular hardship. This disconnection of natural life from human life is part of Eliot's literary doctrine of painstaking realism. Rather than have the weather reflect her characters' feelings, she quite accurately has her characters mark their memories and experiences in the context of their actual environment. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> marks his movement from happiness to adulthood by the beech tree that he contemplated moments before seeing <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> and Arthur kiss under it. <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> marks her homeward journey not to return to the family farm, but to regain some scenery that is familiar to her. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_%28character%29_c00b.html" title="Adam Bede (character)">Adam</a> always refer to his interception of her in Snowfield and their agreement to marry as "the meeting on the hill."<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Industry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h3>
<p>Eliot wrote Adam Bede at the time that the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> was beginning to change the face of life in Britain. More and more ingenious inventions meant that farmers were caught up in industry, and many moved away from their small towns into bigger cities. The village that Eliot portrays is a holdout against this new lifestyle, but the presence of new industry is indicated by the mill that <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> works at when she is home. Eliot comments that <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> is drawn to this town as well as to the industrial town of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> which, along with <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> is drawn to such towns because of the great misery in them. Eliot seems to side with many poets and authors in lamenting the onset of industry insofar as it alienates people from nature. Eliot personifies the spirit of Leisure in contrast to this new industry, describing him as a portly old gentleman with excellent digestion.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Motherhood" id="Motherhood"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Motherhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Motherhood</span></h3>
<p>As a novel which centers on an infanticide by a mother, Adam Bede is necessarily preoccupied with motherhood. The most obvious example of a strong mother figure is Lisbeth Bede, who loves her son, Adam, almost too much. She is constantly worried about where he is, what he is doing, and whether he has had enough to eat. Her constant nagging, which irritates Adam, also shames him. Lisbeth's relationship with Seth is a much easier one, perhaps because she loves him just a little less â€” and therefore nags him just a little less. It is important to note that neither <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> nor <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> has a mother anymore. Both of them were orphaned and live with their uncle or aunt, respectively. The lack of a mother figure affects each of them profoundly. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> quickly grows into a mother figure herself, looking after and waiting on others before herself. Seth describes a young boy even climbing into her lap to be held during one of her preaching sessions. Hetty, in contrast, lacking strong guidance, grows up vain and petty. When she has a child of her own, admittedly under extremely tough circumstances, she kills it by burying it. She does have some motherly feelings, however, noting that she could not bear to look at its "little hands or little face" before she buried it. She imagines that she continues to hear it crying. This is why she returns to the spot where she buried it, and this is why she is apprehended as a criminal.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Sacrifice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sacrifice</span></h3>
<p>Because religion (in particular, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a>) is of such importance in this novel, the issue of sacrifice â€” and its nobility â€” comes up quite often. The character most inclined toward sacrifice, Dinah, is also the most religious. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> is content to spend her life serving others if she thinks that she can bring them some comfort. This notion of sacrifice is parodied by Mrs. Poyser, who thinks that <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> takes the idea to an extreme. Mrs. Poyser is upset that <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> moves back and forth between different parishes, trying to calculate in which one the life is hardest so that she can choose the one needing the most help. Her aunt says of <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> that she would only marry if the man were a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> and lame, consistent with her doctrine of help and sacrifice. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> must struggle against her conscience in order to allow herself to marry Adam, because she thinks that she loves him too much--it would be too little of a sacrifice. Eliot makes it clear that this argument (if not Dinah's whole perspective on sacrifice) is somewhat ridiculous, and besides, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> changes her mind in a short time and agrees to marry Adam. Eliot suggests that sacrifice is worthwhile for the most part, but not to an extent whereby it prevents overall personal happiness or other goods such as the creation of a family.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Female_Identity_and_Autonomy" id="Female_Identity_and_Autonomy"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Bede_0dd7.html" title="Edit section: Female Identity and Autonomy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Female Identity and Autonomy</span></h3>
<p>The issue of female identity is often at the forefront of George Eliot's novels, even in one named after a man, such as <i>Adam Bede</i>. Of course, in the mid-Victorian period Eliot was writing in a male-dominated world; for instance, she saw a need to assume a male pen-name in order to protect her identity and popularize her writing. Among the most memorable characters in the novel are women with strong voices who are attached to men.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most confident female character is <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah Morris</a> , who asserts her identity to Lisbeth Bede in Chapter Ten, announcing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I am <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah Morris</a> and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home."</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> is also a confident and effective female preacher. Her resistance to marriage because she is worried that it will curtail her religious teaching is resolved by Eliot in a manner calculated not to upset the male hierarchy. It turns out that <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> was not in fact prevented from a traditional marriage by religiosity, but rather by the fact that no man that she truly loved had yet asked her to marry him. Indeed, she quiets into a typical housewife at the end of the novel, even consenting to discontinue her preaching because the Methodist men have decided that it is not a good idea.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another strong female voice in <i>Adam Bede</i> is Mrs. Poyser. She is much more intelligent than her husband, and she has much more control over their farm than he does. She inevitably has her "say out," which involves working up her courage to tell her hated landlord what everyone in the community thinks of him. She prefaces this opinion with,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Then, sir, if I may speak--as for all I'm a a woman, and there's folks as thinks a woman's fool enough to stan' by an' look on while the men sign her soul away, I've a right to speak..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Still, Mrs. Poyser's marriage to Mr. Poyser gives her an added ethos in contrast to that of an outspoken maiden or, in Victorian fiction, the stock character of a dangerous widow.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hetty Sorrel, in contrast to these stronger women, lacks the power or the initiative to speak up for herself. <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetty_Sorrel_5b27.html" title="Hetty Sorrel">Hetty</a> does not speak very much, and her preferred method of seduction is to burst into tears rather than to have a conversation. She pays dearly for this quietness, because she is not able to ask for help when she becomes pregnant. When she finally admits to <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Morris_b49f.html" title="Dinah Morris">Dinah</a> in the jail cell that "I did it," this first instance of her assertion of agency comes far too late.<sup id="_ref-GradeSaver_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GradeSaver" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
