<p>Hi there&#160;:) I see you and I have both been talking to 70.44.20.57. I just wanted to point out that you left him a first-level warning test1 message after he'd already received a test4 from me for today. I don't know if you're using a tool like VandalProof to leave messages or if you're doing it manually, but please be careful that you're escalating test messages correctly for the most effective vandalism-fighting possible. I really hope you don't find this message rude - I'm as much of a vandalism vigilante as you are and I just want us to work as hard as possible. Thanks very much, and happy vandal-hunting! -<a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaCha%27ar_c718.html" title="User:RaCha'ar">RaCha'ar</a> 02:06, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can't tell you, as I haven't yet been approved to use it. You have to have at least 250 namespace edits and as of the last time I applied, I didn't even come close. I knew of a utility to find out how many namespace edits you have but I have lost track of it; I'm just going to keep going for a bit longer before I try applying again. I personally like doing it at least partially manually, so I can take a close look at the test messages that have already been left on a user's page, but <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">popups</a> makes it a LOT easier than doing reverts and everything else manually. You might try popups before you try VandalProof. &#160;:) -<a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaCha%27ar_c718.html" title="User:RaCha'ar">RaCha'ar</a> 02:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>look on the 3rd paragraph. he should get as much credit as anyone else. the reason started editing this is because for school we have to do a project on a charity org., and i choose UNICEF, and it bothered me when he wasent on there.</p>

<p>I was correcting the word 'revert', which I think should be '<a href="http://www.onelook.com/?w=evert" class="external text" title="http://www.onelook.com/?w=evert" rel="nofollow">evert</a>'.</p>
<p>I think 'revert' is wrong. I suppose 'invert' would be ok, but I think 'evert' is the appropriate medical term.</p>

<dd>Evert is correct. Without the strings the valve leaflets would blow backward and outward "evert" into the low pressure chamber.

<p>Possibly a little combative, but clear. You might want to make it clearer that, although citing is important, this doesn't necessarily mean a footnote at the end of every sentence. This is a misunderstanding which leads many to avoid citing these sort of things. Also, this would only be on the talk page, yes?

<dd>Yea, it would be on the talk page. The only reason I threw in a flair of sternness in the template was because of some of the questionable interpretations I just came across: "This sonnet has suggestions of references to masturbation Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse. The suggestion is that the male in the sonnet should be procreation to preserve his beauty rather than engaging in self-pleasure.".

<p>Ah, you'll get me started on a what-do-they-teach-the-kids-these-days-rant with that one.</p>
<p>The poetic diction of "the word" is a fascinating subject; the use of parallelism (in English: In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God) was a classic element of the Hebrew poetry of the Old Testament, and John invoked the device in Greek, just as he was invoking the opening of Genesis (which had God creating in the beginning rather than being in the beginning). John had a tremendous poetic voice, which is well brought out in many of the translations.</p>
<p>T.S. Eliot certainly considered that line Poetry - it is a line of Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning Service, one of his Sweeney poems.<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/199/23.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/199/23.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Indeed, it is one of the few lines in the poem that seems to be decipherable without a dictionary.</p>
<p>And, as a quote, I thought there was a richness to using the idea of "the word" to invoke poetry.</p>

<dd>Sorry I didn't realize you added that (I didn't view the history). I figured it was a POV christianity pusher with an agenda.--I have no problem with including that quote--It's good to include more than just British and American poetry, but we might draw the ire of atheists and non-Christians. Also, we might want to make any excerpt longer to make the poeticism more obvious. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 19:12, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't worry about it - I'll find a good rap quote to replace it. I believe most Americans listen to poetry for about 20 hours a week without realizing it - in song lyrics, on TV (all those ads!), and at religious services (whether Friday, Saturday or Sunday). They just don't pay attention to it, or care about what is good and what is bad among it. So you'll see a number of unpoetic poetry quotes from me over time - I'm much less fond of the obvious stuff. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 19:22, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is also an entirely plausible claim made by several opponents of his "alcoholism is a disease" concept (for which I currently have no independent verification) that Yale forced him to re-examine his 1946 work and, upon re-examination, Jellinek himself declared the entire study to be wrong (e.g., <a href="http://www.baldwinresearch.com/alcoholism.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baldwinresearch.com/alcoholism.cfm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Anyway, I have done as much as I can to keep it neutral, and I hope that it meets your approval. Also, I have only just discovered how to cross-reference to another language. I had discovered that the German Wiki had a short piece on him, so I inserted cross-references at "both ends". I think that the article reads rather well, especially as it clearly shows that Jellinek was far from the first to do many of the things that his AA allies had claimed priority on his behalf. Footnote: Once I have finished the appropriate piece in the placebo article, I will check whether the Jelllinek piece needs any re-editing.

<dd>Ah. I see the confusion. It is true Keir Johnson is not a trainer of ponies, nor is he a hippo. The definition I contributed is wrought by slang appropriate to the subject matter. The Communist Manifesto is not the well known Marx writing. It is a journal regarding camping at skatespots across America. Keir actually does communicate with Brad Pitt (or claims to and falsifies the evidence). I do admit I took liberties describing his bachelor status, and I was colorful describing his parent's affection toward his accomplishments.</dd>

<dd>If Wikipedia requires entries to be written in the vernacular, I understand the reaction. However, there are certain things about hiphop and skateboarding that do not translate well to the large audience. I do not think a large audience appeal is appropriate in this context. My definition was more appropriate and informative to the audience that would actually visit Keir's entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.49.15.155 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.49.15.155.html" title="User talk:68.49.15.155">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.49.15.155_94f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.49.15.155">contribs</a>) .</small>

<p>I personally liked it when it said, "...ignore them and go about your business." My recent revision was in that spirit, because it seems to complete the statement.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Ugonna Wachuku</span></h3>
<p>This article does not violate Wikipedia verifiable content principles as<a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">User:Dlyons493</a> suggests. The quoted letter from Kofi Annan is verifiable. And a copy can be faxed to wikipedia's <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> if need be. The letter was written and signed by Kofi Annan himself and not his secretary. Kofi Annan himself can be contacted by Wikipedia. So, I don't see why my fellow editors are saying that the Ugonna Wachuku article is not verifiable.</p>
<p>The facts in the article are verifiable wen looked at closely with an open mind. Webcity Resources, Ltd that Wachuku is Chairman of is also verifiable in Lagos, Nigeria - except that the Web site of the company is currently being upgraded and is not available for the moment. If that company is a problem, then as the contributor of the article, I can remove that sentence. Also, <i>The Great Place</i> a book by Ugonna Wachuku is also real and verifiable - if only <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">User:Dlyons493</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> would be objective and not cynical.

<p>As you may have gathered, discussions have been raging for about a week on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WT%7EESP_1b68.html" title="WT:ESP">the <i>Esperanza</i> talk page</a> as to the future direction of Esperanza. Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>. Basically, the whole leadership has had a reshuffle, so please review the new, improved charter.</p>
<p>As a result, we are electing 4 people this month. They will replace <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> and form a new tranche A, serving until December.

<p>I've been watching the discussion about the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Periodic_table_%28Chinese%29_2b06.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Periodic table (Chinese)">Periodic Table (Chinese)</a> after I originally voted to Merge. I've re-read the article itself several times now, and I really think it's worth keeping. I noticed that you had put enough thought into it to make extra comments (heh, heh) and even change your vote. You are a more experienced Wikipedian than I, so I'd like you're opinion on this: Do you think the article has enough content to really stand on its own without merging? If the content is sufficient I would change my vote to a straight Keep. And BTW, I know its not <i>really</i> a vote, but I want to make the right <i>comment</i>&#160;:) Thanks in advance for taking the time to consider this. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> 22:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I personally feel that it's long enough. I mean it's one thing to say it's long enough to have its own article, but it's another to say it's too long to merge it into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>. It would be a bit of an eyesore, with the full table and everything. Also, it might be a bit inappropriate, figuring it's basically a strictly-scientific page. Perhaps a "See Also", or a small subsection discussing translations with one of these:</dd>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table_%28Chinese%29_e1ed.html" title="Periodic table (Chinese)">Periodic table (Chinese)</a></i></div>
. So, I'd say don't be afraid to change your vote. If you've been convinced by other arguments, you're a better person for not sticking with something that you feel is wrong. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 22:28, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(edit conflict) Thanks a lot Adam. I really appreciate the time you took to make such a well-reasoned response. I normally use the word 'thoughtful' to mean <i>someone who actually thinks</i>, and I can tell you're a very thoughtful person. I noticed a comment on your Userpage about "...uninformed yet strong opinions." That's actually one of my favorite soapboxes and I'm known to expostulate on the difference between an <i>informed opinion</i> (an opinion based on knowledge, experience, or deductive reasoning) and an <i>opinion</i> (oral flatulence). Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing you around <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>.

<dd>That's another thing that's great about Wikipedia, though. If one person writes a clear, logical argument, and five people simply "vote" (Oral flatulence), than the concensus is toward the person who wrote the argument.

<p>Agreed, which is why I like to emphasize that <i>votes</i> are <i>comments</i>.

Another editor and I attempted the best we could to rewrite the article per the references which it had. If you look back through the various versions in the history you will see the changes we made. We determined that the article was impossible and that the topic name "Next Door Nikki" was too ambiguous since it referred to both a web site and the pseudonym of an actress. The article was too small to split, and neither had any notability to create an article for either of them. The determination then was that the article simply hadn't any reason to be on the encyclopedia. If you would like to participate in those discussions, the article is up for debate in the AfD section.
