<p>Hi, Didn't know who to turn to, noticed that you have helped me in the past. Sorry of the intrusion. I would like to create a table, not sure how it will look and wanted to experiment with various forms of table's or lists. I was looking for a listing of the function codes such that I can understand their usage, such as cellpadding, etc. If you could point me in the right direction that would be fantastic. <a href="../../../h/j/k/User%7EHJKeats_7f65.html" title="User:HJKeats">HJKeats</a> 13:31, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really, unless there are some things there that isn't clear to me.

<p>I hate to come discuss this, but I don't know any other way. User A. Lafontaine, who's behaviour convinced many of us that he was DW/Angelique/JillandJack resurrected, is going over all articles which contain an instance of "Patriotes" and replaces them with "rebels". Also, he is still at it removing any sentence which conflicts with his belief. As before, he is doing everything unilaterally and is not open to any discussion.</p>
<p>If you are bored to death and have nothing better to do, you can read the talk pages of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecession_of_Quebec_1035.html" title="Talk:Secession of Quebec">Talk:Secession of Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Talk%7EQuebec_sovereignty_movement_5611.html" title="Talk:Quebec sovereignty movement">Talk:Quebec sovereignty movement</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Talk%7EQuebec_321d.html" title="Talk:Quebec">Talk:Quebec</a> and others. I am wasting a lot of time replying to him/her with what I believe are sufficient proofs that he is mistaken. I find it pointless and quite demanding, as reasoning with an unreasonable person always is.</p>
<p>It just happens that most of my contributions in English deal with Quebec's history and politics, so I see almost everything he does just by looking at my watchlist. It seems to me, although I have no proof whatsoever, that he is going over the list of my contributions and systematically taints each article I have created or edited with his point of view.</p>
<p>I didn't find the time, energy, and patience to undo everthing that JillandJack had done before, so I am very discouraged at the prospect of undoing A. Lafontaine's irrational modifications.</p>
<p>What steps can we take to have user A. Lafontaine expelled since reasoning with him appears to be an impossibility? Is there anything we can do to have him not reappear yet again a few weeks after?</p>
<p>Sorry to disturb you.</p>

<dd>I am also not opposed to the change from <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotes_Rebellion_6076.html" title="Patriotes Rebellion">Patriotes Rebellion</a> to <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_Canada_Rebellion_7cb6.html" title="Lower Canada Rebellion">Lower Canada Rebellion</a>. In fact, I am the one who did the original article move.&#160;:-) I am opposed to A. Lafontaine's tagging each Patriote leader as a "rebel". Most "rebels" never took arms and escaped to the USA to same their lives. Those who resisted their arrest out of principle became "heroes" on one side and "rebels" on the other. The use of either "hero" or "rebel" is precisely what the No-POV policy tries to prevent. Anyways, I don't think we disagree on this, so I'll stop babbling right there.

<p>Hello! I have the London article on my watchlist as it seems to attract a fair bit of vandalism. Someone removed the Bill Brady entry in the notable person category yesterday, so I did some research on the man before I made the readdition. The anon who just removed it says "by no objective measure is he notable". Not just for his Order of Canada, but his presidency of the broadcaster association, and his entry in the broadcasting hall of fame, but he was the first Canadian radio journalist who had a phone in talk show. That in itself establishes notability. My theory is that since Brady is still on the air, he may have detractors that disagree with whatever topic hes discussing on a particular day and deleting his entry for spite. Its always anons who make these changes as well. If you havn't already, I'll revert his changes, thanks for your time, see ya 'round! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 17:26, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi Adam, I noticed you restored that part of the notable Londoners section. Thanks! I left a note on that page to respond to the anon who removed it earlier. It got me thinking, maybe a section of London residents that have won the Order of Canada? Also I was thinking that Peter Desberats might be worthy of inclusion to the noteable section as well.Questions, comments, ideas? See you! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 21:12, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that there has to be a minimum bar to be set, I think Brady meets it by being a national hall of fame member. Desberats if you're not familiar was an anchor at Global news for many years, but has gone on to be a published author and head of UWO's journalism dept. I was more amused that someone included Roy McDonald to that list. Hes very much a character, but definately in the local scope only. I won't think of changing it though. If Joe Swan is there, well... Susan Eagle probably should be there as well.</li>

<p>HI Adam,</p>
<p>I noticed you reverted the edits I made to Mykonos Nightlife.</p>
<p>I don't think that doing this is justified. It is afterall the "Nightlife" section and that requires some input from someone who has been there many times to let people know what the island is all about. No accurate description of that island can exist without some detailed description of what goes on there at night and why it is so popular. I can edit some of it so that it doesn't sound as touristy as you say but considering the section I put it in, I think it is valid and ture to many other articles I've seen.</p>

<p>After looking that text Thomas and Demetrius Palaeologus are needing clean up and demand of Arrigo for one article about Thomas and another about Demetrius I have writen today article <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Palaeologus_fac5.html" title="Thomas Palaeologus">Thomas Palaeologus</a> . Around 09.09 article about Demetrius will be finished ( I got problems with his titles ). Yes and I have problem with year from which is Demetrius in Morea without leaving this province. I have birth year for Thomas 1409 ( from memory ) and for Demetrius 1410 ( from memory ). For now article Thomas Palaeologus is not connected with anything. I think to write in article Constantine XI succeded by Thomas and Demetrius with separated connection: one for Thomas Palaeologus second for Demetrius Palaeologus. I write to you because of your administrator status for later complete deleting of now article "Thomas and Demetrius Palaeologus" or will you transfer on that place only Thomas. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjecina_638f.html" title="User:Rjecina">rjecina</a></p>

There is no longer any problem with these articles, imo (The extra Demetrius page is tagged with merge suggestion, has no edit history worth saving as Rjecina has contributed almost the same to the better one, is more or less already merged, and sooner or later someone will delete it.) - I then made copyedits in both <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demetrius_Palaeologus_f304.html" title="Demetrius Palaeologus">Demetrius Palaeologus</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Palaeologus_fac5.html" title="Thomas Palaeologus">Thomas Palaeologus</a>.

<p>Hello Adam,</p>
<p>I moved the article on Duke Godfrey I, back to "Godfrey I of Leuven". In fact, this Godfrey was only landgrave of Brabant and Duke of Lower Lotharingia. The title of Duke of Brabant appears at the earliest under Duke Henry I from about 1183/1184. This Henry succeeds as Duke of Lotharingia in 1190. Don't worry: even for Belgian historians this is confusing. Best regards, <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitger_4eac.html" title="User:Witger">Witger</a> 11:23, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'm willing to do much of the work, but for the time being I am in Ottawa and having some people on the ground in Toronto will be necessary. We also need a number of people willing to assist at the actual event, likely the first weekend of August 2006. If you are interested in helping out sign up at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_2006/Toronto" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikimania_2006/Toronto">Wikimania 2006/Toronto</a>. Preliminary bids from various cities need to be made by Sept. 30, 2005, at which point a committee will choose which city gets to host the event. The number of people willing to help will certainly be an important consideration. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:17, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been thinking today why not start article Despots of Morea, so after Constantine XI it will be writen next ruler Demetrius Despot of Morea. Person which like formal history will be happy because Constantine XI will be last emperor, and others which like to know what has really happened will be happy. I write this to you because for that will be needed your list of Morea rulers so it will maybe be best that you write that article. For now you have story about 4 despots I can write little about Theodore I to be five. More that enough for your article Despot of Morea&#160;??</p>
<pre>
  I have been thinking for possibility of making similar to List of Byzantine emperors list of Morea despots. Simple possibility for making table on the article end. Example for Theodore II:
  Morea Despot  prev=Theodore I with=Constantine XI next=Constantine XI
  To tell the truth I have tried that but my version is not working.
   I will add Theodore I this sunday.

<dd>I certainly wasn't indending to split <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBattles_of_the_Crusades_f758.html" title="Category:Battles of the Crusades">Category:Battles of the Crusades</a>; all the battles would still be in it, but <i>also</i> in one or more categories by country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, you make a good point regarding category sizes; categories that will never contain more than a few articles are not particularly useful. I'm hardly an expert on the Crusades, so you're probably in a better position to judge this. Would any of the individual crusader states have more than a dozen or so battles (not necessarily having articles yet) associated with it? Or is the number of possible articles in this area too small? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:17, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification.; if the number of battles is that small, the extra categories probably are excessive.

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I recently created a page called WikiConstitution. It was deleted, and I asked for help in Help Desk. Here's the response I received:</p>
<p>"You actually created the page under the title Wikiconstitution. This page was speedy deleted by Adam Bishop, who cited WP:NOT, "wikipedia is not a social experiment". If you feel your article did not qualify for speedy deletion under WP:CSD, you should contact that user on User talk:Adam Bishop to see about having the page undeleted and put through WP:AFD. --Canderson7 00:48, 28 September 2005 (UTC)"</p>
<p>"Wikipedia is not a social experiment" is not one of the items on the "wikipedia is not" list. If it were, I don't think the WikiConstitution page would fit that definition anyhow; I think of it as a valid demonstration of the notion of a WikiConstitution. At any rate, violation of the "wikipedia is not" list does not seem to be a valid reason for speedy deletion. Can you clarify why the page was deleted, or what I could do to have it reinstated or considered more widely?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Good evening, Mr Bishop. I have no intention to "edit" or otherwise disturb your web page, but I could not find any other way to make contact with you. I am very sure you monitor your web page as, apparently, you do other Wikipedia pages. With respect to Feudalism in Colonial America â now having disappeared completely from the Feudalism Page â No, I was not trying to write a book, merely to provide a thorough presentation, in short form, of the original. I am new to Wikipedia (and thus having great dificulty getting things formatted correctly; see my many, many often futile attempts to re-edit) and, like you, an historian. My principal interest is English Constitutional History and am well-published in several of its more obscure and little-understood areas of the subject.</p>
<p>As for the attempted entry, Feudalism in Colonial America, I shall leave it alone and off the Wikipedia web site. I regret inadvertently taking up too much space.</p>
<p>If you wish to make contact with me directly, you may use my e-mail address, ecalibre@alltel.net</p>

<p>I know that the 1911 encyclopedia is in the public domain, but the source from which the text was directly copied does matter. I thought that the text was copied from <i>LoveToKnow Free Online Encyclopedia</i> which would have been a copyvio (as noted on the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_6bc1.html" title="1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica">1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica</a>. The "<i>See: W. Wattenbach, Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen, vol. i. (Stuttgart and Berlin, 1904)</i>" line led me to believe this. I didn't think to check the actual public domain 1911 but I thought it should be investigated. Anyhow, the text is the original so we're fine.

<p>Hi Adam. I am writing about an erroneous reference in today's home page, regarding the"Names of the Greeks". Somewhere it says "...while those in the Byzantine Empire would call them Yunans.". This is wrong and I think you understand better why. The Byzantines were overwhelmingly Greeks themselves, especially in the later ages. They didn't call themselves names from other languages. It's fairly well explained in the article itself.--<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 04:46, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I would like to bring your attention to the article on <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral_98ee.html" title="St. Volodymyr's Cathedral">St. Volodymyr's Cathedral</a>. Less than two weeks ago this was a nicely-written article about the Cathedral, about the architecture, mosaics, frescoes, the history how the Cathedral was built etc. (see the last version of 00:03, 20 October 2005 by Mzajac <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=25962321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=25962321" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>)</p>
<p>At 15:06, 22 October 2005 <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">User:Kuban kazak</a> decided to use this preaty neutral and nice article to push his POV that is far from being neutral (see his contribution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;diff=26189124&amp;oldid=25962321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;diff=26189124&amp;oldid=25962321" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). This stared a long-lasting edit war.</p>
<p>Even if his insertion were neutral (this was definitelly not the case) this is a serious question whether it's legal to use architecture, art, music etc. articles for advertising (or bringing attention to) political issues. Does it improve the Wikipedia content? Does it make the work of editors more productive? Is it not an abuse of Wikipedia for propaganda purposes?</p>
<p>It looks like this is a more broad question. Inserting political stuff into initially quite neutral, nice and popular articles is quite common in Wikipedia. I admit that the question is not simple. Sometimes political stuff is important and the article looks incomplete without it. But in most cases the politiocal stuff is irrelevant and just force the reader to spend his/her time for reading the information s/he was not actually looking for. In my opinion, a serious discussion is needed. <b>What's your opinion?</b></p>
<p>It would be indeed nice <b>to protect the article</b> in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=27052632" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St_Volodymyr%27s_Cathedral&amp;oldid=27052632" rel="nofollow">politics-free form</a> until the discussion is over.</p>

<p>Thank you, Adam, for stopping that unfortunate edit war over the use of the series template! I guess "ridiculous" was a very polite way to put it; I personally cannot understand how can people be so easy at destroying others' work without even trying to understand it first, and worse - trying to pull their history apart and juggle its pieces to best suit their minute political ideas of today. Isn't everything connected in this world? It only seems that it is not... Wouldn't it be nice if at least early history was left alone, set free of politics or nationalistic battles; alas... Oh well, I am hoping I didn't sound too harsh :) or too stupid; sorry if I was wrong somewhere, but I was sincerely trying my best to stay ~neutral~ and not too emotional. Perhaps if you have interest, and the time, you'd consider to contribute more to Rus' history as the expert!

<p>Through exploring more on the Crusader Kingdoms I have become interested in Mideival titles, and had docovered an interesting web sie that chronicalled what many mideival rulers called themselves. That is where I got ducissa (from how Eleanor of Aquitaine was called in her lands on official Aquitaine documents).</p>
<p>Why did you remove the Melisende image of the Queen accepting hommage? I know you doubt that it was Melisende, but it could be to. Do you have a copy of all the images in the Melisende Psalter? I remember the person who posted it had emailed me that it was from there.</p>
<p>Anyway the book I am reading Queen of Swords has a mideival image it suggests is Melisende and Baldwin II in Acre waiting for Fulk of Anjou, who is himself depicted in Acre's harber. I am unsure where the image is from so havent suggested it yet. It is as a compelling image as the Queen accepting homage. Ill keep you up to date.</p>
<p>It seems there is so much history and events wrapped up in those Crusader States, so much foundation. It is surprising to me the more I read of the governmental structures. There was a high sence of chivelry and yet women were according more freedoms then in other Mideival countries, even if by default that all the men died early. It amazes me that not more is widely known of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Anywho! Happy Belated B-Day!</p>

<p>I have no vested interest in films.com. I was just very glad to discover that they existed, because it meant that I could get on DVD plays I had wanted for many years. They don't advertise, so unless you happen to stumble onto them, as I did, there is no way of seeing these wonderful plays. I added the information because I thought that others would be glad to learn about it. If films are commonly available, as most films are, then it is obviously spam to recommend one place to buy them over another. On the other hand, if films are only available in one place, and that place does not advertise, then I think the information is appropriate.</p>
<p>But, I'm not going to get into a reversion war. I hope, after consideration, you will restore what you have deleted. If not, so be it.</p>
<p>Similarly with the Shakespeare on DVD. I've wanted a complete set of Shakespeare on DVD for many, many years. But the company that produces these does not advertise (except maybe to academic libraries). Also, when you search, say, amazon.com for "Shakespeare" on DVD, some plays come up and others don't. I thought that fans of Shakespeare would be glad to know what was available. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 13:56, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are the arguments posted on the page of "Moldovan language".</p>
<p>For these <b>facts</b> many users have been blocked and more forced to accept an unilateral point of view of the Administrator Mikkalai and 16 years old Kid [[Node _ue]]. <b>He does not bring arguments as we do</b>, instead he uses his power <b>to block many times</b> (for one week or 24 h). Like for yourself, he warned you and mock on you saying that you don't have the right to say something.</p>
<p>I agree with you when you say to redirect to "Romanian language". Anyway "Romanian" was once recognized in the constitution as official language of the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> between 1991-1994 and many attempts to remake this were done.</p>
<p>"Moldovan language" is <b>in fact</b> <b>indentical</b> with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>, renamed as a "language" for political reasons by the government. Although similar theories have been fielded for other languages, this proposal is now believed to have been made to serve political purposes only, and nobody has provided any evidence so-far towards the idea that Moldovan and Romanian are not from common linguistic stock.</p>
<p>The term "Moldovan" is also a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">soviet</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">invention</a> (see Dept. of State &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>). A separate language based on these was declared and promoted for political reasons, in order to further advance a Moldovan identity separate from that of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>.</p>
<p>The soviet Russians called people of Moldavia Republic: "Moldovan" because they wanted to create a new nation different from Moldavians/Romanians.</p>
<p>There is also in Romania a region called Moldova.</p>
<pre>
Russians manipulated people of Republic of Moldova and washed their brains to create a new person, the soviet "Moldovan". The real name in English is Moldavian, in Romanian is Moldovean and in Russian is Molidavanin. So "Moldovan" belongs to no language!

<p>"The name 'Moldovan language' (in Russian, ÐÐÐÐaÐCKÐÐ Ð¯ÐÐIK 'moldavskii iazyk'); in Romanian, limbÄ moldoveneascÄ, or, in Cyrillic characters, ÐÐMÐ±Ð MOÐÐÐBeÐÐ¯CKÐ was applied in the Soviet Union, as during earlier periods of Russian occupation of the area in question, to the * Romance language used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (corresponding more or less to the formerly Romanian territory of Bessarabia, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940). In reality, 'Moldavian' is nothing else than the *Romanian language as spoken in Moldavia, i.e. both east of the river Prut in Bessarabia (now the Republic of Moldova) and west of the Prut in that part of the former province that remains as part of Romania. Claims made in the post-Second World War period by the Soviet linguists that 'Moldavian' should be recognized as a distinct Romance language were not taken into seriously by western scholars. Under Soviet domination, the *Cyrillic alphabet was in the use in the Moldavian SSR until the passing of a law on 31 August 1989 (i.e. before the break-up of the Soviet Union) proclaiming Moldavian as the official language of the Republic and the use of Latin script. Apart from a few lexical differences (mainly technical terms borrowed from Russian rather than, as in standard Romanian, from western languages), the written language was thenceforth indistinguishable from that in use in Romania and moves are afoot to harmonize the technical terminology of Moldova with that adopted in Romanian specialized dictionaries. After the Republic of Moldova declared its independence of the Soviet Union in 1991, its Constitution (1994) declared that the official language was limba moldoveneasca 'the Moldavian language'. At the time of writing, moves to have this amended to 'limba romÃ¢nÄ' the Romanian language have not yet succeeded.</p>

Evolution from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a> to so called <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian.html" title="Moldavian">Moldavian</a></span></h2>
<p>Lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">romanian</a> and "moldovan" - was prefab since the 1812-1918. Some important aspects of the problematics: functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from Bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river Prut, taking out the name "romanian" and introducing the term "limba moldoveneasca", the intention of the tsarist government "to create a dialect neared to the slavic language".</p>
<p>In the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" title="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, used along with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>. Gradually the russian language win importance. According to the dates offered by the Dept. for ruling the Bessarabia from <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, the papers from bureau were held only in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. As concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>, after that being taught as a separate object. Thus, at the theological Seminar of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="ChiÅinÄu">ChiÅinÄu</a>, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. At the highschool no. 1 from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="ChiÅinÄu">ChiÅinÄu</a> the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of Feb. <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils "know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals". Around <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, the tsar published an ucaz "On the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from Besserabia", because "In russian Empire are not taught local speeches".</p>

<p>Hi. You happened to be around right after I used the sandbox. Is it a coincidence? I've seen you before. (Do you remember where?)</p>
<p>Btw, so you know, I found a brand-new purpose on Wikipedia, and that is redirecting possible &amp; common spelling mistakes to the article of the correct spelling. Somehow, I find that fun, so I hope it'll replace vandalizing articles (which is funny to some, but disruptive to others.) Take a look in my history- I've created many spelling error redirects already. It feels like a new awakening for me. You know, an Epiphany if you will. I hope my spelling error redirects make a significant difference.</p>

<p>Isn't this a small world after all? I thought Wikipedia has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=en.wikipedia.org#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=en.wikipedia.org#top" rel="nofollow">grown so big</a>, it would be exceedingly rare to cross random paths twice! How many admins are registered with WP right now, anyway?</p>
<p>And now I remember our last conversation. You found "Kim Il-sung City" by looking through the most recently created articles, and I thought you were stalking me because I didn't know there was a "most recently created articles" page. Now, occurrences of "Kim Il-sung City" simply redirects to <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Il-Sung_24a7.html" title="Kim Il-Sung">Kim Il-Sung</a>, the father of one of the most brutal dictators to rule anywhere on Earth!</p>
<p>Now, my days of de-constructive vandalism are over (at least I hope it stays that way), now that I redirect spelling errors. See my contribution history? What do you think? So far so good? I hope my new activities serves the site well!</p>

<p>I have no access to the deleted userpage, but from mention of it on the Sonic talkpage, it sounds like it was used for discussing the Sonic article...which I think would fall under the umbrella of contributing to Wikipedia (unless there's something I don't know about the page). <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 19:59, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have 1 very active person which demand that Mehmed II has married daughter of Demetrius Palaeologus. My only source for that last years of Morea is Gibbon which say against that. Can you please look about that because is crazy.

<p>I just noticed you changed my googlesque "did you mean ...?" page to a redirect. I'm fine with that, in retrospect its a better way to go.

<p>....most definitely was not French. Thanks for catching that - I don't know how I got that in there, as my source, right in front of me, said "born in the east about 1130." However, it is true he was <i>in</i> France at the time of the Battle of Ascalon, and it was there that he wrote his account of the event.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 08:29, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I goofed on the times of writing. As for the Damascene chronicler - Barber, in "The New Knighthood," writes that no Muslim source even mentions the role of the Templars at Ascalon, but Ibn al-Qalanisi does mention the tower and the breach, as preliminaries to the fall of the city. Barber also interprets the fact that the city capitulated one week later as suggesting the Franks weren't set back as much as William implied. In his notes, he does write that <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Athir_0d0a.html" title="Ibn al-Athir">Ibn al-Athir</a> recorded that a Frankish attack was repulsed, and following that the beseigers almost gave up.</p>
<p>One point Barber constantly makes in the book is that William often wrote to contrast the early poverty and piety of the Templars (which he saw as good in the beginning) with their perceived greed and avarice at the time of his writing the chronicle; and thus his interpretations/relating of events has to be treated with caution. What's your take on this? And your take on Barber, if you're familiar with his works on the Templars?<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 08:58, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that a small group of people (no more than two or three) have been using Wikipedia as a soap box to promote a narrow, far-right agenda on several inter-related articles. I have explained by position on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGregory_Lauder-Frost_7f23.html" title="Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost">Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost</a>, in a section marked "Observations".

<p>After thinking things over, I agree with your redirects of these two articles. However, redirecting them without notice or discussion, and with the note "wow, who cares?" doesn't strike me as the most diplomatic way of doing things. Some people do care. A little courtesy can go a long way.</p>

Although some centuries later a lot of Finnish peoples (then called cwens) immigrated to those areas around 1850-1900. This is the reason some Norwegian municipalities have names in they're language.
