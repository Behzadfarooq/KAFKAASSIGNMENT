<p>Article states: "On The Adam Carolla Show, Carolla said he was offered a football scholarship to Marshall University, but he was not interested in college."</p>
<p>On Loveline, Adam has stated that he was playing junior college football with the intention of accepting a promised scholarship to UC-Davis once he got his grades up, but he couldn't overcome the persistent effects of his earlier back and leg injuries that were also discussed on the show multiple times. He also freely admits to being a poor student, but that's not why he missed out on college football.</p>
<p>He could have received scholarship offers from more than one school so both UC-Davis and Marshall could be correct, but the reason he was unable to accept the offers is wrong.</p>

<p>Adam's middle name is NOT "lakers". He has stated on numerous occasions that because the DMV lets you fill out the information to appear on your license yourself, he wrote it in there as a joke. The DMV messed up my sister's driver's license and put M as her sex instead of F. This doesn't make her a guy. Adam has no middle name; he has stated this many, many times over the years. There's no way it should say Adam "Lakers" Carolla right at the outset of the article. I can't believe this is even a discussion. That's not his name.</p>
<p>Why was the information about Adam's middle name removed? I've listened to the ACS when he talks about his middle name being Lakers, and he showed a copy of it to Teresa and Dave. There was also a source provided for the information. Is there a reason why it's being taken out? <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 22:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reworded the trivia on his middle name to leave out a legal claim about it. I'd imagine a driver's license does qualify as legal documentation of your identity (what else would you use?). But I could be wrong. Either way, before we make a claim about the legal status of his name we should have citations backing up whatever claim is made about it. -- <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtalbert_4dbc.html" title="User:Craigtalbert">Craigtalbert</a> 01:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note: The following is conversation with me and 24.7.70.164 adapted for the talk page. For some reason he is unwilling to use it to discuss edits to the article, and would only respond when I left a message for him on his IP's talk page.</p>
<p>The problem I have with starting the article out with his name written as Adam Lakers Carolla is that Lakers is not his middle name. The fact that it is on his driver's license does not make it official. I have listened to him for many years and I remember him stating on multiple occasions that he has no middle name. The radio show blog in which he reveals what his driver's license says reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Adam's license shows his middle name as "Lakers", even though it's not true. He just decided to pencil it in when he got his license and they were doing good."</p>
<p>OK. Perhaps a good trivia question, but it compromises the encyclopedic nature of the article by having an untruth right off the bat. How is this even under dispute? His name is not Adam Lakers Carolla. It's right in the referenced blog Adam's license shows his middle name as “Lakers”, even though it's not true. Is it true even though its not true? Come on. -- <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.7.70.164.html" title="User talk:24.7.70.164">24.7.70.164</a></p>

<dd>I mostly agree with you. The rationale that I've used until this point is that a driver's license *is* a legal document -- legal proof of identification. To that extent, it seems to me that a middle name on it is just as legal/offical as the rest of the information on it. So, it seems to be it's mostly a legal question. If you can find a legal source that says a middle name appearing on a driver's license is not "legally binding" then that would elimiate any question about the existence of his last name. Alternatively/Additionally, if you wanted to call in to the radio and ask him for an offical explaination, I think it would make good radio.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtalbert_4dbc.html" title="User:Craigtalbert">Craigtalbert</a>

<dd>I just have trouble believing that because Adam wrote Lakers on his DMV form and that because the DMV was too lazy to actually look anything up (that I can believe), it makes Lakers his legal middle name. I can sign up for magazines under any name I want, but it doesn't make it so. If Lakers is not on his birth certificate, then he would have to go to court to get it legally changed. -- <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.7.70.164.html" title="User talk:24.7.70.164">24.7.70.164</a>

<dd>For all I know the process might be different if you were never given a middle name and changing/declaring it. I still think it's a legal question and the back and forth about what we think may or may not be legal isn't useful. Until there is legal evidence otherwise, I believe since his driver's license is a legal document that the burdern of proof is to show that the name on his driver's license is "illegal." -- <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtalbert_4dbc.html" title="User:Craigtalbert">Craigtalbert</a>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "pencil it in" from the source cited strongly suggests that he wrote it on his license after the fact, meaning that it's not legally his middle name. -- 69.160.54.107 08:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC) William

<dd>He's said numerous times that he has no middle name. He mentioned once, as a gag, that he inserted a false middle name on his driver's license. (Whether it's actually printed there or he wrote it himself is irrelevant.) Since "Lakers" is not his middle name, and it is not referenced anywhere else in the article or in his life, it should come out. <a href="../../../r/b/_/User%7ERB_McLeroy_25a9.html" title="User:RB McLeroy">RB McLeroy</a> 02:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Carolla explained that he does not have middle name, and that he added "Lakers" as a joke. Obviously the information on a driving license is not legally binding if it is patently false <i>by the admission of the owner</i>. I have no issue with it being mentioned as a triviality, but <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">lead</a> names should only include the person's legal/birth name, or the name they are notable under.

<dd>I have read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> many times. I still believe it is a question of the legality of his drivers license, and procedures to change/add middle names in California. No legal documentation has been provide yet to void the legal status of his name on his driver's license. I believe, in good faith, we should assume his driver's license is legal. -- <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtalbert_4dbc.html" title="User:Craigtalbert">Craigtalbert</a> 06:35, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I didn't see that you were an administrator. I'll revert it back on account of your status and me not wanting to be blocked.

<p>(reset indent) Please do not relent on the account of me being an administrator. My opinion on content is no more valid for having sysop tools, and I would certainly not use those tools over an issue I am involved in. That said, I really believe it would be prudent to err on the side of caution here. Consider how many people with Wikipedia bios have "legally binding" middle names yet we do not list them in the lead. When this one is obviously nothing more than a joke, it really doesn't seem encyclopaedic to include it. That notwithstanding, this will all be moot in the near future anyway. The <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_ID_Act_059f.html" title="Real ID Act">Real ID Act</a> states "a Federal agency may not accept, for any official purpose, a driver's license or identification card issued by a State to any person unless the State is meeting the requirements." These requirements include, among other specifications, "proof of true full name" <a href="http://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/illegalimmigrant_driverslicense.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/illegalimmigrant_driverslicense.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. California currently does not fulfil these criteria (as Carolla's experience shows) <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/24/MNGIHK4CT01.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/24/MNGIHK4CT01.DTL" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, ergo the California license is not currently a reliable source of a "true full name" and as of his next renewal, Carolla's driving license will be invalid as official ID in the Federal US. Of course, that his ID may currently be accepted does not mean that it is his legal name, because his social security and birth certificate do not match (according to him). Considering that it is on public record that his license details were submitted as a joke, and its clear that the Californian license is currently an unverified secondary source for a name, I don't think there would be much doubt about which would be deemed "legal" in a court of law. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 09:32, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The definitive answer came from Adam himself, repeatedly throughout his career. He was adamant that his name was NOT spelled the same as the Toyota Corolla, but instead is spelled C-A-rolla.</p>

<p>Adam Carolla is not Hungarian!</p>
<p>Regarding, Carolla's heritage and genealogy: if he serves no other purpose on earth, certainly not for comedic reasons will society recognize Adam Carolla. Instead, he lives only to validate the theory of evolution. He is a testament to the idea that we evolved from apes that derive pleasure from playing with their genitals and making loud noises with their bodies. Adam Carolla is our closest link to primates, which is why we had to make him available to the greater public by giving him his own show – to validate the theory evolution over intelligent design.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like your theory. Publish it somewhere, and we can include it in the article! <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 12:38, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could it not be argued that Adam Carolla is in fact the ultimate evidence of intelligent design such that a higher being bestowed him upon us to grace us with his comedic genius? It seems that such a wizard of humor could not possibly have come to be from natural processes alone but is in fact indisputable proof of divine intervention. I posit that Adam Carolla's show is God's way of showcasing his accomplishment, his veritable A+ paper on the proverbial refrigerator.</p>

<p>Once upon a time (circa july 2006), this page had adam's own self announced personal income showing zero dollars for a few years.. Aside from being amusing, it did show the blue-color roots of adam himself. Why was this removed from the page, and what reason is there for not adding it back?</p>

<p>While one of the best parts about Carolla is his lack of polarizing political rants, do his beliefs deserve a mention in here. He certainly dislikes the religious right, he shows the most contempt for left wing groups such as the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>. Some fans have called him a right wing libertarian or a "<a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>" Republican. I probably agree with these statements. To summarize my ramblings, do you think that a sentence or two about Adam's politics is necessary? It certainly fleshes him out more, but may alienate some fans.

<p>I would classify the Aceman as an Independent, I remember he was always ranting on Maxine Waters, calling her "Aunt Esther" as in the crazy sister of Fred Sanford from Sanford &amp; Son. He was mainly mad at her because (according to him) she was always talking about reparations for slavery, and not important things that affected everyone in her district, such as Plan B/emergency contraception, or CalTrans freeway billboards not displaying local traffic information and instead only being used for Amber Alerts or notices of tie ups in <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Tree_b2a4.html" title="Joshua Tree">Joshua Tree</a>. On the other hand, he doesn't have much respect for evangelical Christians, "crazy right wingers", or "abstinence only pussies" who don't want people having sex and won't just come out and say that but instead hide behind bogus science and false "facts" to back up their arguments. --Lovelinelistener 16:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a lot of fact citations. I know these things about Adam are true because I've heard him talk about it on the show, but specific shows/facts need to be cited for inclusion on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiface_de15.html" title="User:Liface">Liface</a> 21:04, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Here is a mention of Adam making a radio station for people who want to sleep on long flights, but from the context is seems as if a typical morning radio bit and not something that is really going to happen. <a href="http://adamradio.blogspot.com/2006/02/adam-with-jillian-barberie-kristin.html" class="external free" title="http://adamradio.blogspot.com/2006/02/adam-with-jillian-barberie-kristin.html" rel="nofollow">http://adamradio.blogspot.com/2006/02/adam-with-jillian-barberie-kristin.html</a></p>
<p>I recently also added a few citations to the unsourced trivia section, as well as some new trivia with cites. Who would have thought the Aceman once dated a stripper, I had always imagined him a white knight in a suit of armor, not some beer guzzling stripclub aficionado! --Lovelinelistener 23:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added in the information about Adam losing his virginity to Molly Ringwald's sister, with a sourcing back to the radio show blog. <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 19:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nice move on the Aceman's part. I remember once on Loveline he talked about the Ringwalds living up the street from him in the Canyon when he grew up, and apparently Molly's sister had the hots for him and he would always see Mr. Ringwald in town walking around with his cane (he's blind). Good times.--Lovelinelistener 22:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to say, Adam Carolla and Lynette are most definitely married; she is not a 'long term' girlfriend.</p>
<p>This is for the person who doesn't believe Adam has never referred to himself as an atheist [<a href="http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/" class="external autonumber" title="http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>].
