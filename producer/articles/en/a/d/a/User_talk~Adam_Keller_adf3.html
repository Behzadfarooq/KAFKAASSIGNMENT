<p>I noticed you added two paragraphs to the <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson</a> article about themes in his writings. If they are themes, it might be good to mention examples from more than one book.

<p>I was reading this article since I am doing a report on H.G. Wells and saw you added a bunch of analytical details which are great! I just wanted to say thanks and ask where you got them or are they your own ideas? Kramer k 07:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. I just got it from the book itself, I think Wells meant his readers to read the book intelligently and not take at face value Bedford's judgement. By the way, if you make a report of Wells' work in general and not just this book, I would advice you to include his "The Shape of Things to Come" from 1934, which is often neglected and in my view unjustly.

<p>Your recent addition to the "Reception" section seems a bit rambling and long. The purpose of the section is simply to report the response, not evaluate it.

<p>Thanks for the interesting text. Would you have a chance to add screenshot from Zeman's movie when Sword is flapping away from Nautilus?</p>
<p>HMS Sword is also name of at least one real historical ship: <a href="http://www.historycentral.com/navy/LSD/rushmore.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historycentral.com/navy/LSD/rushmore.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. At some time tt may be good to move the fiction submarine under different name and create disambiguation. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:03, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I could have expected this, "Sword" is a natural name for Englsih-speaking navies to use. I agree that this change should be made, the real ship should have some precedence over the fictional one. About the Zeman film: I am afraid I never saw it, only found some refernces to it on the internet. I have no way of adding film sequences to the page, if you can do it go ahead, it would be a nice addition. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 20:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I now read the interesting description which you found. If I understand correctly the first lines - "Rushmore (LSD-14) was laid down as HMS Sword 31 December 1943 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Va; launched as Rushmore 10 May 1944" it seems to meand that the Ameroican origianlly built her for the British who intended to call her "HMS Sword" but that in fact, for an unspecified reason, the Americans decided to keep her and call her "Rushmore", and that was the actual name she bore throughout a quite long career. So, in a way, this "HMS Sword" is as fictional as the other one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 20:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have seen Zeman's film couple of times (early <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">Steampunk</a> style, very good movie) but currently have no chance to get it on my machine. Will see.</dd>

<dd>HMS Sword: there was also "HMS Sword Dance", a WW1 minesweeper. I have no intention to work on British ships, it's just a result of quick googling. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 14:46, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taking look on Czech Wiki I discovered that just today someone put exactly the picture I had in mind into the article there. I added it into <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Sword_0145.html" title="HMS Sword">HMS Sword</a>. You may notice mechanically powered "frog flaps" used to propel the ship (Nautilus used a classic propeller). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 15:11, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you go on searching you will find hundreds more (I would not be surprised if it will turn out to be thousands).

Or are they all paying royalties (to whom)?</p>
<p>Of course, if turns out there is a real copyright you could wipe the text from the article itself and install instead an outside link to one or more of these websites.

<dd>Most of the information is derived from the doctorate paper presented by Jeffrey M.Angles to the Ohio State University in 2003, which is availalble on the net. The paper is about Murayama Kaita and Edogawa Ranpo, who were Japanese writers of the generation immediately following Shunrō Oshikawa, and it contains several detailed references to him and footnotes giving the names and dates of his books.</dd>

<dd>The expert in this case is Jeffrey M.Angles, who seems to be living in Japan at present and is directing an email list about the shakuhachi, which seems to be a peculiarly Japanese musical instrument, difficult to play <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/shaku/Shakumail.2001/0328.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://communication.ucsd.edu/shaku/Shakumail.2001/0328.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the information Adam, I guess I should have noticed the dissertation link in the article, but PDFs make me cry so I avoid looking at them unless I have to.

Though it does provide some good general info on the guy, it's a bit odd using it as a main source as it's really not about him at all. A bit of random searching turned up a possible additional source of "The Gender of Nationalism: Competing Masculinities in Meiji Japan" in the Winter 2002 issue of the <i>Journal of Japanese Studies</i>, which could perhaps be obtained by through <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENewspapers_and_magazines_request_service_a0a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service">Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service</a> and might provide some additional material.

<p>As advised, I looked through the Wikipedia guidelines for "notability", and I must say it is true that Moshe Ayalon does not fit most of them, because he is definitely not famous enough in the various ways enumerated there. (But I saw also that these guidelines are not binding.)</p>
<p>The only criteria which in my view jut might fit him is this: <i>100 year test (future speculation)</i> -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?"</p>
<p>My reasons for thinking this is applicable is - apart from the fact that I think Ayalon IS going to become famous, but of course I can't prove that - is that even if he never become more famous than he now is, he has a sharp and incisive mind, identifying real issues and dealing with them in an original way which nobody did before him, and writing with considerable literary merit. Re the above <i>100 year test", it is my opinion that for example a researcher of the Twenty-Second Century writing a doctorate about our time might find it useful to mention Moshe Ayalon in at least a footnote, which in my view is sufficiant reason for Wikipedia to retain the article.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 17:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>I have no real opinion on whether that article should or should not be split up. I did add a section entitled "Basic irreducible difference" stating some things which need to be mentioned on the Jewish point of view - whether this remains a single article or is split up. I think many Mormons might not fully appreciate that their accptance of Jesus might, in the Jewish view, quite outweigh any similarities that exist between their religion and Judaism. The Jewish negative attitude to Jesus is mainly due to the nasty doings of much earlier Christians, long before the rise of the Latter Day Saints (doings which were certainly contrary to the teachings of Jesus himself as expressed in the New Testament). But whatever its origin, this Jewish attitude is a fundmental fact which must be taken into account.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 12:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Adam.<br />
I'm writing to you because I have troble understanding the importance of those huge fragments of H.G. Wells "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shape_of_Things_to_Come_85b6.html" title="The Shape of Things to Come">The Shape of Things to Come</a>" (or any metion of his opinion on the subject for that matter) being inserted into the article about the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Corridor_837b.html" title="Polish Corridor">Polish Corridor</a>. Many people of the era - politicians, militarists, historians and ethnographers - wrote about the post WW I Polish German borders. Yet you chose the opinion of a science-fiction writer to occupy most of the article space. Why is it so important to you? (And if it's so important, then maybe it deserves it's own article). Because he predicted WW II? But he "predicted" an international conflict lasting till late 60's resulting in death of over 90% of the Earth's population. Although many people died in WW II it still ended 1945. I don't know if you are aware that <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> "predicted" World War One. Does that make all their reasoning true? Are you going to believe everything else they say because of that?<br />
Another important thing:<br />
Was resolving the Polish Corridor question the German way really going to stop the war?<br />
First demand of Hitler after which he promised peace was reintroduction of military conscription.<br />
Then remilitarization of Rhineland.<br />
Then incorporation of Austria.<br />
Then incorporation of Bohemia and creation of Protectorate.<br />
All those demands were met.<br />
At the same time he already started big scale dicrimination of the Jewish population of Germany.<br />
But again nobody did anything. Makes one wonder if it perhaps wasn't the weakness and undecisiveness of other countries, and their lack of any response to Hitler's actions that caused WW II.<br />
(Speaking of predictions: Polish leader Józef Piłsudski in 1934 also predicted the danger of the Nazi ruled Germany and proposed a preemptive strike to Great Britain and France, but nobody did anything.)<br />
This is of course my humble opinion, everybody has a right to have one, Science-Fiction writers too.<br />
In conclusion - I don't think the inclusion of Mr Wells' opinion (accompanied by a ton of quotes or not) into the article has any constructive purpose. I may be wrong of course. For now I'm going to remove the disputed paragraphs from the article. Maybe a better place for them would be the article about the book, I don't know. I'm open for discussion, though.

<dd>Certainly, by 1939 the Polish Corridor was no more than an excuse for Hitler and if it was not there he would have found another excuse. The point which Wells tried to make was that this - and the entire Versailles Agreement of which it was a prominent part - contributed greatly to Hitler getting power in Germany in the first place. The relevant thing for the Wikipedia article is that it gives in detail the arguments why creation of the Polish Corridor was justified, but not one word of the opposing arguments, which is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. (I get the feeling that at least some parts of the article were written by partiotic Poles, which is all right as long as theirs is not the only point of view represented.) Wells, though nowadays remembered mainly as a Science Fiction writer, was also very much of a political writer, and actually the book quoted (like much of his later writing) is more a political essay dressed up as science fiction than a true SF book. I felt that Wells presented in a logical and cogent way the case against the Polish Corridor, and that he could not be accused of pro-Nazi bias (the Nazis burned his books and placed him on the list of people to be immediately liquidated in the event of a succesful invasion of Britain). Perhaps I was too lazy in just copying and pasting the text which is available online (and which I think is well-written) and I should have just extracted the main counter-arguments and placed them in the same format as the arguments in favor of the Polish Corridor.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 17:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Adam, I was wondering whether your comments on the more recent trilogy are appropriate in an encyclopedia article. The words "seems to" suggest that this is one reader's interpretation. In order to validate this, we need something less subjective. A statement from one of the authors would be ideal. A published book review might be good enough; we could at least say "according to so-and-so."</p>
<p>If it's just your own interpretation, I grant that it's an interesting one, but there are many other places on the Internet where it should appear rather than Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarob_b082.html" title="User:Alarob">Rob C (Alarob)</a> 02:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The trilogy starts from the same premise as the Moore book and then goes off in an opposite direction. That is an objective fact which can be determined from just looking at their respective plots. I have no direct proof that it was consciously intended as such by the authors of the trilogy, and in theory you might suppose it is a pure coincidence. Still, the fact that it was published precisely fifry years after the Moore book (1953 and 2003) plus the fact that the Moore book is a classic in the subgenre of Civil War alternate history, which is likely to be known to anybody writing new books of the kind, seems to be at least "circumastantial evidence". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 10:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prabowo.html" title="Prabowo">Prabowo</a> I didn't really look at it yet and will get back to you soon. I removed the pov tag simply because a vandal had hijacked the template and it was showing an obscene picture. This has been happening a bit lately and when I went to report it others had also found it on other articles. Great work and I will get back to you soon.

<p>Your work improved the article a fair bit. I did some work on the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prabowo.html" title="Prabowo">Prabowo</a> article, but i think it is still a problem. Generally, in my opinion much of the content is unsourced opinion. Although it is opinion I personlly agree with, it is not quite up to encyclopedia quality. I made some comments <a href="../../../p/r/a/Talk%7EPrabowo_fdb2.html" title="Talk:Prabowo">here</a>. Hopefully you or I or both can revisit the article soon. regards <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 03:44, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adam, the best place I can suggest for good sources is a library - ha ha. As for the internet, non spring to mind straight away but my recommendation is for something academic and scholarly. On such a controversial figure like Prabowo, there is bound to be a lot of sensationalist but poor quality sites around. I have a new book called Indonesian Destinies by Theodore Friend that has a lot of Prabowo refs in the index. But Prabowo is far from my wiki priority at the moment. How about you post a message in this board here asking for ideas: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. In the meantime, i will try but not promise to see what is in that book. Maybe in the meantime have a look at what can be found in google. I find though that the best journal sources are "locked" in online databases which one must either pay for or have a subscription. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 14:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I quite agree that a library is the best place to look. Unfortunatly, I don't see any reason to assume that I would have a chance to visit a library in the next two or three months (at a conservative restimate). I have a quite busy life, I can do things on Wikipedia in odd feww moments in between a big load of other work done on the computer, often late at night. I have no practical possibility to go and spend hours travelling to and from the Tel-Aviv University Libarary (the nearest worthwhile university to my home) and many more hours doing serious research in the library - much as I would have loved doing it for this and may other subjects. In practical terms, I am restricted to whatcan be located online.

<p>I notice we are sort of coinciding - I have noticed the sunan giri and gresik edits. I am constantly trying to tag the smallest of indonesian geographic stubs so we can eventually work out how many we have (!)

<dd>I blundered into this quite by chance. I have actually started to work on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Indonesian_6d19.html" title="Chinese Indonesian">Chinese Indonesian</a> article which is in an atrocious condition of completely disconnected pieces with no coherent chronological order, and I noticed a reference to some of the Wali Sanga having come from China, but no further details. I went looking for such and saw that there was much to do on the Sunan Giri article, so I started doing it, though he plainly has no Chinese bacground. But probably you are much better qualified than me to work on this subject. Do you have any information on those Wali Sanga who have a Chinese bacground?

<dd>I am sorry to say I don't understand what the hell you are talking about. Most of these names have their own Wikipedia articles to which I have created links, and each of these articles says exactly where in the Bible the name mentioned occurs. I just put it all together for the convenience of people who might be interested. Where is the "Original Reserch" here? Of course, if you insist, I can go into each of the seperate articles and copy the references into this article. I think this would wasted effort, anyone inrested could find the references in the specfic articles, but of course it can be done. In any case, I see no reason for a speedy delete or any kind of delete. Adam Keller 23:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Adam, The deletion of the article was an act of political censorship initiated by an Israel who is less enlightened than yourself. I would be happy to open a review of the deletion, but in order to do so we need to address the reasons those who voted in favour of deletion put forward. Most important is to show that this incident is noteworthy, i.e. worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. This requires references to other publications which report the incident (e.g. newspaper issues, articles in book and journals). Can you provide these? The other complaint was about the autobiographical nature of the article. In effect you are being penalised being open and honest enough to write in your own name.

<dd>I saw now that "Big Four" was already used after the First World War for "the four leaders of the most powerful nations who attended the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Peace_Conference%2C_1919_f74c.html" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference, 1919</a>.

These four leaders were responsible for devising the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>". I think that since this was half a century after the Railroad Big Four, the term was probably influenced by them, and the WWII Big Three by the ones of WWI rather than directly. Anyway, I did not notice when making this edit that there were already pages full of various "Big Three"s and "Big Four"s so you are right, I should have left the railroad Big Four alone in their own page.

<dd>There are two systems of judging soldiers. "Disciplinary proceeding" by a commanding officer, held in camera in his bureau without lawyers or witenesses and with the punishment restricted to 28 days, is very common. A full court martial, with three judges of whom at least one must be a jurist, which is held in public with lawyers and witnesses and press coverage, can give a much longer sentence but it can (and is) used for political speeches and gets considerable attention.That is why the army resorts to it only once a decade or so, and each case is memorable, is noticed by the press and by peace activists who make an effort to be present. The 280 cases that are refered to are of "disciplinary" instant trials in camera, not full court martials. The army does often use the full court martial against soldiers who broke discipline for non-political reasons (for example, desertion, being rude to an officer etc.). In non-political cases, the army feelks free because they get no press attention. Adam Keller 09:08, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi Mr Keller. Welcome back, and I hope your travels were good. I am afraid that our best efforts were unable to save the court martial article. On another subject, I was wondering whether you could help with the question of racism in Israel in both <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism_by_country.html" title="Racism by country">Racism by country</a>. If you look at the talk pages of these articles you can see that a number of editors have been involved in acrimonious exchanges with american "supporters of Israel" who are whitewashing and mention of racism in Israel. Your voice, as an Israeli who has been courageous in the battle against racism, may get a better response, especially if you are backed up by reliable sources. warmest regards <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 20:45, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In your edit from 12 March 2007<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goliath&amp;diff=114418506&amp;oldid=113970763" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goliath&amp;diff=114418506&amp;oldid=113970763" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></sup>, you've added information about "orpha and ruth being sisters", which seems to be an obvious error. I've reverted the paragraph and moved it to the talk page so you can make a case for your edit.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Goliath#Later_Jewish_Sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Goliath#Later_Jewish_Sources" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></sup> Jaakobou 17:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>your notes are not welcome on my page. i can easily look up changes in articles i edit. and may i suggest, you try employing some accuracy in your statements and quotes - you seem to have a unique ability at manipulating even the simplest of storylines - such as leaving out the validity level of ruth rabbah.

<dd>Sorry, I can't understand this remark. I could have reciprocated and said that YOUR notes are not welcome on MY page, but I would not do it. What are these pages for, except for Wikipedians to communicate with each other? And what "validity level"? Surely you don't think that Ruth and Orpah were actual persons and that some sources are more reliable than others in determining who they "really" were and what their realtions to each other were? There was one version of the story in the Bible, other versions in later Jewish sources. It is certainly relevant to mention what kind of sources they were, as you did. But what has "validity" to do with it? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Keller_28af.html" title="User:Adam Keller">Adam Keller</a> 18:19, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
