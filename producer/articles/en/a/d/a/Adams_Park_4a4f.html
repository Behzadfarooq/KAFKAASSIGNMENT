<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adams_Park_4a4f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p><b>1990</b> - Situated right on the edge of the Sands Industrial Estate in High Wycombe, the stadium was opened in time for the 1990/91 season, originally having a capacity of 6,000 with 1,267 seats in the Main Stand. The move was financed almost solely by the sale of the club's former stadium <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loakes_Park_a3cc.html" title="Loakes Park">Loakes Park</a> to the health authorities to facilitate the expansion of Wycombe General Hospital. It had come after a period of 30 years in which a site had been sought for a new stadium after Loakes Park had been earmarked for the site of the hospital development. Due to High Wycombe's hilly geography finding a suitably flat piece of ground that was also in a convenient place was not easy.</p>
<p>The new stadium coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes as, under the guidance of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_O%27Neill_d01b.html" title="Martin O'Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>, they won the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Trophy_31b9.html" title="FA Trophy">FA Trophy</a> at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley</a> thanks to a 2-1 win over <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidderminster_Harriers_F.C._13d6.html" title="Kidderminster Harriers F.C.">Kidderminster Harriers</a>. This was no doubt helped by the fact the club had no loans to service due to the stadium construction. It was during this season before the original date of the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> 2nd Round tie against professional side <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peterborough_United_F.C._ee44.html" title="Peterborough United F.C.">Peterborough United</a> that the <a href="http://www.homesoffootball.co.uk/reporting_from_the_ground.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.homesoffootball.co.uk/reporting_from_the_ground.htm" rel="nofollow">infamous scene</a> of football commentator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Motson_fc3d.html" title="John Motson">John Motson</a> being engulfed by what can only be described as a blizzard that had suddenly come over the Chiltern Hills during a live television broadcast before the game.</p>
<p>Two seasons later, the stadium witnessed Wycombe do the double by not only storming to the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Conference_6c7d.html" title="Football Conference">Conference</a> title by a country mile, but also by winning the FA Trophy in a 4-1 win over <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runcorn_FC_Halton_6a7c.html" title="Runcorn FC Halton">Runcorn</a> at Wembley in front of around 28,000 Wycombe fans making the short trip down the railway line. Wycombe had reached the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html" title="The Football League">Football League</a> for the first time in their history, a significant achievement for a club that had been a bastion of amateur football for so many decades. It was during this season that Wycombe officially recorded a then record crowd at Adams Park (the record at Loakes Park was 15,850 against <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Albans_City_F.C._0754.html" title="St Albans City F.C.">St Albans City</a> in 1950) of some 7,230 against Slough Town, though many eye-witness reports claim that as many 9,000 were let in due to concerns of overcrowding outside the stadium due to the huge interest from both sides' fans in the match. Many who couldn't get in the ground watched from the hills overlooking the stadium.</p>
<p>A few months after entering the Football League, the crush barriers on the terraces at Adams Park were upgraded, taking the capacity not far shy of the 10,000 mark. Promotion in the first season from the erstwhile <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Third_Division_c093.html" title="Football League Third Division">Division 3</a> (current <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Two_10d2.html" title="Football League Two">Coca-Cola League 2</a>) via the play-offs was followed by 6th place in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Second_Division_82be.html" title="Football League Second Division">Division 2</a>, just one place off the play-offs. However, after this momentous run of success, the manager <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_O%27Neill_d01b.html" title="Martin O'Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> left Wycombe for <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich_City_F.C._b179.html" title="Norwich City F.C.">Norwich</a> and eventually ended up one of the most prominent managers in English and eventually Scottish football.</p>
<p>Wycombe however went into a steady decline after Alan Smith took over in the summer of 1995. Crowds fell away in disapproval of his rather negative tactics, which were in stark contrast to O'Neill's far more attractive and flowing style. It was ironic that at this time further expansion of the stadium was carried out. In the summer of 1996 the impressive 4,990-seater Woodlands Stand was built on the hill behind the erstwhile Woodlands Terrace. The Hillbottom Road end, where the visiting fans are accommodated, was seated, thus reducing its capacity from well over 2,000 standing spaces to a mere 1,049 seats. The latter development had created problems when large amounts of visiting fans came to the ground, outstripping the supply of seats in that end when sides like <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford_F.C._1355.html" title="Watford F.C.">Watford</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_City_F.C._f327.html" title="Birmingham City F.C.">Birmingham City</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_City_F.C._90bc.html" title="Manchester City F.C.">Manchester City</a> came to town.</p>
<p>The capacity of the stadium was fixed at 10,000 to comply with council regulations, as the positioning of the stadium on a dead-end road was leading to problems when large crowds were leaving the ground, particularly with parking cars in the streets of the nearby residential suburb of Sands. This has hampered the ground since the club has been getting crowds over the 4 to 5,000 mark.</p>
<p><b>2000</b> - The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000-01_in_English_football_da9d.html" title="2000-01 in English football">2000/2001 season</a> was one that will be forever remembered not only by Wycombe Wanderers fans, but also by fans of clubs around the country. Although progress in the league was largely unspectacular, Wycombe's incredible run to the semi-final of the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> will live long into the memory. At Adams Park there were two sell-out crowds of 9,617 (short of the 10,000 due to segregation measures) against <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the 4th round, and 9,650 against <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wimbledon_F.C._43b4.html" title="Wimbledon F.C.">Wimbledon</a> (before they moved to Milton Keynes) in the 5th.</p>
<p><b>2001</b> - In the summer of 2001 the Hillbottom Road end was extended by an extra 977 seats to take the capacity to 2,026. This was done mainly to be able to accommodate more away fans in one place when the need arose. However, the capacity was kept at 10,000 by reducing the official capacity of the standing areas at the Valley End and on the paddock in front of the main stand.</p>
<p>It was during this season that the crowd record was broken again, 9,921 witnessing what was nearly a major shock against <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">Premiership</a> outfit <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham_F.C._53e7.html" title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a> in the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> 3rd Round in a 2-2 draw. Fulham only equalised in the last minute after what seemed like a foul by Barry Hayles during the move that lead to the goal.</p>
<p><b>2002</b> - The season after, the rugby union team from Sudbury, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a>, became tenants to Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park because of <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham_F.C._53e7.html" title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a> groundsharing with <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C._4b31.html" title="Queens Park Rangers F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> at <a href="../../../l/o/f/Loftus_Road_316f.html" title="Loftus Road">Loftus Road</a>, where Wasps used to be tenants. Just like when Wycombe moved to Adams Park, Wasps enjoyed a season if immense success winning the Premiership title two seasons running. However, Wycombe were in a period of decline, culminating in relegation from <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Second_Division_82be.html" title="Football League Second Division">Division 2</a> (now <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_One_a28d.html" title="Football League One">League 1</a>).</p>
<p><b>2003</b> - The summer of 2003 was one of indignation amongst not only the hardcore of Wycombe fans, but also generally amongst many people who wouldn't call themselves Wycombe fans. The cause was the 'rebranding' of the stadium's name to <b>The Causeway Stadium</b>. For £100,000 over three years local technology company Causeway bought the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Naming_rights.html" title="Naming rights">naming rights</a> to the ground. Many fans had pointed out the ground was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams, and to rename it would be hugely disrespectful to his memory. Adams had bought the former ground Loakes Park for the club, whose sale crucially financed the move to the stadium fittingly named after him. He is fondly remembered by many people outside of the club in High Wycombe for his grand gesture and contribution to the town. The Causeway Technologies sponsorship expired at the end of the 2005-06 season and the ground has reverted back to its Adams Park roots. The club is seeking a new ground sponsor, but has stated that it will only sell the name if the supporters approve. It has been rumoured that the sports (mainly <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby</a> including <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a>) clothing company <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury_of_New_Zealand_2ccb.html" title="Canterbury of New Zealand">Canterbury of New Zealand</a> may be the next sponsor with a £1m+ deal. However, the Wycombe Wanderers Supporters' Trust has distributed a questionnaire for supporters regarding this issue, and the "ballpark" figure quoted in it was no more than £50k p.a. after consultation with WWFC MD Steve Hayes, making the rumoured £1m figure sound very fanciful.</p>
<p><b>2005</b> - The ground attendance record was broken again in July 2005, when <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">Premiership</a> champions <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_F.C._c6c0.html" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a> brought their star-studded team to play Wycombe in a pre-season friendly. For the first time, the crowd was officially recorded as a full-to-capacity 10,000.</p>
<p>At was during this season that the idea that Adams Park would be further expanded was mooted by senior figures at Wycombe Wanderers and Wasps so that it can comply to the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Football_Union_d013.html" title="Rugby Football Union">Rugby Football Union</a> regulations for Premiership grounds in the future. These stipulate that stadia must have a capacity of at least 12,000 by 2007/08. It was initially suggested that a stand identical to the Woodlands Stand be built where the Main Stand is currently situated, though this would also require a large amount of road building to solve the current access difficulties. These plans never came to fruition, with the two clubs now exploring extending the Valley End of the stadium instead. In whichever form it was to take, expansion was definitely on the cards as Wasps signed an agreement that extends their stay in South Buckinghamshire by another two years, with a view to extending it long-term to 20 years afterwards.</p>
<p>Wycombe District Council also outlined long-term plans for the regeneration of the Abbey Barn area of the town which include a possible 20,000 capacity stadium near the current site of the Wycombe Heights dry ski slope. These would plans are in the very early stages and are not intended to be realised for around 20 years.</p>
<p><b>April 2006</b> - Planning permission is given for a new club shop, on April 2nd 2006, to be built in the summer to replace the current one housed in a large <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portakabin.html" title="Portakabin">portakabin</a>. This will be joined onto the offices in the back of the old main stand and free up space in the lower carpark. Plans were also announced for a, much needed, new front pedestrian entrance alongside the main vehicle front gates.</p>
<p><b>July 2006</b> - Plans are also afoot at <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a> for a new access route to the ground, allowing the expansion up to 15,000. Plans were handed over to WWFC by Wasps for expansion plans in July 2006. They include adding two tiers of seating onto the back of the existing Valley End terrace with them filling in the corner round to the large Woodlands Stand enclosing that section of the ground. The capacity will rise to 15,000 with this building work. There is also a revised access route planned to allow the safety certificate to let the extra 5,000 people in and out. The single access currently allows no more than 10,000 people in the ground regardless of the actual capacity. Costs for the expansion are put at between £4-5 million.</p>
<p>When, or indeed ever were this project to be realised it would render the surrounding area of splendid green-belt countryside unrecognisable to what it was some 16 years ago, when the construction of the stadium first took place.</p>
<p>New club shop and office plans were submitted to Wycombe District Council at the same time. The revised plans include a second storey of offices for joint use between <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C._62f4.html" title="Wycombe Wanderers F.C.">WWFC</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a>.</p>
<p><b>August 2006</b> - The Valley Terrace has a new sponsor, after Jewson ended their sponsorship, in the name of MEWA. Giving us the MEWA Valley Terrace. MEWA also provided Wasps with a new short sponsor for a short time in the 2006/2007 season before disappearing for unknown reasons.</p>
<p><b>September 2006</b> - It was announced at a <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a> fans forum at Marlow RFC that plans for the ground expansion should be made public by the end of October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p><b>October 2006</b> - Work has started on the new club shop and offices with the foundations going in. It is understood that Wasps will not be using the offices initially and that the new pedestrian entrance and car park layout may be added later, once the initial building work is complete (due by Christmas 2006). There may also be a, much needed, match day bar added under the Dreams Stand, where there is currently car parking. Plans for the new 1st floor club offices were rejected on October 19th by a Wycombe District Council committee. The new club shop will be built and is expect to be open in December. <a href="http://www.chairboys.ndirect.co.uk/onthenet/latest.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chairboys.ndirect.co.uk/onthenet/latest.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Also, the promised ground expansion plans that were due to be released in October failed to materialise, and, at the time of writing, the clubs have yet to elaborate on their plans for the redevelopment of the Valley End.</p>
<p><b>December 2006</b> - The new club shop opens, allowing the old <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portakabin.html" title="Portakabin">portakabins</a> to be removed, as their planning consent had expired. The shop was officially opened on the 7th by players and members of staff of both Wycombe Wanderers and Wasps. Stadium expansion plans are now due in the 'new year' according to David Davies (Wasps CEO) at a stadium travel plan meeting.</p>
<p><b>February 2007</b> - Update on Wasps stadium expansion plans at the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Wasps_7b38.html" title="London Wasps">London Wasps</a> fans forum in <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html" title="Twickenham">Twickenham</a>. The plans were altered after receiving comments from the Safety Advisory Group (SAG) &amp; the modified plans are currently being considered by SAG. Once they've approved the plans they will go to <a href="../../../w/w/f/WWFC_11d1.html" title="WWFC">WWFC</a> for final approval. At this point the Club will need to consider how &amp; when to submit the plans for outline planning permission.</p>
