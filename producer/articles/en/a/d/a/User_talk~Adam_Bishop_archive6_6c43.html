<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>I see that you deleted my contribution on the article <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusade</a> about the crusade against the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stedingen.html" title="Stedingen">Stedingers</a>. I know it wasn't a large crusade, but the fact that it was against roman catholic people who were excommunicated for purely political reasons makes it worth mentioning in this article. I also see that there is no mentioning about the 'crusades' (not sanctioned by the pope) against the jews in the Rhineland. A section could deal about that as well. I agree with the deletion of the enormous texts who are already mentioned in other articles.--<a href="../../../d/a/a/User%7EDaanschr_498e.html" title="User:Daanschr">Daanschr</a> 11:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Crusades against the jews have been mentioned. But i still think that the Stedingers should be mentioned as well, because they were unique.</p>

I've been watching and dealing with this user for a while (heck, ive gotten him blocked myself), and although he is a bit out of line at times in the <b>way</b> he approaches copyright violations, I dont think what he was doing qualifies as vandalism. All of his edits to the crusade were to add a {{copyvio}} tag, and although the violation turned out to be only two sentences, it still correct. So while ill be the first to agree that his actions were a bit over the top, I think that a one week block for vandalism (with no warnings or notices or discussion on his talk page first) is a bit out of line as well. Thanks for considering. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> <sub><sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELanoitarus_979b.html" title="User talk:Lanoitarus">(talk)</a></sup></sub> <b>.:.</b> 19:46, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Like I said, I agree with you that his approaches are totally out of line. He knows enough about wikipedia to use the copyvio tag because several of us have been following his edits since about the begining of december (when he first appeared). Originally he did not use the tag, but was told in no uncertain terms that if he did not follow procedure in the future he would be blocked, and we told him how to use it. If you read his talk page youll see a long history of this. Basically, my point is that i agree that he was way over the top here, but I hardly think a weeks blocking is in order, especially with no communication or warning. After all, it wasnt really vandalism, it was just hyper-psychotic copyvio policing. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> <sub><sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELanoitarus_979b.html" title="User talk:Lanoitarus">(talk)</a></sup></sub> <b>.:.</b> 21:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Adam, I've just come across Playboy's (at www.usedmagazines.com) "Back to Campus issue" of October, 1987 wherein it featured the "Women of Top 10 Party Colleges." My guess is that here is where Saugeen was mentioned/ featured -- a Playboy Top 10, not a Letterman Top 10. City Lights Bookstore in downtown London might have a copy of it or a buddy of mine might. Regarding the goat story, I haven't heard that one, but if you Google "Saugeen-Maitland Hall," you'll find 12 or so pages of stuff about the residence and the recurring theme is that's it been a wild place for years. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Wells_33a7.html" title="User:Barry Wells">Barry Wells</a> 22:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, I've just been looking at your list of contributions on WP. All I can say is you're one heck of contributor on a wide variety of topics, including Canadiana.

<p>I saw the comment "Monster Contributor" and took a look at your history contributions (I've seen your entries pop up an awful lot in Crusades-related articles as I've been perusing/studying/editing on that topic lately) - kudos! You also quickly caught a few errors on William of Tyre on my part, and demonstrated a great deal of knowledge and tact - which saved me a great deal embarassment! <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 17:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam -- yes I wrote the Monterey stuff on Milesago (it's my site, BTW) and the sources are cited there, although unfortunately the main article I drew on is no longer on the web.</p>
<p>Is it possible to restore the stuff I added please? Anything I take from Milesago for Wikipedia is my own writing/research and therefore my copyright (yes? no?), so I can't see what the problem is? I've had the same hassle with the article about Stewie Speer even though it's all my article from my site. *sigh*. Is this going to happen all the time? How do I avoid this?

<p>Hi Adam -- staggeringly prompt response, mate! Now I grok the question -- sorry but it's 3.45 am over here so I'm a bit slow on the uptake. I have NO problems with my Milesago stuff being used on Wiki and/or getting copied elsewhere, or I wouldn't put it there. The main reasons I started adding copyright notices on Milesago were (A) not all of the stuff there is my work and I want to protect the people who contribute (although I only ever put MY articles on Wiki) and (B) because some clown of a music teacher in northern NSW copied a whole bunch of stuff off Milesago onto his own website and used it as a teaching resource without asking.</p>
<p>But basically I don't care what happens to my work on Milesago as long as it's acknowledged when used by others. However I'm not familiar enough with international copyright to have thought through the implications concerning copying my articles to Wikipedia. Call me lazy, but I have a house to finish renovating (singlehanded) so copyright law is WAAAY down the "to do" list, haha. Anyway, all the best and thanks for your assistance and advice&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunks58_9740.html" title="User:Dunks58">Dunks</a></p>

<p>I read you. Yes, obvious might have been an option, though one I did not think of. But remember that Maria Comnena and her daughter Isabella were at least as obvious, which is why Sibylla had to shore up her position, and proper looking struck me as a good rendering... <i>aparoistre</i> meant to become/be visible, or to seem, but had connotations of looking good, unless qualified. There may very well be something to your idea about the term being linked to <i>heir apparent</i>, I could not tell. And I grant I'm NOT an expert in old French, the earliest I read with ease being Rabelais, I never could get proper education in the older dialects. I am relying on more general knowledge of French(my native tongue after all), Latin, linguistics and history. --<a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvartalf_4e9b.html" title="User:Svartalf">Svartalf</a> 17:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam! I found an image of Melisende's marrage to Fulk in 1130! It is from the 'Histoire de la conquete de Jerusalem' by William of Tyre, an exerpt appearing in "The Crusades; An Illistrated History" (found at Barnes and Noble!). It is amazing! It protrays a crownd Melisende and an un-crowned Fulk, the right hand of each is held by the Latin Patriarch. Melisende has golden-yellow hair and appears demure. A crowed and bearded Baldwin II appears behind Fulk, with his right hand facing the back of Fulk's head. What is telling is that Melisende is crowned and Fulk is not.</p>
<p>There are other church officials in the back ground, but I do not know whom they may be. There are richly clothed lords to the left of the picture, and bejeweled ladies on the right behind Melisende.</p>
<p>The illistration appeares <i>exactly</i> in the style of the one on the book-cover of "Queen of Swords", which appears to protray Melisende and party in Acre watching Fulk's ships come to dock. Additionally it seems very close to the image we removed of "a queen accepting fealty from a vassel". Weather or no they are in fact Melisende images I do not yet know. I wish to scane the image of the wedding, and once I get more images directly from the 'Histoire' will wish to publish them here too, mayhap with your assistance and prior viewing. What is the policy of an image from a book but of a clearly older source?<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a> 02:36, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam; you were very helpful to me some time back, and if I could be so bold as to ask for your assistance again it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>I like to stay abreast with articles of interest and prime to that is to see the latest articles that become linked to it. The default for the <i>What links here</i> is to display the earliest written article to the last written article that is linked to it.</p>
<p>I was wondering if that can be manipulated so as to display the latest article first? It certainly would save a lot of time when paging down through reams of links, sometimes in the thousands to get to the latest.</p>
<p>The ability to do this is an option when viewing the <i>User contributions</i> page when you can choose the option of latest or earliest. You may not be able to answer this question or suggestion, but I believe that it would be a worthwhile option for many users that uses <i>What links here</i> similar to how I use it. <a href="../../../h/j/k/User%7EHJKeats_7f65.html" title="User:HJKeats">HJKeats</a> 13:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was hoping I wouldn't get that answer but I kind of suspected it. Do you believe that it is something that could be requested be changed? I'm sure if you took a survey of the active wikipedians they would all say that they use it this way and to get to the latest can be a pain. How do we go about to force change? <a href="../../../h/j/k/User%7EHJKeats_7f65.html" title="User:HJKeats">HJKeats</a> 02:23, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not so. In many sources she is referred to as Queen of Caria or of the Carians. Her tyrantship over the largely Greek populace of Halikarnassos was probably in addition to a queenship over the native Carians who inhabited the hill country. The fact that the later ARtemisia is referred to as "Artemisia II" clearly recognizes that she is of the same rough sequence as Artemisia I.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 04:49, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to let you know I've been tweaking a few articles; hope that's OK. I noted that a few articles still retain interpretations that are no longer sustained by contemporary academic historians. For example, Bernard Hamilton has, I think, effectively taken apart the definitions of 'court' vs 'noble' factions in Baldwin IV's reign - it's more about paternal vs maternal kin-groups. The traditional depiction of the king as his mother's puppet is not really sustainable these days. Also, as (it seems) the main (only?!) English-speaking Montferrat researcher, I've clarified a few references about the Williams, Conrad and Baldwin V. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverwhistle_7e2d.html" title="User:Silverwhistle">Silverwhistle</a> 00:35, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - when I was a student in the '80s, Runciman &amp; c were still the historical orthodoxy. But over the past year or so I've been catching up on over 20 years' worth of new work. I've been reworking some of the articles as I've come across them, to acknowledge the differences. (Have done some tweaks on Balian of Ibelin). What's interesting is that so many of the earlier historians took on board the prejudices of some of the chroniclers without question - even when they were obvious political players like William of Tyre, with his sour grapes over not getting the Patriarch's job. (I'm reminded of Stubbs's 19C introductions and notes to things like the <i>Itinerarium Peregrinorum</i> and Roger of Howden - as vicious in the notes as in the text about Conrad!) I enjoyed Kedar's <i>Outremer</i>, the festschrift volume for Joshua Prawer - good pieces on Guy and Eraclius.</dd>

This tapestry was inspired by a fresco depicting the events detailed above, and was painted in 1420 by an anonymous painter known only as the "Master of Manta".

<p>There wasn't, as far as I can see, an actual annullment-and-remarriage - she simply selected him at the coronation and crowned him, while he was still her husband. Given that there had been a precedent with her parents (Amalric getting throne and having to annul Agnes), it might have been hoped she'd co-operate. The same precedent would also have been in play re: Isabella and Humphrey.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>I have seen that you did a partial revert on the "viz" article. You say <i>the 7 with or without bar is an abbreviation for "et"</i> implying, IIUC, that the final 'z' in "viz" has another origin. This would be confirmed by <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tironian_notes.html" title="Tironian notes">Tironian notes</a>, which says (emphasys mine):</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Two</b> Tironian notes are still used today: the Tironian "et" in Ireland, and the "z"</dd>
<dd>of "viz" (short for videlicet), which denotes a Tironian symbol shaped somewhat like a "z".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do you have any reference for this? It would also be nice to have an image of this second symbol, in order to compare it with the first one.</p>

<p>Hi, Adam,</p>
<p>I found that Western <a href="http://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/western/web/2006(new)/WESTERNS_COAT_OF_ARMS_146888.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/western/web/2006(new)/WESTERNS_COAT_OF_ARMS_146888.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> insists "white and purple" is correct because the heraldic description is "purpure and argent". So I went to revert and found that it had already been reverted. Seems a little obsessive-compulsive to me. Still don't see why they bother to teach logic, though. <i>p</i> <sub><b>v</b></sub> <i>q</i> = <i>q</i> <sub><b>v</b></sub> <i>p</i> is what I was taught in Philosophy 37 or whatever it was. I think it was, anyway; it's so long ago they could have changed the rules. Anyway, I added a note that this position is an opinion of the administration.</p>
<p>Don;t want to sound disparaging here, although I have (I got a cold). If there's a good reason I'm open to removing my note. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 19:49, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A slight twist on the rude &amp; arrogant words you uttered on my talk page. You've put yourself on the wrong foot already with me. To answer your rude questions, I am <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a>, just incase you didn't get it from my talk page. Why you should care what I think is because maybe if you listened to what I thought, you'd find out what someone other than your over inflated ego bulging inside that head of yours thinks. I'm simply placing a legitimit template on the movies I've reviewed. People are allowed to place templates for their collaborations which go nowhere, so why aren't I allowed to place a template for a couple of movies which I reviewed? I also encourage others to take part in the process, saying they should submit their reviews too. If they did in the first place, maybe I wouldn't have to "spam" (hardly...) the movie's talk pages. If you have a problem, please ask my opinion before deleting all my templates. I shouldn't get blocked for exploding up there, because quite frankly, you started it.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can take a joke, but yours wasn't very funny. In fact, it was quite.... not jokey. The templates do not detract from the encyclopedic value. I'm sure all encyclopedias have their own collaboration banners on their talk pages.... (not!). So I don't see how I'm disrupting the whole site with a couple of banners on a couple of little used talk pages to a page which might give someone an idea of the book or movie they might want to see soon. They can even contribute if they wish. I do not see the problem. The only problem is you probably being jealous that I have a review's page &amp; well.... you don't.

<p>Hello again Adam. Thanks for replying to my earlier question. "It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine," to quote an overrated English scribbler. With that in mind, would you mind having a look through the summaries on my edits, and the comments I've made on talk and user talk pages lately, and tell me how I'm doing on the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> side of things&#160;? Somewhere along the way I appear to have upset someone, which surprises me, since I surely am a ray of sunshine, or so I think. So perhaps a second opinion wouldn't hurt. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for checking so quickly&#160;! Much appreciated. I don't know who I upset. If it was do to with reporting open proxies being used for scripted edits/vandalism, then I'm happy I did upset someone. I just wanted to check I wan't being a complete dick.

<p>Hi, Adam.

If you look at the discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Future_TV_shows" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Future TV shows</a>, it seems that there isn't really a consensus for a speedy deletion.

<p>I've just restored this per the request on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. The speedy reason given is not part of the CSD (crystal-ballery) and, whilst a good reason to slowly delete an article, a template that actually contains no information of crystal-ball nature seems to lie far outside the speedy criteria. It was also a contested PROD that the PRODder essentially tried to force through by an inappropriate speedy.

<p>The anonymous vandal has struck again, less than 24 hours after I set the matter right again. I think the "long period of time" you perceived stemmed only from my being slow in checking and correcting the article.

<p>This is turning into an edit war, and <b>something</b> has to be done about it.</p>
<p>All because some know-it-alls from the briton world won't take continental Europe's historical data, both archeologic and linguistic into account, and insist into turning the article into a disclaimer about it being a legend born of the low standards of Victorian era historical analysis... I know from linguistic evidence and from reputable (and quoted) French sources, that this bit of ironmongery was no legend, and I'd bet the German world might give some confirmation, except I can't do that job myself. I can't negociate a note about the matter with some #@§% who operate only from an anonymous IP number and don't quote sources. "generally acknowledged today that virtually all the armour on the Bayeux Tapestry is standard chain mail "&#160;: by whom? Anyway, this method of wholly replacing a decent article with one that is laden with POV and unsourced, and without giving a proper signature constitutes vandalism if I ever saw it. As for the talk page, I've made my position and sources quite clear there, as you can check yourself, and the naysayers are wanting in their argumentation. Contamine's source catalog alone (just on medieval armour) takes several dozen pages. As for the "reputed armor expert Dan Howard", I've checked him out, and found he's interested in winning arguments, not in serious history, and resorts to dirty debate team tricks when he can't prove his point.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, "ringmail" really was a historical type of armor, even if the term is of recent coinage, and I'm tired of correcting the rants of stupid dweebs who haven't had access to proper sources and try to pass it for a legend created by misinformed historians, and who pass their own misconceptions as "widely acknowledged truth". By letting them anonymously rewrite history, you're letting falsehood and POV into the wiki... which goes contrary to this work's objective. I guess it's to avoid that kind of thing that admins are given special powers. I'm an ordinary joe and can't do a thing about it. Now, if you want me to just wash my hands of the whole matter and let whole days of research go to naught as "difference of opinion", okay... but then, I wash my hands of the whole wiki, I don't want to work for nothing. I can understand people improving on my stuff, but not making my work a complete waste of time. --<a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvartalf_4e9b.html" title="User:Svartalf">Svartalf</a> 17:49, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
I've been translating your contributions into Swedish for about two or three years now. I've been thinking of providing you with some good feedback for about the same time. So, this is my way of saying "great job, keep going"! I'm glad you are around, several of my translations are featured or "prominent" articles on the Swedish Wikipedia now. Your contributions are really part of the best side of Wikipedia!<br />

<p>Descendents of Edward IV and Henry VII</p>
<p>What sort of social rank would one have to bear in their family, in order to be a descendent of either?</p>
<p>How far up the totem pole, would you say?</p>
<p>This is intended to have broad answers and based on gradients of time and population, not going into specifics about exact descendents. About how common is their descent in the English or British genepool today?</p>
<p>I've noticed that American Presidents don't descend from either king, but the most common recent royal ancestor shared by many of us is Edward III. How common is it for anybody in the English or British genepool, to have a Protestant royal ancestor?</p>
<p>There is a general cutoff, isn't there?</p>
<p>Is it because of fratricide in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors' "new men", or the Union of the Crowns, or the parliamentary union under Queen Anne (I can't think of any non-royal family descent from the Hanoverians within the UK)?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is a big difference between Plantagenet and Tudor descents, that the commons in all likelihood have the former and the latter is held by the lords. (just generally speaking) Then again, Tudor descent in the Welsh must be higher in general. I am further curious about pre-Royal Tudor blood in Anglo-British people today, since the status and/or concept of Welsh royalty/nobility is rather hazy in my mind. I found the Blevins aka Ap Bleddyn family of Powys in my ancestry, but have no real idea on what to make of it--or any other Welsh "native aristocracy". I might be able to find Stewart descent somewhere, from way back when. What percentage of Hanoverian background do you think that German colonists had in America?</p>
<p>On the British side, I have to go as far back as Welf himself...but any recent genetic relationship with the Hanoverians or the counts of Nassau are completely obscure. How does one research those other colonial people, such as the Hessians?</p>
<p>UK genealogy is relatively easy when focusing on English (and French) ancestries. What would a "national person" of Jerusalem (or Antioch, for example) in Crusader times be known as?</p>
<p>We say "American" for those Founders, but was there such a nationality-term for the Crusaders in their own domains?</p>
<p>I guess the term is supposed to be Levantine/Outremer, or "Crusader" as our national heritage says "Colonist"...</p>

<p>Hi Adam. I'm not sure who said it but I know for sure that it was in Phillips' book on the fourth crusade. That's what I like about Phillips, his rich citations of contemporary accounts. Give me a minute, I'll find the full citation and paste it here. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 12:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aha, I found it (ch. 9, The first siege of Constantinople), but I was wrong about the context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alexius III dispatched a Lombard, Nicolo Rosso, to hear at first hand why the crusaders had come to Byzantim and to ask them to justify their actions... Some feared the effect of this approach, and Hugh of Saint-Pol reflected the age-old suspicion of Greek duplicity: "<i>we did not want the Greeks to solicit or soften us with their gifts</i>".</p>

<p>hi Adam, how are you? question, long time ago you translated the article <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_V_of_Austria_%28Babenberg%29_17dd.html" title="Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)">Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)</a> from German into English, thank you for your work. I am trying to find a solution to the naming issue of the article, since according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a>, article "Other royals" point 1 states "<i>For royalty other than monarchs: 1. If they hold a princely substantive title, use "{first name}, {title}". Examples: Charles, Prince of Wales, Anne, Princess Royal, Felipe, Prince of Asturias.</i>" and point 2 "<i>If they hold a substantive title that is not princely (a peerage, for instance), use "Prince/ss {first name}, {title}". Examples: Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.</i>". I guess if you don't want to count the non-ruling Habsburg's as royalty but as nobility, "Other non-royal names" point 1 "<i>Members of the hereditary Peerage (people who inherit their title), such as a marquess, viscount, count, duke, earl, etc., as with royals have two names....etc.</i>" (I won't post everything down, you can click here for the full text <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29#Other_non-royal_names" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29#Other_non-royal_names" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> gives a further guideline. Basically my question is, since you created the article, do you think moving it to another location such as "Leopold V, Duke of Austria" is ok with you, similar to the format <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_XIII%2C_Duke_of_Bavaria_f1ef.html" title="Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria">Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria</a>? Only if he was a ruler of a place is the format "xxxx of xxxx" used for males (see Wikipedia convention on "Monarchical titles", point 1). Similarly, the current <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_V_of_Austria_%28Habsburg%29_0aba.html" title="Leopold V of Austria (Habsburg)">Leopold V of Austria (Habsburg)</a> would be moved to "Archduke Leopold V of Austria". Do you see what I am trying to say? Following this pattern, the current non-ruling Habsburg articles would be moved in order to make a differentiation easier and have them comply with the current Wikipedia rules. Looking forward to your thoughts, thank you. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 18:20, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see no reason not to include it; its unfortunate her gender will make her an asterisk in future history books, but surely her passing is as significant as the sacrifices of the other 16 Canadians, some who have been highlighted by articles already. One may want to revisit the decision if Canadian casualties become as numerous as US casualties in Iraq but I think Captain Goddard will always be of historical significance, as much as I disagree with the reasons why that may be so.

After all the helpful contributions everyone made to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_I_Comnenus_fd09.html" title="Manuel I Comnenus">Manuel I Comnenus</a>, and its selection as a Featured Article, I think it would be great to get the article on John II up to the same standard. Suggestions on the talk page for the article would be much appreciated. Thanks! <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigdaddy1204_d2e3.html" title="User:Bigdaddy1204">Bigdaddy1204</a> 13:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of late, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarrtel_9c5d.html" title="User:Marrtel">Marrtel</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarrtel_46d2.html" title="User talk:Marrtel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marrtel_b1c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marrtel">contribs</a>) has been busy moving assorted pages around. I have no problem with that. What I do have an issue with is the user's habit of editing the redirects which result, and in some cases creating the redirects which were suggested as alternative names, so as to require admin intervention to move them back. Equally annoying, the user never, ever fixes the double redirects. Note that <a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wknight94_b36c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wknight94">contribs</a>) noticed the redirect fiddling first.</p>

<p>This looks like MoS-Wonkery gone mad. You may like to look at the edits which resulted from the editor moving articles on medieval Scots <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormaers.html" title="Mormaers">Mormaers</a> (not Earls, but we are stuck with Earls unless we move them all to X, Mormaer of Y) around to suit his/her interpretation of the MoS. I can't see any benefit to what the user is doing, and the cleanup work which (s)he leaves behind is taking up other editors' time. The total absence of discussion, and the unwillingness to wait and see what the views of other editors might be, is worrying.

<p>Hi. I just noticed you are an administrator, so I want to run this by you. I have been editing articles on Byzantium in accordance with the discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EConstantine_XI_b9e4.html" title="Talk:Constantine XI">Talk:Constantine XI</a>, and have also moved some pages accordingly (since it seems that matching article title and usage within the article is important to some contributors). However, there are several pages in which a pre-existing redirect does not permit the move without the intervention of an administrator. In this case the information is fully usable and accessible regardless of the form one enters in the search engine, but for the sake of consistency the redirects should be reversed. Would you be willing to undertake this? At present, the pages in question are (to my knowledge) only 5:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Palaeologus_fac5.html" title="Thomas Palaeologus">Thomas Palaeologus</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Palaiologos_0b65.html" title="Thomas Palaiologos">Thomas Palaiologos</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_IX_Monomachus_206d.html" title="Constantine IX Monomachus">Constantine IX Monomachus</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_IX_Monomachos_6849.html" title="Constantine IX Monomachos">Constantine IX Monomachos</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Psellus_ffcb.html" title="Michael Psellus">Michael Psellus</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Psellos_6cbd.html" title="Michael Psellos">Michael Psellos</a></li>

<dd>Thanks for getting this done so quickly. I just cleaned up any resulting double redirects and now everything should work fine.

<p>A new user has unilaterally decided that the name Stefan used by all rulers of the Nemanjić dynasty in Serbia was actually a title and moved a number of these articles accordingly. Although in some cases it can be shown that the name Stefan was adopted as a regnal name, it was used intrinsically in royal and imperial documents, and is standard in modern historiography, be it Serbian or foreign (e.g., the standard English treatment, John V.A. Fine Jr., <i>The Late Medieval Balkans</i>, Ann Arbor, 1987). I have fixed what damage I could, but the following have to be fixed by an administrator because of pre-existing redirects. The following redirects should be reversed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radoslav_I_of_Serbia_208a.html" title="Radoslav I of Serbia">Radoslav I of Serbia</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Radoslav_of_Serbia_b4c5.html" title="Stefan Radoslav of Serbia">Stefan Radoslav of Serbia</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladislav_I_of_Serbia_ccf4.html" title="Vladislav I of Serbia">Vladislav I of Serbia</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Vladislav_I_of_Serbia_bac1.html" title="Stefan Vladislav I of Serbia">Stefan Vladislav I of Serbia</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladislav_II_of_Syrmia_7e67.html" title="Vladislav II of Syrmia">Vladislav II of Syrmia</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Vladislav_II_of_Syrmia_f0f0.html" title="Stefan Vladislav II of Syrmia">Stefan Vladislav II of Syrmia</a></li>

<p>Hey Adam</p>
<p>I just read through all this... fascinating. I didn't know that you were an admin... but I'm new and don't know much. I saw your comment somewhere about being stuck using your real name. Ironically, I had been thinking about changing to my name. After reading all the negative things here however, I've changed my mind.</p>
<p>As far as fixing up the article, I will if I find some solid, quotable information. I'm just beginning my research, though. I was going to make a comment about how busy I was... but I concede that you are busier.</p>

<p>Hi Adam -- I just took a look at this article, &amp; yes the comment about a "Frankish royal family" ruling Antioch is odd. (IIRC, Antioch was part of the Muslim world at that time.) What I suspect is behind this phraseology is that the Arab word for European ("Ferenji") is adapted from the word "Frank" or "French" due to the number of Frenchmen during the Crusades, &amp; a native Arabic speaker, for whom English is a second language, may have confused the two words; the use of "Frank" dates back to the original contribution, which was made by an anonymous editor. (Take a look at List of words meaning outsider, foreigner or "not one of us", &amp; notice how the Arabic term has permeated thru the lands around the Indian Ocean!) And yes, the creators of <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> stole the word to name that alien race. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 14:24, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good day to you. Yes, of course I read it; pretty flimsy reasoning was my thoughts, certainly not enough to contravene established usage.

<dd>This is not the case for the Emperor Heraclius, he is called "Heraclius" in most recent works. I see what you mean with the apparent variation in my thinking. My reasoning is based on usage my the most respected contemporary historians and, and it is not unconnected, ethnic identity. So I think it is quite right to have Malcolm III of Scotland as Máel Coluim III of Scotland, but the Emperor Heraclius is a Roman Emperor; few historians would call him Herakleios, although this is a fair rendition of the Greek spelling. Moreover, I find it extremely distasteful to see past multinational rulers being claimed by one ethnic group, and in the case of these rulers, I'd prefer English names (as, apparently, do historians). For Hraclius the Patriarch, maybe he does get called Eraclius; but I checked a couple of my books on high medieval England, and these guys (e.g. Bartlett), employ Heraclius. I don't object to the name Eraclius per se, but I think there needs to be more discussion on that page. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 02:09, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I guess no one got around to installing them...<i>I</i> still haven't finished. I probably won't go through the articles until I figure out whether the birth and death year should go after the papal name (as it is on most pages) or the pre-papal name (as it is on some more recent popes—which generally adhere to the style guidelines more completely) and the preferred structure of the first sentence (not that these have to be uniform). <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 21:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Adam, thanks for the comment. I think, after a few days of arguing with everyone on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EConstantine_XI_b9e4.html" title="Talk:Constantine XI">Talk:Constantine XI</a> (and, really, that's among the most absurd places imaginable for this debate. I suppose it's better than having it at, I don't know, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_III_of_France_130c.html" title="Napoleon III of France">Napoleon III of France</a>, but only marginally.), I have come down to more or less your opinion - I don't particularly like the result, but it's not incredibly horrible, and it's not worth the kind of sustained effort that would be required to change it back. Still a bit disheartening, though. And I do agree with your reasoning on the second vote - it's better to have consistent names than a policy of using inconsistent names, which is ridiculous. But I just don't think it was fair to exclude the fully Latinized option for absolutely no reason, except that a misguided mediator said so. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 09:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

They are hardly "of" those obscure French places if they never went there. We come back to the insoluble naming questions (as with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EConstantine_XI_b9e4.html" title="Talk:Constantine XI">Byzantium</a>) of which I had quite enough during my many years as a library cataloguer.

<dd>Technically the accurate usage is "de Villehardouin" or, in English translation, "of Villehardouin." This has nothing to do with whether or not these rulers had anything to do with the barony of Villehardouin itself, it is just the typical medieval aristocratic family name derived from a benefice. That being said, although the thought that something was not quite right did cross my mind when I first saw the list of princes of Achaea, I suppose plain "Villehardouin" is tolerable enough to be retained.

<p>Hey -- the guy requested unblocking. I didn't, but I did start a post on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> about this block. I don't disagree with your action, I just feel that if it's a community block, it needs community exposure. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, how well do you know <a href="../../../e/d/u/User%7EEduardo89_59e4.html" title="User:Eduardo89">Eduardo Rivero</a>? Is there any chance you can help me get him to stop the vandalism he's been doing for the past month or more? I'm tired of always looking for the same set of boring and predictable vandalism to the school articles. (See <a href="../../../s/_/c/User_talk%7ES_charette_c1ac.html#Problems_with_user_Eduardo_Rivero" title="User talk:S charette">this short discussion</a> for some background.) --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stephane Charette</a> 23:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry -- thought you may have known him because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Adam_Bishop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58809227" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Adam_Bishop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58809227" rel="nofollow">this childish vandalism</a> to your userpage back in June. He was a student at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George%27s_School_%28Vancouver%29_1af5.html" title="St. George's School (Vancouver)">St. George's</a> in Vancouver, and now looks like he's over at <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordonstoun.html" title="Gordonstoun">Gordonstoun</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schule_Schloss_Salem_7dc7.html" title="Schule Schloss Salem">Schule Schloss Salem</a>, which are the articles he typically vandalises. --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stephane Charette</a> 01:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
