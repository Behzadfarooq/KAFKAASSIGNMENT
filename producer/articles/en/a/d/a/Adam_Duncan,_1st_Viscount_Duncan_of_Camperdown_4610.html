<p>Adam Duncan, second son of Alexander Duncan of Lundie, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost.html" title="Provost">Provost</a> of Dundee, and his wife Helen Haldane, daughter of John Haldane of Gleneagles. He entered the navy in 1746 on board the <i>Trial</i> sloop, under the care of his maternal uncle, Captain <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Haldane_7e40.html" title="Robert Haldane">Robert Haldane</a>, with whom, in HMS <i>Trial</i> and afterwards in <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Shoreham_5125.html" title="HMS Shoreham">HMS <i>Shoreham</i></a>, he continued till the peace in 1748. In 1749 he was appointed to <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Centurion_ec26.html" title="HMS Centurion">HMS <i>Centurion</i></a>, then commissioned for service in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, by the Hon. <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Keppel_b6a1.html" title="Augustus Keppel">Augustus Keppel</a> (afterwards Viscount Keppel), with whom he was afterwards in the <i>Norwich</i> on the coast of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, and was confirmed in the rank of lieutenant on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">10 January</a> <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a>.</p>
<p>In August 1755 he followed Keppel to the <i>Swiftsure</i>, and in January 1756 to the <i>Torbay</i>, in which he continued till his promotion to commander's rank on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">21 September</a> <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a>, and during this time was present in the expedition to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Roads_8716.html" title="Basque Roads">Basque Roads</a> in 1757, at the reduction of <a href="../../../g/o/r/Goree.html" title="Goree">Goree</a> in 1758, and in the blockade of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_France_092f.html" title="Brest, France">Brest</a> in 1759, up to within two months of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Quiberon_Bay_8e83.html" title="Battle of Quiberon Bay">battle of Quiberon Bay</a>, from which his promotion just excluded him.</p>
<p>From October 1759 to April 1760 he had command of the <i>Royal Exchange</i>, a hired vessel employed in petty convoy service with a miscellaneous ship's company, consisting to a large extent of boys and foreigners, many of whom (he reported) could not speak English, and all impressed with the idea that as they had been engaged by the merchants from whom the ship was hired they were not subject to naval discipline. It would seem that a misunderstanding with the merchants on this point was the cause of the ship's being put out of commission after a few months.</p>
<p>As a commander Duncan had no further service, but on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">25 February</a> <a href="../../../1/7/6/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a> he was posted and appointed to the <i>Valiant</i>, fitting for Keppel's broad pennant. In her he had an important share in the reduction of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle_%C3%8Ele_4a04.html" title="Belle Île">Belle Île</a> in June 1761, and of <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a> in August 1762. He returned to England in 1763, and, notwithstanding his repeated request, had no further employment for many years.</p>
<p>During this time he lived principally at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>, and married on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_6.html" title="June 6">6 June</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a> Henrietta, daughter of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Dundas_c99b.html" title="Robert Dundas">Robert Dundas</a> of Arniston, lord-president of the court of session. It would seem that his alliance with this influential family obtained him the employment which he had been vainly seeking during fifteen years. Towards the end of 1778 he was appointed to the <i>Suffolk</i>, from which he was almost immediately moved into the <i>Monarch</i>. In January 1779 he sat as a member of the court-martial of Keppel, and in the course of the trial interfered several times to stop the prosecutor in irrelevant and in leading questions, or in perversions of answers. The <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty.html" title="Admiralty">admiralty</a> was therefore desirous that he should not sit on the court-martial of Sir <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Palliser_8457.html" title="Hugh Palliser">Hugh Palliser</a>, which followed in April, and the day before the assembling of the court sent down orders for the <i>Monarch</i> to go to <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Helens%2C_Merseyside_bbfe.html" title="St Helens, Merseyside">St. Helens</a>. Her crew, however, refused to weigh the anchor until they were paid their advance; and as this could not be done in time, the <i>Monarch</i> was still in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> harbour when the signal for the court-martial was made (Considerations on the Principles of Naval Discipline, 8vo, 1781, p. 106n.); so that, sorely against the wishes of the admiralty, Duncan sat on this court-martial also.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1779 the <i>Monarch</i> was attached to the Channel fleet under Sir <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Hardy_0520.html" title="Charles Hardy">Charles Hardy</a>; in December was one of the squadron with which <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Rodney_112a.html" title="George Rodney">Rodney</a> sailed for the relief of <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, and had a prominent share in the action off <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines_a739.html" title="Saint Vincent and the Grenadines">St. Vincent</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">16 January</a> <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a>. On returning to England Duncan quitted the <i>Monarch</i>, and had no further command till after the change of ministry in March 1782, when Keppel became <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty_bef6.html" title="First Lord of the Admiralty">first lord of the admiralty</a>. He was then appointed to the <i>Blenheim</i> of 90 guns, and commanded her during the year in the grand fleet under <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Howe%2C_1st_Earl_Howe_2214.html" title="Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe">Howe</a>, at the relief of Gibraltar in October, and the rencounter with the allied fleet off <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Spartel_270a.html" title="Cape Spartel">Cape Spartel</a>. He afterwards succeeded Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jervis_b7bb.html" title="John Jervis">John Jervis</a> in command of the <i>Foudroyant</i>, and after the peace commanded the <i>Edgar</i> as guardship at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> for three years. He attained flag rank on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a> <a href="../../../1/7/8/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>, became vice-admiral <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a>, and admiral <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">1 June</a> <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a>. In February 1795 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, and hoisted his flag on board the <i>Venerable</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Duncan%2C_1st_Viscount_Duncan_of_Camperdown_4610.html" title="Edit section: In Action with the Dutch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In Action with the Dutch</span></h2>
<p>During the first two years of Duncan's command the work was limited to enforcing a rigid blockade of the enemy's coast, but in the spring of 1797 it became more important from the knowledge that the Dutch fleet in the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texel.html" title="Texel">Texel</a> was getting ready for sea. The situation was one of extreme difficulty, for the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutiny.html" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a> which had paralysed the fleet at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nore.html" title="Nore">Nore</a> broke out also in that under Duncan, and kept it for some weeks in enforced inactivity. Duncan's personal influence and some happy displays of his vast personal strength held the crew of the <i>Venerable</i> to their duty; but with one other exception, that of the <i>Adamant</i>, the ships refused to quit their anchorage at <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarmouth.html" title="Yarmouth">Yarmouth</a>, leaving the <i>Venerable</i> and <i>Adamant</i> alone to keep up the pretence of the blockade. Fortunately the Dutch were not at the time ready for sea; and when they were ready and anxious to sail, with thirty thousand troops, for the invasion of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, a persistent westerly wind detained them in harbour till they judged that the season was too far advanced (Life of Wolfe Tone, ii. 425–35). For political purposes, however, the government in Holland, in spite of the opinion of their admiral, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_de_Winter_32bf.html" title="Admiral de Winter">De Winter</a>, to the contrary, ordered him to put to sea in the early days of October.</p>
<p>Duncan, with the main body of the fleet, was at the time lying at Yarmouth revictualling, the Texel being watched by a small squadron under Captain <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Trollope_a151.html" title="Henry Trollope">Henry Trollope</a> in the <i>Russell</i>, from whom he received early information of the Dutch being at sea. He at once weighed, with a fair wind stood over to the Dutch coast, saw that the fleet was not returned to the Texel, and steering towards the south sighted it on the morning of <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_11.html" title="October 11">11 October</a>. about seven miles from the shore and nearly halfway between the villages of <a href="../../../e/g/m/Egmont.html" title="Egmont">Egmont</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camperdown.html" title="Camperdown">Camperdown</a>. The wind was blowing straight on shore, and though the Dutch forming their line to the north preserved a bold front, it was clear that if the attack was not made promptly they would speedily get into shoal water, where no attack would be possible. Duncan at once realised the necessity of cutting off their retreat by getting between them and the land. At first he was anxious to bring up his fleet in a compact body, for at best his numbers were not more than equal to those of the Dutch; but seeing the absolute necessity of immediate action, without waiting for the ships astern to come up, without waiting to form line of battle, and with the fleet in very irregular order of sailing, in two groups, led respectively by himself in the <i>Venerable</i> and Vice-admiral Richard Onslow in the <i>Monarch</i>, he made the signal to pass through the enemy's line and engage to leeward.</p>
<p>It was a bold departure from the absolute rule laid down in the <i>Fighting Instructions,</i> still new, though warranted by the more formal example of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Howe%2C_1st_Earl_Howe_2214.html" title="Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe">Howe</a> on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_First_of_June_fd50.html" title="Glorious First of June">1 June 1794</a>; and on this occasion, as on the former, was crowned with complete success. The engagement was long and bloody; for though Duncan, by passing through the enemy's line, had prevented their untimely retreat, he had not advanced further in tactical science, and the battle was fought out on the primitive principles of ship against ship, the advantage remaining with those who were the better trained to the great gun exercise (CHEVALIER, Histoire de la Marine Française sous la première République, 329), though the Dutch by their obstinate courage inflicted great loss on the English.</p>
<p>It had been proposed to De Winter to make up for the want of skill by firing shell from the lower deck guns; and some experiments had been made during the summer which showed that the idea was feasible (WOLFE TONE, ii. 427); but want of familiarity with an arm so new and so dangerous presumably prevented its being acted on in the battle.</p>

<p>The news of the victory was received in England with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed the power and the prestige of the British navy. Duncan was at once (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a>.) raised to the peerage as Baron Duncan of Lundie and Viscount Duncan of Camperdown (with which came the lands now known as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camperdown%2C_Dundee_5260.html" title="Camperdown, Dundee">Camperdown Park</a>, Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a> his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: <i>‘Report says my nephew is only made a viscount. Myself is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …’</i> (Arniston Memoirs, 251). It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.</p>
<p>Duncan was awarded the Large Naval Gold Medal and an annual pension of £3000, to himself and the next two heirs to his title - this was the biggest pension ever awarded by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_government.html" title="British government">British government</a>. Additionally, he was given the freedom of several cities, including Dundee and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>Till 1801 Duncan continued in command of the North Sea fleet, but without any further opportunity of distinction. Three years later, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">4 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>, he died quite suddenly, aged seventy three, at the inn at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornhill.html" title="Cornhill">Cornhill</a>, a village on the border, where he had stopped for the night on his journey to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> (ib. 252) and is buried in Lundie. He left a family of four daughters, and, besides the eldest son who succeeded to the peerage, a second son, Henry, who died a captain in the navy and K.C.H. in 1835.</p>
<p>Several ships have been named <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Duncan_899f.html" title="HMS Duncan">HMS <i>Duncan</i></a> after him, also a street in Leeds town centre is named after him (Duncan Street), The pub on this street honours him with its name and many pictures and paintings of him.</p>
<p>A statue of Duncan was erected in 1997 in Dundee, on the corner of High Street and Commercial Street.</p>
