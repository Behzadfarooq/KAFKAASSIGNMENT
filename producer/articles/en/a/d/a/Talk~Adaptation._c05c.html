<p>To fit with Wikipedia style, this page should remain at Adaptation (movie) and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> should be deleted. Wikipedia pages don't use periods normally.

<p>I now understand that there is a period in the actual movie title, so agree that the page title should reflect that. I support the proposed move. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmelia_Hunt_40ba.html" title="User:Amelia Hunt">Amelia Hunt</a> 17:29, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, the period isn't for looks but an actual part of the title. Because of confusion on my part and the way things happened (I originally put <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> up for rfd; per Netholic's suggestion I moved it to a page move) so please make sureyou voice your opinion on the <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html#Adaptation_.28movie.29_.26rarr.3B_Adaptation." title="WP:RM">WP:RM#Adaptation_.28movie.29_.26rarr.3B_Adaptation.</a> vote since it's under way. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 20:01, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actual movie name is "Adaptation." [with a trailing full stop] and I want to move <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> as well as saving the history. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> and I think they should be swapped. As per Netholic's suggestion on the rfd page (<s><a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html#January_8" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects_for_deletion#January_8</a></s> <i>RFD has been removed</i>), I bring the request here. My original intention was delete <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> and then move it.</p>
<p>Again on why. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> is technically the wrong title since "Adaptation" is not the actual movie name but rather "Adaptation.". This point is why I think the content and history should be moved to the correct page (i.e., <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a>) and make <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> a redirect to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a>.</p>
<p>As for confusion between "Adaptation" and "Adaptation." (raised on the rfd page) I think a short note can be added to the tops. And there's still <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> to point to the correct article in case someone tries to add an article of a movie entitled "Adaptation" who is unaware the actual title is "Adaptation." <s>So either move the page or delete the redirect that is <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a></s> (<i>RFD has been removed</i>). I'll be content if either happens so that the content about the movie appears under the correct article title. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:12, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b>. IMDB says the film is called "Adaptation." including a full stop, so the "(movie)" style of disambig is unnecessary if it's moved to the correct name.

<li><s><b>Oppose</b>. If I type adaptation into the find box in Wikipedia I expect to find an article about natural selection, not a piece about a movie. If anything, the biological meaning should be the primary meaning. At present we have a disambiguation page which I think is acceptable. The movie is given equal billing with two fundamental scientific concepts, which I think is pretty good going, actually.</s> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:19, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tony, you did notice the move is to "Adaptation." (with a trailing period) and not "Adaptation" (sans period)? Your explanation doesn't hint that you do. Putting in "adaptation" or "Adaptation" will still give you the disambigutation page here: <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation.html" title="Adaptation">Adaptation</a>. I tried to make this very clear in my explanation and make sure all links are as intended. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 00:28, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I didn't notice the period. I reconsidered. I asked myself how many people who are interested in the movie would be aware that the period is significant. I noticed that imdb.com also includes the period in the title (which is rare). Rottentomatoes, a review site, lists it without the period. Other sites listing it without the period include moviefreak.com, The Guardian, Roger Ebert at Chicago Sun-Times, and James Berardinelli at Reelreviews. I stopped looking after that, because if those guys don't list the period it doesn' really matter who else does. So it seems to me that the only people listing it with the period is imdb, which evidently has a policy of listing movies meticulously according to official title. It appears, therefore, that it's quite unlikely that most people casually interested in the movie "Adaptation." are going to be aware that its title incorporates a period. They're going to type in the name without the period and hit the disambig, unless they're wise to Wikipedia ways and tag on "(movie)". For this reason, I still think that Adaptation (movie) is a more appropriate title. In this case as in all others we should go by the popular name, not the official name of the movie. There should be a redirect from <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">adaptation.</a> (with the period) to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">adaptation (movie)</a>, making everybody happy. <b>Oppose</b>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:45, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You may be interested in the movie "<a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks..html" title="Clerks.">Clerks.</a>" too, though in that case <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks.html" title="Clerks">Clerks</a> is a redirect. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 16:03, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks. I've known the movie as <i>Clerks</i> for well over a decade. I wouldn't want <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks..html" title="Clerks.">clerks.</a> to be moved to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks.html" title="Clerks">clerks</a>, but neither do I see any <i>a priori</i> reason to move an article just to pander to the typographical eccentricities of the production or distribution companies. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:12, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that if <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> is either going to contain the article itself or a redirect to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> (or maybe Adaptation. (movie)]]), then I can see no reason why the page shouldn't have the article itself.

<dd>My objection is that the period is a typographical frippery that would make the movie harder to find than it is at <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">adaptation (movie)</a>. It isn't important enough that I'd want <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">adaptation.</a> moved to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">adaptation (movie)</a> if this were the other way around (as with <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks..html" title="Clerks.">clerks.</a>), but it does weigh in when people are asking for a move in the other direction. I don't believe we should go out of our way to ape the silliness of the movie industry. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:30, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>People are no more likely to type "Adapation." than "Adaptation (movie)". Most requests will go through <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation.html" title="Adaptation">Adaptation</a> anyway. So unless we put the movie there (as primary usage), there's no reason to actively avoid the correct title.

<li>Actually that's a fan site, run by an Australian guy, and the only place it says "Adaptation." is on the poster. I emailed him asking about the dot and he said he couldn't give a strictly canonical answer, but the two draft copies of the script that he owns are titled "ADAPTATION" so he figured it was just for the poster.

<li>The period is some typographic ornamentation that the movie's graphic designer created for "branding" purposes, and the promotional department perpetuated it in the news releases. It's not called "Adaptation dot". The period is not part of the English-language title <i>Adaptation</i>, any more than the cherubs and fleurons that appeared on the original posters are part of the title of <i>Hamlet</i>.

<dd>That's what redirects are for: misspellings. It's "Clerks." not "Clerks" and "Adaptation." not "Adaptation". I don't see your's or Netholic's or Michael Z's or the others' name attached to the movie, so I hardly see how your opinion of what the movies' title should be is relevant. Perhaps you should contact Kevin Smith and Charlie Kaufman and complain about their creativity or something... Your ignorance of the proper title shouldn't dictate the true name of something.

<dd>Didn't bother to look at the title of the site, did you? "Clerks." The title of the official site is "Clerks." and the title of wikipedia's article should match: with a period. Label the period a "marketing gimmick" if you wish, but that doesn't change the fact that it's in the title of the movie. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 22:23, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But this is most likely due to either laziness on the part of whoever wrote the content for that website, or some other similar reason. Kevin NEVER types the period when he's casually mentioning the movie in message board posts (nor do most fans), but when you watch the actual movie itself the title that comes up to display the title of the movie says "Clerks." --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlattopus_a573.html" title="User:Plattopus">Plattopus</a> 18:47, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It doesn't matter what the author called the movie. The vast majority of all people who saw Clerks call it Clerks, which is also what the vast majority of people who didn't see Clerks and want to know about it call it. And therefore Clerks, as far as Wikipedia is concerned, is its name. A redirect can handle the case of the few people who know what you believe to be the "true" title. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:42, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>. The issue has nothing to do about whether people will find the article. That is why there are redirects. The issue is which is the MOST ACCURATE title of the movie, and I think the evidence supports "Adaptaion.". There is policy about this, which states that the title should be the name of the movie in its UK or US release. Redirects can get people the page whatever they type. I don't want us to start fixing all the intentional mistakes that come with titles and names. Like, for example <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boys_to_men.html" title="Boys to men">Boys to men</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beetles_63df.html" title="The Beetles">The Beetles</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 10:09, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suspect that you pulled phrase "most accurate" out of your hat. Wikipedia policy favors the most popular title.

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I've seen no convincing evidence to support the idea that the period is part of the official title; it's not seen anywhere but on the poster, the opening credits of the film and the IMDb. The credits list it in the same font as the poster, so if that's a marketing gimmick, they're just matching it. The poster text - the "A film by" etc. at the bottom of the poster - doesn't use the period. The redirect is probably fine, but we can add it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation_%28movie%29.html" title="Adaptation (movie)">Adaptation (movie)</a> is much more appropriate. -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 09:33, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that "the opening credits of the film" would be one of the most obvious places to find the actuall title of a movie, since it's in the movie itself (a place normally untouched by studio bigwigs in the less mainstream genre to which Adaptation. belongs). Filmmakers in general (and especially someone like Charlie Kaufman or Spike Jonze) do not just put whatever the marketing department tells them to put in the opening titles. It's THEIR movie, so they put the NAME of THEIR movie in the opening credits. Noone has ownership of what they put in their films but themselves. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlattopus_a573.html" title="User:Plattopus">Plattopus</a> 18:51, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b>. We're not talking about the whims of some marketing department in a studio board room. I have seen an image of the original screenplay and it indeed has a period, so therefore the film's full and correct title is <i>Adaptation.</i>.

<dd>There's a clear consensus to move the page. The DVD cover also has the period at the end, for the record. The argument about how the article should be "where people expect to find it" is all but moot, since the average person would <i>expect</i> to find it at <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation.html" title="Adaptation">Adaptation</a> (the disambig page), and not under any other of the titles suggested. In this case, having the article title appear the way it does on the movie cover seems to make the most sense. But, at present moment, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adaptation..html" title="Adaptation.">Adaptation.</a> cannot be deleted (due to a current server problem with block-compression), so nothing's going to happen right now anyways. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELachatdelarue_f99b.html" title="User:Lachatdelarue">Lachatdelarue</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELachatdelarue_dc2e.html" title="User talk:Lachatdelarue">(talk)</a> 22:48, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder what would happen if someone were to officially name their new movie with a trailing space character â€” or letâ€™s say with a newline character in the middle, I mean, why not? The Wikipedia article could look something like the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span style="font-size: large"><b>Some Movie</b></span>
<dl>
<dd><i>The correct title of this article is <b>Some<br />
Movie</b>. The newline character is omitted due to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28technical_restrictions%29_3627.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)">technical restrictions</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>Some<br />
Movie</b>, the first work of art whose title includes a newline character, is a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> movie by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Schmo_5534.html" title="Joe Schmo">Joe Schmo</a>. [...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>But thatâ€™s not the end of the fun. For example, for your next movie title, why not add a trailing paragraph separator instead of a newline character? It gets even more interesting when you start to consider the full range of control characters: of course, BEL immediately comes to mind, but I think the ultimate annoying movie title would be one that contained a NUL character.</p>
<p>If you think Iâ€™m being silly, please consider the fact that punctuation characters like periods and commas <i>are the control characters of English.</i> Including disruptive control characters in names is very confusing, and I think there is a limit to what kind of name games Wikipedia should honor at the cost of typographical clarity. Ending a movie title with a full stop for no reason crosses the line in my book. Itâ€™s just pointless typographical clutter.</p>

<p>Concerning the line: "In the film, Kaufman represents McKee as the deus ex machina, as he gives Charlie the solution to his problematic situation." In the film Adaptation, Robert McKee was introduced very early in the story. His expertise with scripts was also introduced early, and it was mentioned that McKee and Charlie would both be in New York at the same time. Because his appearance was fully explained, he is not a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his advice does not resolve a conflict at all. It causes Charlie to seek out his brother's help, which actually complicates the plot. However, the alligator that comes out of no where to eat John Laroche at the end, THAT is a deus ex machina. - Luke (4:40 EST) 4-14-06</p>
