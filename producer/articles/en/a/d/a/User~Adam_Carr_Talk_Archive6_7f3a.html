	    <p>Adam, thank you for finally injecting some sense into the Kim Jong-Il article.

<p>I think it would be more appropiate to place a picture of the Agora instead of the Acropolis in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Athens_619a.html" title="History of Athens">History of Athens</a> article.

Btw, about thumbnails size.. it is better to have them on a relative small size. I beleive someone once mention less than 250 pixels, but IMO they should be less than 200 pixels. The problem is for users who browse in the standard skin at low screen resolutions (the left column/menu takes a lot of screen space + big thumbnails = bad juju). I usually leave them to the default resize because of that. For example, the Acropolis image at 500pixels takes so much space in an 800x600 resolution that you can barely read the introduction.

<p>Adam, I just changed the date style on the Papandreou article because it seems to me we ought to have these things standardized -- at least within a single article. Call me compulsive, but it's more than I can bear to see dates done in one style in one sentence and then done in another style in the next. And since most of Wikipedia is done in the American style, I figure if one style or the other is gonna go, it ought to be the less common one. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:05, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Furthermore, this whole article is built on the assumption that Nazis segregated their camps by nationality, which is untrue, and that Polish Jews were not Poles.

<p>I understand the correlation between the words "Prime Minister" and "Premier" - they are used interchangeably in many places. But it is not common within Australia, especially with the common term for state leaders being Premier also (e.g. "Peter Beattie is the most disrespected Premier in Australia"). I just assumed it would be best to use the most common term. The word "premiership" should be reserved for when the Eagles win the AFL Grand Final.&#160;;-) How have you been, Adam?

<p>Hi Adam. As promised, I got back Lukas's book, <i>Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles under German Occupation, 1939-1944</i>. From a percursory glance at the list of concentration camps for Poles and a comparison with the index, plus a search through the book based on the index, none of the camps is mentioned as such in the book, either as a concentration camp, extermination camp, extermination camp for children, or anything of the sort. I am taking the liberty of quoting two paragraphs from the book here (pp. 38-39): <i>Unlike most Jews who died in gas chambers, most Poles perished in mass or individual executions and were starved or worked to deat. However, many Poles died in the extermination camps too. The first non-German prisoners at Auschwitz were Poles, who constituted the largest number of inmates there until 1942, when the Jews became the largest group. Poles also numbered 90 percent of the inmates of Stutthof until 1942. The first killing by poison gas at Auschwitz involved 300 Poles and 700 Soviet prisoners of war. So many Poles were sent to concentration camps that virtually every Polish family had someone close to them who had been tortured or murdered there. Over 35,000 Poles passed through Dachau; approximately 33,000 Polish women were imprisoned in Ravensbruck. In Sachsenhausen, 20,000 Poles perished; in Mauthausen, 30,000; in Neuengamme, 17,000. ... As a result of almost six years of war, Poland lost 6,028,000 of its citizens or 22 percent of its total population, the highest ratio of losses to population of any country in Europe.</i> Therefore, while I am not questioning the scope of atrocities commited in Poland, that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_concentration_camps_for_Poles_d86f.html" title="List of concentration camps for Poles">List of concentration camps for Poles</a> is totally beyond me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 00:26, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Essentially, I think the list is totally bogus too and think it should be deleted. On the other hand, I don't want to get into an edit war over comparative suffering with the Poles, especially since I believe that they suffered immensely and that they were the first group (even before the Jews) upon whom the Nazis initiated a genocidal program (see Mike Phayer's <i>The Catholic Church and the Holocaust</i>--I actually discussed it with him last night at a conference). What I might suggest is that we ask them to provide sources, hopefully in English. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 02:40, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sounds reasonable. I will support the deletion. It is important to note that there were mass executions of Poles. For instance, from p. 161, <i>When the Germans began the mass deportations and executions of Poles in the Zamosc area late in 1942, it appeared to the Poles that the Germans intended to exterminate the Polish people even before they had finished off the Jews.</i> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 03:15, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure I actually agree fully with the edit. I think the situation for Christians in Poland was far more severe than you are making it. I have Phayer's book in front of me. In his chapter 2, he reiterates Lukas, particularly the "2,000 concentration camps that dotted the Polish countryside." He argues that there was a planned effort to exterminate the Poles, quoting, among other things Woodward (ed.), <i>Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939</i>, 3rd Series, 7, 258. Apparently, even the <i>Volksdeutsch</i> in Poland appealed to Pius XII to condemn German atrocities, particularly before 1942 (when the focus of extermination became the Jews). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 03:51, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know. It is bothering me too. The texts do seem contradictory, and I have been considering what they mean by concentration camps. Sub-camps? Still too many. I am going to try to email Lukas (who seems to be Phayer's source) and ask him. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 04:20, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have for long considered starting an article on Germanness, and noted that you on some of the Poland-connected talk-pages with quite some certainty declared that the existence of a separate Austrian nationality also meant that Austrians were not to be considered <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_Germans_125e.html" title="Ethnic Germans">ethnic Germans</a>.</p>
<p>I do however hesitate, among other reasons also since I am rather unsure of how <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> (and also <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnos.html" title="Ethnos">ethnos</a>) <b>really</b> are considered connected in the Anglophone world.</p>
<p>What is, for instance, the established view on the "Germans" in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>? Are they "ethnic Austrians" maybe?</p>
<p>And the Danes in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein_b206.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, are they <i>Danish nationals</i> or are they <i>ethnic Danes?</i></p>
<p>I'm afraid my mindset is too much coloured by French and German discourse. I hold Bavarians to be of Bavarian nationality, like Austrians are of Austrian nationality, but all of them being of German ethnicity.</p>

<dd>In English usage, <i>Danish national</i> implies that the individual has Danish citizenship, rather than Danish ethnicity. This is confusing, but because journalistic usage often says <i>national</i> to mean <i>citizen of,</i> it is better not to confuse the issue. FWIW, <i>ethnic</i> derives from the Greek <i>ethnikós,</i> which in fact means <i>national</i> (e.g., <i>Ethnikí Trápeza Elládos,</i> National Bank of Greece). <a href="../../../t/k/i/User%7ETkinias_6e4b.html" title="User:Tkinias">Tkinias</a> 05:01, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Image:Ac.spainmap3.jpg really is ideal for PNG. The problems with JPEG are (1) it is lossy, so if you compress to much you get distortion which is very visible on images with clear lines and solid blocks of color; and (2) it only supports eight bits per color, whereas PNG can use a pallette of arbitrary size, so it doesn't require as much information per pixel if the colors can be represented with less than 24 bits. <a href="../../../t/k/i/User%7ETkinias_6e4b.html" title="User:Tkinias">Tkinias</a> 05:05, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although there were some associations (like Hotel Lambert) that formed some sort of a quasi shadow-government of a state to-be during the partions, the 1939-1990 government was the only one to bear this name and work as such. Of course one can argue that the <i>Związek Patriotów Polskich</i> (or Association of Polish Patriots) was formed in exile as well, but it had nothing to do with a legitimate government and even after it got to Poland it was still a Soviet puppet. Therefore we could call all governments of Soviet Union a <i>government of Poland in exile</i>, but that would be too much.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibutt</a> 12:31, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>I have just logged on to your pages for the first time and I must say that I am very impressed with the work you have put into creating and maintaining it.</p>
<p>I have a particular interest in the careers of recent Australian premiers, particularly those of Victoria and South Australia. I was pleased to see you had already incorporated info about Sir Rupert Hamer's passing, as well as Paul Lennon's ascension to the Tasmanian premiership.</p>
<p>Your range of topics also astounds me. I will certainly spend more time browsing these pages when I have time.</p>
<p>Finally, do you know of any biographies of Dick Hamer? I have been searching for one, but in vain. Do you know if one has even been written? It'd be a shame if one hasn't been - Hamer would easily qualify as a worthy subject of a good biography.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your work.</p>

<p>You read "Jordan-Israeli" incorrectly, but I guess that's because it ambiguously combines a noun and an adjective. What I intended was "Jordanian-Israeli". Also, the country was calling itself "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan" (not Transjordan) by the time of the armistice and it appears that way on the armistice document. (The name was changed officially in 1946 and appeared that way on the constitution but somehow nobody noticed and it was again changed officially in 1949.)

I have strong political views, but try hard to make NPOV edits and have no desire to be witchunted for them. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> 16:46, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If he "allows articles to be NPOV" he cannot be a Communist (as opposed merely to a theoretical Marxist) in any serious sense. If he is a Communist in a serious sense, he (a) doesn't believe in NPOV and (b) is incapable of it. So, yes, I do believe that "Communists should not edit this encyclopaedia." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:19, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that Hellenic Greece is not a particularly useful article at the moment...it seems to be describing what I learned as Archaic Greece and Classical Greece. I have heard Archaic and Classical used as subgroups of Hellenic Greece though (or the Hellenic period, or Hellenic age), preceding the Hellenistic period, although that doesn't really make sense. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 03:31, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: "until Hanpuk and his various aliases are banned from Wikipedia". As an experiened Wikipedian, do you know how this can be brought about? I have proposed banning several times, but it doesn't seem easy to mobilize the community. The evidence that he is an unrelenting troublemaker is overwhelming; indeed, he has admitted his motives and intentions on his user pages and elsewhere. Of course, I expect his ideological allies to defend him, but surely reason must triumph? Right? Well, I just don't know what steps to take beyond what I have done already, but we should act, so no more of our energy is sapped and the project goals thwarted (e.g., via protection). -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 04:27, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, you disagree with the article about the "Hellenic Holocaust". Why don^t you edit it correcting the points you disagree. I am greek but anti-nationalist. I am open to a different approach. Greek history must be linked with this period anyway. It happened. Write what you think. HERAKLES</p>

<ul>
<li>Would you care to explain this? Given our policy of NPOV (essentially, assign points of view to their proponents), I can see no reason why a Communist would not "believe" in it, or be incapable of it. They <i>may</i> disagree with it, or fail to uphold it, as Hanpuk appears to, but I don't see why this applies to all Communists.</li>

<p>Re Administrator (of the Government) of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>There probably _is_ a formal title, which will be the form used in the relevant Letters Patent appointing the Administrator of the time: I do not know what form was used in Sir Guy Green's LP. The constitution refers to someone appointed to "administer the government of the Commonwealth", and this is no more misleading than talking of a "governor"-general who does not govern.</p>
<p>You should have noted that my original edit was to turn a non-functioning link Administrator of the Commonwealth into an almost identical functioning link <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrator_of_the_Government_becc.html" title="Administrator of the Government">Administrator of the Commonwealth</a>. I have no problem with 'Administrator of the Commonwealth', as it is the more usual term, but you should know that the position of 'Administrator of the Government' exists at state level as well as in Canada, New Zealand, etc. Either way, the link must direct the reader to the existing <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrator_of_the_Government_becc.html" title="Administrator of the Government">Administrator of the Government</a> article. I do not feel this is a major point, but I do take issue with your inclination to automatically reverse changes rather than to attempt to improve or incorporate them.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mention of Sir Ninian Stephen's place of birth (though the detail, taken from an ACM lecture online, was incorrect) could have been corrected without being excised. The references in the article to 'British' and 'Australian' Governors-General are not at all precise because there were no Australian citizens until 1948, and all Australian citizens were 'British subjects' in Australian law until 1986: some work will need to be done on this.</p>
<p>As for Dr Hollingworth's title, you say that I have inserted opinion. I think the idea that Hollingworth was not considered a suitable title for a Governor-General played some part in the granting of the Canterbury doctorate is more credible than the idea that Hollingworth had no title, seeing as when he retired as archbishop he became "The Right Reverend Peter Hollingworth", or "Bishop Hollingworth" for short. Bishops, like senior officers in the armed forces, retain their titles for life: once a bishop always a bishop. It is also not unbelievable that after the Hollingworth fiasco Howard went back to the safe option of a military man, whose profession was felt to be ideal for the governor-generalship.</p>
<p>Admittedly, on the first edit I asserted the opinion rather than refer to it. I will try in a day or two to rewrite the sentence so that it is clear it refers to an opinion held at the time. If you want to attempt it first, feel free. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 19:13, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>yeah, the US is one of the only western countries to embrace the death penalty, which almost certainly has something to do with our fascination with the violence culture and our preponderance of handguns, which leads to an extreme crime problem, which in turn leads to a champing at the bit for extreme measures... me, I just see it as a competition for limited resources (time, air, water, funds), and certain people forfeit their right to compete through their barbaric acts. As we all know, every right has a corresponding duty. Anyway, for me the most troubling moral question the US criminal system has to answer for is prison rape, not lethal execution... sorry, it's late and I'm babbling.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsiform_49e3.html" title="User:Ensiform">Ensiform</a> 05:19, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
