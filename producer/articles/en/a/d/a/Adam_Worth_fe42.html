<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: Earlier life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Earlier life</span></h2>
<p>Adam Worth was born into a poor <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family in Germany in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1844.html" title="1844">1844</a>. His original surname might have been <i>Werth</i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> When he was five years old, his family moved to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and his father became a <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tailor.html" title="Tailor">tailor</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1854 he ran away from home and moved first to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> and then in 1860 to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. He worked as a clerk in a department store for one month.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> broke out, Worth was 17. He lied about his age and enlisted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> army. Worth served in the 2nd New York heavy Artillery, Battery L (later designated 34th New York Battery) and was promoted to sergeant in a couple of months. He was wounded in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Bull_Run_c863.html" title="Second Battle of Bull Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> and was shipped to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown_Hospital_cb3a.html" title="Georgetown Hospital">Georgetown Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_DC_0dbd.html" title="Washington DC">Washington DC</a>. In the hospital, he learned he had been listed as "killed in action" and left.</p>
<p><a name="Criminal_career" id="Criminal_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: Criminal career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criminal career</span></h2>
<p>Worth began to enlist into various regiments with assumed names, received his pay, saw some action and then <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desertion.html" title="Desertion">deserted</a>. When the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinkerton_Detective_Agency_c08c.html" title="Pinkerton Detective Agency">Pinkerton Detective Agency</a> began to track him, like many others using similar methods, he fled to New York City.</p>
<p>After the war, Worth became a <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickpocket.html" title="Pickpocket">pickpocket</a> in New York. He saved most of his money, kept a low profile and avoided violent confrontation. In time, he founded his own gang of pickpockets, began to organize <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbery.html" title="Robbery">robberies</a> and heists. When he was caught stealing a cash box of an Adams Express wagon, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sing_Sing_e4db.html" title="Sing Sing">Sing Sing</a>; however, he escaped a couple of weeks later and resumed his criminal career.</p>
<p>Worth began to work for the prominent fence and criminal organizer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marm_Mandelbaum_5e59.html" title="Marm Mandelbaum">Fredericka "Marm" Mandelbaum</a>. With her help he expanded into bank and store robberies around 1866 and eventually began to plan his own heists. In 1869 he helped Mandelbaum to break out safecracker Charley Bullard from the White Plains Jail through a tunnel.</p>
<p>With Bullard, Worth robbed the vault of the Boylston National Bank in Boston in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, again through a tunnel, this time from a neighboring shop. The bank alerted Pinkertons who tracked the shipment of trunks Worth and Bullard had used to ship the loot to New York. Worth decided to move to Europe with Bullard.</p>
<p><a name="Exploits_in_Europe" id="Exploits_in_Europe"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: Exploits in Europe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exploits in Europe</span></h2>
<p>In 1877<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Bullard and Worth arrived in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. Bullard had taken the identity of "Charles H. Wells", a Texas oilman. Worth was a financier "Henry Judson Raymond", the name he would use for years afterwards. They began to compete for the favors of a barmaid Kitty Flynn who eventually learned their true identities. She became Bullard's wife but did not disfavor Worth, either.</p>
<p>When the Bullards went on their honeymoon, Worth began to rob local <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawnshop.html" title="Pawnshop">pawnshops</a>. He shared the loot with Bullard and Flynn when they came back and, together, the three moved to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1871.</p>
<p>In Paris, the police force was still in disarray after the events of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Commune_7d01.html" title="Paris Commune">Paris Commune</a>. Worth and his associates founded an "American Bar", a restaurant and bar on the ground floor and a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> den on the upper floor. Because gambling was illegal, the gambling tables were built so that they could be folded inside the walls and the floor. A buzzer would be sounded from downstairs to alert the customers before any police raid. Worth formed a new gang of associates, including some of his old comrades from New York.</p>
<p>When William Pinkerton of the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinkerton_Detective_Agency_c08c.html" title="Pinkerton Detective Agency">Pinkerton Detective Agency</a> visited the place in 1873, Worth recognized him. Later the Paris police raided the place numerous times and Worth and the Bullards decided to abandon the restaurant. Worth used his place for the last time to defraud a diamond dealer and the three moved to London.</p>
<p><a name="London_master_criminal" id="London_master_criminal"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: London master criminal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">London master criminal</span></h2>
<p>In England, Worth and his associates bought West Lodge in <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clapham_Common_90c7.html" title="Clapham Common">Clapham Common</a>. He also leased an apartment in <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayfair.html" title="Mayfair">Mayfair</a> and joined high society. He formed his own criminal network and organized major robberies and burglaries through several intermediaries. Those who worked in his schemes never knew his name. He insisted that his subordinates should not use violence.</p>
<p>Eventually <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> learned of his network though they were initially unable to prove anything. Inspector John Shore made Worth's capture his personal mission.</p>
<p>Things began to go wrong. When Worth's brother John was sent to cash a forged <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheque.html" title="Cheque">cheque</a> in Paris, he was arrested and extradited to England; Worth managed to exonerate him and get him sent back to the USA. Four of his associates were arrested in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> for spreading more forged letters of credit and he had to use a considerable amount of money to buy off the judges and the police. Bullard's <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> got worse, he became violent and eventually left for New York. Eventually Kitty left as well.</p>
<p>1876, Worth personally stole the <i>Duchess of Devonshire</i>, a recently rediscovered painting of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgiana_Spencer_a499.html" title="Georgiana Spencer">Georgiana Spencer</a> from a London gallery of Agnew &amp; Sons with the help of two associates. He was taken with the painting and did not try to sell it. The two men who assisted in the robbery, Junka Phillips and Little Joe, grew impatient. Phillips tried to make him talk about the theft in the presence of a police informer and Worth effectively fired him. Worth gave Little Joe money to return to the USA where he tried to rob the Union Trust Company, was arrested and talked to Pinkertons. They alerted Scotland Yard but they still could not prove anything.</p>
<p>Worth kept the painting with him even when he was traveling and organizing new schemes and robberies. Eventually he decided to travel to South Africa where he stole $500,000 worth of uncut diamonds. Back in London, he founded a Wynert &amp; Company which sold diamonds at a cheaper price than the competitors.</p>
<p>In 1881 Worth married a young woman (though her name has not survived) still using the name Henry Raymond and they had a son and a daughter. Possibly his wife did not know his real identity. He smuggled the painting to the USA and left it there.</p>
<p><a name="Mistake_and_capture" id="Mistake_and_capture"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: Mistake and capture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mistake and capture</span></h2>
<p>In 1892 Worth decided to visit <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> where Bullard was in jail. He had been working with Max "Baron" Shinburn, Worth's rival, when Belgian police had captured them both. In Belgium he heard that Bullard had recently died.</p>
<p>On October 5 Worth improvised a robbery of a money delivery cart in <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a> with two untried associates, one of them the American Johnny Curtin. The robbery went badly wrong and the police captured him on the spot. Two others got away.</p>
<p>In jail Worth refused to identify himself and the Belgian police made enquiries abroad. Both the New York Police Department and Scotland Yard identified him as Worth, although Pinkertons did not say anything. Max Shinburn, now in Belgian jail, told the police everything he knew. In jail, he heard nothing about his family in London but received a letter from Kitty Flynn, who offered to finance his defense.</p>
<p>Worth's trial took place <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>. The prosecutor used everything he knew about Worth. Worth flatly denied that he had anything to do with various crimes, saying that the last robbery had been a stupid act he had committed out of need for money. All the other accusations, including those from the British and American police, were mere hearsay. He claimed that his wealth came out of legal gambling. In the end Worth was sentenced for seven years for robbery and was sent to <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leuven.html" title="Leuven">Leuven</a> prison.</p>
<p>During the first year in jail, Shinburn hired other inmates to beat up Worth. Later Worth heard that Johnny Curtin, who had supposed to take care of his wife, had raped her. She had gone insane and been committed to an asylum. The children were in the care of his brother John in the United States.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Edit section: Release and last years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Release and last years</span></h2>
<p>Worth was released early for good behavior in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>. He returned to London and stole £4,000 from a diamond shop to get funds. When he visited his wife, she barely recognized him. He traveled to New York and visited his children. Then he proceeded to meet with William Pinkerton.</p>
<p>Through Pinkerton, Worth arranged the return of the painting <i>Duchess of Devonshire</i> to Agnew &amp; Sons in return for $25,000. The exchange happened in Chicago on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>. Worth returned to London with his children and spent the rest of his life with them.</p>
<p>Adam Worth died on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>. He was buried in <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highgate_Cemetery_d80e.html" title="Highgate Cemetery">Highgate Cemetery</a> under the name of "Henry J. Raymond".</p>
