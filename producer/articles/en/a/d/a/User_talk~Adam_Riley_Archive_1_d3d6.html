<p>I was under the impression that userpages were <i>for</i> the biography of users on wikipedia. I see that yours is such a bio. Simply because mine is satirical (as per my occupation) does not warrant deletion. If i have missed something please leave a comment on my discussion page, do not simply delete it. Further more, i have noticed that mine is the <i>only</i> user page up for speedy deletion. thank you. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranktidwell_182f.html" title="User:Franktidwell">Frank</a> 23:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your user page was never up for speedy deletion. I tagged Frank Tidwell to be speedy deleted, not <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranktidwell_182f.html" title="User:Franktidwell">User:Franktidwell</a>. I posted that Frank Tidwell was up for deletion on your talk page, because you were the only contributor to that article, and I wanted to let you know in case you wanted to contest it. Your user page has never been an article for deletion, or candidate for speedy deletion. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment on my talk page. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 04:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Would help if I could, but I leave the AfD-ing to the others and wouldn't really know where to start. Relatively new to the game myself!&#160;:-) I looked just now and I think it's all sorted itself out TBH.

<li>Your comment about the Question is Acadame North real? I can answer this question by showing you lots of proof Acadame North maintains diplomatic relations with Mollossia and other well known Micronations, Acadame North maintains about 6-8 websites and a 250 article constitution along with a 300 article criminal code. I hope this proof is sufficiant for you, please tell me what you think about this situation. --Acadamenorth 21:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Camp Sagamore-dining hall.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>I'm not sure your ambition to make the photo available to wikipedia but not be available for commercial use can be supported. The list of copyright tags we tend to use is at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. Having looked through the list, it's clear that wikipedia is moving away from "general non-free licences" which were in the past used to say "wikipedia but no commercial". There is one in the "Any Purpose licences" section, called {{CopyrightedFreeUseProvidedThat|restrictions}}, but which in the description of the tag says: "Note that non-commercial or educational use restrictions are not allowed as provisions in this tag. Consider using {{GFDL}} or one of the Creative Commons licenses below, instead of trying to make up your own restrictions.". My understanding is that if you use the GFDL licence, others who use the image would at least have to publish the image with a GFDL licence on it, and I think that would deter most commercial use (at least amongst those firms that care two hoots about copyright.) So in conclusion, I'm not sure I have helped, except to say that I do not think there is nowadays a licence of the sort you are after if the GFDL will not do. (I could also ask, out of interest, a) why the interest in preventing commercial use?)

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Futureshop.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia.

<p><br />
Dear Robotman 1974, That message is noted. However Exhibitionist World has been promoting the exhibitionist lifestyle before wikipedia was even registered. If you are going to promote Jerry Springer as a exhibitionist medium relevant to exhibitionism, then you have to include the most popular way used today for exhibitionists to share pictures in the web. If you truly want to say that any link for exhibitionism is not relevant take alook at the other links you leave.....none is close to being a site totally dedicated to exhibitionism. I hope you will reconsider, this not promotion, just simply fact. Exhibitionist World is a Free site known thoughout the world by exhibitionists like myself, and is worthy of recognition.</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for responding. Actually, I think I need to disagree with your comment.... I think the article has miles of context. It says it is a high school in Arkansas; from this I can fit it very well into the grand scheme of things. What you're complaining about, I suspect, is that the article doesn't have very much content. (But this is a different thing!) Anyway, bringing it to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> was the right thing in this case, if you think it should be deleted.

<p>I agree with you that many articles on local Christian churches, at least as they are written right now, do not meet WP standards for notability. I probably would have supported AfD for some congregations. However, your mass <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bayside_Community_Church_1f1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bayside Community Church">nomination</a>, combined with your many other nominations of congregations, make it appear that you are using the AfD to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>. Perhaps it would be a good time to give a rest to the campaign to nominate churches for deletion, so that it is clear to others that you were nominating according to the standards for notability and not according to your own views on religion or churches.

<p>I don't disagree about the number of non-notable churches with articles, but I do question the method. Perhaps tag the article as non-notable and let the tag stand for a while; perhaps it is notable and someone will come along and fill out the article. Another option would be to leave a note the talk page of the articles originator, requesting that they fill in the article with evidence of the subject's notability. For myself, I think that assuming good faith means not making AfD the first step. That, combined with the very high public profile of some of the churches nominated, are what raised my eye-brows.

<p>I apologize for rushing to judgment. I spoke out of anger because I feel churches have been coming under attack with mass-nominations recently and it did not look good on your part. Please list individually next time so each one can be debated on its own merit instead of being a blanket call on all church stub and so you can show you read all of them individually. I would recommend you focus on other areas where there is less suspicion of bias. Though I should have taken your claim in good faith, you cannot expect people not to question your motives if you put out a long list of a mass nomination even if they refrain from saying it. Your user page just added more credence to my suspicion. With that said, I was in the wrong, and I hope you can forgive me.--JEF 14:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
