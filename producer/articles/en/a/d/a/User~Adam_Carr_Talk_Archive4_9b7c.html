<p>I have made a stub <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deportation.html" title="Deportation">Deportation</a> altough there is a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_transfer.html" title="Population transfer">population transfer</a>. I do not know if this falls into your interests, but I am definitely no historian and you might like the subject. I made the "deportation" article bc there was NONE and the "population transfer" sounded more like a "solution" than a "problem" and does not even cite the USSR's deportations etc...</p>
<p>(Added later): I have been told about the difference between pop. transf ("bi-directional") and deportation ("uni-directional") but anyway I think the article on deportation is still of interest.</p>

<p>Hi Adam, I saw your comment about the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rohl_d3df.html" title="David Rohl">David Rohl</a> article, &amp; although I'm not a fanboy of the man, I think his primary problem is not that he's a crank but that he is surrounded by cranks.I've been reading his <i>Pharaohs and Kings</i> book (the U.S. version of <i>A Test of Time</i>), &amp; although it is trivialized by an overabundance of photographs &amp; Rohl's inclination to recount story &amp; anecdote whether it helps him make his point or not, still Rohl does set out a plausible thesis about redating parts of Ancient Egyptian History. (I haven't read his section where he discusses the history of the ancient Israelite kingdom, because I'm not convinced that there is enough historical evidence to prove it's existence.) And he takes the time to explain at least some of the reasoning behind the accepted chronology -- material not easily available to the non-professional without the funds or connections to keep up with the secondary literature.</p>
<p>So does that make me a believer of Rohl's theories? Not really: I've noticed some surprising errors of fact in his book, &amp; a tendency to go over his opponent's arguements with a fine comb while defending his own with a wide brush. And one or two of his arguments have set off my, er, bull-shit detector, so I am waiting until I can consult reviews of his book in back issues of <i>Antiquity</i>, <i>American Journal of Archaeology</i>, &amp; <i>Scientific American</i> before I accept his more convincing arguments.</p>
<p>Still, it appears that Rohl has enough followers that we need something about him in Wikipedia. Yet the current article is clearly a mess, &amp; I hope to rewrite it when I finish my research. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:51, 27 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>There should be an article on Rohl, but I think the man is definitely wrong. He absolutely can't fit Mesopotamian chronology into his scheme. See <a href="http://members.aol.com/Ian%20Wade/Waste/Index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/Ian%20Wade/Waste/Index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for some extensive refutations... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 22:41, 27 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I believe you said on the Village Pump that you have lists of British MPs?

<p>I think including the name of the chamber (in this case "Duma") is more informative than simply "parliamentary" or "legislative" since the whole parliament did not go up for election.

<p>I agree that the barons in question had no heirs. However, the use of an ordinal is to indicate that the individuals had titles by right, and not courtesy. A lack of an ordinal seems to indicate that the title was by courtesy, not held in one's own right. (See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Peerage_c8b4.html#A_couple_questions" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Peerage">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Peerage#A_couple_questions</a> for further discussion.) -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 21:53, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>And if I am not mistaken, in the first line of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Northcote%2C_Baron_Northcote_29ce.html" title="Henry Northcote, Baron Northcote">Henry Northcote, Baron Northcote</a>, you have called the subject "Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote", and the same goes for the Lord Casey. To be consistent, should not the article titles also match? -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 21:58, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I just discovered that the website of the Governor-General concurs that "1st" should be used, but only in the case of Lord Northcote, and not in the case of Lord Casey, for some reason which I do not know: <a href="http://www.gg.gov.au/textonly/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gg.gov.au/textonly/history.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 22:05, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Casey was a life peer, while Northcote was a hereditary peer who just happened to die without issue. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 22:26, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well if I wrote 1st Baron in the text I will change it, since it is wrong. Clearly Casey as a life peer cannot have an ordinal, since life peerages are not inheritable. I will accept Lord E's opinion in the case of Northcote, though it seems strange. I notice incidentally that Disraeli appears simply as <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, without his title at all. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:44, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is already a convention on not indicating life peerages in the title, I think. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 05:11, Jan 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

All of the aforementioned in mind, I instead started a discussion at: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Peerage_c8b4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Peerage">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Peerage</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 00:40, Jan 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Danny has made hysterical and false claims it is a "right-wing" anti-Arab, pro-Israeli point of view...to allow an Arab point of view to be shown. (Yeah, you read that right. He thinks mentioning <i>Arab</i> points of view in public is pro-Israeli POV violations!) Please understand, this is not a difference of opinion on what to include or how to phrase something. Like you, I am flexible. The problem is that Danny refuses to even allow the issue to be discussed, and offers no alternatives or constructive criticism. He just is engaged in a vandalism campaign, and refuses to allow anyone to edit the article. That is a clear violation of all Wikipedia rules. Others have also spoken out against the vandalism of Danny, and labeled it precisely as such. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:16, Jan 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Please do not make such criticisms of me. The only <i>ad homenim</i> attacks came from Danny and Zero, against me, against Humus Sapiens, and against others. Those two (Danny and Zero, that is) have of late gone a bit out of control, which is why their words and actions were censured. (Have you read the hateful personal attacks they repeatedly made on multiple articles of late? I get the idea that your comments to me were made out of a lack of knowledge of their unjustifiable actions.) I have done nothing wrong here; I repeatedly stated that I would like to work with others, and <i>encourage</i> joint editing. It is other people who refuse any compromise, delete articles, and make non-stop insults. In contrast, I have publicly praised Danny's knowledge many times, and I have repeatedly tried to work with him. Thus, your words make no sense to me. Danny, however, made it clear to me over a period of month's that his anger at Zionists was severe. That is too bad; if he was less emotional on such issues, he could return to the wonderful contributor that he used to be. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://js-catalog.cpl.org:60100/MARION/BDZ-4907" class="external autonumber" title="http://js-catalog.cpl.org:60100/MARION/BDZ-4907" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, he changed his name in 1924 when his wife inherited the great Swinton estate at Masham in Yorkshire. This was actually fairly common in British wills among the gentry, I think - requiring surname changes to get inheritances. At any rate, is there anything to be done to salvage this peerage mess? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:14, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. My current state of constantly sitting in front of my computer is making me see all this as far more important than it actually is. It does irk me, though, that so many people who don't seem to have any particular interest in British history feel it's their job to come in and tell us how we need to do it. I certainly don't go to votes on science article titling conventions and tell all the people who actually work on such articles how to do their business. At any rate, hopefully we'll win the first vote, and have enough votes to be able to secure a fairly restrictive convention as to who <i>doesn't</i> get described as a peer. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:26, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, you have, in case you did not notice, been nominated for the Administratorship: see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 13:00, Jan 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certain users are entirely adamant that an individual such as yourself ought to become an administrator. One could respond to such requests by either quashing all suggestions of your administratorship through a re-iteration of one's aforementioned position, or one could of course reverse one's position - I, for one, believe that you could take the latter position quite safely, as it would be very helpful in moving certain pages to certain locations. And incidentally, I have found out some information that is either very depressing or very wonderful: the results of polls (as opposed to votes, as in votes for deletion, etc.) are not binding. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a></dd>

<p>Adam, this is a rather raw dump of material rather than a prepared piece.</p>
<p>The Zionism page has a couple issues. one is that target area of Zionism since 1917, at the latest if not before, is limited to the geographic region centered around Jerusalem. The definition should indicate this. Zionism in Uganda or any of a number of other places, while considered, was conclusively rejected at the sixth (? have to check the number) Zionist congress. the last holdouts for somewhere other than Zion ceased activity in 1917. The reference to Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah help to explain why people from a variety of countries, laguages and professions would leave their homes to go somewhere far away in a period in which travel as dangerous.</p>
<p>The "Zionism today" section gives one the impression that Zionism has been discredited among Jews in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are a number of Jewish academics that adopt non-Zionist or anti-Zionist views but they are a fringe group as can be seen by the unending stream of people and funds collected from millions of families to further the goal of Zionism. Similarly the ultra-orthodox anti-Zionists are a fringe group. Chabad, a much larger ultra-orthodox group (than neturei karta and similar groups) is strongly Zionist.</p>
<p>The page as a whole reads as if Zionism was in some way archaic or shameful rather than a remarkably successful movement that has revived a language, provided safe haven for a people subjected to centuries of unremitting hostility in Europe (survive but not thrive credo), created a near-first world economy in an area with little natural resources in the face of determined, persistent hostility. Even Koffi Annan charaterizes the Zionism as Racism UN resolution as a shameful episode in the history of the UN <i>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said that the General Assembly's resolution condemning Zionism as a form of racism was a low point in the organisation's history. That resolution has been repealed, but sadly, its destructive legacy continues."</i> <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/2001/09/06/FFX48TG08RC.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/2001/09/06/FFX48TG08RC.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (this is a rather difficult statment to find)</p>
<p>The Anti-Zionism page has many of the same problems as well as two arguments regarding "identification between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is not possible" that are <i>interesting</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>some anti-Semites were pro-Zionist.</dd>
</dl>
<p>some Republicans are pro-choice, but the party is definatively anti-choice and is identified as such by a large number of voters (a majority) in the USA. one can not logically argue that "A&#160;!= B because some B's are anti-A". "identification between Republican party and anti-abortion is not possible because some pro-choice folks are Republicans". Its not true. Its not logical.</p>
<dl>
<dd>even a small minority of anti-Zionist Jews is sufficient to show that there is no necessary identification between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism</dd>
</dl>
<p>by the same argument, "even a small minority of anti-Semite Jews is sufficient". this is also, bizarre, there are anti-Semitic Jews, some of them are anti-Zionist as well (dont know of any that arent, but there may well be some). The rise of anti-Semitic activity by anti-Zionist elements in Europe is so marked that the EU commissioned a study which it then surpressed due the inflammatory nature of the conclusions. (sometimes the truth is quiet, sometimes it is inflammatory.) The adoption of anti-Semitism by a large number of anti-Zionists should be documented on the Anti-Zionism page. The report should be referenced.</p>
<p>The statement that "identification between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is not possible" is simply true. We need only cites examples of anti-Zionists that are not tainted by anti-Semitism and are reputable individuals. Direct example that contradicts and demonstrates the falsity of the the idea that "all anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism".</p>

<p>Hi Adam. I just read your reasons for declining sysop status. Fair enough - you know your own mind best - though I'd certainly be happy to vote in your favour should you ever change your opinion. In the meantime, if you stumble across anything that needs sysop powers to deal with (e.g., a page with history that needs to be deleted to make room for a move), just sing out. I'm not on-line much at present (I am just not getting the free time right now) but I'll be happy to oblige. Later on, I imagine that you will reconsider - sysoping is no big deal.

<p>Saw your post re: the Earl of Ypres at Lord Emsworth's talk page.

<dd>Generally, I think that providing peerage titles in the form of "Rank of X" is avoided when X is outside the British Isles because doing so might give the impression that the UK has sovereignty over the said area.

<dd>There are four further examples I could find: The Duke of Ireland (Peerag eof England; extinct) The Earl of Jersey (Peerage of England), The Viscount of Canada (Peerage of Scotland; abeyant); Earl of Auckland (Peerage of the UK; extinct). -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jersey and Ireland, at least, were within the dominions of the King who granted them. Auckland is not an example. The (currently existing) barony and the earldom are named after a place in Durham. The New Zealand city is named for the 1st Earl, not vice versa. Canada would seem to be an example, though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 02:46, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd keep these out of the title, and note them with a disclaimer.

<dd>The Duke of Ireland was only about in the 14th century, and the title was quickly revoked, so that's not really problem.

I don't believe that the Belgian government has ever objected. Noble titles do not generally imply actual <i>rule</i> over a place, and have not since at least the 15th century or so. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 05:40, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Try to be more tactful in your dealings with Lancemurdoch. There's no need to insinuate that he's 'uncivilized' since he doesn't 'detest Communism.' He has largely been a good counter-balancing force, especially on the Shining Path. He strikes me as an orthodox Marxist, which is a bit too deterministic and rigid for my tastes. But someone more inclined to link socialist ideologies to structural and organizational realities should be welcomed on Wiki, balancing the often values-laden and simplistic tracts of other users. Discussion pages on Wiki too often mirror the sterile controversies of the Cold War period. When compromising with users that hold views that are more conventional in the rich English-speaking democracies, Lancemurdoch can be a force for NPOV, eschewing the tone of post-Cold War triumphalism. Whether we agree with his views or not, he should be afforded the same measure of respect as any other frequent, well-meaning contributor. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 11:09, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Honestly, I haven't dealt with Lance yet. I just saw several of his contributions, and reacted with cautious optimism. I foresaw controversies over NPOV, but greeted the presence of an old-time orthodox Marxist as adding to Wiki's diversity.</p>
<p>While he may be a prickly character, anticommunist pronouncements will only provoke him and heighten his belligerence. If you strove to focus your arguments with him on matters of evidence, sources, and analysis, rather than the "moral dimension," perhaps he'd respond coolly and positively. I know that this goes against your principles, but it can be an effective means to an end when dealing with rogue contributors. This strategy may keep the ideological response and counter-response (and the consequent rudeness) to a bearable minimum.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's a good idea to hold off on a ban right away. He can serve a valuable function on Wiki. Too many communist-related articles are obviously written by lay readers of Robert Conquest, RJ Rummel, Joshua Muravchik, or <i>The Black Book of Communism</i>. He has the potential to be a helpful counterweight to some of the more flamboyant anticommunism that creeps its way into articles. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:12, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not being clear enough earlier. I mentioned Robert Conquest, along with the others, because of the <i>style</i> of his prose, along with the popularity of his work, more than anything else. (Lynne Viola, Alexander Dallin, Moshe Lewin, Roberta T. Manning are far better sources anyway than Conquest, but I'll let this go since I don't feel like writing a book review.)</p>
<p>Anyway, NPOV, after all, is a matter of <i>tone</i> as well. Nor was I suggesting that there's no need to keep an eye on Lance. I was also a vocal opponent of banning RK, who has a similar set of flaws, but produces great work (when edited for NPOV by others). I was merely suggesting a strategy for dealing with Lance. It might go against your principles, and I'd respect that, but it could enlicit a less doctrinaire and more agreeable posture on his part. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:43, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>BTW, my comments on the Conquest page were facetious, in case that's not self-evident. The article was in far worse shape when I wrote the smart-ass comment in March, so the sarcasm was more obvious then. Kudos for your plans to revamp the article. Just be careful to keep the new article within the NPOV constraints. It might be a good idea to include the criticisms (especially on sources and use of the old-fashioned totalitarian model) from Sovietologists and agricultural specialists like Viola, Lewin, and Dallin. A note on e.g. Hobsbawm's emphases on the continuities with the Tsarist era would also be good for balance as well. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:56, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A little while ago I made a proposal on the mailing list for changing the process of editing problematic pages. It didn't get a great amount of comment, but notably it didn't get strongly attacked either. It is less drastic than your proposed changes but more likely to be accepted. The initial proposal is <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-January/009350.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-January/009350.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and some further comments are <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-January/009421.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-January/009421.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Viajero suggested trying it out with a new article, but I wonder what you think about trying it out with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a>. As you can see, some of the details of the new process are still undefined. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 06:22, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no authority to approve or disapprove it, so we should just decide on a process, announce it on the Talk page and in the mailing list, then go for it if there is no major objection. Probably we would have support from Danny and Viajero (but I didn't ask them yet). The committee is the part of the process that I'm least sure about. Maybe we can try it without a committe first. We would copy the existing article to Anti-Zionism (draft), invite edits, then when we have some degree of consensus get someone like Ed Poor to copy the draft to the official article. If the experiment fails, it fails, and if agreement is never reached we can reconsider forming a committee. I'll invite Danny and Viajero to comment now.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 10:42, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Thanks for your answer. I don't know much on copyright, but since you use photos from Google, I advise you to have a look at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> and I please you to check whether it is legal for Wikipedia to use the photos in this way. Have a look at the GFDL license, too. If you are not sure, it may be better to remove/delete the photos, just to be sure that Wikipedia will not face any kind of legal problems in the future. I don't really know whether there is any problem; I just inform you that Wikipedia is a bit sensitive regarding copyrighted material, in case you don't know. In case you are assured there is absolutely no problem, sorry for my intervention. I trust you that you don't upload copyrighted pics without persmission.

<p>Your map of the separation barrier is good but somewhat out of date in the Jerusalem area especially.

<p>No, I cleaned up the last one on the second shot. Why does a George W. Bush exist and not a George H. W. Bush?

<p>Just as it is probably apparent who "George Bush" refers to in that google link I provided, just turn on the news and listen to what "George Bush" refers to in speech. It's probably even more common. Only old people who have been living in a cave for at least the last 3 years believe "George Bush" refers to George Herbert Walker Bush. It is not wikipedia renaming people - it is the media and the people appearing on the media.

<p>Nai, you are right:) As I write in the image description it is either Poseidon's Temple or Thission. Hephaestos Temple is generally known as <i>thission</i> IIRC (I am not so knowledgable about ancient monuments, although I live next to them). Since you also recognise it as Hephaestos' temple, it probably is. Another day when I will go again there I will have a better check. and Nai, simera nobody remembers this great temple&#160;:( <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 11:27, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
