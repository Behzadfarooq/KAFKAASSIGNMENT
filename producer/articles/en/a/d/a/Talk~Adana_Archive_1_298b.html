<p>If you insist on pointing out "Adana Massacre" , its place is right under the famous "Armenian Genocide" page. If you plan to insert "historic facts" on how many Armenians were killed on each Turkish cities page, I am sure some other guy will come with the bright idea of editing the Armenian cities, which are only a few. --<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarioglu_2329.html" title="User:Isarioglu">Isarioglu</a> 20:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Wiglaf,</p>
<p>On the "Armenian Genocide" , I express my knowledge and ideas of what really happened on discussion page. For the events between 1919 and 1922, I have to ask you a simple question:</p>
<p>What would happen to a minority in YOUR country, if that minority would cooperate with the invaders and further, join their armed forces and make YOUR civilians suffer or kill them for revenge, money or fun, after the invaders are gone?</p>
<p>I thing you would revert them at sight...</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <i>civilized</i> way would be to arrest individuals who committed crimes, not to condemn an entire nation to ethnic cleansing. There is a reason why <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milosevic_9795.html#Trial" title="Slobodan Milosevic">Slobodan Milosevic</a> is in prison at the moment.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 21:17, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When one person in ten does commits this crimes and you have efficent ways to restore order and organise trials, that is the way it should be done. If this is not the case, it is called civil war, the most unpleasent and bloody kind of war. Yet the article itself explains how brevly Adana Armenians fighted against the local Turks when French withdraw, and be sure not with stones. Ethnic cleansing is one thing, civil war is another.</dd>

<dd>The exile of Armenians, which resulted with a disaster is a shame on Ottoman but not on modern Turkey. You have to understand that at early 1915, the same Ottoman Empire has send his best army, consisting of choosen, big , strong Turkmen youngsters to death at -40 Celcius at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sarikamis_7ebe.html" title="Battle of Sarikamis">Battle of Sarikamis</a>. 90,000 of best Ottoman soldier has frozen, because some pasha has arranged that the only regiment with good winter wear paraded 10 times in front of Enver Pasha.

<dd>The Adana massacre is not really related with the Armenian genocide, it happened in 1909, and the official Ottoman version doesn't deny it really happened. In fact, it is the only massacre of Armenians, that the "other side" do not entirly disagree with the official version. The Ottoman advanced 15 thousand as number of victims, Western sources varry from 20,000 to 30,000. The minimum range is pretty close to the Ottoman figures. Beside, there were Ottoman trials after the event condemning many that participated in the massacres. So, I really don't see what your regurgitated revionism regarding the Armenian genocide is doing in the Adana talk page. Beside, what you think is the truth, is not proper Wiki talk page discussion. Talk pages don't exist to establish what is the truth or not, but rather discuss regarding the different official positions. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 17:07, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name, Hittites, Cilicia etc.</span></h2>
<p>Re. this addition: "Its history goes back to the ancient Hittites,calling the area;Uru Adaniya which means Land of Adana.The city later took the name of the son of Pheonician King Agenor's son Cilic,which turned into Antiochia in Cilicia (Αντιόχεια της Κιλικίας) or Antiochia ad Sarum (Αντιόχεια η προς Σάρο)"</p>
<p>I have severe doubts.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not "Cilic", it's <a href="../../../c/i/l/Cilix.html" title="Cilix">Cilix</a>.</li>
<li>Cilix and <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agenor.html" title="Agenor">Agenor</a> are legendary personalities.</li>
<li>Cilix is related to the naming legend not of the city, but of the region of <a href="../../../c/i/l/Cilicia.html" title="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. The city was obviously named not directly after him, but after the country.</li>
<li>If we talk about the naming of "Antiochia in Cilicia", then of course we'll have to talk about some "Antiochus", who is obviously the direct name patron of the Hellenistic founding of the city.</li>
<li>I'd require solid references for the claim that the name "Adaniya" was used previously by the Hittites. Not that I'd exclude it, at first sight, but the only reference I can find on the web is a single text that is spread identically across a couple dozen Turkish-language websites. Not very confidence-inspiring.</li>
<li>If "Adaniya" was used before the Hellenistic era, we need a more detailed discussion about the side-by-side tradition of "Adan(iy)a" and "Antiochia" in antiquity.</li>
<li>Further down in the article it is said that the city was founded in the first century BC. That must be the foundation under the name of "Antiochia", obviously. The relation between that foundation and any previous Hittite settlement must be clarified.</li>
<li>There's a weird sentence further down in the article that I noticed only now: "Adana is the only city, whose name has remained the same for centuries in the world". What's meant by that? (Given the fact that "Antiochia" and "Adana" are clearly two different names.)</li>

<dd>Hi, the name of the city comes from an ancient Hititian legend, about the son of King, called Adanus. Antiochus is about <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarsus.html" title="Tarsus">Tarsus</a>, not Adana itself. By the way, Tarsus doesn't locates at the border of city not only in modern time but also in ancient times. --<a href="../../../t/u/z/User%7ETuzsuzDeliBekir_99b9.html" title="User:TuzsuzDeliBekir">TuzsuzDeliBekir</a> 19:44, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>According to the dab page at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochia.html" title="Antiochia">Antiochia</a>, both Tarsus and Adana were called Antiochia at one time, there were a hell of a lot of different Antiochias. As for "Adana", I can now at least confirm that it too is ancient, and there's an eponymous report or legend about one "Adanos" as a founder. It's in Greek sources; I wonder if we can trace it back to Hittite ones (I rather doubt it). So, do we have an ancient settlement that was re-founded or re-established under the name of Antiochia at one time but kept the original name of Adana side by side with it? Given this complexity, it might be a better idea after all to move the historical names further down in the article. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 20:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">about armenian genocide</span></h2>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I live in Adana and if you are interested in furthering your info. of genocide in Adana, I have lost of proofs that there were Turkish genocide in Adana. Genocide of Armenians in Adana is <b>an example of Armenian lies.</b>. In the north of Adana where Kozan and Kadirli locate, there were lots of graves of people who were killed by Armenians. Additionally, in those places there are some photo museums which shows the total killing actitvities of Armenians by the aid of France. Besides, I want to point that there were newer 30.000 Armenians in Adana at that time.--<a href="../../../t/u/z/User%7ETuzsuzDeliBekir_99b9.html" title="User:TuzsuzDeliBekir">TuzsuzDeliBekir</a> 19:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw that there is a discussion about wether the Adana massacre should be in this article.Adana should not be 'treated' differently than the articles about other cities.removing a specific historic event from an article about a specific city,is nothing more than an attempt to hide the facts!the reference must stay for the same reasons as,e.g. the 526 earthquake is mentioned in the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>...it is a History(=unchangable)--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If my memory serves me right, there was also a massacre of Turks instigated by the Armenians so, although the figures may not be in the same order, it is important to point this out, if not, like in the Armenian "genocide" article, the Turks are being portrayed as evil doers, part of the systematic Armenian campaign to sully the image of Turks. The Adana Holocaust article is clear proof of this!</dd>
<dd>And BTW, it was <b>local</b> officials, there were no orders coming from the central government!</dd>

<p>I am not aware of the level of your memory,nor am i interested to know it.if u have sources about a massacre of the turks by the armenians,cite them.but if u omit the reference to the armenian massacre,just cause it does not fit in your POV,it is u who makes <i>the Turks are being portrayed as evil doers</i>,cause u try to delete history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>and btw,when saying 'locals' i meant citizens.u do not know if the local officials had orders by the central government or not.and in any case,those who ruled did this,not the ordinary people.--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 17:12, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dont worry, I wasnt trying to recall my memory for your blue eyes, the whole period relating to the Ottoman downfall is surrounded by controversy with claims and counter claims, forged documents, plots, assassination attempts, rebellions etc. So excuse me but just because a bunch of racist Armenian bigots or the so called "academicians" decide to point the finger on the common Turks as instigators of all massacres, just like Goldhagen did with "Hitler's willing executioners", doesnt mean that they hold a monopoly on truth. Learn to be more objective and look closer at the supportive evidence and then you will realize that its just a pile of rubbish! I dont know and dont care to know what you think, but there is a clear pattern of discrediting the Turk and portraying them as evil doers and, sadly, this disease seems to have crept into Wiki!</dd>

<p>I am not sure that i understood what u said about the adm.system.lets be clear:a vilayet contained only a city,a city and a small rural area or a city and a vast rural area,something like that drawn in the map in this article?cause if it is the last case,i find the claim that there were not that many armenians in the city or non importance...</p>
<p>I have put no links at the reference section.but whoever did it,he was not supposed to include many references for the Adana massacre.it is an article about Adana,and the massacre is just mentioned in the history section.do not accuse me by saying "<i>you and those guys who wrote this sources</i>" or "<i>judging people</i>".look at the top of this page...i provided 2 links without including neither an armenian nor a turkish one.look at the date:i did it 3 days before.i am not trying to present an event that never happened.i am just trying to point at an event,that happened in Adana and is part of the city's history.it will be very interesting if u show some ottoman sources,as well as if someone wants to show some armenian sources.this will be a good balance for the discussion.but i think that neutral sources should be used in the article.the number in the article is 20-30,000,for the reason that there is not a source clear or neutral enough about the exact number of the victims.but this does not mean that the event did not happen.so,i find it ridiculous for anyone to try to delete it.and btw,i am not supposed to visit any place on earth were an event happened so as to write about it.Regards--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 15:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course there are Armenian villages in Adana, one of them is close to my villages. You are right because number is the most important problem in this case. most of the historian use Ottoman and German sources, though Germans had right to open ever door in the empire and thier sources are more relevant. Unfortunately, as I wrote above, nobody knows who escaped. Either of the sources and some France sources showed that around 30.000 Armenians escaped durin WWI. So, the number showed in the page is irrelevant. What I am aganist is non-sense propagandas. As we all know, Turks were also killed by Armenians during WWI. Those were armed by France army. At this point, we, if you wear a uniform, you are a soldier of the nation whose uniform you wear, cannot say 'Armenian' for them. Anyway, our topic is the number of whom were killed.--<a href="../../../t/u/z/User%7ETuzsuzDeliBekir_99b9.html" title="User:TuzsuzDeliBekir">TuzsuzDeliBekir</a> 18:54, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What the 1911 Britannica says</span></h2>
<p>Here is what the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (1911) says about Adana; author is David George Hogarth. I have preserved it texto, so it uses old spellings for placenames, and calls the Ottomans 'Turks'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) A vilayet in the S.E. of Asia Minor, which includes the ancient Cilicia. The mountain districts are rich in unexploited mineral wealth, and the fertile coast-plain, which produces cotton, rice, cereals, sugar and much fruit, and affords abundant pasturage, is well watered by the rivers that descend from the Taurus range. Imports and exports pass through Mersina (<i>q.v.</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) The chief town of the vilayet, situated in the alluvial plain about 30 m. from the sea in N. lat. 37° 18′. E. long. 35 18, on the right bank of the Seihan (Sihun, anc. Sarus), which is navigable by small craft as far as the town. Adana is connected with Tersus and Mersina by a railway built in 1887, and has a magnificent stone bridge, which carries the road to Missis and the east, and dates in parts from the time of Justinian, but was restored first in 743 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> and called Jisr al-Walid after the Omayyad caliph of that name, and again in 840 by the Caliph Mutasim. There are, also, a ruined castle founded by Harun al-Rashid in 782, fine fountains, good buildings, river-side quays, cotton mills and an American mission with church and schools. Adana, which retains its ancient name, rose to importance as a station on the Roman military road to the East, and was at one time a rival of Tarsus. The town was largely rebuilt by Mansutr in 758, and during subsequent centuries it often changed hands and suffered many vicissitudes. Its position, commanding the passage of the mountains to the north of Syria, rendered it important as a military station in the contest between the Egyptians and the Turks in 1832. After the defeat of the Turkish army at Konia it was granted to Ibrahim Pasha, and though the firman announcing his appointment named him only <i>muhassil</i>, or collector of the crown revenue, it continued to be held by the Egyptians till the treaty of July 1840 restored it to the Porte. The chief productions of the province are cotton, corn, sesame and wool, which are largely exported. The population of the town is greatly mixed, and, having a large element of nomads in it, varies much from time to time. At its maximum it reaches nearly 50,000.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So it appears that the EB11, which is normally very keen on classical identifications, does <i>not</i> identify it with any ancient "Antiochia" and indeed explicitly says it kept its ancient name of Adana. We need better sources.... Some of the historical information could also be added to the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 20:41, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

In fact they should be taken more seriously than the comments from so called acamedicians such as Dadrian who is a well known bigot and big time racist against Turks. I agree that the articles themseleves are not directly related to what happened in 1909, but one can argue that the events of 1909 are amongst the precursors of the massacres that followed during WWI!</dd>

<dd>and again,these events are supposed to have happened in all Anatolia,not only in Adana.i find no other reason of them been mentioned here,than to reduce the significance of the Adana massacre.</dd>

<dd>TAT is not progpaganda, far from it, it uses various sources to validate its claims, its one of the most comprehensive sites rejecting the "genocide" thesis and that probably explains why Turk haters like yourself cant stand it. As for Pamuk, he is an amazing writer and I find it rather curious that he mentioned what happened to the Armenians as a massacre and NOT a genocide!</dd>
<dd>As for academic sources, as long as it does not argue against the genocide thesis its ok I guess? That ma boy is whats called censorship, something you and your armenian buddies seem to be very acquainted and at ease with! Sorry, but your argument about academicians is just not credible if you apply it in a biased manner!</dd>

As for sources concerning the Adana Massacre, we can cite <i>Histoire de l'empire ottoman</i> (1989), by a pool of historians directed by Robert Mantran, chapter 14, written by Paul Dumont and François Georgeon. This book can hardly be called anti-Turk, on the contrary the appreciation and respect for the Ottoman institutions and history pervades all the book. <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 23:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi SouthernComfort. I must start admitting I'm a newbie concerning Armenian-Turkish articles, so I don't know the standard thas is generally followed in these articles. The point is that in ancient history articles we don't put obviously partisan links, and certainly we don't put a thing on which there is an academic consensus on the same level, as you did, with partisan sources. If you don't believe me, look in Google Books Search and tell me how many awnsers you found for "Adana Rebellion"; the coorect awnser is <b>0</b>. As for "Adana Massacre", I can give you a master list if you want, with the number of dead proposed by each. I confess I generally trust books far more than websites; an editor has to pay to get a work pubblished, and it is pretended that a historian has academic titles to exhibit, while any fool can open a website. While the PDF link you gave is very interesting <a href="http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/reslib.nsf/a2a27112da97de9b85256f7100617ec7/fce9a8ae241cbce185256f8d006471a0/$FILE/AG%20Chapter%203.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/reslib.nsf/a2a27112da97de9b85256f7100617ec7/fce9a8ae241cbce185256f8d006471a0/$FILE/AG%20Chapter%203.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, I must note you created a non-existent contrast between Mantran's book and the source in your link, and secondly you cut it short giving the misleading impression that it endorses 2000 victims for Adana, forgetting to say that the same source adds immediately after that most were killed ten days later, and cites a member of a parliamemntary commission of investigation that speaks of 19,479 Armenians, 850 Syrians, 422 Chaldeans and 250 Greeks. As for the last two links, I have no axe to grind and am neither Greek nor Armenian, but I think we shouldn't use links when they clearly have an agenda. All the same, we can as well keep them to simply record the Turkish POV; but it should be remembered that while every statement is always a POV, the various POV are not equal and have not the same academic consensus. Excuse me if this message is so long, and sorry if I may have been a bit acid; I know that your only intent is to put an end to this edit-war, but it's only that truth (or what academic consensus believes to be truth, more exactly) is not always precisely in the middle.

<dd>Hi Aldux. Actually, Justin McCarthy is a respected American academic and university professor, so unless evidence is provided that says otherwise, I consider him as neutral as any other source regarding this matter. I understand your concern about the term "Adana massacre" versus "Adana rebellion," however as McCarthy has demonstrated, there are two POVs to this event and very often the deaths of Turkish Muslims are ignored. These issues are extremely contentious and there is, in reality, not much academic consensus. If there was, we'd have an easier time settling these disputes. As for number of deaths and so forth, any further expansion should be taken to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_massacre.html" title="Adana massacre">Adana massacre</a>, IMHO. However, I believe the term "massacre" to be potentially POV - a better article title would be <b>Adana conflict of 1909</b> or something along those lines. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:00, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for awnsering. Personally, as an American academic and university professor, I have no problem considering citing his theory; but I should make clear what I mean by "academic consensus". It does not mean the universality of the accademic world, but a considerable majority, which leaves space for a minority to express an alternate view. In my opinions this is a classical example of accademic consensus: a majority expose the massacre view which McCarthy opposes. The fact that searching in Google Books Search I have not found one text exposing McCarthy's position, while I have found many accepting the massacre version, including, and this is important, historians who cited the event only indirectly as an example, while they never refer to it as being highly controversial. As for the title you propose for <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Massacre_91e7.html" title="Adana Massacre">Adana Massacre</a>, <b>Adana conflict of 1909</b> is far more POV, because it exposes completely McCarthy's position. --<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 23:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But at this time there is no "majority" - most of the sources regarding Adana (and I have searched Google Books) are written by Armenian authors. One book written by non-Armenians <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521829585&amp;id=2hcw6_PMuh4C&amp;q=adana+massacre&amp;dq=adana+massacre" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521829585&amp;id=2hcw6_PMuh4C&amp;q=adana+massacre&amp;dq=adana+massacre" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> is also, I'm assuming (perhaps incorrectly - I don't have a Google account), citing first-hand Armenian accounts. This is the problem. There are old references from Britannica and Trotsky that use the term "Adana massacre" but nothing new other than non-academic works. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:43, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I checked the link given by Hybridlily, and I think that looks nice. Since some of them are Ottoman archives.

The fact that you are Greek and you frequently contribute to the WP "Armenian Genocide" topic always on the side of the Armenians makes your motives on this particular topic highly suspicious. Why dont you just accept the fact that you have a deep complex and cant stand anything that is remotely Turkish?</dd>

<dd>During the French occupation, a large section of the Armenian population was already evacuated in the desert to perish or killed. The Armenians that served in the French army during the occupation of Adana were mostly not from Adana but rather were refugees whom were rescued or volonteers from the West. When the French army left the region, the Armenian quarter was rased. To include some incidents compared to what happened to the Armenians of Adana during the genocide is clearly misleading. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:04, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You can always start reading: <i>The Lions of Marash; Personal Experiences with American Near East Relief, 1919-1922</i> by Stanley Elphinstone Kerr. If you want more books, feel free to request them. Stanley Elphinstone Kerr discribes what happened there in Adana, what Armenians were able to do at best was to defeat Omar Bey's detachment but those were even not Armenians from Adana, but rather those returning Armenians in Zeitoon. But soon after that Ali Bey answered back and it was over. The rest of the Armenian population just vanished under the complicity of a local branches of the Ittihad, while Colonel Brémond attempt to prevent that with his declaration for sieging the place was a total failure.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Settling this for once and all</span></h2>
<p>TuzsuzDeliBekir, I have clarified my opinion on the talk page of the Adana massacre article, which is the same. The Adana massacre is considered less controversial than the Armenian genocide. An example is one of the sources, Mantran an Ottomanist is one of the very few Westerm scholar who still question the veracity of the Armenian genocide but still treat the Adana massacre as something that is not debateble. It is the only event which figures of victims are about the same from every sides in fact there is only two notable Western historians that I know of that have ever limited it to a rebellion and they are McCarthy and Shaw and his Turkish wife Ezel Kural. Even Turkish author don't even cover that event much. So not only limiting that event as a rebellion is to place a fringe position (The Sebrenitsa massacres are even considered more controversial than what happened in Adana) as equal as a majority view, but rebellion is not an 'also called' but a position of the underlying possible causes of the massacres, no one including Turkish authors deny the deaths of 20 thousand people, in fact McCarthy who is considered as the ambassador of the Turkish government position in the east provides the same figures of deaths for Adana than the Hamidian massacres of 1894-97. Here, I am not interested entering in a revert war, but it is not for me to justify my revert but you, because you are the one not respecting word conventions.Doing what you do is equivalent as to add in the Quantum mechanic entry 'also called Super String theory' which is plain wrong, because Adana massacre refers to the death of a number of people, which is not to be confounded with the different positions to explain the underlying causes, and the term 'Adana rebellion' refers to one of the thesis explain the causes of the massacre and is not another term to refer to the massacre. I have for now reverted enought, and I won't play the ball game, I just think thyat if you care for the quality of this article you will do it yourself, I am not engaging in an endless debate for something that is obvious. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really cannot understand why you still disscuss it in this page. Again, I remind you that it is also a page in Wiki. Saying 'ohhh, McCarthy refuses Adana Mass. so he is not a respecfull sholar' cannot take us further. Since I could say Armenian sources aren't respectful at many points. Before we agreed, we had an armenian sources which shows that more than 30.000 armenians were killed.</dd>

<dd>Anonymous, I thought I helped you realise to not waste your time, so what the hell you are doing here? As for your answer, I repeat, while you are gratifying yourself of your English skills, you still are not able to understand what others are posting. Besides, the 35 thousand figure is not an Armenian one, various authors including in the democidal calculation work of Rummel we find such a figure. 20 thousand is the number of victims figure from Ottoman source only in Adana, the Adana massacre does not only refer to the deaths in Adana by elsewhere in Cilicia. As for comming to McCarthy, this is not my page, this is Wikipedia, I have not tried discarding him, what I said is that McCarthy does not question the deaths, he does not question those massacres, he only justifies them by proposition an underlying causes which according to him was rebellion, he is the only of the 2 Western scholars that I have ever read who limit the massacre to its underlying causes, even those rare authors questioning the reality of the Armenian genocide do not do so, and I already refered to Mantran, who is often viewed as the French McCarthy. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:45, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Besides, he is only one of them who refuse Adana Mas. I dont have much time to answer all. '<i>Adana rebellion' refers to one of the thesis explain</i> well, it is supported by both Turkish and Non-Turkish scolars. Therefore, as a respecfull editor, I know that Armenians were killed and that was a result of a rebellion. Since they weren't killed without any meaningfull reason. I think the page should contain either of opinions. Again, if you want to diss. it, please go to talk page of Adana Mass. --85.100.77.217 11:23, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, here is where you are wrong, two Western scholar just notable enought and who have never published any specific paper about Adana massacre, can in no way be compared to the concensus, read Wikipedia policies, you can not present two different positions as equal, and in this cases calling an event from its underlying possibles causes is proper to McCarthy and the Shaws, because the rare ones that question the Armenian genocide still do not deny the Adana massacres, even Kamuran Gurun and Turkish scholars settle to at least 15 thousand killed. So, presenting 'Adana rebellion' as equivalent and as an 'also called' is to present a thesis on the underlying causes as equal to the massacre, one is a possible underlying causes the other refers to the deaths of people. Sebrenitsa in the published literature is more controversial, but you do not have such misleading characterisation.

<dd>Hopeless nationalist? You mean Armenian nationalist? Nationalism imply that my nation is Armenia or that I am born in Armenia, which isen't the cases. Don't expect that throwing mud at me some will stick, this is not how it work in a platform such as Wikipedia. Comming to the Ottoman government figures, the report published by the new Vali and Baban Zadei placed the number of victims to 20,200, from which 19,400 were Christian, mostly Armenians and only 620 Muslim. It appears that the Turkish attack against the Arabs later was dumped as Muslim victims cause by 'Armenian rebellion.' Those figures were confirmed submitted to the French minister Pichon (AMAE, Correspondance politique, Turquie, n. s., vol. 83, f° 147). I also have pictures of entire towns burned in the fire if you want.

<p>Mr. Bekir, may I please ask you why you insist on putting irrelevant data in the article <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana.html" title="Adana">Adana</a>. I refer to the surface area figure. This is the figure for <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Province_93f1.html" title="Adana Province">Adana Province</a> and the data is placed on the related page. Best regards. <a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehemoth_656c.html" title="User:Behemoth">Behemoth</a> 20:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I was about to write to you. The data that I added is not irrelevatn data. Since, it is counted and documented by local governer. Besides, I live in Adana and the city doesn't have adm. district like Adana city and Adana province. The place where you think that is Adana is known as Seyhan, an urban district of Adana. For futher knowledge, please look at geo-district of Turkey. I hope that above is helpfull for you to understand why I add the statement. --<a href="../../../t/u/z/User%7ETuzsuzDeliBekir_99b9.html" title="User:TuzsuzDeliBekir">TuzsuzDeliBekir</a> 20:44, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Mr. Bekir, governor represents the central government in a province. A province (il) is an administrative unit. There exists no category as a city (şehir) in Turkish administrative organisation. "Adana city" means the area administered by Metropolitan Municipality of Adana (Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi). Seyhan is a district (ilçe), an administrative sub-entity. The figure given at the governor's website is the surface area of the whole province, including districts as far as Tufanbeyli or Pozanti. Furthermore, when we usually talk of a "large city" (more correctly, big city or metropolis, et al.) we mean the amount of population residing in that city, not the surface area it covers. Therefore, the data given (provided by the governor's website) is irrelevant in this particular context, just because of the sole fact that article Adana pertains merely to City of Adana, in a more administrative and judicial sense, area administered under the authority of Metropolitan Municipality of Adana. Perhaps, you may well obtain the figure for surface area of the Metropolitan Municipality if you counsel some of your local municipal officials. (For comparison, Greater Tokyo Area, which is (unlike Adana) not organised as a single local admnistrative entity, covers about a surface area about 5,000 square kilometres.)

<dd>Hi, I dont have much time, because I am in my launch break.First of all, il and şehir refers to the same area. Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi exist, because according to Turkish adm. cities holding more than 1 million citizens have to be defined as a Metropolitan Municipality. Thus, they have to have a Büyükşehir Belediyesi. Please, look at page of Adana, the city is composed of more than 15 small region. The central region is called Seyhan. For ins. according to my identity card, I was born in Seyhan region of Adana. Hence, you can understand that Adana is just the name of the city, and used to refer all districts. I know that above is a bit confusing. By the way, it is the web site of local governership, not local governer. They are also more different inasmuch as their responsibiliy and selection procedures as well. I hope that you understand why it is as big as does the numbers say.

<dd>As an uninvolved editor in this dispute, it's my opinion that the area (which needs to be cited) belongs not in the intro, but in a Geography section (which I've added). Maybe this article also needs an infobox, where such information as area could go. The dispute also seems to revolve around the definition of Adana's borders or as a city vs. a province. What the area figure refers to needs to be specified. If it's the area of the Adana province, say so and cite it as such. -<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 18:02, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The surface area figure <b>IS</b> for the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Province_93f1.html" title="Adana Province">Adana Province</a>, not for its capital city, Adana. To claim otherwise is absurd. There exists a manifest distinction between a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">province</a> (an administrative unit) and a <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> (an urban area). <a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehemoth_656c.html" title="User:Behemoth">Behemoth</a> 17:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes made</span></h2>
<p>I made the following changes on the Adana page: I placed the gallery, to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana_Province_93f1.html" title="Adana Province">Adana Province</a> page, since none of them were located in city of Adana. The lists of ruins and festivals (except Altın Koza) were moved there as well. A festival and a historical site, which were in Kadirli and Düziçi were moved to <a href="../../../o/s/m/Osmaniye_Province_a740.html" title="Osmaniye Province">Osmaniye Province</a> page. Also, a strange phrase ("Inhabitants of Selonica") embedded between Abbasid and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in the Chronology was removed. Behemoth 14:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
