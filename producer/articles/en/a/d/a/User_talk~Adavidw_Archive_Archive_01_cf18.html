<p>I'm fairly new here; I've been tending, when cleaning out articles, to take out the red links--rather than putting new ones in. Now I'm wondering if there's any sort of guideline on this. On the one hand, it automatically gives you a working link if someone ever does make the appropriate page. On the other hand, it's fairly distracting to have a signal that says, "There's not a link that works here! Or here!" And distraction is a real consideration when you're presenting information. I tried to find some discussion of this but some basic poking around didn't turn up anything. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 18:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>LOL! Sorry; you had no way of knowing what I was talking about.</p>
<p>When I first started a couple of years ago, we were fighting a bizarre vandal I dubbed the "B-Movie Bandit." We came to the conclusion we were dealing with a bot, but no matter. Anyway, all this bot's contributions were formatted exactly the same way your initial entry was with little more than a cast list and no plot description whatsoever. Drove us up a freaking wall since the proxies kept shifting and a now-banned user was really stirring the pot during this time and used this as an excuse to disrupt the place. A few entries were expanded, most were deleted or redirected. Thanks for fixing the new version. - Lucky 6.9 09:11, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I saw you had linked <a href="../../../i/n/t/Image%7EIntacsonfinger2.jpg_5cd8.html" title="Image:Intacsonfinger2.jpg">Image:Intacsonfinger2.jpg</a> in the article you wrote on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrastromal_Corneal_Rings_acd0.html" title="Intrastromal Corneal Rings">Intrastromal Corneal Rings</a>. Because the image has been taken from the manufacturer's site and is copyrighted, its licensing on Wikipedia is <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">Fair use</a>. This requires that <i>each</i> use of the image be justified on the image page. If you look there, you can see the licensing notice, plus what I wrote for the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Keratoconus.html" title="Keratoconus">keratoconus</a> article. It's not a problem for your article, as the usage there is clearly covered by fair use licensing, but it does need something written to that effect on the image description page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Links</span></h2>
<p>I deleted some links some weren't relevants to the article.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-L_d1af.html" title="WP:MOS-L">WP:MOS-L</a> for more information about having too much links in an article.</p>
<p>Internal links</p>
<p>The use of links to other Wikipedia articles, for example, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant.html" title="Ant">Ant</a>, is encouraged. Use the links for all words and terms that are relevant to the article.</p>
<p>The purpose of internal links is to allow readers to easily and conveniently follow their curiosity or research to other articles. These links should be included where it is most likely that a reader would want to follow them elsewhere — for example, in article introductions, the beginnings of new sections, table cells, and image captions. Generally, where it is likely that a reader may wish to read about another topic, the reader should not have to hunt for a link elsewhere in the page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, do not make too many links. An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:</p>
<pre>
   * more than 10% of the words are contained in links;
   * it has more links than lines;
   * a link is repeated in the same article (although there may be case for duplicating an important link that is distant from the previous occurrence);
   * more than 10% of the links are to articles that don't exist; or
   * low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century.
</pre>
<p>This also applies to tables, considered by themselves.</p>
<p>As a general rule, do not put links in the title; however, this may be acceptable with complex titles or verbose leads, such as those concerning multiple concepts.</p>

<p>Well, but the string "A1, A7" conveys no useful information to either me or anyone else, such as the article creator trying to find out why his article was deleted; I don't have the CSD numbers memorized. The templates {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}} and {{tl|db-bio} are provided to use instead. I feel that "noted for his work in preon theory" is sufficient assertion of notability (and I did a quick check to find out it it's true, which it appears to be), and that the article is not empty in the sense of {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}} but rather just a short stub. Assuming that Mr Yershov deserves an article, which seems likely, there's no harm in retaining this stub. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 02:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63294901922"></span></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alela Diane</span></h2>
<p>I am disturbed that you have deleted an article without any discussion, and request that that decision be referred on (however that is done, I don't know). Alela Diane is an up-and-coming artist of renown, for whom at some point soon there will clearly need to be an article. She is already cross referenced in the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psych_folk.html" title="Psych folk">psych folk</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Weird_America_22ff.html" title="New Weird America">New Weird America</a> articles. She currently has 47,000 Google hits (up from 45K yesterday), is touring in the US, and shortly in the UK. She has an All Music Guide entry as follows&#160;: “First released in 2004 as a private CD-R run then later re-released formally in 2006, the softly spooked-out acid folk of The Pirate’s Gospel is a captivating debut from Alela Diane, whose enthusiasm and ability for a then-extremely-fresh learner on guitar is quite something. Recorded by her father, who also helps perform on many tracks along with other friends and family members, the disc showcases Alela Diane’s knack for gentle, immediate melodies and her fine voice, possessed of a hint of twang that suggests a combination of Dusty Springfield and Kristin Hersh, with a rich maturity beyond her years.” If you wish you can continue to insist on an over-strict application of Wikipedia criteria, or alternatively you can ensure that information is made available on a current artist who is in the process of becoming one of international renown. <a href="../../../g/h/m/User%7EGhmyrtle_8d53.html" title="User:Ghmyrtle">Ghmyrtle</a> 11:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RF</span></h2>
<p>With all due respect, the question as to whether or not Nintendo's technology for RF game controlling speficially is derived identically from Atari's is irrelevant. The basis of the statement is that the wavebird operates on RF frequency technology, and that RF frequency technology was first pioneered for use <i>in gaming</i> by Atari. It's the same way with analog sticks- Nintendo's analog stick operates on a much different basis than, for example, the pioneering analog sticks created for use on the Vectrex, but the founding principle of analog movement based on potentiometers is still in place. The same goes for the wavebird- it relies on RF technology that, while less advanced, was pioneered by Atari. Nevertheless, in the interest of fairness, the sentence has been modified for clarity. It now states that the wavebird "uses RF waves that were first utilized in gaming by the Atari CX-02 joysticks". <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 07:34, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Adavidw. I removed the Gizlio spammer from AIV because he hadn't been adequately warned on all the IPs —&#160;although it's obviously the same guy, we really should take care to provide the full set of warnings before blocking. I've put {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-spam4_e0d7.html" title="Template:Uw-spam4">uw-spam4</a>}} on the user and IP talk pages. If/when he spams again, please relist him at AIV and I or another admin will block him then. Thanks. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
