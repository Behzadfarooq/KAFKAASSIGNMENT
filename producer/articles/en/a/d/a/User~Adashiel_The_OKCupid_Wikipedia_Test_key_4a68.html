<li>Wikipedia may be the most famous "wiki" out there, but it isn't the only one. What exactly is a wiki, anyway?
<ul>
<li>Answer: A collaborative Web forum where anyone can edit the content.</li>
<li>Commentary: See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a>. (And by the way, it's a <i>kiwi</i> not a <i>wiki</i>&#160;;) )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I click the edit tab for an article in Wikipedia, make changes to it, and then click the button to save them, what happens?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It immediately goes live for all the world to see.</li>
<li>Commentary: This is perhaps the most startling aspect for new users. Much of the vandalism on Wikipedia consists of tests from those who stumbled into the edit function and had no idea their changes were being added to the live article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While visiting an article in Wikipedia, you find an inaccuracy you'd like to see corrected or you have information you'd like to add. What do you do?
<ul>
<li>Answer: Edit the article and make the correction or add the information.</li>
<li>Commentary: You'd also get partial credit for choosing "Go to the article's Discussion page and politely ask someone to make the changes." If you don't feel confident, that's okay, but an important guideline for Wikipedians is it's good to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One of the founding precepts of Wikipedia is that all articles reflect a neutral point of view. What does that mean to you?
<ul>
<li>Answer: Articles should be objective, and not reflect the biases of their contributors.</li>
<li>Commentary: I also gave you partial credit for "I'm thinking the articles on pedophilia and Hitler are a pain in the ass to maintain", because they are. Everybody's got an opinion about topics like those, but no matter how vile to you a subject may be, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">the neutral point of view</a> is sacrosanct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Wikipedia, it is possible to create an account so that you can log into the site. Why might you want to do this?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It helps to establish your reputation and a rapport with other editors, and also hides your computer's IP address from the edits you make.</li>
<li>Commentary: You'll also get partial credit for choosing "I wouldn't. I prefer to remain anonymous." The reason you only get half-credit for that is if you edit an article, it leaves behind your <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a>, which isn't very anonymous. For an argument about why you should make an account, see the article <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_create_an_account__49b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Why create an account?">Why create an account?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the context of Wikipedia, what is a sandbox?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It's an area where you can carry out editing experiments.</li>
<li>To access the main sandbox, go <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">here</a>. For more information about Wikipedia sandboxes, see the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Wikipedia%7EAbout_the_Sandbox_7fb8.html" title="Wikipedia:About the Sandbox">About the Sandbox</a>. You'll get a vandalism point if you choose "It's the whole of Wikipedia," since using Wikipedia as your personal sandbox is pretty much what vandalism is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many pages in Wikipedia have an accompanying Discussion (aka Talk) page. What is this page for?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It's where contributors go to discuss the accompanying article, user, project, or policy, to resolve disputes, vet ideas, and make comments.</li>
<li>Commentary: Most pages in Wikipedia have a talk section. Even this page does, and you can access it from the "Discussion" tab at the top of the page or by clicking <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_The_OKCupid_Wikipedia_Test_key_d998.html" title="User talk:Adashiel/The OKCupid Wikipedia Test key">here</a>. For more information about talk pages, see <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">Talk page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The content in Wikipedia is explicitly described as free. What consequences does this have for copyrighted material?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It means no material that has restrictions on its redistribution or modification can be included in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Commentary: See <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Ownership of articles</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Copyrights</a> and the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Document License</a>. This answer actually isn't 100% true for all material in Wikipedia. Most significantly, though they're discouraged when alternatives are available, non-free images are permitted in some cases. See the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> guidelines for more information. You'll get partial credit if you answer "The contents of other Web sites should never be copied into Wikipedia." You can copy material from other Web sites if the owner gives permission or it has been released with a GFDL-compatible license or into the public domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have edited an article on a subject that you feel passionate about. The next time you check it, you notice someone has removed your changes, indicating they violated Wikipedia's neutral point of view (or NPOV) policy. When you wrote it, you didn't think it was biased. Which of the following would be an acceptable response? (There are actually many acceptable responses, but only one of the following is one of them.)
<ul>
<li>Answer: Place your changes back in, and then open a civil dialog on the article's talk page explaining why you believe your edits should stay.</li>
<li>Commentary: This is actually a more aggressive approach than many Wikipedians would prefer, but it is an option. It's often better to take the discussion to the Talk page first before making your edit. Whatever you do, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">be civil</a>, and do not get in an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>. Don't violate or abuse the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Three-revert rule</a>; if the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> is against you, maybe you were more biased than you thought. If the discussion is especially contentious or no consensus can be reached, Wikipedia has options for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Articles in Wikipedia should be descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and be encylopedic in nature. Sometimes, it's not always clear what encyclopedic means, but of the following, which has the most potential as a new entry.
<ul>
<li>Answer: You're familiar with an organization that has received national attention, and you think people would be curious about it.</li>
<li>Commentary: The other answers violate policies on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">spam</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would you find out what changes have been made to an article?
<ul>
<li>Answer: Check the article's History section. From there you can determine when it was edited, by whom, and what the differences are between versions.</li>
<li>Commentary: You'll get partial credit if you answer "Use Google. Older versions of articles are likely to be cached there." You <i>can</i> use the Google cache, but the article's own <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_history_b7d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Page history">revision history</a> will provide far more detail. For information about what the history section is, see the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Page_history">user's guide to page history</a>. Though this page isn't a very good example, you can see its history from the History tab at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You come across an article that's been mangled by vandalism. How would you revert it back to a cleaner version?
<ul>
<li>Answer: Click the article's history and find the latest version that hasn't been vandalized. Edit that version and save it.</li>
<li>Commentary: For detailed instructions on how to revert and when, see the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Revert</a> guidelines. You'll get partial credit if you choose "Leave a note on the article's discussion page and try to get hold of an administrator." However, except in severe and persistent cases of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>, it's better to do the revert yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have come across an article with a notice indicating it is currently being considered for deletion. Assuming you'd rather the article stay, how would you express your opinion?
<ul>
<li>Answer: Go to the article's deletion page and edit it. Leave a "Keep" vote, explain why, and sign your vote.</li>
<li>Commentary: You'll get partial credit if you choose "Edit the article's discussion page, explain why you don't want the page removed, and sign your entry." If an article is earmarked for a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">speedy deletion</a>, that would be the correct action. However, for a standard deletion nomination, if you make your comment on the article's talk page rather than participating in the actual vote, it's likely your voice will not be heard. For more information about the deletion process, see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for deletion</a>. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a byzantine process, especially for new users, but once you understand a little Wiki mark-up and how to edit the deletion article, it's not too difficult. For an example of what a deletion debate looks like, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elf_Only_Inn_%283rd_nomination%29_786f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf Only Inn (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf Only Inn (3rd nomination)</a>. (Please do not contribute to that AfD article as it is a closed debate).</li>

</li>
<li>Wikipedia is just one of the communities maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation. Which of the following is not one of those communities?
<ul>
<li>Answer: WikiWikiWeb</li>
<li>Commentary: WikiWikiWeb was actually the first Wiki, but it was not maintained by the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. It was part of the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland_Pattern_Repository_abe1.html" title="Portland Pattern Repository">Portland Pattern Repository</a>. Many Web sites use wikis on their sites for collaboration. Examples include <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a>, <a href="http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/" rel="nofollow">WorldWideWiki</a>, and <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki" rel="nofollow">MeatballWiki</a>. Wikimedia Wikis include not only <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="m:">Meta-wiki</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:">Wiktionary</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="n:">WIkinews</a>, but also <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:">Wikibooks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:">Wikiquote</a>, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikisource:">Wikisource</a>, <a href="http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikispecies:">Wikispecies</a>, and the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a stub article?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It's a short article that could benefit from some fleshing out.</li>
<li>Commentary: See <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Stub</a>. Stubs are so common in Wikipedia that they are broken down into different kinds of stubs based on their subject. More so than any other type of article in Wikipedia, if you come across a stub and know something about it, feel free to expand it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a WikiProject?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It is a collection of pages devoted to the management of a family of similar articles.</li>
<li>Commentary: See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a>. There are hundreds of WikiProjects covering a broad spectrum of subjects, from hobbies and interests to Wikipedia policies. Examples include <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Webcomics</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Discworld_f43d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Discworld">Discworld</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">Stub sorting</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When editing an article and you see [[ and ]] around a word or phrase, what does that mean? How about {{ and }}?
<ul>
<li>Answer: [[ and ]] are for links to other Wiki articles, while {{ and }} are for templates.</li>
<li>Commentary: Wikis use their own mark-up style, so even if you are familiar with HTML or bulletin board style mark-ups, how it works may not be immediately apparent. For more information, see <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">How to edit a page</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Template messages</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wikipedians use a lot of abbreviations and short hand. Which of the following is used in an edit summary when an editor has erased simple vandalism?
<ul>
<li>Answer: rvv</li>
<li>Commentary: Abbreviations and other forms of shorthand crop up in any editing environment and Wikipedia is no exception. Every contributor has his or her own style, but many have wide usage. Specifically, RVV is short for "Reverted Vandalism". The other choices listed are also widely used abbreviations. NN is short for "non-notable"; see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a>. Copyvio is short for "copyright violation"; see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Copyright problems</a>. POV is short for "point of view" and refers to Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is RC Patrol?
<ul>
<li>Answer: It's a way quickly removing harmful edits by monitoring the latest article updates.</li>
<li>Commentary: See <a href="../../../r/c/_/Wikipedia%7ERC_patrol_419c.html" title="Wikipedia:RC patrol">RC patrol</a>. An effective way to weed out bad edits, especially vandalism, is to watch it happen in real time. The <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a> page is where most RC patrollers start (thus the name), but there are other sources and tools available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who is Jimbo Wales?
<ul>
<li>Answer: The founder of Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Commentary: See the Wikipedia article about him <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">here</a>. He also has a Wikipedia user page at <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>. (And by the way, that's Jimbo <i>Jones</i>.)</li>
