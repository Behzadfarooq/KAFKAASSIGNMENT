<p>I was reading this article since I am doing a report on H.G. Wells and saw you added a bunch of analytical details which are great! I just wanted to say thanks and ask where you got them or are they your own ideas? Kramer k 07:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. I just got it from the book itself, I think Wells meant his readers to read the book intelligently and not take at face value Bedford's judgement. By the way, if you make a report of Wells' work in general and not just this book, I would advice you to include his "The Shape of Things to Come" from 1934, which is often neglected and in my view unjustly.

<p>Thanks for the interesting text. Would you have a chance to add screenshot from Zeman's movie when Sword is flapping away from Nautilus?</p>
<p>HMS Sword is also name of at least one real historical ship: <a href="http://www.historycentral.com/navy/LSD/rushmore.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historycentral.com/navy/LSD/rushmore.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. At some time tt may be good to move the fiction submarine under different name and create disambiguation. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:03, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I could have expected this, "Sword" is a natural name for Englsih-speaking navies to use. I agree that this change should be made, the real ship should have some precedence over the fictional one. About the Zeman film: I am afraid I never saw it, only found some refernces to it on the internet. I have no way of adding film sequences to the page, if you can do it go ahead, it would be a nice addition. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 20:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I now read the interesting description which you found. If I understand correctly the first lines - "Rushmore (LSD-14) was laid down as HMS Sword 31 December 1943 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Va; launched as Rushmore 10 May 1944" it seems to meand that the Ameroican origianlly built her for the British who intended to call her "HMS Sword" but that in fact, for an unspecified reason, the Americans decided to keep her and call her "Rushmore", and that was the actual name she bore throughout a quite long career. So, in a way, this "HMS Sword" is as fictional as the other one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 20:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have seen Zeman's film couple of times (early <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">Steampunk</a> style, very good movie) but currently have no chance to get it on my machine. Will see.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>HMS Sword: there was also "HMS Sword Dance", a WW1 minesweeper. I have no intention to work on British ships, it's just a result of quick googling. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 14:46, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I added it into <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Sword_0145.html" title="HMS Sword">HMS Sword</a>. You may notice mechanically powered "frog flaps" used to propel the ship (Nautilus used a classic propeller). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 15:11, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry,it did not even occur to me that there could be any such problem with a song which is more than sixty year old and whose text appears on HUNDREDS of websites. Here is what I found in exactly three minutes' search on Yahoo: <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/ww2-music-uk.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/ww2-music-uk.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>,<a href="http://www.know-britain.com/songs/therell_always_be_an_england.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.know-britain.com/songs/therell_always_be_an_england.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.jilldaniels.com/BRITISH%20ANTHEMS.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jilldaniels.com/BRITISH%20ANTHEMS.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.ghostofaflea.com/archives/005515.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ghostofaflea.com/archives/005515.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.littleengland.co.uk/le/lpp.html#There'll%20always%20be%20an%20England" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.littleengland.co.uk/le/lpp.html#There'll%20always%20be%20an%20England" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/t/therellalwaysbeanengland.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/t/therellalwaysbeanengland.shtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://madtpot.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://madtpot.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>,<a href="http://www.youth.net/memories/1999/0260.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youth.net/memories/1999/0260.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. If you go on searching you will find hundreds more (I would not be surprised if it will turn out to be thousands). Are all these people breaking the supposed copyright, and is somebody suing all of them for it? (It could provide several law offices with full employment for several years at least). Or are they all paying royalties (to whom)?</p>
<p>Of course, if turns out there is a real copyright you could wipe the text from the article itself and install instead an outside link to one or more of these websites. A very left-handed way for an encyclopedia to do things,in my view, but far be it from me to cause legal problems to Wikipedia.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 12:54, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the information is derived from the doctorate paper presented by Jeffrey M.Angles to the Ohio State University in 2003, which is availalble on the net. The paper is about Murayama Kaita and Edogawa Ranpo, who were Japanese writers of the generation immediately following Shunrō Oshikawa, and it contains several detailed references to him and footnotes giving the names and dates of his books.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have tried to include a link to this dissertation in the Wikipedia page but it seems not to work - probably because of the program used there. If you could make it work it would be very useful. This is the address: <a href="http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi?acc_num=osu1071535574" class="external free" title="http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi?acc_num=osu1071535574" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi?acc_num=osu1071535574</a></dd>
<dd>It does work when you paste it directly into Google.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can't claim to be any kind of expert on this subject myself, my only part was to search very hard for useful information, since I became very frustrated to see many mentions of later Twentieth Century film adaptations of his books and hardly any mention of the man himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The expert in this case is Jeffrey M.Angles, who seems to be living in Japan at present and is directing an email list about the shakuhachi, which seems to be a peculiarly Japanese musical instrument, difficult to play <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/shaku/Shakumail.2001/0328.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://communication.ucsd.edu/shaku/Shakumail.2001/0328.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the information Adam, I guess I should have noticed the dissertation link in the article, but PDFs make me cry so I avoid looking at them unless I have to.

Though it does provide some good general info on the guy, it's a bit odd using it as a main source as it's really not about him at all. A bit of random searching turned up a possible additional source of "The Gender of Nationalism: Competing Masculinities in Meiji Japan" in the Winter 2002 issue of the <i>Journal of Japanese Studies</i>, which could perhaps be obtained by through <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENewspapers_and_magazines_request_service_a0a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service">Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service</a> and might provide some additional material.

<dd>Sorry, had been busy with other things for a few months. Got slightly stuck on the Oshikawa article because there was just too much I couldn't find out. Biographies tend to try and be a roughly chronological account of an individual's life, and I just couldn't think of a sensible way to string the random bits of information that there was together in a sensible way. Might look at it again now, see if I can do any better. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 16:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A tag has been placed on Moshe Ayalon, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

<p>As advised, I looked through the Wikipedia guidelines for "notability", and I must say it is true that Moshe Ayalon does not fit most of them, because he is definitely not famous enough in the various ways enumerated there. (But I saw also that these guidelines are not binding.)</p>
<p>The only criteria which in my view jut might fit him is this: <i>100 year test (future speculation)</i> -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?"</p>
<p>My reasons for thinking this is applicable is - apart from the fact that I think Ayalon IS going to become famous, but of course I can't prove that - is that even if he never become more famous than he now is, he has a sharp and incisive mind, identifying real issues and dealing with them in an original way which nobody did before him, and writing with considerable literary merit. Re the above <i>100 year test", it is my opinion that for example a researcher of the Twenty-Second Century writing a doctorate about our time might find it useful to mention Moshe Ayalon in at least a footnote, which in my view is sufficiant reason for Wikipedia to retain the article.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 17:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>I have no real opinion on whether that article should or should not be split up. I did add a section entitled "Basic irreducible difference" stating some things which need to be mentioned on the Jewish point of view - whether this remains a single article or is split up. I think many Mormons might not fully appreciate that their accptance of Jesus might, in the Jewish view, quite outweigh any similarities that exist between their religion and Judaism. The Jewish negative attitude to Jesus is mainly due to the nasty doings of much earlier Christians, long before the rise of the Latter Day Saints (doings which were certainly contrary to the teachings of Jesus himself as expressed in the New Testament). But whatever its origin, this Jewish attitude is a fundmental fact which must be taken into account.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 12:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Adam.<br />
I'm writing to you because I have troble understanding the importance of those huge fragments of H.G. Wells "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shape_of_Things_to_Come_85b6.html" title="The Shape of Things to Come">The Shape of Things to Come</a>" (or any metion of his opinion on the subject for that matter) being inserted into the article about the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Corridor_837b.html" title="Polish Corridor">Polish Corridor</a>. Many people of the era - politicians, militarists, historians and ethnographers - wrote about the post WW I Polish German borders. Yet you chose the opinion of a science-fiction writer to occupy most of the article space. Why is it so important to you? (And if it's so important, then maybe it deserves it's own article). Because he predicted WW II? But he "predicted" an international conflict lasting till late 60's resulting in death of over 90% of the Earth's population. Although many people died in WW II it still ended 1945. I don't know if you are aware that <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> "predicted" World War One. Does that make all their reasoning true? Are you going to believe everything else they say because of that?<br />
Another important thing:<br />
Was resolving the Polish Corridor question the German way really going to stop the war?<br />
First demand of Hitler after which he promised peace was reintroduction of military conscription.<br />
Then remilitarization of Rhineland.<br />
Then incorporation of Austria.<br />
Then incorporation of Bohemia and creation of Protectorate.<br />
All those demands were met.<br />
At the same time he already started big scale dicrimination of the Jewish population of Germany.<br />
But again nobody did anything. Makes one wonder if it perhaps wasn't the weakness and undecisiveness of other countries, and their lack of any response to Hitler's actions that caused WW II.<br />
(Speaking of predictions: Polish leader Józef Piłsudski in 1934 also predicted the danger of the Nazi ruled Germany and proposed a preemptive strike to Great Britain and France, but nobody did anything.)<br />
This is of course my humble opinion, everybody has a right to have one, Science-Fiction writers too.<br />
In conclusion - I don't think the inclusion of Mr Wells' opinion (accompanied by a ton of quotes or not) into the article has any constructive purpose. I may be wrong of course. For now I'm going to remove the disputed paragraphs from the article. Maybe a better place for them would be the article about the book, I don't know. I'm open for discussion, though.

<dd>Certainly, by 1939 the Polish Corridor was no more than an excuse for Hitler and if it was not there he would have found another excuse. The point which Wells tried to make was that this - and the entire Versailles Agreement of which it was a prominent part - contributed greatly to Hitler getting power in Germany in the first place. The relevant thing for the Wikipedia article is that it gives in detail the arguments why creation of the Polish Corridor was justified, but not one word of the opposing arguments, which is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. (I get the feeling that at least some parts of the article were written by partiotic Poles, which is all right as long as theirs is not the only point of view represented.) Wells, though nowadays remembered mainly as a Science Fiction writer, was also very much of a political writer, and actually the book quoted (like much of his later writing) is more a political essay dressed up as science fiction than a true SF book. I felt that Wells presented in a logical and cogent way the case against the Polish Corridor, and that he could not be accused of pro-Nazi bias (the Nazis burned his books and placed him on the list of people to be immediately liquidated in the event of a succesful invasion of Britain). Perhaps I was too lazy in just copying and pasting the text which is available online (and which I think is well-written) and I should have just extracted the main counter-arguments and placed them in the same format as the arguments in favor of the Polish Corridor.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 17:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Adam, I was wondering whether your comments on the more recent trilogy are appropriate in an encyclopedia article. The words "seems to" suggest that this is one reader's interpretation. In order to validate this, we need something less subjective. A statement from one of the authors would be ideal. A published book review might be good enough; we could at least say "according to so-and-so."</p>
<p>If it's just your own interpretation, I grant that it's an interesting one, but there are many other places on the Internet where it should appear rather than Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarob_b082.html" title="User:Alarob">Rob C (Alarob)</a> 02:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The trilogy starts from the same premise as the Moore book and then goes off in an opposite direction. That is an objective fact which can be determined from just looking at their respective plots. I have no direct proof that it was consciously intended as such by the authors of the trilogy, and in theory you might suppose it is a pure coincidence. Still, the fact that it was published precisely fifry years after the Moore book (1953 and 2003) plus the fact that the Moore book is a classic in the subgenre of Civil War alternate history, which is likely to be known to anybody writing new books of the kind, seems to be at least "circumastantial evidence". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 10:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your work improved the article a fair bit. I did some work on the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prabowo.html" title="Prabowo">Prabowo</a> article, but i think it is still a problem.

<dd>Adam, the best place I can suggest for good sources is a library - ha ha. As for the internet, non spring to mind straight away but my recommendation is for something academic and scholarly. On such a controversial figure like Prabowo, there is bound to be a lot of sensationalist but poor quality sites around. I have a new book called Indonesian Destinies by Theodore Friend that has a lot of Prabowo refs in the index. But Prabowo is far from my wiki priority at the moment. How about you post a message in this board here asking for ideas: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. In the meantime, i will try but not promise to see what is in that book. Maybe in the meantime have a look at what can be found in google. I find though that the best journal sources are "locked" in online databases which one must either pay for or have a subscription. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 14:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

Unfortunatly, I don't see any reason to assume that I would have a chance to visit a library in the next two or three months (at a conservative restimate). I have a quite busy life, I can do things on Wikipedia in odd feww moments in between a big load of other work done on the computer, often late at night. I have no practical possibility to go and spend hours travelling to and from the Tel-Aviv University Libarary (the nearest worthwhile university to my home) and many more hours doing serious research in the library - much as I would have loved doing it for this and may other subjects. In practical terms, I am restricted to whatcan be located online. Will try to take yur advice and posst arequest for help at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Indonesia#Re-activating_the_project" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_keller_8606.html" title="User:Adam keller">Adam keller</a> 14:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your edits and updates to the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarwo_Edhie_Wibowo_6b4e.html" title="Sarwo Edhie Wibowo">Sarwo Edhie Wibowo</a> article, I have updated the 'Act of Free Choice'. You will find addition information and links to various source references from <a href="http://wpik.org" class="external free" title="http://wpik.org" rel="nofollow">http://wpik.org</a> , and in the Introduction text of that page you will see a linked quote from the US Dept. of State Summary "pro-Indonesia group at the White house" - on that page you will find some preliminary information about the three gentlemen in question. Elsewhere in the Kit you will find a listing of New York Times articles about Indonesia and its efforts to gain West Papua, as well as many other reports by various groups. I would greatly appreciate if you could help update various Wikipedia articles with more concise and informative edits. Thank you for your efforts.

<p>Unfortunately Merbabu has struck again, deleting the below from the article.</p>

<dd>I have no specific issue with the text - in fact, i barely read it. My point is there is no references. Yes, I know Indonesia articles are on the whole extremely poorly referenced and this is one of the wikipedia fundamentals. But that is no reason to continue adding unreferenced material. Isn't it easier to add the references as you go rather than expect someone else to do it after you. By removing (what can be replaced anyway) i figured it might inspire you to put in some citations and <i>preferably</i> from an academic source rather than a political/advocacy/govt (or anything else with possible dual interests). As for "striking again", if you have an issue, I am always happy to discuss. IMO, there is no need to whisper behind my back, so to speak. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 13:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
