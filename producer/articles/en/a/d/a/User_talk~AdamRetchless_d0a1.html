<p>Adam -- Never, never, NEVER delete Talk pages. They can be archived, but don't delete them. I've reverted <a href="../../../p/a/t/Talk%7EPatent_1880.html" title="Talk:Patent">Talk:Patent</a>. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I've deleted a few talk pages in my time, but only when the discussion was both amicable and concluded, acted on, and obsolete. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">KQ</a>
<dl>
<dd>They really should be archived instead of deleted. But Adam did it unilaterally, claiming all discussion was moot. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I noticed that he did. But do you really think <i>all</i> talk should be archived? Imagine the following exchange on the talk page for, say, Stephen King: "Good coverage of his work. Shouldn't we talk about his family, too; he doesn't spend *all* his time in from of the computer. --AxelBoldt" // "Yeh, isn't his wife named Samantha or something? --KQ" // "No, actually it's Tabitha. --mav" // "I added a short paragraph mentioning his wife Tabitha, who's also a writer, as well as his children, who are all moved out and living independently now --Zoe" // "Nice work, Zoe, thanks! --AxelBoldt" // "Yeh, nice work, Zoe, thanks. &#160;:-) --KQ" // "No problem. --Zoe"</dd>
<dd>If I came across those bits above and visited the article &amp; saw that the paragraph added seemed perfectly unobjectionable, then I'd have no compunction in deleting the talk. Leaving it, to me, would be like starting a collection of Post-It Notes in wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">KQ</a></dd>

<p>Hi Adam, thanks for the comment on my talk page and your various edits. I think I've noticed your user name before. Is your research related to RNA, by any chance? (Mine is, in case that wasn't apparent from my edit history.)</p>

<p>Hi Adam. Haven't met you before -- just wanted to say, I didn't know if the anonymous user who changed your user page was you. If it was, sorry for reverting! Just revert back. I assume that anonymous edits to someone's user page are vandalism (and they are, 90%+ of the time), so that's why I reverted them. Hope I did the right thing.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:26, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Jwrosenzweig, I did in fact make those edits. However, I do appreciate your vigilace. I had been worried that someone would think it was vandalism, but I thought the nature of the edits would be innocuous enough to pass. Anyway, no harm done. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 23:46, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh yeah, deleting a big paragraph is not necessarily innocuous. Good call. -adam (two minutes later)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for being understanding.&#160;:-) Should I remember that IP (i.e., is it your static IP?) if it makes edits to your user page in the future, or should I revert anons here regardless?

<dd>Don't bother memorizing the IP address... it would change regularly. I'll probably avoid making changes without signing in. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 21:36, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I collect very different and interesting plants. I don't really have any flowers however my mother keeps a garden.</p>
<p>Your Number six is definately a Daffodil and number one and seven are probably Daffodils too. The taxonomy of Daffodils is quite large but they are all of the Narcissus family. Number 8 also could be a Narcissus hybrid. Number two is definately a type of violet (viola genus) the common violet is viola papilionacea but yours is too blue. Number 5 is prolly a forget-me-not (myosotis scorpioides). Number nine is a wild pansy (Viola tricolor). My mother thinks the number three is a clematis but no confirmation is possible. We don't have any idea what the number 4 is.</p>

<p>The Wikipedian community has saw fit to delete The Classical definition of republic. I found more corraborating evidence and, on the Votes for Undeletion, They are still voting to keep it deleted. I think this is highly unfair. Is there a cabal going around voting things off that they don't like? I have put external link to Wikinfo:Classical definition of republic and they delete that also. It has been deleted twice from <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>. What's going on here? Wikipedia is not "Free and Open-Content". There is a group controlling what gets said around here. I have been reading about "Republics" all my life. I even quote from a Modern Scholary work that used the term "Classical Republic". And they still delete. Something is not right here. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Wikipedian community has saw fit to delete The Classical definition of republic. I found more corraborating evidence and, on the Votes for Undeletion, They are still voting to keep it deleted. I think this is highly unfair. Is there a cabal going around voting things off that they don't like? I have put external link to Wikinfo:Classical definition of republic and they delete that also. It has been deleted twice from <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>. What's going on here? Wikipedia is not "Free and Open-Content". There is a group controlling what gets said around here. I have been reading about "Republics" all my life. I even quote from a Modern Scholary work that used the term "Classical Republic". And they still delete. Something is not right here. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:23, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Still, I am no expert in Indian history of Hinduism, so I never really tried to push the point in the discussion of Hinduism, or to edit the page.

<dl>
<dd>I wanted to try and write something in first person as best I could. Independance rightly reduces to one, upon which a constitution for many must lawfully stand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hold, that a Declaration of Independence is a "living" document. It must be restated, reworded, translated, transmitted... all simply striving toward a perfection untenable. Of such value to humankind, that it should remain as task in perpetuity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To all those who may try: To ignore Declarations of Independence, written or spoken Constitutions, Bills of Human Rights. I say to ignore, burn and trample you may with all your might. Yes, with all your might, even should you strike me down.</p>
<p>For it is my capacity infinite to declare, to write, to acknowledge anew, these truths self-evident. Drawn from a spirit which burns within me, the same spirit which burns within all humankind, burning within countless hearts and as common as the stars burning in Heaven.</p>
<p>My covenant with Humankind, Earth, and the Heavens Universe.....</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that good people may find themselves outside the jurisdictions of states such as Montana, Maine, Vermont, Hawaii, Alaska or other such places affirming the declarations of independence, constitutions, and bills of rights; Good People everywhere are invited to declare their independence from all who may otherwise infringe.</p>
<p>This is one of infinite examples, to remind authority of my right to independence. A Wiki of The Unwashed Masses Constitution, with Rights innumerable, and a Rule Golden to humankind.</p>
<p>Self evident, although worth repeating:</p>
<p>Any sovereign, which may naturally be reduced to even a single Individual, irrevocably possesses a collection of Rights, (de jure ab initio ad infinitum).</p>
<p>Among these many inalienable rights are included such joys as Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
<p>Whether boisterously proclaimed from mountain tops, quietly whispered to a lone fellow, silently thought of deep within the mind, or even should it fail to enter one single neuron, these Rights may never be revoked, rescinded, nor abandoned without recovery.</p>
<p>ONLY in cases brought through findings by a rightful jury and unfailing due process, wherein an otherwise enjoyed right has been infringed, may a sovereign be otherwise infringed. (this is also known as the Golden Rule for short, and a measure by which to gage verdicts seeking balance between violation and reparation)</p>
<p>To offer the future reader, or contestants at law, an idea of this authors demands, to illustrate concepts of common good, and to hint at only a few of the items found in an innumerable Bill of Human Birth Rights such as:</p>
<p>The Right to air. The Right to water. The Right to flora and fauna sustenance. The Right to contract, commerce, trade and barter without adheasion, nor clause obscurity. The Right to a given name, to an alias, to privacy and even to flawless anonymity not used in evasion of the Golden Rule. The Right to rome, to circle, to locate, to settle and resettle. The Right to swim, to walk, to fly, to orbit, to journey and certainly The Right to voyage endless. The Right to be informed by anyone. The Right to inform anyone. The Right to see. The Right to hear. The Right to think. The Right to say.</p>
<p>Infringements upon such Rights as these may find one, or many, called before civil or criminal contests at law. As humankind is also known to be reactionary in cases where survival becomes thrown into harried doubt, cognizant trespasses or even transgressions absent of malice, may trigger defenses whether balanced or otherwise.</p>
<p>Thus remains this Constitutions most sobering item; For every member of Humankind, a word supremely void of any recognition to meanings such as sex, race, age, creed nor any brand of mental wanderings, ALL of us posses the full spectrum between a loving humanity, and a hateful decrepitude.</p>
<p>Is this not our Truth inescapable?</p>
<p>For if We can not be given freewill by other men, then it must be inherent or by Heavenly Spirit. To choose for ourselves, or as individuals together, weather to kill our fellow humanity in unGodly fratricide, or whether to simply infringe upon our fellow humanity at great risk to its unbounded defense.</p>
<p>Or We can choose to imagine into Being such dreams as peace and love, enterprise and prosperity, maybe even a small ray of heaven for every last rider upon this tiny blue globe.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So to grow the Unwashed Wiki Constitution, I have a few more ideas to add:</p>
<p>Since many of mans predilections involve "contests", from simple child games to athletics, business to prosperity, once survival dilemmas (real or imagined) inter the playing field... man becomes quite "natural" in contests of War.</p>
<p>And as War is so easy for man to make, and disturbingly easy for some men (maybe less driven by rightful survival, but rather Greed?) So naturally a War-Maker would try and convince "other" men to make War in his stead, thus cunningly spill benefit back to the first man.</p>
<p>Since humankind inseparably carries the dualities of Love and Hate, War and Peace, Light and Dark... Then I offer that our Constitution fully embrace these dualities, and for the reader of the future, or re-writer, or even the autodidact Phenix rising in otherwise isolation and declaring ones independence...</p>
<p>That We can also choose between contests of the sword, or brilliantly impressive contests of the pen.</p>
<p>So this is a clarion call... Try as one might to ignore the Phenix-like spirit of free people, to ignore history and all her lessons, to ignore the guns, shouts, whispers, or even silence of Humankind and her love of Life.... this is a clarion for the never ending War of the Pen.</p>
<p>To exercise, show, and demonstrate that love of independence, freedom, and liberty are as natural and spiritual to all humankind, as is looking to the heavens and asking God, "why?"</p>
<p><br />
Note: This think tank is simply a current forum, however We shall never be dependent upon it or any such construct. That people will always come and go, some will hold high freedoms documents as others will burn them. This is no matter, humankind carries within her the Phenix of Liberty. Will always, and forever, give rebirth to the Truths Self Evident.</p>
