	    <p>Hey, do you mind if I put your picture of Marathon inside of a table? I was going to fix up the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Marathon_775b.html" title="Battle of Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a> article to match the other WikiProject Battles (with the template and such). If I did that though, it would need to be smaller, but with a link to the larger picture of course. I just thought I should ask first since it's your picture&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 01:00, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we called it the Roman Empire all the way through to 1453, that might be a little confusing...it's not centred on Rome, they don't speak Latin, they aren't pagan, and by 1453 at least they don't have much in common at all with the old empire. I know they considered themselves Romans, as did the rest of Europe unless it interfered with some political consideration, but I think in this case the 19th century historians are right to use a different name.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you have more pictures to add, that would be great! Would you happen to have a picture of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistra.html" title="Mistra">Mistra</a>? I found some good ones but none of them were public domain... <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 03:33, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, good work on various articles. (It is nice having another PhD about the place.) Can I please urge you to desist from making critical personal comments about Lir. You appear to aware of the past history there. (I was one of his major critics.) However since coming back he has been IMHO genuinely trying to put his past behind him and simply work on articles. In doing so he has impressed a number of his former critics, including <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a>, who was a very outspoken critic of his in the past but is a strong supporter of his work since his return. Given that there are some on wikipedia who have what they feel are scores to settle with Lir, I think it wise to avoid becoming the vehicle that triggers off another Lir war. Some people think he has not changed and is simply biding his time. I disagree and do believe, to use that old catholic phrase, that he has a 'firm purpose of amendment'. But I think the guy needs space to be allowed to prove himself. After the roasting he got in the past he is highly defensive at the moment. Perhaps his critics are right, but I don't think so, and do believe he is trying to do the right thing. But it would be a great pity is someone of his ability ended up driven from wikipedia by criticism of what happened many months ago, even though he has not repeated that behaviour and is trying to put it behind him. Basically, give the guy space at the moment. By all means be critical of specific edits you disagree with, but don't make generalised judgmental statements about him, for in the current climate, they risk bringing those with old scores they wish to settle back onto the talk pages to ignite Lir War III and driving the guy away. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 04:24, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh the joys of historiography. I am a history nut and can be driven mad by attempts at biased history on wikipedia, as you saw with <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>. I am expecting the cowpat to hit the fan next on <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a>, given that Erik, as well as his <i>thing</i> about MT, also has a <i>thing</i> about PP. Neither MT nor PP are exactly favourites of mine, but trying to use neutral language and balanced content is and Erik's 'case for the prosecution' style, though well meaning, can be infuriating to professional historians. Turning <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> from a hotch-potch of nutty theories and agendas into a proper encyclopædic article was a nightmare, with even left wing athiests like <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a> horrified at the POVs being pushed. (And neutrality, of course, interpreted as 'censoring truth', ie, the agenda-pushing analysis of one side or the other.)</p>
<p>Maybe, if you get the chance, you might look up <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a> and give it an academic analysis. It needs more <i>properly researched</i> evidence from the critics, as opposed to the current mention of one discredited play. And its defenders section makes statements that may be fact or well written spin by a Pius defender; which, I'm not sure until I can do more research. I've simply added in stuff from good quality sources that I have been able to lay my hands on. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 05:28, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>It was only after I had had a go at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> that I noticed your intention to edit it. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have gotten involved. However, having done so, I found I had to revert a number of large deletions by <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlun_Ephraim_e355.html" title="User:Alun Ephraim">Alun</a>, who made the text exceedingly Anglocentric (an improvement?!?!), adding bits that were badly written and/or wrong. He then undid many of my changes, and I tried once again to merge everything. As it now stands, <i>virtually</i> all of the previous text plus his contributions are joined together, not always smoothly. As you will seen in the Talk page, I have implored him not to make any more deletions without discussing things first.</p>
<p>I have a favor to ask of you: now I know you are a superb writer and editor, and I know that many articles here have had too many authors and need a strong hand, and I don't want to cramp your style, but could you please tread judiciously in this case? As you will see if you review the recent Talk messages, I am trying to make Alun understand that he can't be quite so single-minded, that has to edit more circumspectly, and that he has to discuss major deletions. He is a young -- 16 -- and doesn't have a very highly developed sense of his own limitations. Hence, could I ask you, if you plan to delete any paragraphs or sections, to list them on Talk with your reasons? I know it is cumbersome but we need to set a good example.</p>
<p>I hope the article doesn't undergo any further bizarre mutations from the time I post this to the time you start working on it. I look forward to seeing what you do with it!</p>

<dd>Alun is certainly keen but doesn't have a fully developed understanding of NPOV. His article on the history of British Socialism is appalling, for example and reads like an authorised history of the Labour Party. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 11:22, Oct 31, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're welcome. Since reverting occasional vandalism is so easy, I don't think it makes much of a difference whether user pages are protected or not; the end effect is the same.

And sometimes friendly people do make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Menchi&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Menchi&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">useful alterations</a> to one's user page. -- <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> 04:55, 30 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't understand what GH is saying to be honest. If it was part of the history of Poland, I can't see why he objects to it being in the article about the history of Poland. Anyway, I'm not getting involved in a history fight. You historians are too scary.

<p>I have absolutely no recollection of editing any of your conversations with Szopen, nor does my "user contributions" page indicate that I have done so. What are you referring to? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 09:37, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Adam</p>
<p>I am afraid, your knowledge about Holocaust in Poland is highly POV. I oppose putting nonsenses about eternal Polish anti-Semitism as NPOV. To build the true picture one must take into account very complicated mixture of Nazi crimes, Soviet crimes, Polish resistance and Polish-Jewish tensions, including anti-Semitism. Have you ever read "Sofie's Choice"? It is excellent book, and gives balanced kicks everyone. However, it doesn't take into account problem of responsibility for communism, that is so complicated problem, that nobody yet wrote nothing resambling balanced view.</p>
<p>After all, you can blame Poles from Jewish POV, and dead Jews can be blamed from Polish POV, but the NPOV is that both nations suffered terribly from the hands of Nazis. I am not sure if you are able to write something NPOV, so maybe both sides should blame each other, so we have more then one POV. Better then nothing.</p>
<p>What you don't understand for sure, is that <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Government_f91e.html" title="General Government">General Government</a> is not the name of German administration in Poland, but it is the name of German colony, that consists of about 30% area of Poland. Putting the description of the administrative divisions of the whole Poland, to General Government make equal sense to putting administrative divisions of Britsh Empire to article about England alone.</p>
<p>However, you are right, that those description, that doesn't apply to GG should be removed form GG. (Please do it). <a href="../../../g/h/_/User%7EGH_3bfb.html" title="User:GH">GH</a></p>
<p>Huh - I have absolutely no memory of doing that - nor do I have any idea why I would do that. I'd also note that if you check out my "user contributions" page, it doesn't show said edit. Apologies if I did somehow do it, but I really have no idea how that came about. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 21:17, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm...I'm not sure how it would then appear in the article history as though I'd done it, though...it's all very strange. I do recall <i>looking</i> at the Szopen talk page, but I certainly have no memory of reverting (or of typing in an edit summary about reverting, which indicates that it can't have been done inadvertently). Very strange... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 19:33, 2 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Liked your addition to Poetry re the Greek: maybe it would be useful to add the old English <i>scop</i>, which shares a root with the modern 'shape'? Cheers <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 11:15, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suppose I was thinking that while the Greek is the direct root of the English words, the concept of the poet as Old English scop/shaper, Scots makar/maker is a common thread in many European traditions (although the Irish file is cognate with 'to see'). So that the idea is not just Greek, but also vernacular? <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 13:37, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam. Sorry it took me so long to get back. We have a major new exhibition opening in my Museum on Monday, so I don't know whether I am coming or going. As for the Armenian quote: I remember reading somewhere that it is one of the "urban legends of the Holocaust" and that Hitler never really said it. I do not know, but I have been unable in the little time I have to track the source of the quote either. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 00:01, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the Armenians, please see <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Adamthwaite219.jpg">p219</a>, <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Adamthwaite220.jpg">p220</a>, and <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Adamthwaite221.jpg">p221</a> which I extracted from amazon.com (told you it was a useful resource). Then please ask Danny to hard-delete them as they are a possible copyright issue. I'd want to look at the paper of Koch cited on p219 before saying anything about the authenticity. However it does seem that this "speech" appeared during the war and its provenance is an issue. I should have just left for a week away from home so I'll leave this in your hands. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 00:58, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adam, the work on the translation is great but <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not a place for source texts</a>. It really needs to be placed at <a href="http://ps.wikipedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://ps.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Wikisource</a>. Are you aware of the discussion of the same article at the Polish Wikipedia? It is at <a href="../../../../pl/p/r/o/Dyskusja_%C5%BAr%C3%B3de%C5%82%7EProtest_Zofii_Kossak-Szczuckiej_338a.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Dyskusja_źródeł:Protest_Zofii_Kossak-Szczuckiej">Dyskusja źródeł:Protest Zofii Kossak-Szczuckiej</a> if you are interested. I was not able to understand the whole discussion but it seems to have been decided to implement a Źródła (Sources) namespace instead of moving the text to Wikisource. I was speaking to Taw about it and it seems the namespace is preferred over ps because the interface of ps is in English. I think the article on the English Wikipedia should be an explanation of what the document is with a link to the full text at the Wikisource address. I appreciate the work that you and GH are putting into the translation, but it is best that this is moved to a proper location. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 21:37, Nov 5, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't entirely understand your point about not existing term <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubus.html" title="Lubus">Lubus</a> in English. If you write let say an article about the geography of China. If the name of the province doesn't exists in English, you simply should adopt local name. In the matter of fact, some territories that were taken over by Poland after WWII in the West, didn't belong either to Pomerania or Silesia, but they were known under term <i>Ziemia Lubuska</i> when they belonged to Poland. The term is also mentioned in the German vikipedia see Neumark. Before WWII they belonged to Brandenburg province, but Brandenburg is located even West from Berlin. The best idea is to introduce the term <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubus.html" title="Lubus">Lubus</a> that is even the name of Polish Voivodship. <a href="../../../g/h/_/User%7EGH_3bfb.html" title="User:GH">GH</a></p>
<p>I don't agree. In English these territories are generally known by their German names. My pre-war German atlas tells me that all the annexed territories were in East Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg or Silesia. English-speaking readers don't need to know their historical Polish names <i>in this article.</i> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:39, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Pasted from Talk:John Howard)</p>
<p>It may come as a shock to some, but society is divided along lines of class, and different classes tend to have different views about political issues because they have different interests in those issues. It has been one of the most consistent facts of Australian political history that the majority of working-class Australians have been opposed to immigration, because of the belief that immigrants take jobs from Australian workers. This belief may be true or false, but it is idle to deny that the belief is widespread (see <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_Policy_da7a.html" title="White Australia Policy">White Australia Policy</a>. The central fact about the 2001 election was Howard's success in using the Tampa issue to arouse working-class fears about immigration (in this case illegal immigration) and using this to drive a wedge between the two parts of the ALP's base, the working class and the middle class left. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:19, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but was the ALP's election loss the result of John Howard's scaremongering or Kim Beazley's failure to adequately respond? Or a combination of both? Gosh politics is a complicated thing. I can't believe I even considered a career in politics. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Ryan_e158.html" title="User:Mark Ryan">Mark Ryan</a> 04:32, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beazley succeeded in persuading the majority of working-class voters that an ALP govt would take an equally strong line on illegal immigration. (It was after all the ALP govt which introduced mandatory detention). If Beazley had taken the Carmen Lawrence line, the ALP would have lost 20 seats rather than the four they did lose. The price he paid for that was that large numbers of middle-class ALP voters voted Green instead, but since most of those votes came back as preferences that cost the ALP no seats. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:43, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You sound like you don't think Carmen Lawrence's election as President of the ALP would be good bad thing for the party. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Ryan_e158.html" title="User:Mark Ryan">Mark Ryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The ALP has a fundamental problem in that its activist core is mostly from the middle-class left, while a large part of its voting base is still from the traditional working class. In opposition the activists are dragging the party to the left, a trend Crean is too weak to resist. Lawrence polled 8,000 votes, but there are probably a million voters who the ALP has lost since 1993. The activists have indulged themselves by electing Lawrence president, but the ALP won't win an election until it has a leader who can take the party back to where its voters are. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:56, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you noticed that Simon Creane doesn't really smile? Like, even when he does smile, his eyes don't smile. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Ryan_e158.html" title="User:Mark Ryan">Mark Ryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I've always thought (speaking as an ALP member) that Crean was a hopeless loser. He's only still in the job because the left are propping him up for fear of having Beazley back. Beazley is the only Labor leader the electorate likes or trusts, but I guess we will now have to let Crean lose us another election before we can get rid of him. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I've never really liked Kim Beazley, from what I've seen of him. He reminds me an awful lot of Paul Keating, since both of them (along with Peter Costello) are the sorts of politicians who think that they are serving their electorates by standing up in parliament and acting like small children. I have nothing terribly against Paul Keating, since his economic reforms were excellent, but I like Prime Ministers more like Bob Hawke... slightly placid and more like a Statesman. The seemingly overbearing attitude of Kim Beazley reminds me a lot of the bully in the playground in primary school: dominant, scary and homophobic. Not exactly the sort of people I like. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Ryan_e158.html" title="User:Mark Ryan">Mark Ryan</a></dd>

<p>Having met KB several times I can assure you that is a very mistaken impression. He is as scary as my teddy-bear, extremely intelligent, very funny, with a strong social conscience.

<p>In regards to unprecedented set of falsehoods about me the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Talk%7EZionism_e758.html" title="Talk:Zionism">Talk:Zionism</a> page, you need to be aware that Zero0000 and Danny have a personal animosity towards me. Zero0000 has been angry at me when I called him on his past gross statements towards Jews (he repeatedly claimed that public death threats to mass-murder Jews does not count as anti-Semitism.) I would strongly urge you not to believe a word they say about me; as I hope you can see for yourself, they are fabricating positions I do not have, and ruthlessly attacking for them. Zero0000's latest statements are not only incorrect, but paranoid. This is grossly dishonest behaviour, and it causes me to question all the other things they have written. I don't care if people disagree with me, but fabricating positions I do not have, and insulting me for such non-existent positions, obviously makes any form of cooperation impossible. I am uncertain of how much longer I can stay on Wikipedia if I repeatedly harassed in this fashion. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:37, Nov 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
