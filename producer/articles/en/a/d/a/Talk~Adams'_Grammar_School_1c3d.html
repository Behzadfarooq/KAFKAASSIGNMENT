<p>they are successfull in their field and should be included.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would suggest citing them; link their name on the page to the NME article, maybe. Or, perhaps, create a proper Wikipedia page for Ripchord themselves, and see how that stands regarding vanity pages, etc. If it's OK-ed, then they can stay, and the names can link through to the page, rather than being un-linked text. Don't take me as gospel, mind, I'm no huge contributor myself, so I might be suggesting something that'll just annoy everyone. Still, it's worth a thought, and things are easier to justify on here if they have proper links and references. --JTA 18:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You obviously have a different view of success to me. I would have thought being successful would have meant at least one charting Top 40 (at the very very bare minimum). There are a lot of signed bands around who go nowhere and do nothing but fade into obscurity - I really don't see how Ripchord, The Fight or the Raging Palmsta's are any different. To justify inclusion because of an appearance in a low circulation newspaper is preposterous. I say Ripchord should go along with the Raging Palmsta's and the Fight. -- GN

<li>Unofficially, Talbot used to have the Talbot family Crest, but I imagine that's gone by the board in the absence of BKB... O, and just for referrence: Talbot's Gryffindor, Darwin's Slytherin, Clive's Ravenclaw, and Webb's Hufflepuff.

<li>Oooh, I remember now that at the end of year 7 for me (thats <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>) Mr Hadley determined that the Webb symbol was, in honour of our departing house captain Geoff Worth, the Worth family crest, and that the motto was to be simply "Worth". However neither ever caught on, and it would have been our year (the class of 2005) who would be the last generation of pupils to remember this. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 17:49, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a crest on the Talbot noticeboard, but it was stuck on, on a piece of laminated paper... I know because I looked after the board for the past year or so. And is it just me, or was Talbot named after John Talbot, not Charles Talbot? Maybe JTA may be able to help me on this, he was in Talbot too...</li>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChingwakabungya_6f6e.html" title="User:Chingwakabungya">Neil Fairbrother</a></p>
<p>Yep. Sir John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury - fought at Agincourt, I think. Charles Talbot was much later; we're named after the original guy, who died in battle in France and whose soldier's were so devoted to him they stood over his body fighting back the French 'till the end of the battle, so he could be taken away and buried on English soil. (See, I paid attention in BKB's assemblies...) Dunno who on earth Charles Talbot is, though. Mister JTA</p>

<dd>1) In answer to your question on the history page, Adams Grammar School has not always been called Adams Grammar School. In the same way that Monmouth Grammar School changed its name to become Monmouth School in the 1970's or Shrewsbury Grammar School became Shrewsbury School, Adams has changed its name. Being known at various times as Newport School (not to be&#160;::confused with various American namesakes or the one in Monmouthshire), Newport Grammar School (not to be confused with its namesake in Essex), Newport Free School, Newport Free Grammar School, even the Latin School at Newport Salop (as the former victorian headmaster Tom Collins called it). So it is very possible to have a school called Newport School that was refounded in 1656.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally you will notice that this school founded in 1442 was given Â£5 from the revenues of Crown land in 1581 which continued to be received by Adams after 1656 - that is a fairly obvious link. It is also not terribly difficult to see that Adams might be on the same site, it is across the road from a church, all schools of the time would have been strongly linked to the church and later accounts of Adams list the Curate as receiving a salary from the school. Thus Adams would have been very similar in constitution to the previous school - but with a greater endowment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not unknown for schools, universities or businesses to merge and claim the oldest date of foundation. Aside from that it states that Adams was refounded in 1656. The re being rather significant, no? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.134.html" title="User:205.188.116.134">205.188.116.134</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.116.134.html" title="User talk:205.188.116.134">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.116.134_b2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.116.134">contribs</a>) 01:26, 7 March 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

</dd>

<p>The school claims its date of founding to be 1656 (see the very top of the schools' <a href="http://www.adamsgs.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.adamsgs.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">website</a>). (This is quite siginifcant as thousands are currently being spent on 350th anniversary celebrations). As far as I can tell the evidence you present is very circumstantial and this source appears to date from the C18th. Once again, I will revert this statement until someone can verify this.</p>
<p>The definitive history of the school is a book called "Mr Adams' Free Grammar School" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1860772218</a>) by David and Ruth Taylor. Someone should get this. (but not me, I'm a poor student)--<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 21:16, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I'm going to revert this for the third and final time <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Please don't take that as an insult, I present my reasons below:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page has suffered a large amount of vandalism and so I am very suspicious of any edit I can't verify. The shred of evidence you present is not enough to convince me that the school which for seven years I walked through gates with "1656" marked on them to enter every weekday, is over 200 years older than this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, the IP which you had when you made your edit, which appears to be an AOL IP address, has been frequently used to commit vandalism. I would be more able to trust the edits of someone who has a registered account and can see that they have a history of useful contributions to Wikipedia. As an AOL user whose IP address changes frequently it is impossible to track down an edit history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to echo Drw25's comments above. Please give hard and not circumstantial evidence to make such a bold claim. Evidence the 1656 only stance can be found on the school's page and also the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2005/03/30/newport_town_guide_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2005/03/30/newport_town_guide_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC Shropshire Town guide</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Another notable building in Newport is Adamsâ€™ Grammar School. The school was founded by William Adams, a merchant haberdasher, in 1665.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="http://www.haberdashers.co.uk/Haberdashers/education/ADAMSGRAMMARSCHOOL.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.haberdashers.co.uk/Haberdashers/education/ADAMSGRAMMARSCHOOL.asp" rel="nofollow">Haberdashers' website</a> also uses language which does not support the re-founding hypothesis:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>William Adams, a merchant Haberdasher with family connections in Shropshire, established his school in Newport, Shropshire in 1656 during the Interregnum, with permission from Oliver Cromwell.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short I have never seen any evidence that supports what you say. I have seen plently of evidence that appears to contradict it. Please provide evidence. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 21:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Luke's stance on this. I too was highly suspicious for exactly the same reasons. It would be odd for the school to suggest its founding year was 200 years after the true date. I thought I'd remark that the revert previous to Luke's was from the same IP address as many of the 'Shamrock Pirates' edits, so don't blame the original contributor for it! I may be able to locate Dr. Taylor's book using the library in which I work, or alternatively I could always get the copy from the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodleian_Library_1cf5.html" title="Bodleian Library">Bod</a> next term... â€“ <a href="../../../d/r/w/User%7EDrw25_6c73.html" title="User:Drw25">drw25</a> <a href="../../../d/r/w/User_talk%7EDrw25_ca31.html" title="User talk:Drw25">(talk)</a> 03:03, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually there was a separate school founded in Newport in 1442 by Thomas Draper - it was attached to a St. Mary's Guild/College/(St. Marys Road/Street?)- it became The Royal English Free School at some point and then ceased to exist in 1879.</p>

<p>I've just removed a couple of questionable alumni from the list - one person listed as having won the "I AM A TWAT" prize, another for being a champion of some video game. Also, the last few entries on the alumni list are not in alphabetical order. I would have fixed it but I'm not at all certain they're actually notable enough to be included in the list in the first place. Help?</p>

<li>My opinion is that <a href="http://www.ripchord.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.ripchord.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Ripchord</a> are notable, because they're signed to a real record label. Although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ripchord&amp;diff=89711985&amp;oldid=89701760" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ripchord&amp;diff=89711985&amp;oldid=89701760" rel="nofollow">last time</a> somebody wrote an article about them, they were deemed non-notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fight_c8c7.html" title="The Fight">The Fight</a> already survived VfD. Not convinced about Denatured, though - Google doesn't bring up anything about them. I'll alphabeticise the list with Ripchord in and Denatured out. â€“ <a href="../../../d/r/w/User%7EDrw25_6c73.html" title="User:Drw25">drw25</a> <a href="../../../d/r/w/User_talk%7EDrw25_ca31.html" title="User talk:Drw25">(talk)</a> 15:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
