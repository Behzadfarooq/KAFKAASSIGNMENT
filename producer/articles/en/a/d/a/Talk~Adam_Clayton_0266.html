<p>It is an incontrovertable fact that Clayton is British. He was born in Britain to British parents, retains UK citizenship and a UK passport. He does not hold an Irish passport nor dual citizenship. So please do not delete his nationality or replace with "Irish" as just happened. 86.7.208.240 23:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As with The Edge's entry, be prepared for a long and bitter fight dude. The Irish brigade run Wiki's biographical entries, and even if you win the argument that Clayton is British they'll just find a way of not mentioning it, or including it as an aside in a later sentence (even though they insist U2 as a band must always be referred to prominently as "Irish"). It's a continuing and never-ending joke and I'm sick of it: I used to have an account but now prefer to edit anonymously (I travel a lot so have different IPs) because I was pi**ed off with the Irish brigade hassling me over the subject. I even had one member tell me Eddie Murphy was absolutely Irish-American - "just look at his surname!"..... 195.92.40.49 12:29, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suppose the best way to end this is to cite a source taht says so. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristbg_52e5.html" title="User:Kristbg">Kristbg</a> 12:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If the man was born in Britain to British parents, has a British passport and citizenship, does not hold an Irish passport or citizenship, and has never said he is Irish and not British (all undisputed facts), why does it need to be cited? What needs to be cited is any claim that he is NOT British or that he claims to be Irish, because no-one has ever come up with a shred of evidence to support this (apart from telling us what they <i>think</i> The Edge and Clayton believe or feel). And yet, despite this, editors refuse any edit which ends up in the term "British" being used to describe him, but lately I am the only one who removes the word "Irish" when others add it (why don't they rush to delete this too? More anecdotal evidence to support various claims of bias). See discussions at.....</li>

<li>So you say he has never said he is not British or that he is Irish? Ie, you actually mean you have no citation for this. But nor can you show citation where he says he is British and not Irish - only citing his passport, which could be for all manner of reasons, to say that he keeps it cos he thinks he is Brtish is also opinion only. No, no-one from memory said it was about "feeling" and "thinking", they did however (and you did not) point out that he has lived in Ireland appox 40 of his 45 years.</li>
<li>The opinion that he is not British or that he claims he is Irish does not need to be cited as you request, for the simple reason that this not in the article. We need to focus on the article in these discussions, not personal views held by editors that are not being pushed into articles. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 01:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Here's an idea. Try reading a string before replying. The point about the citation was a response to the previous post in this string. What is wrong with you? <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.17.246.29.html" title="User:86.17.246.29">86.17.246.29</a> 00:00, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps <b>you</b> need to re-read my last post which was in response to yours previously before that. You asked for the claim he is not British to be cited, yet it is not even in the article. (Nor is the claim he is Irish as I have repeatedly said I am not pushing to have in the <b>article</b>).</li>
<li>Even if I did misread your post (I am not), all editors are required to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. At least learn some manners (on top of your continuted claims of "malice" on my behalf) or i suggest you need to find a site more appropriate for your style. I shouldn't expect more; an anonymous, single-issue editor.</li>
<li>Now if you haven't got anything new to add to the discussion on <b>the article</b>, and not your perception of me as an editor, maybe you should give it a rest. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 00:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It says that he seemed to be the only one not married or in a steady relationship, and then in the next line that his fiance and he had been dating for ten years. Isn't that a "steady relationship?"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I guess since the mid-1990's is fairly "steady" - but given that two of the others are with the women they met in high school (the mid-70s) and the third is divorced (with kids) from a women he met in high school, mid-90s is only "recent" by U2 standards.

<p>why does this article say nothing about his engadgement to naomi campell in the early 90's?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, a good thought. I think the article should mention her, but i removed your recent addition cos linking the break up to his acholism is pure speculation.
