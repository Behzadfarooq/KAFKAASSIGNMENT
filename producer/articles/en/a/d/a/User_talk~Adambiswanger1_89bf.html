<p>In your last edit summary, you said <i>We can't downplay how graphic and, well, sick some of this stuff is. That would be like saying "people died in WWII"</i>. Please note the following: giving something (in this case a press release) undue weight is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (a press release is not exactly a world war); a link to the press release is sufficient for those readers who want details; and there is a CAMPAIGN article to discuss the campaign (notice the "main article" tag at the beginning of the section); that is where details are supposed to go. The campaign section in the Webb article is supposed to be a high-level summary.</p>
<p>I'm also posting somewhat similar comments on the talk page; feel free to respond there or here, or both; I'm not going to mention your edit summary there, however. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 13:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi John. There seems to be a tendency for people to reject an analogy because the two sides of it are not exactly the same. The point I was trying to make was that the details are important in that they indicate the degree of graphicness in these novels. To link to it and require the reader to read through it is not nearly as helpful as stating it directly in the article, just as explaining the provisions of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> is much more helpful than linking to the original document. I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this information to be included other than because of a partiality to Webb or a desire to censor Wikipedia. Is it not more poignant (and accurate) to speak of the horrible scene rather than to speak of "incestuous sexual contact" or "sexual relations with his son"? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 19:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I very much believe in linking to original documents. But I prefer to say "graphic sexual details", if that is the case (and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is being used to support those words) and then let the reader follow the link, if he/she is so inclined, rather than stick vivid details from an adult novel into the middle of a biographical article that may well be read by a twelve-year old [who might not be inclined to follow the link]. Perhaps that makes me old-fashioned; so be it. I'd say the same thing about Lynne Cheney and her "lesbian love affair, brothels and attempted rapes";<a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2006/oct/27/va_sen_lynne_cheney_claims_her_steamy_lesbian_novel_isnt_sexually_explicit" class="external autonumber" title="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2006/oct/27/va_sen_lynne_cheney_claims_her_steamy_lesbian_novel_isnt_sexually_explicit" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> political party has nothing to do with it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for a partiality to Webb, I personally think it's totally absurd (and an act of desperation on the part of the Allen campaign) to hold an author responsible for what is in his/her fictional writings, particularly those set in the past -- but I've haven't expressed that opinion in the talk pages, and I've tried to keep it out of my edits. If it's a controversy, that is a fact, and deserves to be included.</dd>
<dd>Regarding analogies, some are enlightening and some are totally off the mark. It's probably not particularly useful to debate where on the spectrum yours falls. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 00:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So how bad is the situation? If he's just started acting this way, I was thinking about leaving this message: <i>Before the situation worsens, I'll do as the above user did and remind you that we are not censored. The facts, regardless of how obscene, will be part of Wikipedia. It has also come to my attention that you have been "reminding" people of the law regarding child pornography or something of that sort. This may be construed as a <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">a legal threat</a>, and most certainly as a case of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> given the way in which you've voiced your opinions. So, before this gets worse (maybe resulting in a penalty, I'd ask you to contact me or any other editor in good standing for a way to resolve the issue, rather than continuing in the same manner.</i></dd>

<p>Dear Sir-</p>
<p>Ok, I am contacting you.</p>
<p>Which country in the world shows their teenage children pictures of erect male genitals?</p>
<p>That Wikipedia chooses to do so when I can find no group of democratically elected, theocratic, authoritarian, or oligarchic government that allows it should at least speak to MY point. Please, if there are a group of school children that are shown these images, let me know what it is, otherwise, you are "breaking new ground" and telling the rest of the world that it is wrong. Do you show these pictures to your own children? No, you are a freshman in college, and I WAS ONE ONCE TOO. Have some children and see how you feel.</p>

<dd>I almost agree with you. However the manner in which you are addressing the situation, namely by writing in all caps and suggesting legal recourse is what you need to address. You can try to persuade people to your viewpoint, but please do so civilly. Your best option is probably to argue that this is not censoring, or that this is a case in which the obscenity is so great that a minor measure to make it invisible to children would be proper. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 03:52, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I enjoyed and appreciate your response, and will do my best to remove the caps. It is my opinion that any retail outlet in the US should be able to sell a printed version of this site. I do not think that is the wrong way to go. That would not allow it to be sold in all countries, but it would be a good step forward.

<p>Hi. I'm wondering whether you can help me out regarding Xchanter (<a href="../../../x/c/h/User_talk%7EXchanter_a4e4.html" title="User talk:Xchanter">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xchanter_cf94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xchanter">contribs</a>) (since you've been involved with him also).

Honestly, I think I've remained civil, although he seems to disagree (and do let me know if you also believe I crossed the line). But given his last message on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pascal.Tesson&amp;diff=84567836&amp;oldid=84562922" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pascal.Tesson&amp;diff=84567836&amp;oldid=84562922" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I just know I will lose my cool if I answer back, so your help and advice would be appreciated.

<dd>Xchanters responses to the warnings seem to confirm my initial diagnosis of trollishness. Using formalities like "Dear Sir" at the head of an insulting post indicates that he's really missing the point. Sorry I dropped this on your plate Adam, but hey, that's what they pay you the big $$$ for, right? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 05:55, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I gotta tell you guys I'm really on the fence here. Firstly, in terms of the issue itself, I sort-of agree with him. Would using a linkimage be so bad? Is this an issue of censorship, or an issue of hiding a graphic image from those who don't want to (or shouldn't)see it? From those who argue the "Wikipedia is not censored" argument, I get an impression that they imagine themselves being bravely radical, heroically opposing those censors who want to burn our books and make our girls wear skirts down past the knee. Perhaps we need to realize is that there is not a threat of Big Brother, and we need to stop imagining <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_451.html" title="Fahrenheit 451">Fahrenheit 451</a> when someone utters the word "censorship". This is a case of putting an image behind a door; and not a locked one.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, in terms of how he has been addressing the issue, I certainly see legal threats and incivility. Perhaps the block was justified, perhaps not. However after talking to him, I did see an ability for rational discussion, and all the block seems to be doing is give him an impression of a rigid, bureaucratic Wikipedia. It also seems to be punitive. Maybe I've missed some of his incriminating contribs (the worst I've seen are the legal threats), but I'm slightly sympathetic towards him, and I'm probably going to write some encouraging words to assure him that we're not all a bunch of assholes (not to suggest that either of you were acting that way). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 15:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate you offering Xchanter some support and encouragement at this point. I think that kind of thing is an important follow-up to the warn/block process, but it almost never happens. For any editor that's not totally incorrigable, some positive reinforcement and open dialogue will almost certainly help them become a more productive contributor. I know I had become quite agitated when this flurry of activity occurred; the issue of legal threats is my personal "zero tolerance" issue. While statements like "I'll contact my congressman" are pretty clearly not a <i>real</i> threat, any posting to the effect of "you can/will be arrested for saying that" is absolutely intolerable. <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> will never succeed in it's goals if individuals are able to use legal intimidation to quash not only our articles and images, but the very conversations between editors. Even so, I feel like I came close to incivility myself in this case (possibly even crossed the line, but I don't think so). I'll try to learn from this and restrain myself somewhat in future. I've considered leaving Xchanter a note of apology and encouragement as well, but I'm a little ambivalent about it. At any rate, I wanted to thank you and the others who were involved for your patience and good work on this; hopefully the situation will improve. FYI - I'd like to discuss "Censorship and Linkimage" as a seperate topic but I need more coffee first. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 17:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Xchanter, your block will expire soon (or maybe it already has). Consider this not an assurance that Wikipedia is</i> not <i>as rigid as it seems; you've touched on an issue dear to many, and that is censorship. Though unfortunately, "censorship" in terms of book burning and Big Brother has been woefully muddled with censorship in terms of nudity and obscenity, and the liberal mindset has been applied to the latter with as much absolutism and ferocity as the former. Hopefully that doesn't sound too bitter. But, I invite you to return, assuming that you tone down the incivility, and eliminate altogether the legal threats. Just browse around some discussion pages to get used to the pattern and tone of interaction between editors. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 15:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>As a note of clarification, the block had nothing to do with his thoughts on censorship. It was a disruption block because the user was making repeated legal threats, attempting to intimidate users on their talk pages, and repeatedly blanking warnings against that exact behavior. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 15:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I disagree with your rationale for restoring Xchanter's legal threats. You state that they are not at any one person. They are, actually, targetting everyone who has edited those pages, and it is quite clearly a legal threat. If you look at his contribution history, he has singled out a few editors in specific and his text appears to be attempting to menace them. As a result, I'm removing it again not because of 'censorship', but because it's the right thing to do. <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a> exists for a reason, and I hope you'll reconsider reverting the change. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 21:56, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The edits you copied over from another wiki's article on <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> were made to a significantly outdated version of the one found here.

<dd>Hello Simoes. Logically speaking, you seem to be overstating the degree of change I exacted upon the article. Let me address each of your points individually. As to whether or not there is a 3rd truth value in some logic, please see <a href="../../../t/e/r/Ternary_logic.html" title="Ternary logic">Ternary logic</a>. It seems to be very obscure (the only mention I've heard of it is through a passing comment by my TA). Secondly, you used the plural to overstate the situation relating to irrelevant categories. I inserted <i>a single</i> category that did not belong, but in the course of doing so I clarified the opening paragraph significantly for those who are not philosophy graduate students (you) or philosophy majors (me). Anyway, once I get some spare time, I'll try to work out a compromise.

<dd>This doesn't address my first point; videlicet, you effectively reverted to a month-old version of the article and made changes from there. As for your point about trivalent logics, I never claimed there to be no such thing. What I <i>did</i> say is that there is no trivalent logic with a truth value of "unknown" (or, at least, there is none across which I've ever come). If you could cite one, that would be great. The reliability of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Ternary_logic.html" title="Ternary logic">ternary logic</a> article, however, seems dubious at best (it cites exactly one source, it incorrectly labels <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_logic.html" title="Fuzzy logic">fuzzy logic</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraconsistent_logic.html" title="Paraconsistent logic">paraconsistent logic</a> as ternary, et cetera). <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 23:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi BanyanTree. The original version linked to <b><a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisheries.html" title="Fisheries">Fisheries</a></b>, but this doesn't really contain anyting about the situation (the study itself or its predictions) other than a paragraph. In the course of rephrasing the headline I disposed of "fisheries", and as a consequence of not having an article specifically relating to the issue, I left it without a bold link.

<p>Hi, I saw you participated in pages related to radio. I just wanted a little bit of help to correct an article I've tried to translate from French.
