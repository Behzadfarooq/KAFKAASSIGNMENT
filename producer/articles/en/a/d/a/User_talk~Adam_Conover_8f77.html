<p><i>"New Default Theme (reminiscent of <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safari_%28web_browser%29.html" title="Safari (web browser)">Safari</a>)".</i> How is that derogatory?

<p>I interpreted your addition as being an accusation that Firefox ripped off Safari's layout. I guess this wasn't your intention, but personally, I don't find the one reminiscent of the other any more than IE is reminiscent of Netscape. To say that it's <i>derived</i> from Safari is even stronger, and implies that the layout consciously mimicked Safari. Do you have any evidence of this? If you can present some, I don't really have any objections. However, I'm not really sure that that informtion is relevant in the table of browser changes to begin with -- the fact that there was a new layout <i>at all</i> is what's important. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> 20:57, Mar 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe he was correcting my error. When I was converting the task box to its current format (content at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Template%7EPhilosophyTasks_da50.html" title="Template:PhilosophyTasks">Template:PhilosophyTasks</a> and layout at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Template%7EPhilosophyTasksBox_b5c0.html" title="Template:PhilosophyTasksBox">Template:PhilosophyTasksBox</a>), I think I accidentally put the layout code where the content was supposed to go.

<p>Is it appropriate to create redirects from the article namespace to the Wikipedia namespace? For example, I was looking for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">Wikipedia:Article series</a> just now, so I typed "Article series" into the go/search box, and found an empty page. Since one of the purposes of redirects is to make it easier to find thing, I was about to create a redirect to the Wikipedia namespace page, but then realized that this might be good practice. What should I do? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover"></a> — <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> <strong class="selflink">†</strong> 04:53, Apr 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are many such redirects for historical reasons (originally we didn't have namespaces). But we <i>shouldn't</i> create more without good reason. Everytime we make explicit reference to Wikipedia within the article namespace we make things more difficult for re-users of our content. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 09:30, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Muriel. I assume you noticed my random-page-editing last night, which involved a lot of year-linking -- I had never been directed to that page before, and had thought that linking every year was standard wikipedia practice.

<dd>Follow-up. No, I think you NPOVed it the right amount. It's a pretty controversial position, in no small part because the anthropology is really under-analyzed right now, and there's not really any agreement on how to contextualize any of his political/sociological stuff with the rest of his philosophy. (My favorite view, I admit, is that the entire Metaphysic of Morals is somewhat tongue in cheek, since it's impossible for any state to meet the requirements for a "valid state" that Kant sets up). In any case, thanks for cleaning up after me. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 19:03, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's your thought on this article? Something about it makes me suspicious, but it's not enough my area to make any firm statements about its flaws, beyond being kind of suspicious that it's in any way a substantive branch of philosophy.

<p>Well, I'm the author and maybe I have not done the subject justice, but I doubt you can speak to this since you didn't know that it is a Huge area of philosophy.</p>

<dd>I don't think that "philosophy of space and time" is a specific subfield of philosophy, but it is certainly a philosophical issue.

<p>Hi. I noticed you copied and pasted the article at <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Gagne_6dd1.html" title="Eric Gagne">Eric Gagne</a> and moved it <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Gagn%C3%A9_5ebe.html" title="Eric Gagné">Eric Gagné</a>. However, please use the move page feature rather than copying and pasting because moving also transfers the history of the article to its new location, which is something that just copying, pasting and redirecting the old article can't do. Unless, of course, there is an article where you want to move it to (like in this case), then please ask an admin to delete the page to redirect to so that the article can be moved there.</p>

<p>On April 11th, you posted this image of the bust of Thales.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no information has been supplied as to the author of the photo, the source and/or copyrights of the image. Could you please see that appropriate information appear on that page. Or, since no article actually links to that image, it may be better to put a request for its deletion, so that nobody is tempted to use it on any wikipedia (as I did on the French wikipedia&#160;;-)). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Hood_6878.html" title="User:Robin Hood">Robin des Bois ♘</a> ➳ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobin_Hood_448f.html" title="User talk:Robin Hood">✉</a> 01:32, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will answer here to your question regarding the stamp. Yes, I think it would be an appropriate alternative. Since I'm not admin (AND even if I were), I would not delete the file myself. I asked for its deletion because an admin on the French wikipedia told me to. You know, I was disappointed as well, when they did. But now it is up to other users to give their opinion on that matter, and to the admins to decide whether or not it is deleted. However, I suggest you check the article on <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain_image_resources.html" title="Public domain image resources">public domain image resources</a> or place a request on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_pictures_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested pictures">Wikipedia:Requested pictures</a>.

<dd>From what I remember, a factor was originally a person or firm who did the processing of snuff. I'll have to take a closer look at my references -- part of the problem is that most of the ones I have access to deal with the colonial period to the 1920s, which is very applicable to dry snuff but not at all to moist. -<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Ben</a> 19:31, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, with regards to the VfD itself, I nearly closed it as a delete anyway, but the ambiguity and chaos introduced by the sockpuppets made me think that the apparent majority of "delete"s (without socks) was still not really based on a hearty debate over the merits 0of the article. It was therefore invalid. If I had confidence that sockpuppets could be avoided, and others be restricted to just comments and votes, not attempted hijacking of the VfD, I'd relist it myself and see if a consensus I could feel more confident in acting on would arise. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:55, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean have a discussion on deletion on the talk page and see if a (reliable) consensus for deletion evolves, and if it does, then renominate it for VFD? That sounds like a good plan. Ordinarily I'd be happy to keep an eye on the VFD, but we'll have to see about the timing. I'm moving to college on Monday, and I'm borrowing someone else's computer at the moment (mine being in the mail). But by all means drop me a note if it happens, and I'll do it if I can.

<p>I'm responding to your question about Taxation in the UK and whether there is mass avoidance or attempts to move out of the country. For tax purposes, there is little disadvantage of being a UK resident, as our tax burden is overall quite low (both by European standards, but also compared to the US by comparison to Government services provided). While UK residents are taxed on worldwide income, there is also the issue that it's rather hard for HM Customs &amp; Revenue to find foreign assets, so wealthier British citizens, should they wish to hide assets, can do so rather easily. Similarly, because Income Tax is applied differently to rental income in the UK, as well as Inheritance Tax for leaseholds/freeholds, a wealthy person can easily maintain a lower rate of tax liability, and do, without having to move assets abroad.</p>
<p>While in the 1970s the UK had an extremely high tax burden (as did the US, where both countries had upper marginal rates in excess of 70 per cent) those rates have come down dramatically in the past twenty-five years. The top rate of tax, at 40p, is comparable to the US without much trouble (as the US levies Federal, State, and sometimes City/County income taxes), and the services provided for remaining in the UK (healthcare, educational, etc.) are quite good, considering the tax burden.</p>
<p>It's also prudent to understand that the predominent number of Britons with money are from the middle classes, and thus benefit both from the existing system, but also that they benefit from living in the UK, as they continue to work for livings, rather than residing on large family estates. So the ability to migrate abroad for tax purposes is limited, as they would simply migrate to somewhere with a similar or worse tax regime. Hope this explains a bit and do feel free to ask if you have any specific questions. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Kerr_90b0.html" title="User:Nick Kerr">Nick Kerr</a> 13:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
