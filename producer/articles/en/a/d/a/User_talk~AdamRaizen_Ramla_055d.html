<dd>"Jewish and other"</dd>
</dl>
<p>What does this mean? What is "other" here? Other non-Arab? Can we get seperate figures for Jewish, Arab, and other? "Exaggerating" the Jewish % by including "other" might be considered POV (by either side)...</p>
<p><i>Yes, it's other non-Arab. This is the CBS's category, and it doesn't break it down any further. In general, other refers to people who are married to a Jew, or whose father or grandfather was Jewish, and thus immigrated under the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_Return_fc3e.html" title="Law of Return">Law of Return</a>, but aren't considered Jewish by the Rabbinate. Culturally, they're basically the same a secular Israeli Jew, so the category makes some sense. Maybe there should be a link to an article which explains this?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Center district</dd>
</dl>
<p>Link? We ought to have district pages (maybe district pages are more important than cities?).</p>
<p><i>Yes, I'll add links to districts and regions.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>רמלה</dd>
</dl>
<p>Redirect? Maybe not... however, redirects from any former Palestinian names (where applicable) might be useful - we want to avoid situations where we have two articles on the same location. Don't know whether that's available from your raw data.</p>
<p><i>The data doesn't have any information on that, and I can't think of any examples right off where it would be applicable. I think that links and redirects will have to be added manually.</i></p>
<p>What other statistics are available?</p>
<p><i>There are a total of about 272 different statistics. They are broken down into a number of categories. The categories are General, Population Groups and Arab Population by Religion, Demographics (in addition to age groups and natural growth rate, there is live births, deaths, absolute natural growth, infant deaths absolute and per 1000 residents, and a breakdown of the age groups of new immigrants), Internal Immigration Balance (i.e., within the country), Wage and Welfare (there are no direct stats on people below the poverty line, so I used unemployment benefits and income guarantees as a proxy for that), Education (can be broken down into more than just "high school" and "elementary school", and there's average class size), Water (consumption for various purposes, both absolute and per capita), Building and Lodging, Infrastructure and Municipal Services (building of roads and water, sewage, and canalization pipes), Domestic Waste, Transportation (number of motor vehicles, average age of vehicles, traffic accidents), and a huge number of statistics concerning the local authority's budget, expenditures and deficit.</i></p>
<p><i>One item which might be of interest is "Socio-economic level" which is an integer from 1 to 10. I only hesitate to add it because it seems it is the CBS's own scale, and there's no indication of how it was derived (though maybe I'll be able to find something from digging around their site).</i></p>
<p>Can we have links to nearby cities? (X is five miles to the south, Y is fifteen miles to the east, etc) <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 13:42, 15 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>I don't have geographic coordinates, so that's not really possible, but if a data source is found, it could be added.</i> -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 14:58, 2003 Sep 15 (UTC)</p>
<p>Shame. The ability to "travel around" a country would be really neat - virtually following a road from one place to another, "visiting" places on the way - that kind of thing. Ahh, I can but dream&#160;:)</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses. Sounds like an article on the census itself would be a good place to explain some of these things. What's available in "General"? Those stats are, I guess, <i>most</i> likely to be of interest. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 15:39, 15 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The data isn't from a census; it's from a survey of the Interior Ministry's databases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the interesting stats in "General" are already included. The full list is Authority's Name, Authority's Sign (a number used for bureaucratic purposes), District, Region (each belongs to either a district or a region, not both; regions are for settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip), Municipal Status (Municipality (big), Local Council (smaller), or Regional Council (group of rural settlements)), Year of Receipt of Municipal Status, Number of Council Members, Sign of the Planning and Building Committee (another number), Name of the Planning and Building Committee, and Socio-economic Cluster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The district or region is simply a bureaucratic division of the Interior Ministry (the local governments are the subject of the article), so I'm not sure if it deserves its own article, though the districts Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem should link to articles on those cities or on their metropolises. -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 19:09, 2003 Sep 15 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I added "according to CBS" where appropriate, which seems to be ram-bots approach ("as of the 2001 census"). Statistics bureau can be inaccurate, so I think attribution is appropriate. Blanket attribution (eg "all stats from CBS")might hinder the addition of statistics from other sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also changed "Jews and other" to "Jews and other non-Arab". Btw, how is it determined which ethnic category people fall into? I'm assuming CBS don't use the English yob school of ethnography...</p>
<dl>
<dd>There will be an article at <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_groups_in_Israel_42e9.html" title="Population groups in Israel">Population groups in Israel</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, "There are 450 recent immigrants during initial settling-in" - how recent is recent? Are these internal or external immigrants? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:36, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are external immigrants. I've written to the CBS to ask clarification on that and a few other points, but I think that it's immigrants within the past 3 years. -- <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRaizen_3935.html" title="User:AdamRaizen">AdamRaizen</a> 02:29, 2003 Sep 18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a minor, minor thing, but I thinkthinkthink I've heard about the IntMin districts being used as the basis for constituencies in various plans to reform the Knesset. I'm bored and needed to babble, so thought I'd add that.:-) (More usefully: The Knesset deserves its own article, IMHO, with maybe another (linked) article on ideas for Knesset reform. Info in the English wiki on Israel's governmental structure seems sparse, and would seem particularly useful given how often that piece of the planet hits Western news outlets. I'd write it, but I'm not sure I know enough, and I'd prefer to leave it to an Israeli.) -<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenta_b06b.html" title="User:Penta">Penta</a> 21:29, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
