<p>Hey, welcome to wikipedia, if only there was more time in the day. I have had this idea to cross reference all the questions in the Stanford archives with wikipedia (1) to make sure that wikipedia had an entry on any tossup-worthy question and (2) to add useful facts (after checking them of course). I only got through one pack (ACF '94 Emory I believe), but if every active <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quizbowl.html" title="Quizbowl">quizbowler</a> did one pack a week, we would be done in no time. One can dream. Anyway, spread the word, this seems a perfect trap for wayward quizbowlers. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidLevinson_6300.html" title="User:DavidLevinson">dml</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the Joseph Brant article, its a good start. Your interest in that area of history makers me want to explain part of my 'to do list'. I've created a couple of references, and plan on two articles to be labeled <i>Invasion of Canada (1775)</i> and another for <i>(1812)</i>. I've got notes building for the 1775 article but will probably never get further than a stub for the 1812 one. I just wanted you to know were I'm headed, since we'll probably cross paths again.

<p>Thanks for doing all those Byzantine emperor blocks. (Quite a lot of them, and the succession wasn't exactly smooth either.) - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a> 06:51 27 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ditto on the Byzantine Emperor blocks -- &amp; I see that you are now working on the Roman Emperor blocks. (The Roman Emperors &amp; the Popes are the two major lists that don't use this template for some reason.) But I have a quibble here: you stated that some of the Roman Emperors were Byzantine ones that really don't fit that category (e.g., <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gratianus.html" title="Gratianus">Gratianus</a>). I think we need to determine some division point -- either the death of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodosius_I_297b.html" title="Theodosius I">Theodosius I</a> or an important milestone afterwards, OR use both titles to some point between Justinian &amp; Heraclius' death. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:52 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I was fixing up some of the Roman ones, but I don't know as much about them...I could still add the template though. I was thinking the same thing about when the Byzantine emperors start...in the case of Gratianus, the Valens page already had him listed, so I just kept him. Personally, I would start with Constantine, but my main Byzantine history text book that I've been using starts as early as Diocletian, and the roman-emperors.org website starts as late as Arcadius. Maybe Adrianople could be the cut off, and the list could start with Theodosius. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:55 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, Theodosius is well known as the last emperor of the undivided Roman Empire, so I would say that Arcadius should be considered as the earliest Byzantine Emperor in the title blocks. One can also make an argument that Justinian is considered a Roman (in distinction to a Byzantine) emperor because of his work codifying <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Law_6862.html" title="Roman Law">Roman Law</a> &amp; his reconquest of Africa, Italy, &amp; part of Spain. And many of his predecessors played a role in the politics of Western Europe.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a POV issue, which needs noting <i>somewhere</i> in Wikipedia. (Yes, I have seen many Byzantine Imperial histories start with Constantine I, so this is an acknowldeged POV; however <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibbon.html" title="Gibbon">Gibbon</a>'s classic work traces the Roman Empire to the fall of Constantinople in 1453, so there are other opinions on this subject.) Unfortunately, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> article is woefully incomplete, most likely because of the size of the topic daunts most who attempt it, so perhaps this should be added to the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> article.</p>
<p>Do you think it would a good solution to list the emperors from Arcadius to Justinian as both Byzantine &amp; Roman Emperors? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 16:23 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We could list both eastern and western emperors, on the Roman Emperors list. Then when there are no more western emperors, that could be the start of the Byzantine list - in that case Zeno I would be the first on the Byzantine list. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 17:34 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good job with the additions to the Kingdom of Jerusalem article. I'd written most of the previous article, and it's definitely much better now. I'd been intending to do more stuff with crusader state related articles, as there's much to do. I don't think there are articles on any of the other crusader states, for instance. Anyway, just wanted to compliment you on the good work, and urge you to keep it up. <a href="../../../j/l/k/User%7EJlk7e_f298.html" title="User:Jlk7e">john</a> 01:20 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I was planning on writing about the County of Edessa as well, and maybe Antioch.

<dd>I'd recommend Runciman's three volume history of the Crusades, if you haven't read it already. It's well-written, and probably the best narrative history of the period, and it focuses on the crusader states much more than on the western crusaders. It's particularly good for the 13th century stuff, which most people seem to ignore (including, for the most part, our article, at the moment, for which I am probably most to blame) It's a bit light on analysis, though. I'll try to write a bare bones (at least) County of Tripoli article, and leave Edessa (and Antioch?) to you. <a href="../../../j/l/k/User%7EJlk7e_f298.html" title="User:Jlk7e">john</a> 05:54 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've read most of Runciman. I would also recommend Setton's history, which is even longer than Runciman's (six volumes). Joshua Prawer wrote a lot of great stuff too. We didn't really focus much on the 13th century in the class I took, I guess because the kingdom wasn't very powerful by then...anyway, I'll see what I can find for Edessa, at least. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:08 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per Colin McEvedy, dating the Byzantine Empire from Heraclius' reign does make a bit of sense: Heraclius was the last Emperor to hold territory south of the Tarsus mountains -- i.e. Syria, Palestine &amp; Egypt. After that, the Byzantine Empire acquired its "classic" realm of Asia Minor, Greece, the Balkans &amp; the foot of Italy. It seems that the story of the Byzantine Empire gets under way when the following themes are in the forefront: (1) the struggle of Emperor &amp; Christianity; (2) constant fighting with the Muslims (first the Arabs, then the Turks); and (3) Greek culture &amp; literature. While all of these play a role in the history of the Roman Empire from Constantine the Great on -- &amp; several historians have pointed this fact out -- IMHO they don't become primary until after Justinian, &amp; perhaps not until after Heraclius. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 06:00 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

I checked some websites and they said the band's name was <i>The Guess Who</i>, not <i>Guess Who</i>. I presume unless the websites are wrong (which is quite possible. I am no fan of google searches) you dropped the definite article because wiki normally does that. However it does <i>not</i> do that if <i>The</i> is actually in the title, eg, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Irish_Times_e693.html" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a>, unlike the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Independent_7fc3.html" title="Irish Independent">Irish Independent</a>. As the band's name apparently does include the definite article as part of the name , I have moved the article to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guess_Who_b822.html" title="The Guess Who">The Guess Who</a>. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 03:03 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I guess I learned something new tonight. I never heard of either <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guess_Who_5dad.html" title="Guess Who">Guess Who</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guess_Who_b822.html" title="The Guess Who">The Guess Who</a>. Band names can be so much fun. In Ireland we have a band called <i>Therapy?</i> and they cause chaos in newspapers. Invariably there is some sub-editor somewhere who has never heard of them and changes Therapy? to Therapy, leading to major rows and complaints to the newspaper from horrified fans. (At least <i>The Eagles</i> who are playing on my computer's <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> right now (to be followed by <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depeche_Mode_b2a7.html" title="Depeche Mode">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>) don't cause too many problems, though a member of Bono's family tells the story of a British newspaper that did a report on one of their gigs. As we used to do, the <i>copy</i> was read in over the phone. But the copy-editor was either not a rock music fan, was half asleep or hated U2, and so typed up the text as <b>Ewe too</b>. They also got the location wrong, so <b>U2 play Slane</b> was typed up as <b>Ewe too play slain</b> and it made it to press, as somehow no-one noticed it before the paper was put <i>to bed.</i> (journo-sleep for finished) Oh well.)  :-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 03:23 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Adam, I hope I haven't caught you too late. There is an error in the Governor-General template. It is missing the hyphen in Governor-General. (It is in as Governor General!). lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 21:28 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm afraid it definitely is hyphenated. (I've recently had to write 50,000 words on the Irish Governor-General, and that title was taken <i>directly</i> from Canada.) Basically the key word in the title is <i>governor</i>. The <i>general</i> is a qualifier which means in effect <i>overall</i>, ie, superior in rank and constitutional to all over governors (provincial, state, local etc). In modern english if being created now it would probably be <i>general governor</i>. But the words were reversed and hypenated. (As in <i>president-elect</i>, <i>Attorney-General</i>, etc, the key word being <i>president</i> and <i>attorney</i>). In contrast <i>Lord Deputy</i> or <i>Lord Lieutenant</i> aren't, because the key word isn't <i>Lord</i> but <i>Deputy</i> or <i>Lieutenant</i>. Some hypenated words have lost their hypen over time (through illiteracy rather than a deliberate decision) but Governor-General hasn't.</p>
<p>As to the official website, that sounds a classic case of what some Irish civil servants call the <i>OSMS</i> meaning <i>Oh Shit Mistake Syndorme</i>. What happens is an outside expert is commissioned to do something (usually design a website). A mistake is made. The civil servant spots it, presumes it would be dead easy to fix, so easy that it would be embarrassing to have to ask for it to be fixed. Except that in reality he doesn't have a goddamned clue <i>how</i> to fix it. So, like someone who dinges their partner's car and is too embarrased to admit it, he walks away and hopes that no-one will notice or that if they do, <i>they</i> will know how to fix it. Or else a junior civil servant who doesn't know about the hyphen or doesn't think it important had the site designed and has never spotted the mistake. And the senior civil servants who <i>would</i> know aren't very computer-literate and so haven't visited the site and so never noticed. I've lost count of the number of major websites I have come across with monumental errors because of this. As a result I have learned <i>never</i> to trust websites and treat Google searches not so much with a pinch of salt as a bucket of salt! (eg, a user on wiki tried to put on a ludicrous definition of the terms <i><a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_right_of_kings.html" title="Divine right of kings">Divine right of kings</a></i> on wiki. He was blocked so he had now put it on a separate website. So a google search will throw up his nutty theory as a real definition.</p>
<p>Even a google search shows clear evidence of the OSMS. Some documents use a hypen, others don't. Some have spelling mistakes. GG is hypenated in some parts of a document, then loses it in others. The 1982 Constitution Act in some versions hypenates it, others don't. Some bizarrely even have a <i>Governor general</i>, one I found <i>governorGeneral</i>!!!</p>
<p>The site called <i>Governor General of Australia</i> contains he following paragraph:</p>
<p><i>In 1936, the Commonwealth reopened Admiralty House as a Sydney Residence for the new Governor-General, Lord Gowrie. Successive Governors-General have since used Admiralty House as their residence when in New South Wales. Formal title to Admiralty House finally passed from New South Wales to the Commonwealth by Crown grant in 1948 on condition that the House be used only as a residence for the Governor-General.</i></p>
<p>So the article is de-hypenated, but the text <i>hypenated</i>! The 1996 installation of the Aussie GG uses <i>governor-general</i>. An earlier one doesn't.</p>
<p>So as in some many technical areas, the net is unfortunately a very poor source of information. (It would be nice if google had an <i>authenticated sources</i> search as opposed to a <i>anything written on the topic no matter how much bullshit it contains</i> search.) But technically and grammatically the words are hypenated and were so in hard-copy versions of the primary sources. We should aim to achieve primary source accuracy where possible rather than contribute to net confusion, at least in theory! :-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 23:10 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="http://www.gg.ca/" class="external text" title="http://www.gg.ca/" rel="nofollow">official web site of the Governor General of Canada</a> does not use a hyphen. I would think that Her Excellency (and her staff) would know her proper title. - <a href="../../../c/a/f/User%7ECafemusique_5316.html" title="User:Cafemusique">Cafemusique</a> 21:38 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I checked the hardcopy version of the two reports of Australia's <i>Republic Advisory Committee</i>. Volume II does into detail on international governors-general and presidents. It was prepared by a professional secretariat for then Prime Minister Paul Keating. (A copy also went to the Queen). It also contacted each state and quotes and refers to various commonweath constitutions. <i>All</i> GGs are hypenated, including the Canadian governor-general, in the document. Given the document's importance and prestigé and the fact that it dealt directly with governors-general directly, it is unlikely that they would have used the wrong form.</p>
<p>BTW it is more than likely that a state would use either the same outside agency or the same in house team to computerise all their records so there is nothing that surprising about all state web pages in Canada you found not using hypens if the same team of people had had the task of computerising all the major constitutional documents and setting up websites.</p>
<p>Even if perhaps for linguistic reasons to do with French speakers, it was decided in Canada to de-hypenate the governor-general, it probably would make sense to apply the same standard spelling to the office <i>worldwide</i>. Otherwise you could have a repeat of the czar/tsar mess or the problem with two methods of westerning Chinese names. The Irish gg was 100% written as governor-general not governor general. The formal document installing the last governor-general of Australia used a hypen. Formal state documents in New Zealand use a hypen. Hypenating some governors-general and not others would produce a textual nightmare on wiki, with someone seeing a de-hypenated gg in Canada and removing the hypen in Ireland. Then someone reinstating it in Ireland and installing it in Canada. People constantly de-hypenating and re-hypenating governos-general in Ceylon, Belize, New Zealand, Australia, etc. On balance, <i>even</i> if the Canadian GG is de-hypenated, (and I'm not convinced!) it would probably make sense to keep a general wiki standard wiki-wide. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:56 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

Hey I was trying to figure that out too, I was reading the talk page about Mac. Basically what I did was jusr revert what the user had change. I think some of the stuff could have been left as R. O . M and not FYROM, but what should be listed ROM vs FYROM ?</p>
<p>I would think anything tied to international groups ie UN would have to be FYROM but some of the geography things maybe could be ROM. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">User:Smith03</a></p>

<p>Hi Adam! In response to your question:</p>
<dl>
<dd>it doesn't seem that <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestorianism.html" title="Nestorianism">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysitism.html" title="Monophysitism">Monophysitism</a> came after <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulcheria.html" title="Pulcheria">Pulcheria</a>...<a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestorius.html" title="Nestorius">Nestorius</a>, at least, was a contemporary, and the Nestorianism and Monophysitism articles say both were condemned at the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Chalcedon_1cd3.html" title="Council of Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a>, which she helped organize (though that article is pretty stubby and doesn't mention either). That is also the understanding I got from the Byzantine history textbook I tend to use for Byzantine articles. Have I misunderstood something somewhere?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Working thru the materials about Nestorius, <a href="../../../i/b/a/Ibas.html" title="Ibas">Ibas</a> (who some say helped promote Nestorianism), <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severus_of_Antioch_02ff.html" title="Severus of Antioch">Severus of Antioch</a>, etc., it appears that Nestorianism actually developed in the generation <i>after</i> Nestorius, adhering to a version of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html#Christology" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christology</a> that Nestorius briefly advocated, then anathemated. According to Kenenth G. Holum, <i>Theodosian Empresses</i>, he advocated it one Sunday at the pulpit in a misogynist fit at <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulcheria.html" title="Pulcheria">Pulcheria</a>. Obviously, she took offense, &amp; pulled the necessary strings to have him deposed &amp; exiled.</p>
<p>Ibas has been creditted with espousing Nestorianism, but he, too, is a victim of historical misinterpretation, &amp; having been dragged into the Three Chapters Contraversy. (He is recorded as having anathematized Nestorius.)</p>
<p>As I understand it, Nestorianism has nationalist sympathies with Persia, &amp; did not become a self-conscious faction until late in the fifth century. But then, the only motivation I can understand behind all of the fierce contraversy over these subtle distinctions would come from local connections; i.e., enough people felt, "This is how my teacher/my parents taught me was right, &amp; I'm not about to let someome in Constantinople tell me what's right!" Feel free to correct me for espousing a POV ;-).</p>
<p>Another problem is that until the Council of Chalcedon, these differences were not seen as significant. Unfortunately, the imperial politics in the generations that followed defined factions according to their Christological beliefs, &amp; their harmony with the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_of_Alexandria_0c9b.html" title="Patriarch of Alexandria">Patriarch of Alexandria</a>. So I base the fact Monophysitism developed as a defined belief or faction in response to the political enviornment following Chalcedon. This "heresy" doesn't even have a consistent name in the historical literature, called in various places <i>acephalism</i>, <i>Severanism</i> and <i>Eutychianism</i>.</p>
<p>Note: I am not a theologian. I don't even attend church regularly.</p>
<p>But I agree with you more work needs to be done on the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Chalcedon_1cd3.html" title="Council of Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a></p>

<p>Hi Adam! About the first bishop of Jerusalem, according to <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> that was <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_the_Just_a659.html" title="James the Just">James the Just</a>. I think <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_the_Less_6ab1.html" title="James the Less">James the Less</a> was another <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">Apostle</a>, along with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_the_Great_ecff.html" title="James the Great">James the Great</a> -- neither of whom were related to Jesus Christ, as James the Just is said to be (according to such sources as Matthew 13:55, Mark 6:3, and Galatians 1:19). I'll be honest: I'm not certain about all of the relationships between these people (e.g. whether one or more of these James is fictional), &amp; the matter isn't any clearer due to Christian dogma about the nature of Jesus Christ, which forces the logical conclusion that He was an only child. (Although there is sufficient evidence that He had a number of step or half siblings.)</p>
<p>BTW, I wrote the article on James the Less, &amp; right now I'm not very happy about it: it suggests erroneously that the first bishop, James brother of Jesus, &amp; the writer of the epistle all were the same person, when the matter is still under debate. It also needs some more suorce citations. If I find the time today, I'll fix it. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:13, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<li>From my most recent reading of <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, I've noticed that although he follows the succession of Jerusalem closely, he gives pride of place to the archbishop of Caeserea. The <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicaea_c5ec.html" title="Council of Nicaea">Council of Nicaea</a> confirms the fact that (in at least the 2nd &amp; 3rd centuries) Caesarea was the seat of the metropolitan of Palestine in the language they use to promote Jerusalem's bishopric.

<li>Unlike Alexandria &amp; Antioch, Jerusalem did not suffer a schism in its Patriachate. That is an item worth investigating.</li>

<li>I think the list of bishops/patriarchs should be split off into its own article, a List of Patriarchs of Jerusalem.

This is because after the move, the contents of page A are "#REDIRECT [[B]]", and the software allows you to move a page over an already existing page <i>if</i> the only content there is a redirect to the page you're moving (does that make sense?). The reason I had to delete a page before I could make the move back just now is that Michael moved page A to location B, and then from B he moved it to C, which meant it wasn't possible to move C back to A, because A now redirected to B. And if you can understand that, you're doing better than me :)</p>
<p>To put it simply: in almost all cases, if somebody moves a legitimate page to a junk page, you can just click on "Move this page" and move it back to the old location. If that doesn't work for whatever reason, then the old location needs to be deleted first.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping clean up after Michael, by the way - much appreciated :) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

I hope that is where you wanted it moved to. I was just trying to see if it would work and ir did. The theory is that if a page history has nothing more than a redirect, you should be able to move a page into it without deleting it first, but it doesn't always work.

<p>Salve Adam, I made a few changes to your proposed Latin Wikipedia submission, all but one of which you should accept as <b>suggestions</b>. The one exception is that I believe <i>dignitas</i> to be a better choice than <i>nomen</i>.</p>
<p>Actually, my Latin is very rusty -- which is why I'm encouraging people to contribute to the Latin Wikipedia than to contribute myself -- &amp; any feedback you get there concerning your use of <i>lingua Latina</i> would be far superior than anything I could contribute.

<p>I see we have many interests in common (if you visit my homepage you will see). I can contribute photos to some of your other articles, since I was in Greece and Turkey last year. Its good to see people here taking history seriously.</p>

<p>Well, then, the person who added Amenhotep as an alternative transliteration for <a href="../../../i/m/h/Imhotep.html" title="Imhotep">Imhotep</a>, <a href="http://wikipedia.com/w/wiki.phtml?title=Imhotep&amp;oldid=368010" class="external text" title="http://wikipedia.com/w/wiki.phtml?title=Imhotep&amp;oldid=368010" rel="nofollow">here</a>, was confused.

I'm checking with him now, it's possible that he confused him with the Amenhotep who was an architect for a later king (also called Amenhotep, confusingly). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 13:13, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At first I did assume they were alternative transliterations - Egyptian script didn't include vowels, so the name Amenhotep would have been written something like "mnhtp" anyway. But now that I think about it, the transliteraton of Imhotep ought to be "mhtp" - and there is that Amenhotep who was an architect, so if there's an error maybe that's the source of it. No problem with the edit - it brought it to our attention as a potential problem (the Wikipedia does have errors), we'll get it sorted out, and make a note of the details of the situation in the talk page. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 13:51, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've unblocked 216.68.43.85. You suggested on User talk:216.68.43.85 that he would be blocked if he continued to vandalise VfD and RickK then blocked him. However, I am not convinced the blanking of VfD was deliberate. This has happened to other people on large pages and appears to be a browser issue. Judging from the edits to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_comedies.html" title="List of comedies">List of comedies</a> from this IP and to <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Matters_%28television%29_fa03.html" title="Family Matters (television)">Family Matters (television)</a> from a similar IP, this user does not appear to have shown any other signs of vandalism. It is possible this was accidental. If he continues to do this to VfD without explanation then do block him again, but I think Rick's block of him so soon after you left him a message on his talk page may have been too soon. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 03:42, Nov 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if you saw my reply to RickK, but in case not - I am happy for him to be blocked if it happens again as he will have had time to read his talk page by then. Browser issues do cause complete blanking, not just truncation. See BL's talk page for example [1]. I'm not sure the fact the did it three times is evidence either. He could have genuinely been a newbie who couldn't understand why his edits were not saving properly. Perhaps I'm in too nice a mood today. :) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></p>

After he blanked it, he went to the history, and refreshed the page every few seconds until someone reverted it. Then immediately after Rick blocked him he tried to revert the page to an earlier version, but the obviously that edit was blocked. He then read some pages and left at 3.47, which was after I unblocked him. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 04:21, Nov 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The fact that he talks out of the side of his mouth is extremely comical, but I can accept that their might be a more professional way to express the concept.

It is encouraging to know that my efforts over the past 6 months have been appreciated. I prize your actions all the more knowing that many of you were not familiar with my work and had to do some research to decide whether to support me or not (because I limit my contributions to the 750 business/economics articles) . Thank you for the time, the effort, and the confidence.</p>
<p>There was a minority that did not support me because of my name. It seems that half have a problem because they read “shat” into it and half because of the word “god”. I find this amazing. The people that read “shat” into the character string had to ignore the commonly used word “hat” and pick out a word that has not been in common use for more than a century. My spell checker is currently telling me that the word dosn’t exist. One complainant insisted on converting “Monad” into “gonads” and “Excrescent” into “excrement”. Another saw “a dog eating a bone” as a sexual act. All I can say to these people is “Get professional help”.</p>
<p>As for changing my name, I have decided not to do that for two reasons. One is a philosophical reason. For an explanation, read The Crucible, particularly where John Proctor declares the importance of your name. The price of adminship is too high. The other reason is a practical one. I find it useful to use the same name on all my online activities. It is interesting that two universities and several commercial sites don’t have a problem with my name. Maybe it is not all that surprising since they are not inhabited by trolls trying to forward their cause.</p>

But I did say what these two have written on this page, is racism. I am fully qualified to write on the history of Quebec and will get around to New France but again, if you had read before speaking, you would see that "your work" on New France is not acceptable to Mathieu/Tremblay who have stated they plan to change the New France article.

<p>In response, I repeat: In future, please do not make any comments to or about me until you have facts. I resent people who talk without bothering to check the facts. You may give all the "advice" you want, but read first before opening mouth. My edits are ALL factual and proper. And I will edit in accordance with Wikipedia policy unless of course there is a new policy that approves of bigotry and racism in Wikipedia articles? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 17:34, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Adam. I am sure that we both have different points of view on Quebec, but with your degree in history, we will most likely be able to cooperate and have a decent looking, NPOV, History of Quebec and Canada. English is my second language. I make awful typos and don't always write clear sentences, but I know every detail of the political history of Quebec, from the point of view of London, Quebec, and Ottawa. You know that the history of this federation is very political. The only thing we can do is write good articles, including all the details in their rightful historical context and let people think what they want. Is that how you understand NPOV too? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 23:10, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Argh, it's a shame to hear that you won't be reworking <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Quebec_eef9.html" title="History of Quebec">History of Quebec</a>, Adam. I was counting on your arbitration to sort it out! I think if we build very solid specific articles (like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_France_b15c.html" title="New France">New France</a> and eventually <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiet_Revolution_8a2b.html" title="Quiet Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a>) the creation of a more cohesive <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Quebec_eef9.html" title="History of Quebec">History of Quebec</a>, based on the model of other <i>History of...</i> articles, will come naturally.</dd>

<dd>I've started an edit of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiet_Revolution_8a2b.html" title="Quiet Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a> on my hard-drive and I'm sure Mathieugp can do plenty of work too. Do you think you can incorporate the events of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Quebec_eef9.html" title="History of Quebec">History of Quebec</a> into <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_France_b15c.html" title="New France">New France</a>? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 20:42, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Adam, is very simple: first get your hands in a nice drawing program like corel or ilustrator (i use corel), then you make the family tree. Sometimes its a bit like a puzzle because you have a certain width you cant surpass and gets complicated when somebody decides to marry 4 times and have 17 children. When your work of art is finished, export to a *.png format and upload. Please let me know your plans so we dont duplicate efforts. I have data to do the diagram for the scandinavian kingdoms and i'm just waiting for patience to do them. I can give you a nice site with the whole Ptolomies. If you decide to attack the egyptians, you better talk to Adam Carr because i know he is working on them. Keep me posted!

<li>Dear Adam, me again. I was moving discussions in the conflicts page and i noticed your comment on returning to <i>boring</i> subjects. Just to say that i couldnt agree more! At least in these ancient topics people behave like grown ups, as they should. The discussion about the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_emperor.html" title="Roman emperor">Roman emperor</a> move should be an example for everybody. All the best and please dont let them put you unhappy. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Victoria</a> 15:47, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your apology is appreciated and accepted without reservation and I most certainly will go out of my way to help you or anyone else create good, factual articles in Wikipedia.

<p>Thanks for the note, Adam. I don't think Wikipedia has to be worthy of my presence, though. Certainly no place else has ever considered that important. They might stop bouncing Canadians for offending members of other nationalities, though. The quest for knowledge is not, I believe, supposed to be conducted under Marquess of Queensbury rules. If we have to start worrying if we're offending someone else then this place will quickly end up the Tightarsedopedia. Before I disappear for another few weeks I'll go check the excellent article about <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Ontario_c3a0.html" title="London, Ontario">London, Ontario</a> &amp;#8211 a model article. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a> 00:41, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is true that a manual move has been done. However, is it not true that it is impossible for a "Move this page" to be done when another page exists? The other page was a redirect, I believe, and even if the redirect were erased, the automatic move would be prevented. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 22:37, Dec 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was unaware that moving the page would work if it was only a redirect. Well, then, please delete <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Arthur_Stanley%2C_16th_Earl_of_Derby_0bc7.html" title="Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby">Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby</a>.

<p>I did not move any other pages.
