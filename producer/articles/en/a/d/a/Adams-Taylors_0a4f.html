<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adams-Taylors_0a4f.html" title="Edit section: Family members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family members</span></h2>
<p>The family includes several members who occupy powerful or influential positions within the British media, most notably Richard Adams-Taylor (the effective head of the family), and his younger brother, John Adams-Taylor. However, other prominent members of the family are Richard's wife Julia (nee Carter) and his nephew Jake. There are also several younger members of the family occupying minor positions within British media organizations, including the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, Cromwell Productions, and <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewsCorp_eb5a.html" title="NewsCorp">NewsCorp</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adams-Taylors_0a4f.html" title="Edit section: History in the media">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History in the media</span></h2>
<p>The Adams-Taylors, or 'Adams family' as they are known to their critics, first rose to prominence in the mid 1980s, when the two elder brothers made their names launching a series of independent television companies; two of which - Anglander Studios and Delson Productions- were later sold to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada.html" title="Granada">Granada</a>. They then appeared among the group of leading politicians, businessmen and media commentators who advocated reforming or breaking up the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, in line with the prevailing free-market ethos. When the Thatcher government later opted to renew the corporation's charter, on condition that the new Director-General, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Birt_d728.html" title="John Birt">John Birt</a>, carry out a sweeping programme of organizational and management reforms; Richard Adams-Taylor became one of the most vocal critics of both that decision and Birt's later leadership of the BBC. He became particularly famous for the assertion, shared by many, that Birt grossly overemphasised the managerial and bureaucratic aspects of the corporation, at the expense of its creative and programme-making sides. This issue may have been particularly close to Richard Adams-Taylor's heart; as he had himself been a commissioning editor in the BBC's Drama department earlier in his career.</p>
<p>During the course of the 1990s, the two brothers became heavily involved in the various <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicated.html" title="Syndicated">syndicated</a> <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> companies, such as <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian.html" title="Meridian">Meridian</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada.html" title="Granada">Granada</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton.html" title="Carlton">Carlton</a>.</p>
<p>John Adams-Taylor's son Jake also became prominent at this time, as one of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Four_98f9.html" title="Channel Four">Channel Four</a> executives pushing the hardest for the channel to emphasis minority, cult, and youth-orientated programming; rather than follow the path towards direct competition with ITV for the mainstream 'down-market' audience. Within a few years this approach seemed to be vindicated as youth-orientated or path-breaking shows like <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_as_Folk_718f.html" title="Queer as Folk">Queer as Folk</a>, and cult shows like the American-made <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a>, won massive new audiences for the channel, unlike the more ITV-esque <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookside.html" title="Brookside">Brookside</a> and Football Italia.</p>
<p>The two older family members also used this time to branch out into film-making; and their respective production companies had a hand in several of the most successful British films of the era, including <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Jones_Diary_b130.html" title="Bridget Jones Diary">Bridget Jones Diary</a> and the two Oscar-winning historical dramas <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth.html" title="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare_in_Love_3d87.html" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>.</p>
<p>In 1973 Richard Adams-Taylor had married Julia Carter, a distant relative of the British newspaper baron <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Hollick_e0e2.html" title="Lord Hollick">Lord Hollick</a>. In the 1990 (after seeing their three children reach school age), Julia launched a media company of her own, producing articles and segments for major newspapers and magazines on women's and 'lifestyle' issues. Again, the actions of a member of the family proved prescient, as colour inserts targeted at women quickly became a core component of modern print journalism, and one of the principle sources of advertising revenue for their publisher's companies. Deals syndicating her companies produce in leading newspapers such as the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a> made Julia rich in her own right. However her operations were troubled by high-profile feuds with important industry figures such as Barbara Amiel (wife of former telegraph proprietor Lord Black), and Richard Desmond, owner of a string of celebrity and porn magazines including <a href="../../../o/k/%21/OK%21_36f9.html" title="OK!">OK!</a>. When Desmond purchased the group of newspapers which included the Daily Express, Julia decided to terminate her company's involvement in the newspaper market. In part, this was due to her stated opposition to working with a man who owned and produced pornography. But it was also motivated by her reluctance to continue boosting the sales of rightwing newspapers with whose political views she profoundly disagreed. Her company continues to produce various formats of media content for weekly and biweekly magazines, including OK's principle competitor <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello.html" title="Hello">Hello</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to his involvement with the various <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherite.html" title="Thatcherite">Thatcherite</a> reformers of the 1980s, Richard Adams-Taylor is also well known for his associations with the current British Prime Minister, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>. He donated £50,000 to Blair's 1997 election campaign, and was one of the leading media and cultural figures invited to Downing Street in the wake of the Labour Party's victory. He was approached about becoming one of the clutch of New Labour peers (including crime writer <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Rendell_8a40.html" title="Ruth Rendell">Ruth Rendell</a> and film maker <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Puttnam_3d6d.html" title="David Puttnam">David Puttnam</a>) appointed in the summer of 1997 (dubbed 'Tony's Cronies'), but indicated that he did not want to be part of a system he regarded as undemocratic and outdated. He was however highly influential in shaping the new government's policy towards the media arts, and is credited with the creation of a new British Film Council independent of the traditional 'arts policy' elite; and which emphasises modern commercial film productions over traditional arthouse dramas and literary adaptions. Adams-Taylor also courted political controversy as one of several high profile media appointments in 1999/2000 (including <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Dyke_5eac.html" title="Greg Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavyn_Davies_ad9a.html" title="Gavyn Davies">Gavyn Davies</a>) who had donated money to the Labour Party. In the end, he chose to give up the position on the BBC board of governors to which he had been appointed, saying that he didn't feel the limited powers of a BBC governor were worth the hassle of obtaining them, and that he believed the BBC should be subject to much greater and wideranging reforms than the limited measures being developed by Davies and Dyke.</p>
<p>Like much of Britain's liberal media-class, Adams-Taylor lost faith in New Labour after their early performances and the problems of their second term. His company made a number of hostile current affairs programmes criticizing Blair's record on Human Rights and the War on Terror, and questioning his treatment of Britain's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> minority. In 2004, he joined with several other prominent members of the British film-making community in denouncing Blair's government, and his and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Brown_e90d.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>'s leadership, after changes to the tax laws crippled the British film industry, and forced many productions to move abroad.</p>

<p>Richard Adams-Taylor is still the chairman and active shareholder of several British film and television companies, a commercial director of American TV channel <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a>, and an associate member of the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Culture%2C_Media_and_Sport_0a36.html" title="Department of Culture, Media and Sport">Department of Culture, Media and Sport</a>'s Industry Advisory Board. John Adams-Taylor is the Managing-Director of Alaris Studios; a transatlantic music and media business. Julia Adams-Taylor is, as previously stated, still producing content for British magazines, and is vice-president of the International Council on Women Rights. Jake Adams-Taylor is one of the Principle Commercial Directors of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Four_98f9.html" title="Channel Four">Channel Four</a>, although he recently indicated an intention to leave the corporation within a year to pursue a career in the United States.</p>
