<p>Who ever you are, say what you want, but it does not change the fact that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> is the best vocalist in muisc history. No one can compare. She has impeccable control over her voice; chest register, head register and whistle register. She can execute thrills, adlibs, runs and melismas in whistle register that most singers cannot execute even in full voice. Im certain that is better than just hitting a pitch, like most singers who can go to the B in the 9 millionth octave do. Dont worry yourself about Mariah Carey. It all comes down to the overall voice. Im sure that if you ask someone this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What voice would you like to have:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>5 octaves, with <b>perfect</b> control throughout the entire range, or</li>
<li>7 (or more) octaves with an inability to blend it in the song and mediocre control (at best), they would choose #1 (well, if they had any sense).</li>
</ol>
<p>Belting for 15 years, overworking, stress and age will have an effect on the voice, but even with that, she is still better than all the singers in the contemporary music industry <b>put together!!!!</b> And at the end of the day, even with her 'unhealthy' voice, (as you put it), it is Carey who is raking in millions and getting critical acclaim for her vocals, so too bad for the voice teachers who say her voice is unhealthy. You are a real mariah hater, but go on her article and see all her accomplishments: They dont disappear even when you try to put down her voice on this page.</p>
<p>PS: If you say Minnie Riperton is an alto, you know less about music than I initially thought. Also, Carey was a coloratura soprano at the start of her career (I agree that today, her tessitura lies in the alto range, but she still has soprano coloratura abilities), and yes, she still has all five octaves and she has hit over C7 in her latest album. Any way, Im done with this arguing. This is neither the time and place for this; Wikipedia is not a forum. Im going to go listen to "<a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Belong_Together_d83f.html" title="We Belong Together">We Belong Together</a>", the #1 song in America for 11 weeks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>ok. never mind this hater. He's really a fan of Adam, and who knows maybe, he's the "real" adam lopez defending himself. let him go. lolz. But he knows whether his Adam or an obsessed fan, adam will never ever outsang mariah! Or Minnie for that matter!!!</p>

<p>"Hater Who ever you are, say what you want, but it does not change the fact that Mariah Carey is the best vocalist in muisc history. No one can compare."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That's Right, anyone who criticise Mariah would have to be a hater, that is the only way you can deal with it, by labelling people. In that case, that would make you a narrowed mined, ignorant, fanatic Carey fan, who would just about write anything to defend her and comfort yourself. Sure she’s all that and more, just keep telling yourself that. LOL@you!!</p>
<p><br />
“She has impeccable control over her voice; chest register, head register and whistle register.

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
MC has very little head voice range, plus they don’t resonates, they’re thin and airy, she’s in whistle register C6 onwards. MC’s vocalizations can not be recognised as thrills or runs in classical sense, because she does not sing arias and her voice lacks of the essential qualities of a colouratura soprano voice. When are you gonna learn? Coloratura soprano is NOT just about hitting high notes, plus they have to be sung in head voice NOT whistle register!</p>
<p><br />
“Im sure that if you ask someone this question: • What voice would you like to have: 1. 5 octaves, with perfect control throughout the entire range, or 2. 7 (or more) octaves with an inability to blend it in the song and mediocre control (at best), they would choose #1 (well, if they had any sense).”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Oh please, stop with 5 octaves already, like I said, it’s been a LONG time since she hit a G#7, perfect control? She’s far from that, c’mon. Both Carey and Adam have the ability to blend their voices, from chest to falsetto to whistler register.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>oh! i just hit a G7 this morning even without warming up and a proper vocal training. She can do higher than that if she wants to. Everyone can blend their voices but the outputs are not that good as mariah.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p><br />
Barbra Streisand &amp; Patti Labelle both has been singing for more 30 years in the industry, they still kept their range, tone, timber and sound, just like day one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>when did barbra streisand belt? lolz. and patti labelle? she screams. har har har. they don't have the mariah-like belting and patti labelle sounds just like chaka khan, aretha franklin lolz.</dd>

<p>Mariah was never and is not a colouratura soprano stoping bull shitting!!</p>

<dd>mariah is a coloratura soprano so stop hating.</dd>

<p>But not a G#7!</p>

Chart success doesn’t always translate singing ability, you should know.</p>

<dl>
<dd>in mariah's case it always does.</dd>

<p><br />
FYI, I happen to be a MC fan, but I’m wise enough to see her flaws and accept them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FYI you're not an MC fan and i can smell you har har har. you're adam right? har har har.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Adam’s whistle register goes further than MC ever could, its’ a fact, end of story, of course this doesn’t make her a lesser singer, it’s only the case, if you’re insecure about it and have to come out and defend her.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>stop that bullshitting ranging blah blah blah. My whistle can go further than Adam lopez so what's the big deal? I still cannot replace him for that reason and adam cannot replace mariah for that reason too. Mariah is a legend. adam is a legend wannabe. and me a person who can hit higher notes than the two and i'm a legend on my own. har har har.!!!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
SAD TO SEE PEOPLE COULD ONLY RESORT TO PERSONAL ATTACKS AND POINTLESS RAMBLINGS WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF REASONS AND LOGICS, TIME TO FACE THE FACTS PEOPLE!</p>
<p>SURE, MARIAH CAREY IS ALL THAT AND MORE, JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT, ONE DAY IT MIGHT JUST COME TRUE!!!</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Hi all&#160;:)... Enough is Enough!!! This is me Adam Lopez (I have no idea who the above person is...) Firstly, why the hell are you all comparing me to the incredible and the incomparable Mariah, Minnie and God knows who??? I think you're missing the point here... I'M MALE!!!!!!! I am in a completely different category so DROP IT!. I too am a fan of these singers however my style of music is completely different. By the way there is no need to offend when discribing my voice... i'm a TENOR and NOT a baritone, and yes I can sing every single note from my lowest to my highest... and yes I have over 7 octaves - again i'm not saying that i'm the most incredible gay man... I worked my ass off to have what i have. My whistle register cannot be compared to anyone because I use (used lol) classical technique to achieve mine, and that's why it's not a breathy sound... if you don't like it, that's fine as you are entitled to your opinion but please be humane and constructive with your comments.</p>
<p>I shall continue to sing and record as that's what i love doing and I encourage you all to do what you love and please... please... be nice to fellow humans.</p>
<p>Adam Lopez. ps: I will not be writing here again as I have now said my peace. if you have any concerns or questions that you'd like to know simply email me.</p>

<p>^ lolz. so you've been 'monitoring' this page... who knows whether we're talking to a different person or to adam lopez himself.? lolz to that classical technique. I can do it either classical (violin-like) or airy one.</p>
<p>OMG, funny he actually responded or did he? Weird, chill out, everyone has their own opinion. LOL</p>
<p>Mariah carey has hit a C8 live and the clip is actually posted here on wikipedia. Who honestly cares about the range if it isnt singing. This shouldnt be a who can sing the highest column it should be who can produce the highest pitch column. Mariah SANG the c8 during her charmbracelet tour in paris with a riff up against the keyboard and she sustains the note for quite some time. so it was only 2 years ago. So technically she has gone way above the g7 mark within the past 14 years and it was singing not squeaking into a microphone to win a contest</p>
<pre>
        -Brian
</pre>
<p>I totally agree and she didn't appear strained and unlike other artists shes not constantly trying to beat records (it doesn't interest her) though she could definately sing higher than C8 and a professional vocal coach has admitted to hearing her sing higher notes than those produced by a piano.</p>
