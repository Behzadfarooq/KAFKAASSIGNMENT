<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Graves_af15.html" title="Edit section: Playing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing career</span></h2>
<p>After spending several seasons in the minor leagues, Graves made his <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> debut with the Red Wings in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988-89_NHL_season_ca47.html" title="1988-89 NHL season">1988-89 season</a>, playing in 56 games and scoring 7 goals. The next year he was traded to the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Oilers_2a78.html" title="Edmonton Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, where he gained a reputation as a hard-nosed player, compiling over 120 penalty minutes in both seasons he spent with the team. It was there that he won his first <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship.</p>
<p>After joining former teammate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Messier_fe55.html" title="Mark Messier">Mark Messier</a> in New York via free agency, his goal production increased markedly. In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993-94_NHL_season_3b1d.html" title="1993-94 NHL season">1993-94 season</a>, he scored 52 goals to set the Rangers' club record at that time; his efforts earned him a place on the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> All-Star team.</p>
<p>That spring he cemented his popularity with the New York fans by playing a vital role in the team's first <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship in 54 years. That year he was also awarded the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Clancy_Memorial_Trophy_9bd5.html" title="King Clancy Memorial Trophy">King Clancy Memorial Trophy</a> for his work with charities. Although the Rangers' fortunes would wane over the next few years as they sank into mediocrity after the 1997 - 1998 <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> season, he remained one of the most popular players. In June 2001, after winning the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Masterton_Trophy_5064.html" title="Bill Masterton Trophy">Bill Masterton Trophy</a>, he was traded to San Jose, where he finished his career.</p>
<p>Graves is now an instructor at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Rangers_3878.html" title="New York Rangers">New York Rangers</a> youth hockey camp.</p>
<p>Adam Graves won the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a>'s most prized trophy and championship; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stanley_Cup_18dd.html" title="The Stanley Cup">The Stanley Cup</a> in 1994. Graves also won a championship on the international level which is an even greater accomplishment by playing for, and winning for his native <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In 1988 he was a member of the winning Canadien Junior team at the World Championships. In the tournament Graves recorded 5 goals in 7 games. He was also given the honor to captain the 1993 World Championships in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich%2C_Germany_0a92.html" title="Munich, Germany">Munich, Germany</a>.</p>
<p>This time around Graves recorded 3 goals. Again in 1999, Graves represented Team Canada at the World Championships in Norway, scoring 7 points in 10 games.</p>
<p>He played Junior B hockey with King City, north of his birthplace in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Graves then joined the Windsor Spitfires in 1985-86 and averaged over a point per game as an OHL rookie. Graves was then drafted 22nd overall by the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Red_Wings_4b91.html" title="Detroit Red Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> in the 1986 <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> Entry Draft. Grave's big break came in 1986-87 when he scored 45 goals for the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Spitfires_54e1.html" title="Windsor Spitfires">Windsor Spitfires</a> of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">Ontario Hockey League</a>.</p>
<p>He led his team to the OHL championship, the Memorial Cup tournament. Although they didn't win the championship Graves played another year (1987-88) for the Spitfires and was called up for 9 games with Detroit.</p>
<p>From 1987-89 Graves only scored 7 goals in 78 games with Detroit and went back and forth from the Red Wings to their farm team, in Adirondack. Early in the 1989-90 season Graves was traded from the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Red_Wings_4b91.html" title="Detroit Red Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> to the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Oilers_2a78.html" title="Edmonton Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>). The trade was a success for Graves and Edmonton, as he helped the Oilers win the Stanley Cup over the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Bruins_3d6f.html" title="Boston Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>. "It was such an excellent team atmosphere", said Graves of his two years with the Oilers. "We were together as any group of guys in the league. Everyone felt that they were apart of the team- no one felt left out. Because of that, even if you had a small role on the team, you were happy. You were glad to be able to give whatever little you could to the team. You did everything you could". "I have many wonderful memories in my two years with the Oilers. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the team".</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Rangers_3878.html" title="New York Rangers">New York Rangers</a> were interested in Graves at this point and he signed with them in 1991. He recorded 26 and 36 goal performances in his first 2 seasons with the Rangers. During his first year he helped the Rangers to the President's trophy after scoring a league-high 105 points. Even though Graves' play continued to progress in the 1992-93 season, the Rangers fell to 6th place and out of the playoffs.</p>
<p>During the 1993-94 season Graves scored 52 goals and set a franchise record for most goals scored in a single season by a New York Ranger. In the spring of 1994, Graves helped the Rangers win their first Stanley Cup since the 1939-40 season. Graves was awarded the to the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a>'s second All-Star Team at the position of left wing, and was the recipient of the King Clancy Memorial trophy in recognition of his continuing work with charitable causes. After winning the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2001, Graves was traded to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_Sharks_2c4e.html" title="San Jose Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>. Graves played with the Sharks organization for 2 years and tallied 49 total points before announcing his retirement in April 2004.</p>
