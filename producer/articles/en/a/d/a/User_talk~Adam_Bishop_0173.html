<p>Adam, I disagree with your most recent removal of the information at the end of the Labatt Park article. If you are not willing to reconsider it, I am requesting that it be mediated or arbitrated by someone else.</p>
<p>I also wish to point out that there was no discussion of this on Labatt Park's discussion page, just an arbitrary removal by yourself. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Wells_33a7.html" title="User:Barry Wells">Barry Wells</a> 21:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adam, thanks for the link on my talk page, a page I am familiar with. And thanks for telling me what an encyclopedia is and advising me that Wikipedia is not a newspaper article, a travel guide or a telephone book.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding policies, there's also WP policies regarding the 3RR and treating other editors with a little respect to avoid disputes and edit wars -- as in using discussion pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second time I put the info in dispute in to the article, I didn't even know you had already removed it and chalked it up to some sort of an Internet problem in posting information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure the WP policy applies to preclude my posted information at the end of the article (the park is not a commercial entity for example, but a publicly owned heritage site), but I'll leave it at that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Next time I'd appreciate some discussion on a discussion page or on a Talk page rather than three reverts/ removals in rapid succession. Anything else comes off as high-handed. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Wells_33a7.html" title="User:Barry Wells">Barry Wells</a> 23:03, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the info. However, the current name ("Seljuq Turks") is not correct. The accepted name of the dynasty in all major sources, including Britannica and Iranica, is simply "Seljuqs". Calling them "Seljuq Turks" is like adding "Germans" to countless European dynasties.

It appears they just wanted to update the revenue data (which they have done). I suggested that if they want to (and have copyright permission to) add some of the boilerplate info, maybe they could rewrite the article to include it, while preserving or incorporate the previous information (if it is accurate). Seems to be the best way to go about it, although I am concerned about bias/conflict of interest.

<p>Before I go any further, I posted my questions on the Tancred discussion page where I got the following information:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>He and Gaston took hundreds of Muslim prisoners, providing protection to some on the roof of the Temple. However, the following morning he issued a command to the Crusaders to proceed to the Temple and kill the rest of the population that had been assembled there, Muslim and Jewish, both male and female. It may have been that the Western Europeans could not distinguish between the features of the Arab and Jewish populace.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>It was my understanding that Tancred gave protection to those utop the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> and that they were massacred against his wishes. The above paragraph makes it sound like he ordered them to be killed. But at the bottom, it says the Crusaders couldn't "distinguish between the features of the Arab and jewish populace." What does this mean? Does this mean he sent the crusaders to kill Just the Jews, but all were killed instead?

<p>Adam, I happened to notice the current revert thing at <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seljuk_Turks_bec0.html" title="Seljuk Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>. There is a difference, which may be relevant here and may continue to cause problems, between what the template says and what the project page says. The template says "Turkey-related articles". The project page specifically includes the Ottoman Empire, which seems reasonable enough, and carefully avoids claiming any earlier swathes of Anatolian history. But the project page additionally lays claim to the history of Turkic peoples, going back 2000 years. Which is fine, of course, but isn't covered by "Turkey-related articles".</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that this problem will recur, and in much more difficult cases than <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seljuk_Turks_bec0.html" title="Seljuk Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>, but it could perhaps be solved by altering the template to "articles related to Turkey and Turkic peoples". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 12:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. A while back, you expressed concern about the current album templates. Deliberation is currently underway on proposed changes to album infoboxes; a while ago, you expressed concern about certain features related to the templates used in album-related articles. Could you please vote on current proposed modifications to the replacement template? Hopefully, it will make it much easier to maintain than the current template. Also, if you have any comments, questions, concerns, or proposed revisions. Please feel free to express them at the WP Album project discussion page.

<p>-Adam, I disagree with an article of mine that you keep killing. You are improperly deleting it for the wrong reasons. Yesterday I wrote an encyclopedic article entitled "gabrielangel" that you killed for allegedly being a vanity article. It wasn't even about me, and it wasnt vain, it was correct to facts. I reput it up and you killed it again, citing insignificance. If thousands of people are trying to research this topic, it can't be that insignificant, can it be? Today you killed the article again for a thrid time when i tried to put it up a third time for the reason that one cant post encyclopedic entries about oneself. Its not about me, I selected the username Gabrielangel after the famous internet celebrity gamer Gabrielangel so i could be anonymous, but i am not him in real life. Are you trying to harass me? You've incorrectly deleted the article for the wrong reasons every time. I'm requesting mediation. From: User Gabrielangel</p>

<p>As an all-knowing admin, I wonder if you could answer two questions about getting an article to look the way you want.</p>
<p>I was wikifying an article earlier and came across a reference to an Act of Parliament. The creator had tried to link the Act thus: Name of Act 1977.</p>
<p>In Australia Acts are not written this way, their names are italicised, like this <i>Name of Act</i> 1977. The date is not in italics.</p>
<p>When I write [[<i>Name of Act</i> 1977]], you can see the link fails. When I write <i>Name of Act 1977</i> the year is italicised. My first question is, how do I link the whole name and year but only italicise the name? There may be many Acts with the same name but different years (as Acts are re-written) and so the year should be within the link.</p>
<p>Second question.</p>
<p>How does one space a paragraph like this</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a)(<i>tab space</i>)a text block all of which lines up on the left after the tab space.</dd>

<p>I suppose I really want to know if the "#" feature can be used to number items by letters, or Roman numerals etc.</p>

<p>Adam, given the length of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labatt_Park_e7c0.html" title="Labatt Park">Labatt Park</a> article and your concerns, what I'll endeavour to do in the weeks ahead is slide some of the content on Labatt Park over to other related pages, such as the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Tecumsehs_27e3.html" title="London Tecumsehs">London Tecumsehs</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Majors_6a57.html" title="London Majors">London Majors</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_McKay_54ad.html" title="Roy McKay">Roy McKay</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Colman_075f.html" title="Frank Colman">Frank Colman</a> etc. While the history of baseball in London is definitely joined at the hip with the history of Labatt Park, since I've started creating Labatt Park/ local baseball-related pages, some of the content can definitely be moved.

The only thing that has kept it from getting deleted is the same systemic bias that has allowed <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_9e1a.html" title="Category:Wikipedia">Category:Wikipedia</a> to grow to encompass dozens of articles. Though I do personally think it is kind of neat to have my own Wikipedia article, it probably should be deleted. Because of WP:AUTO concerns I am not going to post to the AfD, nor will I edit the article, I'll let others sort it out. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 04:20, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering the numerous complaints by people who can't get articles of themselves deleted, I would say speedy deleting an bio of a Wikipedia editor after two AFDs have determined notability is an example of favoritism <i>towards</i> Wikipedia editors, not the other way around. Now I will reinforce the pro-Wikipedian bias by letting it lie. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BT</a> 18:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sadly yet another topid is being hi-jacked by the Wikipedia pan-Iranist extremist.</p>
<p>The Seljuks always spoke Turkish among themselves, initially Persian was the langauge of state affairs.</p>
<p>This all changed when the Seljuk Empire moved its capitol to Konya and Alanya Turkey. In the 13th century after the landmark move of Karamanoglu's who made Turkish the official language of the state, law, science and all other departments.</p>
<p>The Seljuks adopted this change aswell, it was a period were the Turkish arts and culture flourished. Philosophers like Yunus emre, Haci bektashi great poets, writers and historians like Asik Pasa, Sait Emre and Nasreddin hoca. Turkish dictionaries were written, Turkish was promoted and became the official language of all Turkic states in the region.</p>
<p>This environment gave way to the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman.html" title="Ottoman">Ottoman</a> Turks whose official state language always was Turkish.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this obivous part of history, I mean its the basics of history of the Seljuks is AVOIDED, MISSED AND HIDDED.</p>
<p>I mean what is this? Wiki is meant to be objective yet all that ever happens is Iranians trying to make everything Iranain.</p>
<p>I had to work for AGES! to get <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> Khan recognised as a Turk, I literally had to go and proove this basic fact as some Pan-Iranist had actually fooled one of the Admins into thinking Babur was actually not a Turk. When all anybody has to do is read the "Baburname" where he EXPLICITLY says,"I'm a Turk, everyone in Andijan is a Turk and speaks Turki good looks is common among us"</p>
<p>Now will I have to proove another BLATENT fact that Seljuks were Turks and after moving the capitol to Konya-Alanya Turkey triggered a Turkish renaissance, or will Wiki Admin put a stop to this Pan-Iranic fest and add this very important material into the article.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest as an administrator in your role played with the Mirko Norac article. I was in the process of reading the Afd about it and was in the middle of leaving a reply that I thought it should be kept but edited, made neutral or etc in the case that it wasn't neutral. Right as I tried to leave my reply I saw that you'd deleted it I think on the grounds for being bad faith. I hope you don't mind but I undeleted the article and did my best to edit it and make it neutral</p>
<p>Personally, I'd had no knowledge of Mirko Norac and am neutral as far as to whatever his or his followers or dejectors have to say about him. But in all due respect I hate seeing one's ideas censored. I think we should encourage others to make Wikipedia the best we can. If what I've submitted is neutral, I hope that not anyone else reverts it to an unneutral article.</p>

I added a source from Brittanica, that's it, no-one has the right to say that it is not authoritative, it is one of the most authoritative sources out there, pls remember that this is not the place for original research, if you are trying to put forward a thesis, do it outside (doesn't matter if an academician wrote the article, that's exactly the point, it is original research).. I haven't vandalized anything, I have only put forth sources.. Such info is always mentioned in the beginning. Then why is it mentioned that he is Muslim?

<p>Can you please help me out with the Public Access television article. I'm the founder of Public Access in Evansvile, IN. Public Access isn't limited to the United States. Nor did it start in the United States. It's a global thing. Public Access started in Canada. They basically kept the idea and called it a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_Channel_86d4.html" title="Community Channel">Community Channel</a>. Later, people from starting it in Canada and an American <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_C._Stoney_9652.html" title="George C. Stoney">George C. Stoney</a> invited to work on it in Canada started it in the United States.</p>
<p>Inbetween that transition <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_Television_3305.html" title="Guerrilla Television">Guerrilla Television</a> was started by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Shamberg_930b.html" title="Michael Shamberg">Michael Shamberg</a>, who'd suggested that documentary film style be merged with Sony's porta-pac video system. These things happened. They're history. I didn't make them up. I think I'd helped play a role in getting the Wikipedia article to a good point. I'd added a History section, a Challenges of Public Access, &amp; information regarding the current telecommunication deregluation rules associated with it in particular.</p>
<p>The history which was adapted from Bill Olsen's History of Public Access (Which is accepted by the credited Father of Public Access himself George C. Stoney) and put into my own words to avoid copyrights. The Challenges have been experienced by others and myself and were written neutral. The new rules are current topic for Public Access since it involves the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>--[[User:Peruvian]Llama]] encouraged me to do the latter after I told him about it:</p>
<p><br />
you seem like a very patient and well-informed individual, and Wikipedia is always in dire need of both those qualities. If you need any help feel free to get in touch again. Cheers! --User:PeruvianLlama (spit) 05:34, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I've tried contacting him before, since he was the Administrator that greeted me when I became a member, but lately he hasn't answered anyone. This needs to be checked into too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, another known topic for sometime now among all the various Public Access Media groups, but unknown vitually to the layman, is to enforce a name change of Public Access to Community Media. The reason for this is that that would nicely incorporate all that Public Access involves. Another reason for this is that Public Access is often confussed with Public Broadcasting and they are two entirely different things.</p>
<p>Public Access, also called PEG Access (Public, Educational, and Government Access) is often called PEG Access by the producers associated with it, but that name isn't used as an article name because the layman wouldn't likely associate with it. The support of thus using Community Media or Civic Media has been suggested.</p>
<p>The Director of Operations of Cambridge, MA Public Access, and Wikipedia member, and a heavy contributor of the article, <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeaneffel_8afc.html" title="User:Seaneffel">User:Seaneffel</a> was the latest to suggest the idea on its discussion page. I decided to follow Wikipedia's suggestions to be bold with edits and to totally implement the Public Access article under the new Community Media name. Likewise I went and changed the name any where else linked to in the article and that I knew about. I didn't erase the history section or the discussion page in this transfer.</p>
<p>Yet, I did mess up in not using Move feature because of blindsight. Trying to remedy this I tried changing the name of the article again, but this time to Citizen Media, and to correctly do it by using the Move feature. Apparently, this is the point I think a random Wikipedia patroller named <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a> assumed I was vandalizing the article and came in and started making numerous edits to in his mind try to remedy that. In the edit summary he left notes saying I shouldn't rewrite history, that my use of the image of the United States flag and the Canada flag for their respecitve history sections wasn't needed (he deleted them.), and etc.</p>
<p>Most comical of all he reverted the article of an earlier version by me and said so in the edit summary as if to say, "Leave it the way 'this' guy wrote it. He 'knew' what he was talking about." I tried to explain that the earlier edit "was" by me but he didn't seem to get it. Also, the earlier edit he reverted to had an image of an old t.v. set I'd put there, but later replaced with the moving globe image (with the line, Community Media belongs to everyone.). That image could be miscontrued to say Public Access is outdated. The moving globe and line was sought to tell the reader right off that Public Access isn't something old, but something done around the world and that like the world it's constantly changing. Besides that he wrote the following in my talk page:</p>
<p><br />
Could you please discuss major changes like these before you perform them? Mind you, "Public access" is a culturally neutral name. Community Media/Citizen Media is a Canadian term for it, and now several pages are now back to before you changed them so drastically. Ryūlóng 05:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
What I find interesting is that well intended as he was trying to be he doesn't have his facts straight. Nor did his User page show that he was an Administrator, patroller, a Public Access Director or producer, or ect. that I could see. Public Access "is" a cultural neutral name as I've already said, but that wasn't the point. Community Media/Citizen Media 'isn't' a Canadian term for it, which was a problem that I'd fixed by explaining it was a Community Channel in Canada, had came first, but was sometime mistakenly called Public Access.</p>
<p>I admit I got a bit miffed but tried to keep myself composed in leaving him replys in the edit summaries when I tried to revert the edit to a comproise (to the version before I tried to first change the name to Community Media.) and tried to explain that to them, but they kept reverting to their edits, totally removing any eveidence that Canada is where Public Access started, removed the transition period of Guerrilla Television (which I'd put in because an administrator or someone on that article had put up a tag asking people to help link that Orphan article (which I'd started.) with other ones and to incorporate its mention into texts if possible.), and making it look like it started in the United States.</p>
<p>I admired his passion but finally told him on his talk page and or in a edit summary that I admired him, explained as I'd had again, and said if he'd vandalise again I'd get an Administrator. At this point Administrator User:Eagle left me the following message:</p>
<p><br />
Block = I have blocked you for 3 hours, please read up on WP:OWN and other related policys before editing. Thanks! —— Eagle (ask me for help) 06:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
When I tried to edit before seeing this I got a message that explained I'd been blocked for I think mocking, reverting or drastically changing an article, and for accusing Ryulong in the edit summaries. I could understand what Ryulong had to say about WP:POV and what they both had to say about WP:OWN but I don't understand why an Administrator broke Wikipedia's own rules about using a step by step procedure before blocking me. The block is the last resort. The rules say it shouldn't be used first not even in extreme cases. I was cordial but stern.</p>
<p>I expected something like this and the above only strengthened my convictions. Some Wikipedia Administators abuse their power. I'm sorry if I accidentally broke any rules. I admit I'm still a Newbie to Wikipedia (another rule the Administrator didn't take into account. Also, if you look on my talk page or the article's disucssion page you'll see that I've messed up before but it has never been intentional and it's all been a learning process.) but I'm only trying to make Wikipedia be the best it can be. This is what our rules tell us to be: Be bold! If you're wrong it'll be changed and try again. So I am going to try again. But can you please help me and contact Ryulong and Eagle and help settle this matter once and for all. Thank you. Your Brother in Christ,</p>
<p>(Ok, I've seen during the preview that PeruvianLama and Eagle will not link. Sorry. Can you figure out how to get to them from looking at my talk page or the article's discussion page? Thanks.) DavidWJohnson 16:38, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On second look today at <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">User:Ryulong</a>'s changes after having a good night's sleep I realized there was little I disagreed with. I did add "some" readditions and "some" images but that's all, which I described along with an apology in the edit summary. I do still think that Administrator Eagle needs to be looked into simply to help him with future procedure with blocking people, and possible Administrator PeruvianLama if he isn't going to be understandably to honor his duties for the time being because of other business. I still would like you also to keep Public Access on your watch list for a few days or a week to ensure that all goes well. Thanks.

<p>In fact I spent a good part of the day creating the "Sleep and breathing" section that was deleted soon afterwards. I was hoping to expand on it in the months to come.</p>
<p>Could you please explain as to why the decision to delete this section was taken.</p>

<p>Hi. I have a problem about "Seljuk Dynasty". There is Pan-iranist propaganda there. Iranians have put "History of Iran" column irrelevantly. I entered a discussion subject about this problem and i gave reasonable explanations. However, I could not change this column. Please help as administrator...--Karcha 19:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand what your trying to say, but a WikiProject is a way to manage a certain topic, to regulate it and keep it clean, like a custodian. A portal, is a way to connect certain pages, like a spider web, that is easier to use by people who are just looking for information, not trying to contribute anything. The portal is something more public, a WikiProject is something that a lot of people would rather not bother with. btw, I created the Japanese car wikiproject. Anyway, I think the portal and the project are both neccesary, one to help guide people on a certain subject, one to help keep the pages tidy, up to date and well orgainsed in a standardized format. And its a pretty big subject, too. There are hundreds different models on the market in Japan alone, if you add the US/Canada, Europe, and the rest of the world, plus all the past models, its a pretty big subject. True, maybe Chinese cars are less important, but they're getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Why did you revert my edit? The dates match. Why did you delete my link to the closure of the Winchester factory? I know where her journal is in the house. Just because a physical docment has not been found does not mean that it did not happen. If the ffacts that I added are not currently verifiabe just because it is widely known for fact, then commom speculations such as she built it because she was mad should not be included. It especially should not be jst because that was the opinion of newspapers at the time. It would be nice if you could give me an explanation.</p>

<p>Paria is a village on which my 10 yrs. old guest made an article. I showed him Wikipedia to this very intelligent 10 yrs. old guest and encouraged him to make an article. I know, it is not encyclopedic but I want it to be encyclopedic by someone.</p>

<dd>I compiled it from my knowledge of the related literature. Tried to show how the motif has been used before (Herodotus) and since (Freud). I didn't mean to sound like "Cliff Notes" but I think its helpful to separate the angles of view, and keep as many "in play" as the play deserves.</dd>

<p>You removed the unreferenced template that I added to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge_31ed.html" title="Battle of Vimy Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> article. I think the template should stay. There are only two references, which appear to be the source for only two minor statements in the article. There are no references for the rest of it... As per <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, the items in the "Further Reading" section don't really count.

<dd>On further inspection, it seems that the first footnote is the reference for all of the article up to that point. That doesn't seem entirely obvious from looking at the article, but I don't really know how to improve it. It appears to me that the second footnote is the source for "British I Corps provided 132 heavy artillery pieces and 102 field guns to the 863 of the Canadian Corps, or 21 percent of the artillery involved.[2]" Perhaps it is also the source for more of the article, but I can't tell. The rest of the article (last 3 paragraphs of overview, Legacy section, Vimy Memorial section, rest of British forces section) seem to be unsourced. The people who wrote these sections must have gotten the knowledge from somewhere, but I can't tell where. <a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESewebster_24a1.html" title="User:Sewebster">Sewebster</a> 21:50, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe the template is not entirely necessary since the first part of the article (which is a large part of the whole thing) does have a source.

<p>Hello. I was wondering how would one best go about alerting fellow editors interested in similar topics (in this case, medieval history) about articles for which a foreign-language Wiki has a much better version? Is there a tag for this? Even if so, though I doubt its efficacy, would there be a way to use the Middle Ages WikiProject to set up a list of such articles (I noticed <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottonian_Renaissance_9543.html" title="Ottonian Renaissance">Ottonian Renaissance</a> in French and Spanish and <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Heredia_b58e.html" title="Juan Fernández de Heredia">Juan Fernández de Heredia</a> in Spanish)? <a href="../../../s/r/n/User%7ESrnec_6158.html" title="User:Srnec">Srnec</a> 04:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adam, could you either file a RFCU or unblock Agnes?

<p>You should unblock Agnes because I don't think your judgement that she's a troll was reasonable; she's advocating a position strongly, but an indef troll block after just that one stretch of contentious argument on a TALK page is ridiculous by normal trouble user standards. Please don't block people you've gotten into personal arguments with. She deserved a warning or a get-her-attention block at most for what she'd actually done. Please reconsider.

<p>Hi Adam. I have looked through some of the info on this, the RFCU, some of the discussion on the AN/I archive, etc. I'd be minded to unblock and warn about POV pushing. Do you have any objection to my overturning your indef? If you do think it's the wrong thing to do, let's start a new thread on AN/I referencing archive 180. If you don't have a problem with it, let me know. If I don't hear from you within a reasonable time (say a couple of days or so), I will assume assent and go ahead and unblock and document on AN/I.

<dd>If you think that the K of Jerusalem borders (as of 1135) are the misplaced, let me know where and I can change them. I based the borders on the two maps <a href="../../../a/s/i/Image%7EAsia_minor_1140.jpg_beaf.html" title="Image:Asia minor 1140.jpg">here, c. 1140</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/u/Image%7ECrusaderstates.jpeg_66cd.html" title="Image:Crusaderstates.jpeg">here, c. 1100</a> with cross-referencng to <i>Historical Atlas of the World</i>, SBN: 389-00253-4. Of course, I had to make some decisions when these 3 maps showed different borders, and perhaps I made the wrong decisions, or perhaps these maps were wrong. In any case, I am open to suggestions.

<p>Hi, I have an unusual request. Remember last year, there was a messy page move involving the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_f717.html" title="Knights Templar">Knights Templar</a> article, where somebody did a copy/paste move, and we needed to untangle things by deleting an older version of the article? Well, I think we lost a lot of original talkpage discussion along the way, and I'm trying to re-locate it to build a better snapshot of the article history, including finding any notes related to old peer reviews. Since I don't have admin access, I haven't been able to dig very deep. &#160;:/ Would you by any chance have time to track down the original article's talkpage, and copy it to another archive location so that we can see it? Thanks much, <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 01:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, the hyphenated version is incorrect. As the article itself states, the title is most often written in English without the hyphen. As well, the websites for every Canadian LG don't use a hyphen. And, though it may not be a definitive enough source for Wikipedia, I recently edited the Monarchist League of Canada's educational booklet on the Crown to remove the hyphens from the provincial vice-regal title, at the direction of some people who are well versed on the Canadian Monarchy.</p>
<p>As for moving the page, I thought creating a redirect was the proper procedure. --<a href="../../../g/2/b/User%7EG2bambino_708f.html" title="User:G2bambino">G2bambino</a> 16:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
