	    <p>The banned user "Mr. Natural Health", and other users Simonides, and Raul654, along with Zero, have succeeded in banning me from Wikipedia for four months. They had absolutely no reason to do so, but they did it out of sheer hatred and malice.</p>
<p>I find their behaviour dishonest, shocking and unjustified. A few weeks ago Jimbo wrote and said that I am not going to be banned, and that I was just being hysterical. Yet Raul654 told me that Jimbo had authoried this ban. Someone was clearly lying, and I am sure that it was Raul who was not being honest.</p>
<p>Ironically, this uncalled for ban occurs on the heels of a long discussion, in which most of us recognized that several troublemakers were pushing away long-time Wikipedia contributors, and allowing trolls to run wild. Apparently, the clique who banned me is trying to make certain that the trolls run the asylum. Now Mr. Natural Health, Simonides and their sock-puppets can do huge amounts of damage yet again.</p>
<p>Consider the following seven facts. Has anyone EVER been banned from Wikipedia for such a huge amount of time in such cases? NEVER. Not once. There is clearly a lynch mob that hates me, lead by Mr. Natural Health and Simonides, two anti-Semites, one of whom even publicly admitted to being a Nazi. (Yet he wasn't banned for that, but I have been banned for complaining about their harassment.)</p>
<p>Facts about this case.</p>
<p>1* I am not involved in any flame wars. So why the ban?</p>
<p>2* I am not involved in any revert wars or edit wars. So why the ban?</p>
<p>3* The supposed problems are in articles in which the articles HAVE ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED, long ago! So why the ban?</p>
<p>4* I repeatedly take week-long (or longer) Wiki-breaks (like the last 10 days) to let things cool down and allow other people to have their say without any problem. So why the ban?</p>
<p>5* I have taken many contentious articles OFF of my Watchlist, and simply let others do what they want, rather then engage in multiple arguments. So why the ban?</p>
<p>6* I have asked for and successfully used mediation when necessary. So why the ban?</p>
<p>7* I have been successfully working with a large group of others on potentially acrimonious articles, without revert wars, and with great progress being made on many articles. So why the ban?</p>
<p>Folks, this is a clear abuse of the system by a small group of people who hate me. And it won't go unnoticed by the trolls, or Wikipedia haters.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robert (RK)</p>
<p>A small group of people banned me for no reason. In response, on the official Wiki-En list, Fred Bauder made this incoherent personal attack:</p>
<p>&gt; But just today on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Talk%7EHolocaust_denial_examined_5ca9.html" title="Talk:Holocaust denial examined">Talk:Holocaust denial examined</a> &gt; you made the following edit: &gt; ":::HistoryBuffEr, you are clearly makin anti-Semitic &gt; and ad homenim attacks towards Jay, and you are pushing &gt; a Nazi agenda. Your edits will be reverted. &gt; <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 17:58, Oct 14, 2004 (UTC)"</p>
<p>&gt; Now, you may be right. I don't follow the edits in this &gt; area, but still a personal attack. I would have banned &gt; you long ago, but played no role in the arbitration &gt; case. May I suggest you take what happened as a lesson &gt; and learn from it and when you come back take a lighter &gt; attitude and have some fun instead of the constant &gt; uproar.</p>
<p><br />
I am shocked by Fred's lies and condoning of anti-Semitic personal attacks. HistoryBuffEr has repeatedly been filling Wikipedia with multiple ad homenim anti-Semitic attacks, all of which use anti-Semitic terminology straight from Jew-Watch, a Nazi website. In response, MANY Wikipedia users have condemned this person for his outrageous behaviour, and it now looks like he may be banned.</p>
<p>Yet out of all the people who have been condemning his anti-Semitic attacks, Fred Bauder picks on me alone, and dishonestly pretends that I am somehow attacking people? Huh?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Fred Bauder thinks that it is Ok to come onto Wikipedia, harasss people, revert pages, create flame wars, and use racist hatespeech. And no ban. But when multiple people object to such behaviour, Fred uses this as a reason to ban me? And then says that I should have "fun" with this kind of Jew-baiting?</p>
<p>This is precisely the kind of anti-Jewish rhetoric that I was complaining about last year. No one on this list ever bans people for racist hatespeech, even when they admit to being a Nazi (like Mr. Natural Health), or even when they use Neo-Nazi JewWatch tactics, like HistoryBuffEr. Yet objecting to this gross abuse someone is grounds for a ban?</p>
<p>Is obecting to wife-beating worse than beating one's wife?</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Wikipedia is getting a bad rep, and this latest incident will only convince the world at large that Wikipedia doesn't work, and is controlled by hateful extremists. Fred's outrageous blame-the-Jew-victim mentality is an example of Wikipedia at its utter worst.</p>
