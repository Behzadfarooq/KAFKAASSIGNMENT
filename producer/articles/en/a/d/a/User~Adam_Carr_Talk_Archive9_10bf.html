<p>Adam, this isn't your article. I know you put hard work, but everyone else is entitled to make the edits they feel they have to, as long as the edits help.

<p>Okay, I'll admit to screwing up in the German map thingie. But you could have been more respectful with that matter&#160;;) Nor is it relevant.</p>
<p>You are acting like it's your article. As if it is forbidden and that I can't touch it. Instead of mentioning these past incidents and trying to color me as an uber-stupid user, why not just tell me why it's not good. You are beating around the bush. You are telling me irrelevant stuff about past disputes and not about the current issue. The current issue is the naming of the section. And for that matter, you have not studied my edit history at all.</p>
<p>Quit focusing on the past and get tell me why my current edit is so lame. If you say its lame because I'm the one who did made the edit and that you didn't even look at the edit, then I am going to tell you to please stop. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 05:54, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>About Simonides and straw-man arguments against Jews</p>
<p>I am becoming very concerned about the behaviour of Simonides; he has already declared himself an enemy of "Zionist" contributions to Wikipedia, (although he has little idea of what this word really means; he uses this word as slur word.) Simonides's distortion of the content of the anti-Zionism article (and others), and his distortion of the views of Jewish groups, are straw-man attacks. As you know, no mainstream Jewish denomination, organization or group has ever claimed that a criticism of an Israeli policy or government is anti-Semitism; no on here on Wikipedia here is saying that either. Simonides' repeated claims to the contrary are Jew-baiting strawman attacks. They are not only factually false (and thus have no place in an encyclopedia), but will only serve to encourage open anti-Semitism. This isn't about a disagreement on how to phrase facts; this is about his manufactoring of <i>false</i> "facts" in order to hurt others whom he disagrees with. This behaviour is out of line, and if he continues, we may need to bring this up on the Wiki-En list. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 13:41, Jul 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might sound pompous and anachronistic to put the full titles - and so it is - but that does not change either the history or the facts.

<p><i>In reply:-</i></p>
<p>On the Wikipedia edit page it does say that "If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, then do not submit it."</p>
<p>I notice that today I have a banner asking me to consider donating to the Wikipedia - I was considering it, but there is little point if no-one likes what I write.</p>
<p>However, that said:-</p>
<p>Of course you are correct re the style of the monarch etc., and I would have corrected my errors shortly. However as you are so against the very style you may revert if you wish, however would you allow me to have my pompous and anachronistic page elsewhere on the Wikipedia?</p>
<p>I do think that it is of certain interest to see how the styles develop over time, and there may (hopefully) come a day when Australia and Great Britain (my two nationalities) have a republican constitution, and then the styles and titles will change completely.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I do appreciate your (and others) stance on this. And I also very much welcome any information which assists in accuracy of the information and correcting errors.</p>
<p>Although it may appear from my pedantry that I am a proponent of the peerage system the contrary is the case. I would like to be able to demonstrate how the 'dignities of office' have been changing through history and from country to country and conforming to the acceptance of the conteporary 'society', and a historical list of officials seemed to be the ideal place. Because I have close links with Australia, and because Australia is growing away from the legacy of the archaic 'British' system it seemed ideal to demonstrate this initially with that country.</p>
<p>I do agree that most of those looking for a list of GGs etc. would expect to see a plain list of names and dates - but the thing which has got me is that when I am looking for the extra detail I can never find it, which is why I thought this the ideal opportunity to compile it in case there is anyone else in the world like me.</p>
<p>best regards Adam - hope to speak again soon --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnArmagh_d26a.html" title="User:JohnArmagh">JohnArmagh</a> 08:58, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>So what happens when (for instance) Angola has a Head of Government who is not a 'Prime Minister' or when the Head of State assumes the responsibilities of Head of Government as well. Is there then to be a separate list for each Head of Government who adopts a different title or standing?

<p>EPIRUS, LOW ALBANIA by Sherif Delvina</p>
<p>1.1 Testimonies on Albanian authenticity in Epirus . The ethnological characteristics of Epirus are contraries to those of the neighboring Greece.</p>
<p>First, let us start with the position the king had in Epirus. In Epirus the king was not allowed to hold the crown on his head. The rights of the sovereign were limited. Without agreement of juridical institutions, the king could not produce coins, neither could he declare war to another state; nor even conclude peace treaties and alliances with other states. During the war, the king executed the function of a military leader of Epirus, having only rights to commit sacrifices. Look what Plutarch says about Epirus’ kings: “The kings, after committing sacrifices to war’s God in Passaron of Molossia, had the habit to bet with them to defend the kingdom according to the existing laws. This ceremony was conducted in the presence of two other kings, surrounded by their friends, who, on this occasion exchanged a lot of presents”. Pouqueville (1770-1838), illuminist, consul of France near Ali Pasha Tepelena, Characterizes the Passaron of Epirus as “….the city where was seen, maybe for the first time, the august union of sovereign and people, that of monarchic power and liberty”. The ceremony of Passaron is quoted even by W. Tarn, to Antigonus Gonat. Kings such as, First Alceta, Arryba, Aeacidae, Pyrrhus, etc., were dethroned or killed according to the right of revocation. The position of women in Epirus changed from that in Hellas. In Greece reigned “tutela mulierum”. There, the women were excluded by law, from public life (ownership, citizenship and privileged situation, up to kingdom run). In Epirot coins the face of Diona is distinguished, on the side of Zeus of Dodona. In the numismatics of king Pyrrhus, the women held a remarkable place. These coins clearly speak of the high position the Epirus women held, in contrast with their companions’ position in Greece. This is also shown by the richness of female graves, discovered by archeological expeditions. Epirot dances, documented quite perfectly in painted ceramics are also evidence of the important place by the woman kept in this ancient land. A brass slab in Dodona , speaks of an Epirot woman, who offers her slave to another woman of this land, without any mediation.(C.Carapanos “Dodona and its Ruins”, page 55-56, Athens 1878). In Epirus, “tutela mulierum” was inexistent. This conclusion is issued by archaeologist Pierre Cabane. This tutelage was missing in that time even in Thessaly, the Greek researcher, A.M.Vavakos points out. This data coincides with the definition made by Herodotus for Thessaly. According to him, Thessalians were of Thesproti origin. Consequently, logic works. There are confirmed reasons that Epirus has issued brave women, who equaled in bravery with men. It is worth mentioning here the terrible Olympia, the mother of Alexander of Macedonia, who put the golden crown to the killer of her husband, Philip II , or Neris and Dejdameia, who were the last “forte men” of Aeacidae dynasty, which had vanished for ever and left the place to Epirot League. In Butrinto, Pierre Cabane tells, one third of slave owners were women. When he speaks about the limits of this originality, he makes known that the place held by women in Epirus and Northern Greece was the same as that held in Central and Northern Illyria. Reading the history of Epirus kings, you can find a lot of non-Greek names,Guiseppe Nensi observes in his work,”Pyrrhus” Torino, 1953. It is enough to mention Taryps, Arruba, Alceta, Aeacidae, whose historical beings could not be put in doubt. Typical are the names of Trojan cycle; Neoptolemus, Pyrrhus, Alexander, Teucer, Andromaca, etc. These kings made matching bondages with others, out of Epirus, as in the case of Olympia, nother of great Alexander with Philip II of Macedonia. Pyrrhus’s women were not Greek. Antigone was the daughter of Ptolemy, a Madedonian. Brikena was the daughter of Illyrian king, Bardylis, while Lanasa was the daughter of Dyonisus, the tyrant of Syracuse. According to well-known cartographer, Kiepert, the map 1: 5000 000 “Epirus and Thessaly”(Berlin, 1880), is presented as follows: Molossia, 3500 km2; Thesprotia, 2050 km2, and Chaonia, 2400 km2, the total of Epirot League, 7950 km2. In Epirot League, Mollosians occupied almost half of Epirot territory. On page 59 of the work “Pyrrhus”, of Pierre Leveque, it is observed that there existed a kinship tie between king of Taulants, Glaucias, and the royal family of Aeacidaes. Glaucias’s wife, Beroia was an Epirot princess. On page 89 of this book is shown Pyrrhus’s fidelity to his mother’s memory. In her memory, king Pyrrhus produced brass coins, which on the right had his beloved mother’s head, Phtia, daughter of Thessalian Menon. Based on Plutarch, Leveque(I IV) while speaking about the growing strength of Pyrrhus among Taulants, quotes:”The wild place of Taulants was just released of atrocity; it missed the lucidity of Hellenism, which Molossian prices had obtained from Greeks since the time of king Tharyps”. While on page 173, the same author notes:”We can say that Illyrians had remained more barbarous(read: non-Greeks) than Epirots, but Hellenism began to influence them”. The author here means the radiation of Helen culture, which at that time included a major part of ancient world. To “Old world”, vol.III, Chicago, USA, 1983, in “Epigraphic searches in Epirus”, there are noted too, seven months of Epirot old calendar: Gamilios, Apelaios, Agrianos, Kraneios, Halotropis, Datyos, Phoinikaios. But we have to assume the fact that suffixes are put because they are written in Greek language. The months of Epirot calendar are absolutely different from those of Greek calendar. The father of ancient history Herodotus, in his monumental work “The History”, book eight , paragraph 47, a book which is dedicated to muse Urania, confesses that the Thessproti are neighbors with Ambracias and Leucades, who came to Salamina battle against Persians from all corners of Greece. According to Herodotus, Greece ended in Leucades islands, which is to the west part of Acarnania and Ambracias of Ambracia city, the only Hellen colony in Epirot seashore. Epirus did not take part in Trojan War, neither in the war against Persian, nor in Peloponesian War, which was of a Greek character, because Epirus was not included in Hellen community. In Panhellenic Conference, organized by Pericles, none of Epirot cities took part, except for Ambracia , which as it is known, was a Greek colony (Plutarch,Pericles, XVII). For Ephor of Cuma Greece starts in Acarnania; this stands also for Strabo(VIII, 333) During all times Epirus, up to Berlin congress, remained out of Greece historical borders. Ancient historians consider Epirots as barbarous. It is known that at that time if one was called barbarous, it meant that he was not Greek. Greeks use today the word “Epirot” in order to hide the name “Albanian”. Albanians are the overwhelming majority of current Southern Albania inhabitants, which is extended up to Arta bay. Greeks, says Herodotus in his book VII, paragraph II, dedicated to Polymnia muse, charged king Leonidas with 300 Spartans to defend Thermopylae passes, on order to prohibit the entering of barbarians to Greece. Herodotus even in paragraph 146 of his book states that in the east of Thermopylae there was a step and impassable mountain, which extended up to Aeta mountain. To the east this road is limited by sea and some valleys and rivulets. There is only a passing way which goes to Phocis, Greece region, extended to the east by Aetolia. This pass, confesses Herodotus, is protected by a wall, constructed by inhabitants of Phocis. That wall was constructed, because they were frightened by Thessalians, who had come from Thesprotia and were placed in Aeolida (Thessaly).Phocis people had taken these measures to defend themselves from Thessalians, who wanted to subdue and to keep them under their yoke. In ancient times, Cams (Tsams) were neighbors with Phocis people and Thessaly was Thesproty land, thus, Cam. Herodotus data are accurate “he knew Greece quite well, had friendship with Athens’elite, with Pericles, Sofocles, etc. His writings both by the intellectual elite, and the people, were held in great esteem. We should not forget that he knew the places he had been. He was curious for everything, says Gustav Klotsch in “ Histoire ancienne”, vol II, page 3. In page 4, he points out that the father of history remains an un-substituted cicerone for everybody who seeks to know about Greece of the fifth century before Christ. History has been, is and will be, as Latins say, life’s teacher. Here we reming all Albanian political parties that the ancient border of our country with Greece followed the line of Leucades islands, Ionian sea, Acarnania, Aetoli, Phocis , Locris, and ended in the Egean Sea. While today, Odysseus’s sons want to displace our border with Greece to Shkumbin River. The main regions of southern Albania, ethnically and historically Albanians, are even those of Filat, Paramythia, Gumenica and all Epirus up to Preveza, with Ioannina, Konica, Florina and Kastoria. In all these places, in particular in Cameri(Tsamuria), the Albanian language is spoken: it is spoken at home and in safe places out of home. In Greece exist severe orders, issued by Greek government, that Cams should not speak their language. These orders have banned the use of Albanian spoken language in that part of southern Albania, given to Greece by London conference of 1913. Large number of Orthodox people live in those areas, who speak Albanian language, as well as Albanian Muslims, compulsorily converted into Orthodox religion. These Albanians, in informal environments are called by Greeks, Albanophons Greeks, which mean Greeks speaking Albanian language. These inverted expressions, serve the organized chauvinist Pan-Hellenic goals and propaganda. The former Greece’s Prime Minister himself, the notorious chauvinist, Venizelos, confessed that Greece’s North is inhabited by Albanians. Let him speak:”It is absolutely exact that North population is of Albanian origin”. ( L. Skendo, Extrait de la Revue “Les peuples libres”, numero d’avril, les revendications albanaises, Lausanne, 1919). The word “North”, L. Skendo stresses, is understood Epirus to Arta bay.</p>
<p>And now let’s see Greek-Albanian border in the Middle Ages. George Acropolites (1217-1282) has written about the war fought by Epirus despot, Michael II against Byzantine troops. Let’s see what he says on this: “We retreated, thus, up to their borders (the troops of despot Michael II –SH.D), e.i. up to Pirene mountains( the mountains of today’s Pindus-SH.D), which separate Old and New Epirus from the old world.(Georgios Acropolites, Chronical work, publicher, Teubner, Lipsiae, 1903). Greek land, according to Georgios Acropolites, was beyond the mountains of Pindus, thus, Epirus is not a Greek land. We must not forget that Georgios Acropolites has been a diplomat, politian, historian and teacher of Byzantinum’s emperor, Theodor II Lascaris; he has also been chief commander of Byzantine army. But these aforementioned sayings, are admitted even by Theodor Scutariot, Byzantine historian, who was born and lived during the XIII century. He states all these in his work “ Introduction to Chronicles” (K.N.Sathas, Bibloteca Graeca medii aevi VII). George Pachimeris, Byzantine historian of the XII century, who during his life has held important state functions, considers Albanians as Illyrians. He limits Greece to the South Thessaly River. Let’s see what he says for Peneu river (Selemvria). Pachimeris emphasizes that: “Byzantium’s emperor, Michael VIII Peleologue ordered to attack Illyrians and tribal regions, as well as those beyond Peneu river, the so called, true Greece”. (“History”, First Volume, book II 26, page 137, Bonnae, 1835) Pachimeris confirmed that Hellas at that time was confined to today’s Selemvria River, yesterday’s Peneu. These Byzantine historians accurately confirm that Epirus and Macedonia had never been Greek lands. If we go back several centuries before the time of historian Pachimeris, we will see what Hellas included. The reply would be accurately given by Greek scholars. In Sinecdemos of Jerocles (VI century A.D) is pointed out that old Greece at that time included only regions of Beotia, of Attica, Phocis, Euboea and Peloponnesus. Donald Edgar Pitcher in “ An historical geography of the Ottoman Empire from the earliest times to the end of the sixteenth century”..Leiden E.Y.Brill, 1972, expressed himself as follows, about the expansion of Albanians in the second half of the XIV century: ”In the second half of XIV century, in North they extended ot Zeta (Montenegro) and in South between Epirus and Corinthian bay”. It is evident that old and new historians are of the same opinion about Greece’s historical frontiers. Greek chauvinists should never forget that possessions of Gjin Zebenishi were extended from Argiro to Glyk, while those of Gjin Bue Shpata up to Naupactus. Theodor Mommsen in “Storia di Roma Antica”, volume primo, Roma-Torino, Casa Editrice Nacionale, Poux Viarengo,1903, page 362 of book II, chapter VII writes:” Cosi rimesso nel retaggio paterno, tutti si strinsero intorno a lui. I valorosi Epiroti, gli Albanesi dell antichita”.( Thus, just when he was put at the head of kingdom(of fatherhood inheritance), all united around him (King Pyrrhus-SH.D.) Epirot bravemen, Albanians of ancient times). We must not forget that Theodor Momsen (1817-1903) is considered as the most distinguished researcher of ancient Roman world. His glory reached the apotheosis by winning the Nobel Price (1902) at the age of 85 years. He wrote a lot of books and, among them is ”The History of ancient Rome”, quoted above. But let’s proceed. Look here what the well-known Byzantine historian of VI century, Procope of Caesarea, says about our Greek neighbors:”In the war Greeks are called coward soldiers, as though Greece never had a right man”. (Procope of Caesarea, “Omnia”, vol. III, I, Lipsiae). This historian, in aforementioned paragraph sees the difference between Byzantium, which was a conglomerate of peoples, and Greece, which was a part of that multinational empire. The people of Byzantium people, according to Procope of Caesarea, did not feel like Greeks at all.</p>

<dd>I copied this from my reaction on Ahoerstemeiers talk page:&#160;:It is very "dangerous" to write "negative" things about members of the royal family. I live in Thailand and know that making negative marks about the royal family can get somebody into big problems. No matter if it is the truth or not. Theoratically it can result in a block of wikipedia, they are blocking over 10.000 websites in Thailand already, part of them because they are negative about the government etc. For the list search at 2bangkok.com.

<dd>The marriage info is right, but he is married ... again. As for we should not let the Thai govt. dictate the content of our articles. It is known that when it comes to insulting the royal family they do sue around the world for that. Case in point being a restaurantholder in the US last year. I am also putting critical points about the Thai government like intimidation of demonstrators at the XV aids conference on the pedia, but in the Dutch version. Just to clarify on that matter. I am very carefull with matters relating to the royals as I know that that is a very sensitive point. With matters containing the government and pm Toxin I am not carefull.

<p>Thanks for adding the Chiang Mai images to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, they look nice. Had a question, though. The image you label as "Images of the Buddha", I figure, is probably not actually three images all of the same person.

<dd>I don't doubt that a given temple could have many images of Buddha, but for three of them to be arranged in a little display together like that seems strange.

<dd>Well, for the record, a) I am a Buddhist; b) on the other hand, I don't claim any special expertise on Buddhist iconography, particularly not in Thailand; c) I don't want my persistence to give the impression that there's anything important or offensive or something about this. I'm just being thorough. Anyway, it seems to me that when groups of Buddhas are shown together, you still wouldn't say they are "images of the Buddha" so much as images of different Buddhas. And for a Theravada temple to show 50 Buddhas together makes more sense than showing 3, because the former emphasizes that there have been a lot of Buddhas, whereas the latter, I'm not sure what the point is. Theravada doesn't provide a lot of biographical detail on Buddhas other than Siddhartha, so I don't know why they would pick three to show us. On the other hand, the statues in the back do look like Buddhas, to the effect that that's what I would think they were if I saw them in isolation. That's why I would prefer some sort of waffle description. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 11:14, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adam - In case you're interested, I've started a World War II wiki-reader project, and I'm looking for people who are interested - especially people who fact-check articles prior to printing.

<p>Yes, User:Herschelkrustofsky is also subject to the no personal attacks policy. Could you please give me a link to the attack you speak of? When I have that I will see what I can do. I think the case is still open enough that a ruling could be added. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:29, Aug 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good place to look would be <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">Herschelkrustofsky's own user page</a> in which he writes about "organized groups of malicious editors" who "impose the most blatant and obvious propaganda". A quick perusal of Herschelkrustofsky's contributions gives a pretty good idea of whether or not he's likely to ever become a useful contributor. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 20:45, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found this while looking through the article, "There is no way this "dispute" can be "resolved," because LaRouchists are not amenable to rational discussion." Please try to avoid this sort of statement; it implies much. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:14, Aug 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I might offer an opinion, the real problem is that Wikipedia has no strategy for defending itself against people who do not share its objectives. You may consider me to be rude etc, and that is no doubt true, but my reason for being here is to contribute to building a free-access world-class encyclopaedia, which I consider a noble project. I think you will agree that I have made some contribution to that objective. Herschelkrustofsky's only reason for being here is to promote LaRouchism, as you well know. He makes no useful contribution, and is a disruptive and destructive element. I fail to see why you permit him to be here at all. Wikipedia ought to be a community of people committed to its objectives. Once it is clear that a person does not share those objectives, and is here for some other reason, they should be, after due process, asked to leave. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:54, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think our editing restriction (and I still advocate 86ing him from the Lyndon LaRouche article) pretty much address the question of "only reason for being here is to promote LaRouchism". If he can't do that he will probably go away. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:59, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
