	    <p>ADAM FALLON - singer/songwriter from Chicago, IL adamfallon.com myspace.com/adamfallon cdbaby.com/adamfallon</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its dusk. Outside the air is cool, and the stadium lights are on shining on everyone. There are about 50,000 concert-goers singing a song back to Adam Fallon, the headlining act of this nation wide tour. This is Fallons ultimate musical goal. Based on the rapid growth of his audience throughout North America and his new EP, Slightly Used, hitting the market in 2006, he could achieve this goal sooner than he had imagined. From his home base in Chicago, Fallon is building a following throughout the Midwest, Ontario and across the rest of the continent. Audiences are opening up to his style. He has his own unique take on the tradition of the title singer/songwriter, but with an intangible quality that makes the listener feel that deep down, he knows what they are feeling. Fallon moves effortlessly from ballads to upbeat pop to even full-out rock. The 26-year-old Canadian has been at various times, a performer, producer, promoter, and roadie. Fallon is something of a local legend around Belleville, Ontario. One day, he pulled up to an A&amp;W with his former band Pickseed aboard a flatbed truck and drew 300 people for an impromptu concert. It may be his knack for producing and promoting that keeps him so connected to what his fans expect. The typical person at my show tends to be laid back, casual and looking for good live entertainment, Fallon says. They just want to close their eyes, listen to the story, and be carried away. Hes been there himself; Fallon learned at an early age that music could take him away from problems at home and school. He started with the clarinet at age 12 and really developed a deep appreciation for music by age 14. He got his first drum set during that year. Id go into the garage four hours a night, he says, and just put on a CD and headphones and play along. He credits those early sessions with Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins, and the Foo Fighters with honing his skills and helping him feel good about himself on a musical level. (He also includes Led Zepplin, The Beatles, The Who, the Matthew Good Band, Our Lady Peace and the Tragically Hip among his other influences.) As he finished high school and pursued a degree in radio broadcasting at Loyalist College. His songwriting style slowly began to become crystallized.</p>
<p>Fallon considers himself a free-association writer. The majority of my songs are written off cuff, he says. I get an idea in my head and then put the pen to the paper and just start writing because if I think about what I want to say, I will over think and censor myself. Many of his songs spring from experiences with his wife, Kim, who has a profound influence on his art. She serves as Adams muse. Fallon credits her with keeping his creativity on track. Shes not afraid to tell me if something stinks, needs to be better, or if it's perfect, he states. I can sometimes come up with an idea that I've played before and she has a great memory; she will step in very quickly to let me know that Im re-using stuff that I've already done.</p>
<p>Despite his extensive musical experience, Fallon understands the power of collaboration. His five-year co-writing relationship with guitarist Kyle Defreitas, whom he considers a guitar genius, is a good example. After developing the original idea for a song, (lyrics and basic musical structure) Kyle and Adam work on the progression and harmonies and then build the song from there. Two songs on the new EP, Someday and Ignored, are examples of what they can produce together. When NYOC records released the EP, Slightly Used, it was Fallons fourth recording. He recorded a 3-song solo EP with Defreitas in March of 2002 titled The Power of the Voice of One Vol. 1. He then followed that up with a full-length album with his former band, Pickseed. After that, he re-teamed with Defreitas for The Power of the Voice of One Vol. 2. Scott Juba of the-trades.com said, Vol. 2 demonstrates his tremendous versatility as an artist and proves why he is beginning to earn radio airplay in select US and Canadian markets.</p>
<p>We find ourselves back in the stadium. The song is over, the crowd is roaring, and Adam Fallon lets the sound wash over him. Is this a big dream? Sure. But this artist, who backs up the dream with talent, enthusiasm, and a relentless drive to succeed will soon be stepping onto a larger stage.</p>
