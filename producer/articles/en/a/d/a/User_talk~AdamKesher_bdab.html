	    <p>Look, explain to me what exactly you are against in my edits. You are deleting indiscriminately. I am working on adding citations as fast as I can, it is hard enough without you reverting everything to present the data as Israel's deliberate attacks on civilians while leaving some fishy claims intact. Let's work together on it, tell me what you want changed or downplayed, but do not delete so grossly. Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I'd like to work on this constructively too. The edits are non-Wiki because they are <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>, uncited, and represent a rather radical change in a section contributed by hundreds of people. There has been intentional targeting of civilians by both Hezbollah and Israel, as this balanced (<a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>), cited article explains. A contructive addition to the article would be to cite more evidence where this has occured, or cited credible evidence why it has not. The edits merely assert that Lebanese casualties inflicted by Israel are "collateral damage," without citation. While it is easy to understand why this claim might be a convenient and comfortable one to make, it is not supported by fact. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamKesher_e7c9.html" title="User:AdamKesher">AdamKesher</a> 13:48, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Cyde and Preposterous, Thanks for your messages. Yes, I'm certain that these montages of private photographs are released under GFDL and CC-by-sa-2.5. As I said in the talk page, the claim that these are from the BBC is not true: I simply included a pointer to the BBC article "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5184122.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5184122.stm" rel="nofollow">Their bodies litter the road</a>" reporting on this incident. Also, thank you for pointing out that I placed these in the incorrect section -- I caught this myself and have since corrected it. And as for the shock value, that really depends upon the viewer -- the reality of civilian casualties is certainly in the news as we type, and would appear to be just as an appropriate inclusion as BBC's shocking title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamKesher_e7c9.html" title="User:AdamKesher">AdamKesher</a> 14:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedia is very strict about licensing issues. You say these are montages of "private photographs". We need more source information than that. Who took them? For legal reasons, we need confirmation from <i>each</i> photographer that he intends to release his photographs under both GFDL and CC-by-sa-2.5. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 15:04, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Stop adding the images over and over</b>. You may be blocked. You <i>need</i> to answer these source issues first. Copyright law is not insignificant on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 13:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>adam -- I have had some issues with some of the same people you have, such as tasc, where they made ridiculous edits and said they were removing vandalism. However, I think you are doing a disservice to everyone by insisting on adding victim photos on Wikipedia article pages. That is not where they belong. I fully support you adding <i>external links</i> to photo archives and on-the-scene blogs, as you have done, because theycan potentially give a deeper insight into what is going on -- and I think you have been treated poorly by certain extremist elements on Wikipedia who oppose even just a link to someone who might disagree with them. However, I think that when you add victim photos and shock photos, you are weakening your case and displaying a strong bias of your own. Just my two cents...</p>
<p>BTW, I looked at the mediation you are involved in over the 2006 Arab-Israeli Conflict. Although I do not necessarily agree many of the edits you have made that resulted in the mediation, I am very upset at the <i>tactics</i> employed by some of those on the opposite side of the issue, e.g. attacking the mediator just when a compromise was being established. So I would like to see you succeed -- and I think you hurt your case when you post these photos. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 18:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a>, thank you for your comments. I appreciate the opportunity to have a civilized discussion about this. By the way, the photos discussed above appeared in <i><a href="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/news/shownews.jsp?content=w071541A" class="external text" title="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/news/shownews.jsp?content=w071541A" rel="nofollow">Macleans</a></i> (as discussed elsewhere, I was wrong about the copyright).

<dd>Yes, there are two sections "Hezbollah's rocket campaign" and "(Attacks on cililian targets) By Hezbollah." I moved the civilian-related pp to the second section, so that the first one, which is in a military-oriented major section, is focused mostly on the military aspects of their campaign.

<p>Excuse me, but how can you support leaving that thing in the article? If you press the link, you go to Khaleej times, an Arab newspaper. Arab newspapers can be good source on what is happening on the Arab side, but how can they be a source for something that was supposedly broadcast in Israeli radio, but not reported by anyone else (no Israeli or outside sources?) Especially when this is such a controversial and harsh staterment, and when it is not qualified in any way ("An arab newspaper claims" or so)?</p>
<p>But obviously, this comment will remain unanswered, as are all my comments in the talk page so far. So much for discussion. <a href="../../../m/2E/_/User%7EM._Butterfly_a782.html" title="User:M. Butterfly">M. Butterfly</a> 16:36, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I explicitly stated in my comment, it's the reporting of a press release from <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France-Presse_c913.html" title="Agence France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a> (AFP), "the oldest news agency in the world." The fact that the link provided happends to be from a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_edab.html" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> newspaper is irrelevant. The reason you cited in your edit that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;oldid=65573939" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;oldid=65573939" rel="nofollow">there is no way an Arab paper is a goud source for info on Israeli army radio!</a>" is, quite frankly, flagrantly <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>, which led to my conclusion that your deletion was vandalism, in spite of the fact that I would very much like assume good faith.

<dd>Then why not link directly to AFP? Or to any other large paper quoting it? Doesn't the fact that there is no source for this in more serious papers amount to a problem here? Also, not linking to the real source could mean that there was some misunderstanding (intended or unintended) of the original report, nut that can't be verified.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, I will explain my comment. A lone Arab source cannot be a good source for things that are happening inside Israel, because it's not there! the same way that Haaretz can't be a source for what Hizbullah plans, or for the number of Lebanese casualties. In fact, I have been told that Israeli sources cannot even back up any "neutral" claims, and are only good as sources on the Israeli position. Thus, there is no racism in my position, only realism. This is especially important in this case, where the report talks of something rather extrodinary, that has been supposedly broadcast on Israeli radio - do you suppose something like this could be reported in Israeli radio, and not picked up by Israeli sources, CNN, etc.? Especially when this is supposed to be 'official Israeli policy' and when all reports on stated Israeli policy are so different from it (see same page)? be logical.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third, this is a rather extreme claim, so support from one source, in the form of heresay (we heard that Israeli radio said that...) is, in my opinion, not enough to justify its inclusion.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Last but not least, I do not want to fight, and I am definitely not seeking vandalism. I have raised the issue on the talk page and would like to hear what everyone has to say about it (maybe we should move all of this there). The least that can be done is qualifying the statement by saying who said it, and adding that it has not been verified by other sources; However, I still hold that it shouldn't be there at all.

<dd><a href="../../../m/2E/_/User%7EM._Butterfly_a782.html" title="User:M. Butterfly">M. Butterfly</a>, please read what is written. 1. The direct quote is “Army chief of staff Dan Halutz has given the order to the air force to destroy 10 multi-storey buildings in the Dahaya district (of Beirut) in response to every rocket fired on Haifa.” On Haifa. Not total. How many Hezbollah rockets have hit Haifa? Do this math. I believe the numbers are in the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205150,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205150,00.html" rel="nofollow">low tens</a> (please confirm), and there have been "block after block" of residential buildings in south Beirut levelled (low hundreds of buildings), so these armchair calculations appear, to me, to be consistent. But I am open to hearing a counter. 3. No, I don't have subscription to any of the news services.

<p>Since Hezbollah attacked first, it is logical that it should be mentioned first. Then since Israel responded, Israel should be mentioned second. --128.148.154.119 17:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I definitely agree with this logic for the military section. However, for the civilian section, Israel attacked civilian areas first, then Hezbollah responded with its own attack on civilians. It is true that they've been launching rockets at Israelis for a long time, but in the context of this conflict, that's the chronology for civilans. Also, the number of civilian casualties inflicted by Israel has been much, much higher, and is therefore a much more important part of the story, especially the non-Hezbollah Lebanese, which make their first appearance in this article only in the "By Israel" section. Delaying this important factor has the effect of "burying the lead." Finally, in the neutral reporting of any conflict, it's best logically to mix the sequence of AB and BA. Therefore, I would argue that the sequence in the Civilan section should be Israel-then-Hezbollah, which does follow the Hezbollah-then-Israel sequence in the military section. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamKesher_e7c9.html" title="User:AdamKesher">AdamKesher</a> 17:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Argued to be of a high standard"? The policy says "where the website is of a particularly high standard". Not that someone argues that it's of a high standard. In that case all blogs would be acceptable. Almost any external links will "provide a unique resource beyond what the article can provide" This is a restriction in the policy, not the other way around. It says that we should <i>not</i> link <i>unless</i> it provides a unique resource.</dd>

<p>Hello Adam, I know you're just trying to improve the article, but merely changing one word doesn't change the copyright status of the map, because it is based off of a copyrighted source, and it can't be labeled GFDL. What I recommend is that we wither get permission to use it from the authro, or make our own copy, which we have done most successfully in the past.

<dd>But the template now is before verifiable news sources, which also isn't correct. I propose to delete these links, as I don't believe that they add to the article, then move the template down before the blogs, which is where we originally discussed it to go at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-07-25_2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_5016.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-07-25 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-07-25 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>.

<dd>I would firmly opose deleting the links to the verifiable news sites, the updated news maps they provide do give a unique resource we can not provide. The template is at the top of the links because of the inclusion of an unverifiable Google Earth layer, and hirhome.com and such. I'd agree to moving the templates below the reputable sites, if the unverifiable sites were moved or removed from those lists. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 09:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, those images look good- I think you are trying to illustrate bombing damage to that area, described by Halutz?.</p>
<p>Are they ok for copyright? I think also there might be some questions raised on the timestamp for the images. Have they been used by an reputable organisation, journalist, military official to describe bombing damage? That could help in allowing their fair use. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 02:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see above, you said that you received permission from the copyright holder to use this image. If that is the case, would you consider removing the references to "fair use" from the image description page? This image obviously does not qualify for fair use and having the tag on there places it in a category where it does not belong. Just the CC license tag is sufficient. Also, please consider adding to the page a note saying that you received via email permission to release the image under the CC license so that people don't bother looking at the source website for the permission.

<p>I noticed you've asked for arbitration. Well, I'm not sure it's the right way (see my talk page, I've replied to your last comment there). ArbCom might decide to implement the safest, not the best solution, which is most strict policy compliance, and inclusion here has both pro- and con- points, though the pro- seem to be stronger. Possibly a poll or other less strong way would be better for the article.</p>
<p>If you decide to resolve this via arbitration, would you liker me to participate (as third party, not in categories)? -- <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 20:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. BTW, I've posted a reply there (to avoid breaking conversations into unreadable separate statements). Also, one note about policies - they mostly restrict inclusion, but not removal (except for vandalism), so deletionist position always has advantage here; that's why a less formal process might be better. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 21:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a discussion on <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roles_of_non-combatant_State_and_non-State_actors_in_the_2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_30da.html" title="Roles of non-combatant State and non-State actors in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">Roles of non-combatant State and non-State actors in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> talkpage about the inclusion of detail for Israel. I am of the view that Israel should be included but the detail is being continually removed by <a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">User:Tewfik</a>.</p>
<p>Tewfik's argument is what he considers the illegality of Hezbollah under UN 1559 as the reason he removed the detail. However, Tewfik has not removed recent requests of arms sales to Israel such as jet fuel and GBU-28's. I believe he is pushing the POV that aid to Israel is only in response to the current crisis or the illegality of Hezbollah under 1559. US aid to Israel is in fact a long standing agreement responsible for the size and makeup of the IDF. Without the aid they would not have a military capable of engaging in conflict. If you can take a look and support my position (was working under 82.29.227.171) that would be great. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomGalen_5813.html" title="User:RandomGalen">RandomGalen</a> 11:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
