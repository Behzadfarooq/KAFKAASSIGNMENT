	    <p>Adam Douglas Ford was born on May 2, 1972 in LDS Hospital near the Utah State Capitol. He was the second of an eventual nine children. Adam’s early years were spent in BYU married housing as his father finished his degree. After Adam attended kindergarten at Provost Elementary School in Provo, the family moved to Mapleton where Adam graduated from Mapleton Elementary School and Springville High School. In high school, Adam participated in track, cross-country, performance choirs and debate. He was the Reagan-Republican bane of his Democrat history and government teacher, Glen Bird.</p>
<p>After graduation in 1990, Adam attended Brigham Young University (BYU) for a year. He still recalls the Ty Detmer-led football victory over Miami as one of his life's highlights. He claims that storming the field and joining the spontaneous singing “Rise and Shout” was the most euphoric experience of his young life.</p>
<p>Following his Freshman year, Adam served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Tennessee. After a whirlwind of accomplishment, his Mission President, Serge Woodruff, asked Adam to spend his last seven months training the mission to more effectively accomplish the work. Adam loved his mission and counts it as one of the greatest blessings in his life.</p>
<p>After summer term and fall semester at BYU in 1993, Adam joined a study abroad to Moscow, Russia in the winter of 1994. Fortuitously, a BYU senior in Russian and Psychology from Minnesota, Shaleen Smith, also decided to take the journey. After spending most waking moments together (literally) from January through May, Adam surprised Shaleen with a trip to St. Petersburg. On the shores of the lake behind Catherine the Great’s summer palace, Adam proposed marriage. Shaleen’s eyes filled with tears and Adam stood to give her a hug. “Do you want an answer right now?” Shaleen asked. “That would be nice.” Adam responded. “Then get back down on your knees!”</p>
<p>Shaleen finished a masters degree in Teaching English as a Second Language while Adam completed an Honors Thesis on Religious Freedom in Russia. While expecting their first daughter Sariah Marie, Shaleen and Adam went back to Moscow to finish his Honor's Thesis research into the Russian regional laws on religious freedom. Adam graduated from BYU with University Honors in 1996.</p>
<p>And then he joined the Utah National Guard and was whisked away to basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri, where he was given a company leadership award. While Adam wouldn’t wish drill sergeants on anyone, he found great satisfaction in learning to work with a diverse group of young men towards a single goal. He gained a great appreciation of the armed forces and the sacrifices made by America’s soldiers. After basic training, Adam attended the Arabic Basic Course at the Defense Language Institute, became the father of Hannah Rebekah, and graduated in November of 1998.</p>
<p>In 1999 Adam began law school at Duke University. During his tenure at Duke, Adam edited the Practicing Law Institute publication “Structured Finance: A Guide to Asset Securitization,” co-founded the Duke Law and Technology Review, worked for the Duke Office of Science and Technology developing joint-ventures between Duke Medical Center and private-sector companies, became a hard-core Cameron Crazie, and became the father of Rachel Wyoria. Adam joined in the bonfire celebrations after Shane Battier lead Duke to the national championship in 2001.</p>
<p>After graduation in 2001, Adam took a position with one of the oldest and most prestigious Wall Street firms in New York, Shearman &amp; Sterling, followed a couple of years later by a move to one of the largest corporate law firms in America, McDermott Will &amp; Emery. His first assignment was assisting KPMG in the purchase of certain Arthur Anderson offices. Adam represented Parmalat USA Corp., Motels of America LLC, RP McCoy Apparel Ltd., Texfi Industries Inc., and HCA Genesis Inc. as debtor’s counsel in corporate bankruptcy filings. He assisted Enron investors seeking recovery. Adam represented Intelsat Ltd. as a major creditor of MCI/Worldcom, Nord LB as the largest secured creditor of Speigel/Eddie Bauer, and Cho Hung Bank as the largest secured creditor of SK Global America. Adam also represented Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, General Electric, Wachovia Bank, Rhodes Furniture, Cobb County Georgia, Lenzing AG, IDT Corporation, France Telecom and many other clients in various corporate and/or litigation matters. Adam gained amazing legal and business experience in New York.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2001 Adam was in North Carolina while his family was at their home in New York City. Adam was able to get home two days later by car. He will never forget the smell and the smoke and the scar in the landscape. Sariah’s public school held an assembly soon thereafter where each class paraded papier-mâché symbols of America (eagle head, Uncle Sam, statue of liberty, etc) while singing patriotic songs. Some parents wore Sikh or Muslim head coverings some spoke Serbo-Croatian or Greek or Spanish, But all stood together in grief and love for America. The only blonde girl in her grade (literally) Sariah’s school helped heal the wounds of the community.</p>
<p>Shaleen gave birth to the couple’s first son in Manhattan on a hot summer day in 2003. Mom, Dad and Willard Washington took a cab home from the hospital. Adam enjoyed serving as the mission leader of their small church branch and the family hosted Sunday evening cottage meetings each week. After attending a number of Mets and Yankee games, Adam couldn’t resist the allure of history and became a Yankees fan. Adam heard The Boss sing in the Meadowlands and The Who enchant Madison Square Garden. Saturday morning runs in Central Park lead to Adam running the New York City Marathon in 2003. During these years, the family owned homes in Utah while renting in New York. Shaleen and the kids would spend the summers and holidays in Utah and visiting family in Minnesota and Adam would get away from the desk when he could.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2004 Shaleen told Adam she had a strong spiritual prompting that there were “multiple sons waiting to come to our family.” After a personal revelation received during Elder Boyd K. Packer’s talk in October General Conference of the Church, Adam agreed to continue the family past four and Shaleen was soon expecting. When the doctor told Shaleen that twins were on the way, Adam and Shaleen decided that family help would be needed. It was time to relocate to Utah fulltime.</p>
<p>With partners Bryce Higbee and Kathleen Phinney, Adam founded Higbee Ford &amp; Phinney in January of 2006. The firm maintains offices in American Fork and Provo. Adam’s practice focuses on corporate transactions and corporate litigation. His Utah clients appreciate his skill and perspective gained during his years on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Back in Utah, some Republilcans encouraged Adam to run against Jim Matheson for Congress. But Adam wasn’t comfortable with the political landscape he saw in Utah. In New York, Adam maintained his Republican Party affiliation and was thrilled when Mike Bloomberg beat his divisive liberal Democratic opponents.</p>
<p>But Utah has most one-sided political landscape in America. Democratic Massachusetts has Republican Governors William Weld and Mitt Romney, Democratic New York had Republican Governor Pataki and Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg, Democratic California had Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Utah, on the other hand, hasn’t had a state-wide Democratic office-holder since Scott Matheson stepped down as Governor in 1984—over 20 years ago. Utah hasn’t had a Democratic Senator since Orrin Hatch beat Frank Moss in 1976—30 years ago.</p>
<p>Adam was troubled by the one party dominance he saw in Utah and felt that the lack of checks and balances was not healthy. Adam decided to become a Democrat, not because of an abandonment of his historical values of low taxes and individual responsibility, but because he decided that Utahns needed to have electable moderate Democratic Party candidates on the ballot. Adam believes that one party domination is dangerous.</p>
<p>After becoming involved with the Utah County Democratic Party, the state party recruited him to run for the State Senate. Adam is currently the Democratic Party candidate for Utah Senate District 11.</p>
