<p>This is still a work in progess for a potential article for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I testify that the information below originated with myself.</p>
<p>David T. Hill --<strong class="selflink">Adam's Body in Noah's Ark</strong> 02:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I believed the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a> of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> that I was taught in <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a> because I assumed that the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teachers.html" title="Teachers">teachers</a> were telling me the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> based on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facts.html" title="Facts">facts</a>. I was a little dismayed when I found out that <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">man</a> didn't live at the same <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> as the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaurs.html" title="Dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>, however, I didn't lose much sleep on it or on questioning the theory.</p>
<p>It was around this time (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>-79) that my <a href="../../../m/a/t/Math.html" title="Math">math</a> teacher told me a <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">joke</a>. He said, "This group of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientists.html" title="Scientists">scientists</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologists.html" title="Geologists">geologists</a> are digging around in the ice and they come across these two bodies frozen in the ice. Before they have a chance to get the bodies down from the ice to their <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratories.html" title="Laboratories">laboratories</a> for testing they know they have the bodies of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>." And we students were supposed to figure out how they knew, without any testing, that it was Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Now over the years I had forgotten this joke, but it all came flooding back when I read a book called, The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark by Charles Sellier. In one of the chapters in the book the story was told of how the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Society_03a9.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic Society</a> had retrieved a body from <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a> on <a href="../../../m/t/2E/Mt._Ararat_9a6b.html" title="Mt. Ararat">Mt. Ararat</a>, and how they had presented this body to the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian_Institute_d643.html" title="Smithsonian Institute">Smithsonian Institute</a> for testing. One of the witnesses, David Duckworth, said that he had been told that it was Noah's body. However, the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> of the book suggested that it might be Adam's body. As soon as I read that, the joke that my math teacher told me jumped out of my memory. I knew immediately that this was not a joke but was actually what happened.</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of months I tried unsuccessfully to try and find the history of that joke to see if it had been around before the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedition.html" title="Expedition">expedition</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. I tracked down my math teacher but he could not recall where he had heard the joke from. I also discovered that this joke had appeared in the game Mind Trap so I called the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company.html" title="Company">company</a> which is based out of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and the man there said he had heard it from his <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> but he seemed reluctant to spend the time helping me track it down. I was on the verge of giving up when I decided that I would try and locate Mr. Duckworth. I called information for...<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> and surprisingly was successful. The phone conversation was indeed enlightening and I have also included it here. The reader should take the time to read through the whole <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcript.html" title="Transcript">transcript</a>, as it starts out kind of slow, but then picks up.</p>
<p>Mr. Duckworth will be designated with a 'D' and myself with an 'H'.</p>
<p><i><b>TRANSCRIPT OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH DAVID DUCKWORTH JUNE 1996</b></i></p>
<p>H [Asked if it was ok to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record.html" title="Record">record</a> the rest of phone conversation.]</p>
<p>D Ok. The box itself as I recall, ah, well ok right now I'm looking at my <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigerator.html" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a> standing over in the corner ok. That's a two compartment refrigerator, top and bottom. It's got the ice maker, it's a fairly big refrigerator. Imagine a refrigerator; this refrigerator is probably at least five, its probably close to five and a half feet in all the other dimensions, carved out on one piece. Ah, what was odd was it didn't have a top like a <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mummy.html" title="Mummy">mummy</a>'s <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcophagus.html" title="Sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> box, but down at one end it had like a panel that slid into groves, ok that dropped; the box laying on its bottom, this would drop straight down, if you can follow what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>H Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>D Ok like ya know the sliding part was set into groves so that it would slide down and lock. And at the top of this panel there were two holes drilled, there were two holes in the stone itself, I would think, probably put a rope through was my guess at the time.</p>
<p>H Rope or a pole maybe?</p>
<p>D Ah, I don't know, it was two vertical holes, drilled down. I don't know how far down in there they went but they were there.</p>
<p>H Did it look like it was made to view the body?</p>
<p>D No. No it was a solid box. It was just like an <a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblong.html" title="Oblong">oblong</a> piece of stone. Kinda a whitish kinda almost <a href="../../../t/r/a/Translucent.html" title="Translucent">translucent</a> white with, as I recall, sorta like grayish overtones in it. It was very pretty. It was real polished, you know very angular. It wasn't chipped or busted up you know.</p>
<p>H What was the, there was another question I was going to ask ya. Um. Now you were told that it was made out of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabaster.html" title="Alabaster">Alabaster</a> later right?</p>
<p>D Yeah, that's what my friend told me.</p>
<p>H Um. What was the other question that I was going to ask ya? Let me see. Ok, I guess that's all the questions.</p>
<p>D Your best bet on this if you're really into this sorta thing is to contact Earl Cummings' daughter and I'm sure you can get her on information. Her last name is still Cummings and the address is on ... I don't know the street address but its ... <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Gosh, if you found me, you should be able to find her.</p>
<p>H Yeah, I just called information. So she lives in the same <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town.html" title="Town">town</a> than you're saying?</p>
<p>D No, she lives on the same <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street.html" title="Street">street</a> I do. But the deal is, Earl, his wife got real sick and was taken to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> to live with her daughter and then he got real sick and was taken to a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursing_home.html" title="Nursing home">nursing home</a> in California. Course they're both dead now unfortunately. Ok, one of her daughters, and I'm not sure who it is, he had three daughters, have all his papers and research and films, ah, Cummings taped all these <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interview.html" title="Interview">interviews</a> with me and even filmed some of them. Ok, there's also a guy, Renny, ah Michael Renny, who did some conversations with me, and I don't know if you'd be able to find him. Him and Cummings had a falling out, but really if you're interested in Noah's ark, I really recommend you get with one of his daughters, they've got just file cabinets of that stuff.</p>
<p>H The one thing the guy pointed out. I'll just close with this now and I'll tell you what my story is, ah a guy in the book, they said you know that somebody, I don't know if it was you or somebody else, they were told that it was Noah's body. Were you ever told that?</p>
<p>D That sounds right, yeah. I think that's what I was told, that it was Noah himself, supposedly.</p>
<p>H Now, um, the author of the book questioned that because, for a lot of reasons; I can think of several myself, but one of them is that there is supposedly an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic.html" title="Authentic">authentic</a> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb.html" title="Tomb">tomb</a> over in the mountains of Ararat somewhere ya know in the lowlands [Actually near <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>].</p>
<p>D Yeah, I've heard of that. Where supposedly he was buried. I heard about that but to the best of my <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> as I recall, what I was told, I asked my buddy about it and he said something like, "Hey, guess who we've got in that box?" And I said, "Who's that?" And he said, "We think its Noah himself!" And I said, "Oh, really that's great" or something like that, it was none of my business. Now there was some talk earlier, in the department that I was in, that this area, there had been, they found some remains of <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrines.html" title="Shrines">shrines</a> ok and apparently this area had been visited after the grounding you might say. It wasn't like just a <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derelict.html" title="Derelict">derelict</a>. People came back. They found <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation.html" title="Foundation">foundations</a> of <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houses.html" title="Houses">houses</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buildings.html" title="Buildings">buildings</a>, some <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pens.html" title="Pens">pens</a> and stuff I think. There was evidence to indicate that, well like one thing I think was like a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramp.html" title="Ramp">ramp</a> leading up to the side of this, like a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone.html" title="Stone">stone</a> ramp ya know? [Mentioned in the book as having been built by a father and son].</p>
<p>H Right, which was obviously built afterwards.</p>
<p>D Yeah, precisely. So at any rate that's all I really remember. I wasn't one of the major people involved in this. I'd get with Cummings' daughter is who I'd get with.</p>
<p>H Ok. Well I guess that's...</p>
<p>D What's the name of that book? I kinda would like to read it. I've got a better idea. You have access to a copy machine?</p>
<p>H Ah, a <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerox.html" title="Xerox">Xerox</a>?</p>
<p>D Yeah, sure. I'm only in there what one or two pages?</p>
<p>H That particular section ran for about two or three pages and you were mentioned in about a third of it cause they also talked to people that were working at an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Base_1b80.html" title="Air Force Base">Air Force Base</a>, ah, that was the other question. Were you told that it came from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Society_03a9.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic Society</a>?</p>
<p>D Oh, you mean the actual expedition?</p>
<p>H Yeah.</p>
<p>D Yeah. Definitely. No doubt about that. In fact I saw the stuff when they very first brought it in. It was on the loading ramp down in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basement.html" title="Basement">basement</a> of the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian.html" title="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a> and it was actually marked National Geographic Ararat Expedition Sixty-eight or something like that.</p>
<p>H It was labeled Ararat Expedition?</p>
<p>D I believe so, yeah. The boxes were stamped. There was like <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple.html" title="Purple">purple</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamps.html" title="Stamps">stamps</a> or purple penmanship on em but it was definitely Mount Ararat. Ya know, Ararat Expedition National Geographic.</p>
<p>H Ok. Yeah if you want I can xerox it and mail it to ya; is that what you were talking about?</p>
<p>D Yeah. If you could do that I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>H Yeah. I can do that.</p>
<p>D Do you have my address?</p>
<p>H Ah, I've got...New Mexico.</p>
<p>D Ok. You got my name of course, David Duckworth [address withheld]</p>
<p>H Yeah. I appreciate talking to you.</p>
<p>D Yeah, no problem at all, anytime at all. Like I say it's been, sixty-eight, it's been near thirty years.</p>
<p>H Yeah, you look at the <a href="../../../t/v/_/Tv.html" title="Tv">tv</a> and its been like two or three of these mummies they found in the last five years. They found one on the mountains down in, ah <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, they just found another mummy...</p>
<p>D Yeah, the Aztec Maiden they call her?</p>
<p>H Yeah, and I mean whoever, whatever the body is that they have it's gotta be pretty old. How come it's not in the news, ya know what I'm saying? This is stuff that everybody deserves to hear.</p>
<p>D Well it is in the news if you look for it. I mean it's on like the National Geographic. They had a deal just a couple of nights ago on the National Geographic special on her.</p>
<p>H Yeah, but what about this body that they took from Mount Ararat? You don't hear nothing about that, and they've had it for thirty years.</p>
<p>D Well, the theory was, ya know Cummings theory was at the time was, its hard to kinda explain, I mean, well first off at the time they went in and got it they might not have been in our <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territory.html" title="Territory">territory</a> frankly.</p>
<p>H Right. It wasn't. I'm convinced of that.</p>
<p>D It might have been like <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, Chinese territory.</p>
<p>H <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, actually.</p>
<p>D Well Turkey, yeah same thing ok.</p>
<p>H Yeah.</p>
<p>D Now there was some <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> base activity going on in that area at the time. Ah, the Smithsonian was not, well I remember the one comment I remember, in fact I think it's in the original book, was that one of the people said, "If the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a> crazies ever hear who we've got there's going to be a lot of trouble and we don't need it." That was said, I remember that.</p>
<p>H Right, that quote is in the book. But the thing is that means that it's either Noah's body or someone else's more important than Noah.</p>
<p>D It could be. I couldn't tell you on that. This guy, this kinda former friend of mine, that's what he told me but I don't know if he knew frankly. He was a nobody there.</p>
<p>H Yeah. I don't imagine he was allowed to see the body either unless he saw; I was interested in even if someone had seen it from a distance, even if they weren't right up close.</p>
<p>D I think he's seen it. I think they'd taken it out. I think he'd actually seen it.</p>
<p>H Man! Yeah but he wouldn't be able to tell anyways.</p>
<p>D No. So I wouldn't go any; I'm just saying what I was told. I mean you could <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speculate.html" title="Speculate">speculate</a> all day on it. But you know, who knows?</p>
<p>H Well, I'm trying to track it down from a different angle. I don't know, I probably shouldn't even tell you my theory but if you want to hear it you'll probably think I'm crazy.</p>
<p>D Ok, quickly go ahead.</p>
<p>H All right, the guy in the book, he suggested that it might be Adam's body.</p>
<p>D Yeah, ok now, I've heard that before , yeah. That was what Cummings thought.</p>
<p>H Ok, he thought that too. Ok, now have you ever heard the Adam joke?</p>
<p>D No, un uh.</p>
<p>H I'll tell you it quickly. I heard it from my math teacher back in like seventy-eight or nine, and very quickly it's this. These group of scientists were digging around in the ice and they came across these two bodies, and before they had a chance to get the bodies down from the ice they knew that they had Adam and Eve's body. And the question you were supposed to figure out was how did they know?</p>
<p>D They don't have <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navel.html" title="Navel">navels</a>.</p>
<p>H Exactly.</p>
<p>D Yeah. Yeah that was one of the other things about that deal. I've heard that.</p>
<p>H You've heard that joke?!!!</p>
<p>D No, I heard that from one of the guys at the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>H What do ya mean...</p>
<p>D Well the joke was circulating back then. That's; <b>I heard that joke at the Smithsonian at that time, ok.</b></p>
<p>H At that time?!!!</p>
<p>D Yeah, so...</p>
<p>H Had you ever heard that joke before then?</p>
<p>D Not till right now.</p>
<p>H And you probably can't remember who it was you heard it from?</p>
<p>D I think it was a fellow named <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geist.html" title="Geist">Geist</a>.</p>
<p>H Yeah, he's listed in the book too! Is he one of the one's that was on the expedition to Mount Ararat? I can't remember if he works for the Smithsonian or if he worked for the National Geographic Society.</p>
<p>D That I couldn't tell ya. I only saw him a couple of days. He was one with like the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographs.html" title="Photographs">photographs</a> and everything, some of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artifacts.html" title="Artifacts">artifacts</a> and everything, then it just ended. It closed up real quick. This thing only lasted like maybe two days.</p>
<p>H Yeah, no kidding. Do you understand the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Significance.html" title="Significance">significance</a> of if its Adam's body? A body with no navel disproves <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and it proves instantaneous <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation.html" title="Creation">creation</a> [creation <a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_nihilo.html" title="Ex nihilo">ex nihilo</a> - it also disproves <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien.html" title="Alien">alien</a> <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloning.html" title="Cloning">cloning</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seeding.html" title="Seeding">seeding</a>].</p>
<p>D Yeah, I don't know. I'm not into either theory one way or another.</p>
<p>H I used to believe evolution cause that's what was taught in high school, then I read some books from <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationists.html" title="Creationists">creationists</a>' point of view.</p>
<p>D Course there again, a body that old, man, how could you probably tell?</p>
<p>H Well, if it was encased in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resin.html" title="Resin">resin</a> and it was frozen, chances are, I mean look at these mummies on the mountains. They still got skin on em, and they were exposed to the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elements.html" title="Elements">elements</a>.</p>
<p>D You got a point there.</p>
<p>H This one was encased in resin and it was in an alabaster box and it was inside the ark which was covered with ice, chances are, for a majority of its time. Why else would that joke be circulating; I'm actually glad I told you that now. It proves that at one time; what I'm trying to do is track down this joke [Apparently I succeeded]. This joke also appears in a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a>, and I want to find out if that joke was ever around before this event, ya know before the sixties. If I can trace it down.</p>
<p>D That's the first time I heard that joke since nineteen sixty-eight, sixty-nine.</p>
<p>H Really. See, I heard it from my math teacher; I'm going to call him to see where he got it from. As a matter of fact I just did call him and he wasn't home. I gotta call him tomorrow. I'll xerox them papers for ya.</p>
<p>D Actually, the original joke as I recall thinking about it was, "What's the difference between Adam and Eve and an <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange.html" title="Orange">orange</a>?" And orange's have navels. That's what I heard.</p>
<p>H Oh, ok, that's a different twist to it.</p>
<p>D Yeah, you've heard of navel oranges?</p>
<p>H Yeah, navel oranges.</p>
<p>D Yeah, because there was a fellow there Al, Al Marek. He always used to bring oranges to work for lunch. He was into health and fitness. That's where I heard it from. That's who I heard it from.</p>
<p>H Al Merek?</p>
<p>D Yeah.</p>
<p><i><b>END OF TRANSCRIPT</b></i></p>
<p>Now, the significance of this <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversation.html" title="Conversation">conversation</a> didn't really sink in until I had time to <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digest.html" title="Digest">digest</a> it and listen to it several times. David Duckworth identified the National Geographic Society as returning from Mt. Ararat with a body in an alabaster box. But extremely more important than that, he verified that a form of the Adam joke was being circulated at the Smithsonian at the exact same time that this mysterious body is delivered to them by the National Geographic Society.</p>
<p>One joke tells the story from the Geographic Expedition point of view where they are literally digging around in the ice, and the second tells the story from the Smithsonian point of view, who just examined the body, and both together tell the story that they have had the body of Adam for thirty years.</p>
<p>I would emphasize the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociological.html" title="Sociological">sociological</a> ramifications of those two jokes and the fact that one of them was started by a Smithsonian Employee. As they tell us, all <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legends.html" title="Legends">legends</a> have some basis in truth, and the same is exactly true for these two jokes.</p>
<p>So, think about it. How did that group of scientists prove that every <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a> on the earth came from one woman (who they named Eve) and every man from one man? Well, that's because they did <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_testing_b8e3.html" title="DNA testing">DNA testing</a> on Adam's body, that's how. Why do you suppose that there was such a push to finish the Human Gnome Project?</p>
<p>I actually mailed a copy of this phone conversation to the Smithsonian back in like <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, with a $5 bill with <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honest_Abe_878d.html" title="Honest Abe">Honest Abe</a> on it and included a little message that "Honesty is the best Policy" because, their <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> is "The <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collection.html" title="Collection">Collection</a> and defusion of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">Knowledge</a>". They sent me back the five bucks but kept the copy of the phone conversation, if that tells you anything.</p>
<p>So, after this I did a little research and found out several interesting points. I talked to a lady who saw this transcript the first time I posted it on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a>, and she was from Turkey. She said that her father had been involved in the search for Noah's ark somehow and then she told me that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Irwin_19ed.html" title="James Irwin">James Irwin</a> (the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">astronaut</a>) had been in Turkey in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. I wrote her back to verify those dates but never heard from her again.</p>
<p>But this tipped me off and I did some <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> into him, and it just so happens that he was the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World.html" title="World">world</a>'s greatest <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive.html" title="Defensive">defensive</a> <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot.html" title="Pilot">pilot</a> at the time, hands down (its in his <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biography</a>). This was necessary because of the missile activity in the area at the time. In other words, they wanted the best defensive pilot in the World to fly the Body out of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a>, in case they experienced any attacks on the plane.</p>
<p>Just after he got out of the program, he started "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Flight_6fb5.html" title="High Flight">High Flight</a>" which was dedicated to finding Noah's Ark, and he published a book titled, "More then an Ark on Ararat" (read between the lines on that one). In one of his books, he specified that one of his <a href="../../../w/i/f/Wife.html" title="Wife">wife</a>'s <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother.html" title="Brother">brothers</a> (I think) died in a climbing accident, and he himself, on his first expedition to Ararat almost died in a similar accident. And, from I book I just finished reading, at one time he had asked a former <a href="../../../s/w/a/SWAT_0192.html" title="SWAT">SWAT</a> agent (Robert Cornuke the author of, "The Lost Shipwreck of Paul") to act as his body guard on another trip to Ararat. Why did he feel he needed a bodyguard?</p>
<p>James Irwin was the pilot that flew the body home (he also was the first astronaut to pass away - at a fairly young age). Assuredly, the trip to Turkey in 1967 was to allow Mr. Irwin the opportunity to land, and take off from the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trabzon.html" title="Trabzon">Trabzon</a> flight line which, apparently, is a rather tricky one under normal circumstances, much less under fire. According to the book, they flew out of Turkey via Trabzon AFB (which I actually had some dealings with when I was stationed at <a href="../../../s/h/a/SHAPE_f401.html" title="SHAPE">SHAPE</a>) and also <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsun.html" title="Samsun">Samsun</a> AFB, both of which were turned over to Turkey in <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, within a month of the expedition. This looks like a very obvious and odious smoke screen to me. I had pondered the timing of the removal of the body from the mountain for years wondering why they chose that time of the year and then it dawned on me just a couple of days ago (today being <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) that of course they would have removed the body in the middle of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a> to ensure its <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preservation.html" title="Preservation">preservation</a>.</p>
<p>It was this contact with the National Geographic Expedition that (I believe) actually motivated Mr. Irwin to dedicate his life to finding Noah's Ark after he left the Astronaut Program. I also called his ministry and ended up talking to his wife, but she could not verify the above dates either, however, it is very possible the Jim could have kept this information from her as being <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_secret.html" title="Top secret">top secret</a>. The astronauts were sent to various parts of the globe while in training, to places that would be, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographically.html" title="Geographically">geographically</a>, similar to the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface.html" title="Surface">surface</a> of the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moon</a>, and thus, a side trip in secret to Turkey is not unfeasible. Also, more then likely, as he neared the end of any <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statues_of_limitations.html" title="Statues of limitations">Statue of Limitations</a> on the information about the body, he was more and more likely to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publish.html" title="Publish">publish</a> a book on this very subject, having laid the initial groundwork in his previous books, and then he died prematurely.</p>
<p>Now, it is my belief that the box was originally designed to fit into the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King.html" title="King">King</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffer.html" title="Coffer">Coffer</a> in the <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_of_giza.html" title="Pyramid of giza">Pyramid of Giza</a>, but that Noah took Adam's body with him in the ark, and probably Eve's body was left in the pyramid (see <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appendix.html" title="Appendix">appendix</a> below). Recently they have been digging a <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunnel.html" title="Tunnel">tunnel</a> to a secret chamber that they found in the pyramid, but I haven't heard anymore on this.(www.enterprisemission.com&#160;?). The Tunnel was finished like two years ago (around <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> sometime).</p>
<p>As of this update on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> just announced that they are planning on sending an <a href="../../../u/p/u/Upuaut_Project_fb85.html" title="Upuaut Project">Upuaut Robot</a> up one of the air shafts that has some type of <a href="../../../d/o/o/Door.html" title="Door">door</a> and thus, possibly, some type of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber.html" title="Chamber">chamber</a> behind it.</p>
<p>The existence of Adam's body not only proves instantaneous creation, but it proves that there will come a day of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption.html" title="Redemption">redemption</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reckoning.html" title="Reckoning">reckoning</a>, and it proves that this resurrection will be accomplished by the Last Adam - whose birth has been marked on the world's calender for 2,000 years. In fact, this day of redemption may be a lot closer than most people think.</p>
<p>For all that, it should come as no surprise to the reader that <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speilberg.html" title="Speilberg">Speilberg</a> is planning on another <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> movie and two <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumor.html" title="Rumor">rumors</a> are that it will be about Noah's Ark and that it will include Adam's Body.</p>
