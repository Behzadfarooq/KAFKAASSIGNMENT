<p>A number of people have added family details. If we are going to do it for Gilchrist we should do it for ALL cricketers otherwise it is inconsistent. Those wishing to revert back to having Gilchrist's family members will be personally responsible for this. I seek concurrence from Turner on this. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 210.56.65.6 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.56.65.6_30f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.56.65.6">contribs</a>) 11:01, 28 November 2005 UTC.</small></p>

<dd>You clearly have not understood my point. If the other articles do not have the details, it is because they are not known/no one has bothered to add them yet, not because they should not be there. Wikipedia is a work in progress and will always have inconsistencies of this sort. So that is not a good reason to delete something. You suggest now that your real reason is that you don't agree with the concept. I am not particularly interested in adding these details, but I am against removing it for no good reason. You will have to make a fairly good argument against including the information, because it is generally understood that this is perfectly relevant biographical information. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 12:31, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no JPD, you asked me to add details for others, I am clearly not interested in that concept of adding details for others and request that you do. Why should I add info when I don't believe in the concept? and why do then you and others have to give me examples of articles with family info, I merely countered this example. if you are such a strong believer that the same info should be eventually added to others, I'm not stopping you, just that you should be consistent yourself and commence from today adding family info to other cricketers. the debate ends here. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 203.19.11.70 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.19.11.70_6481.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.19.11.70">contribs</a>) 12:38, 28 November 2005 UTC.</small></dd>

<dd>I haven't added any family details to anything, I have simply objected to you removing it. I suggested that you add the details because your reason for removing it was "inconsistency". I didn't suggest that it was your responsibility to do this, but that this is the correct way to fix such an inconsistency. It isn't a good reason to delete material, and so, I will restore the article.

<p>Totally agree with JPD, the fact that many cricketers biographies do not include family details does not mean that they should not be included - family details are I would have thought a normal part of most biographical material. What is written is brief and doesn't include anything other than immediate family - you wouldn't want to say their uncle or cousin is John or Harry or whoever (unless a relation is also notable in their own right - such as Martin Crowe/Russell Crowe). Wikipedia is a work in progress and you can't expect everything to be completely consistent - there is enough important material missing, without taking out perfectly good material - for example the Lindsay Hassett article (admittedly a stub) does not mention that he was captain of Australia - I might do some work on that article myself.Likie 03:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Must admit I am baffled by this section. As far as I'm concerned there has been no suggestion that Gilchrist's walking had anything to do with Ponting being chosen as captain. When Ponting was made ODI captain it was generally regarded as being because opening batsman, wicketkeeper and captain would be too much for one player to take on. Further, the reason that Ponting was made test vice-captain after the World Cup was that he was clearly heir-apparent by that stage and, in fact, Gilchrist was reported as having requested that Ponting replace him as v-c. In my opinion the entire section is misleading and should be removed in so far as it links his walking to his not being made permanent captain.

<dd>I have re-written it removing the inference that the walking incidents affected his captaincy chances. However, I still feel a section talking about the captaincy is worthwhile although I don't think it should draw any parallels with the walking issue as, like you said, it's at best speculative and, in my opinion, has zero credibility. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow007_7d55.html" title="User:Shadow007">Shadow007</a> 11:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since when has an action that has long been regarded as 'good sportmanship' been regarded as controversial?

<dd>Yes, but the language used does not suggest that. "Gilchrist has not shied from controversy in his international career, igniting the 'walking debate' by walking" .</dd>
<dd>He walked and there is controversy, but the opening suggests that he courts it, and the choice of 'igniting' to describe his actions is inflammatory(ha!). The paragraph should be primarily about walking, not about controversy. Practically everything in the world generates some controversy somewhere. That doesn't mean that they need to be included in a controversy section. The section should be called 'Walking' not 'controversy'. After all it's not a list of controversies is it - there is just the one. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacgruder_34c8.html" title="User:Macgruder">Macgruder</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacgruder_6d20.html" title="User talk:Macgruder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Macgruder_006f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Macgruder">contribs</a>) 08:52, 22 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<ol>
<li>There is no mention of his 2000 elevation to vice-captaincy after the Nursegate-Warney scandal.
<ul>
<li><i>There is now, although not using "Nursegate" which I found hard to cite. It was fun reading about Warney's bad behaviour...!<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 21:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a complete blackout on the 2000/01 Australian season, where he captained one Test in Adelaide when Waugh was injured.
<ul>
<li><i>Okay, so blackout removed, no massive coverage but inclusion of the star moment, when he captained his first test, some comments from him and a good citation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 21:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No coverage of March 2001 tour to India.
<ul>
<li><i>Tour now covered including his king pair in the second test, tee-hee <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 11:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So basically there is a big gap of 18 months from early 2000 to mid 2001 Ashes series. He captained another Test at Headingley when Waugh was injured. This is not mentioned, when he let England have a target of 300 on the last day and they made it easily.
<ul>
<li><i>Hopefully considerably more covered now but will add info re:Headingley test into the Ashes 2001 section <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 13:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>No mention of 2001/02 Australian season. This was when they tried to get Hayden into the ODI team, and rotated Gilchrist Waugh and Hayden in the opening slots. Both Waugh and Gilchrist went out of form &lt; 20 average for the season; Waugh borthers dropped, most successful Australian ODI opening combo broke up.
<ul>
<li><i>2001-02 season now covered although not in the detail described above. Fine, mention rotation of openers with Hayden, but the Waugh brothers out etc would be better in the Waugh brothers articles in my opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Rambling_Man_48d1.html" title="User:The Rambling Man">The Rambling Man</a> 17:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elevation of Ponting to captaincy ahead of Gilchrist, the incumbent VC is not mentioned.
<ul>
<li><i>Okay, so maybe unusual but not that amazing. Can you provide a nice citation as to why this is more notable than just interesting, in other words, some citation of controversy?

<p><i>Gilchrist's form slumped, making a rare</i> king pair <i>(two <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_%28cricket%29.html" title="Duck (cricket)">golden ducks</a> in the same match) in the Second Test in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> and scoring just two in his two innings in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>.</i> --&gt; Not sure whether 'form slumped' is a fair comment of what happened. In Mumbai, he had used his slog sweep very successfully against the spinners (though he was dropped early on by SS Das off a top edge). He kept trying the same shot in the next two Test matches and got lbw in four consecutive innings (actually in the first of them - during Harby's hattrick - he had got a thick inside edge onto his pads). It is as simple as that. "Form slumped" seems to hint at something else. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 11:50, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>At the start of the 1997–98 Australian season, Healy and captain Mark Taylor were omitted from the ODI squad as the Australian selectors opted for a more aggressive batting style, choosing Gilchrist and Michael di Venuto.
