<p>Hi Adam -- Thanks! I can't be around much, but it does look like Stbalbach could use some help at Feudalism. I don't know what Zain is playing at, but it seems like an attempt to hijack the article for his own political agenda. I know you're also active on the list, so you might also mention it there if it gets too heated. He's just plain wrong, as you probably well know!

<p>Hi, thanks for uploading <a href="../../../a/l/e/Image%7EAlexius4.jpg_752f.html" title="Image:Alexius4.jpg">Image:Alexius4.jpg</a>!

<p>I'm sorry to say that I don't much about the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vergilius_Augusteus_1062.html" title="Vergilius Augusteus">Vergilius Augusteus</a>. I am most interested in illuminated manuscripts, and so far as I know, it has no pictures.

<dl>
<dd>If it has decorated initials then by my rather low standards it qualifies as illuminated. Right now my standard for inclusion on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Late_Antique%2C_Medieval%2C_and_Renaissance_illuminated_manuscripts_b6f5.html" title="List of Late Antique, Medieval, and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts">illuminated manuscript list</a> is ANY amount of decoration makes it onto the list. Initials can be a bit tricky, if they are merely enlarged, like <a href="../../../b/e/o/Image%7EBeowulf.firstpage.jpeg_2dde.html" title="Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg">this</a>, then I don't count them. If they are decorated like [Image:CathachColumbaText.jpg|this]], then I do include them. t is strange that the Augusteus manuscript never made it into any my art history books though, decorated initials that early would be important. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 01:46, Jan 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that the the decoration of the initials are enough to qualify the manuscript as "illuminated". I wish there were better images available. On another, related topic. Since I created the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Late_Antique%2C_Medieval%2C_and_Renaissance_illuminated_manuscripts_b6f5.html" title="List of Late Antique, Medieval, and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts">List of Late Antique, Medieval, and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts</a>, I have been considering doing away with the "Famous Illuminated Manuscripts" section of the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminated_manuscripts.html" title="Illuminated manuscripts">Illuminated manuscripts</a> article. It is a bit of a misnomer as the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranworth_Antiphoner_f39a.html" title="Ranworth Antiphoner">Ranworth Antiphoner</a> is not particularly famous, and many very famous manuscripts (Utrecht Psalter) aren't on it, because we don't have articles on them yet. I would prefer just to link to the list on a separate page, which can be expanded indefinitely.

<p>It's not so much necessary to have all those cricket categories as convenient.

<p>Hello, I noticed you're an administrator and I have a small problem I've been meaning to ask someone knowledgable about for some time. Early last month I created an article for a former <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assembly_of_First_Nations_dc8f.html" title="Assembly of First Nations">Assembly of First Nations</a> chief, <a href="../../../o/v/i/Ovide_Mercredi_2c9f.html" title="Ovide Mercredi">Ovide Mercredi</a>. Unfortunately I was impatient and when it did not immediately appear after I clicked Save page, I believe I tried to save it again. Eventually it did appear, but unfortunately thanks to my impatience the article is listed twice in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECanadian_Assembly_of_First_Nations_chiefs_035d.html" title="Category:Canadian Assembly of First Nations chiefs">Category:Canadian Assembly of First Nations chiefs</a>. Additionally, for both "phantom" Ovide Mercredi articles when one clicks on the 'What links here' link in the toolbox, no links are reported, despite the fact that it very clearly is linked to from the Assembly of First Nations page. I'd greatly appreciate any assistance you could give in clearing this mistake up.

<dd>By the way, I reviewed this situation as well, since I noticed it during our other discussion. Admins actually <i>can</i> fix the duplication issue, by deleting the offending article and then recreating it. I've done that; article now appears only once in the category list.

<p>Thanks for notifiying me. I sort of suspected the irrationnal bozo who was using the first person plural to refer to himself (or herself?) was Anglique/DW, but I was too fed up from last time to do anything about it.

<p>I got an e-mail from Oirvine today, stating that they're not JillandJack and their blocking was in error. I know that this <i>still</i> fits in with DW/Angelique/JJ's prior pattern of behaviour, but I'm willing to consider that I may have been wrong. How would I go about having their IP reviewed against the other identities? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:10, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>None that I can find; it has a Yahoo! mail address and the only IPs I can find in the headers are Wikimedia's. The Yahoo! profile says Victoria, BC, but we know full well that you can't always take a Yahoo! profile at face value. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:00, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, actually, it's not the only evidence; Oirvine even reinserted some of JillandJack's <i>spelling</i> ("interventionnism", "terroist") and <i>grammar</i> ("the the", inappropriate capitalization) errors, in places where the sole change Curps or I made to the paragraph was to correct the grammar and spelling. And based on the arrangement of what they changed versus what they didn't in one single edit (ie. there are parts that weren't reverted sitting <i>between</i> parts that were), it can't have been just a cut-and-paste job from the old article -- it has to have been either manually retyped, or cut-and-pasted from, say, a file on their hard drive. And if you compare their edit histories, Oirvine's few prior edits consistently coincide with times JJ was <i>not</i> editing; most conspicuously, Oirvine's three-day stretch of edits in January falls <i>perfectly</i> inside one of the very few multiple-day blocks in which JJ made no edits at all. Which, I suppose, is all still somewhat circumstantial, but I think it adds to the balance of probabilities. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:53, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry but facts are that Roman ( Byzantine ) empire still existed few years after fall of Constantinople. That's like saying that Roman empire in western Europe has stopped to exist with fall of Romulus Augustus, forgeting Julius Nepos or roman regular army which has been fighting few years after his death. I can't accept conecting my text about years after 1453 to fall of Constaninople text. Looking your text about Byzantine empire I have make finding that ulmost every has little historical mistakes in facts or years.

I tried using the Battlebox to track it, but you'll see that something isn't quite working when it comes to campaigns. I'd appreciate your help in figuring out how to set up the Campaign information that would populate the box, and then I'll include all the relevant battles. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:33, 2005 Feb 27 (UTC)</p>

<p>hello Adam! Drachenfyre here, thank you for copy editing Melisende with/for me! I still want to flesh out more of her reign and the second crusade- when she met with Eleanor of Aqutaine, and more depth in the church and her building projects... so be prepared for more editing&#160;:) I am still getting used to the wikipedia format. My only previous contributions were on the Naboo posting.. though I didn't have an acct at the time and my edits there are numbers...</p>
<p>As you are a history buff I have a question for you... recently I have taken a keen interest in the lives of midievial ages women, particulary rulerships. I have come across great resource material in my local libary and am reading them with great vigor. Before now I knew women in Wales had greater freedoms then women in other parts of Europe, and now I am learning women in Scnadinavia also held more rights then their sisters in the Med Sea regions. My fundelmental question is this: what inspired William X of Aqutain, Henry I of England, and Baldwin II of Jeruselam to all go against the grain and appoint their daughters as their direct heirs rather then their next male relitive? Each did have a male relitive that would have become king/duke under strict adhereance of salic laws- at the time practiced everwhere. Instead... they compelatly made a change that was so culturally and politically avantguard. What is more is they all three did it within the same generation... my examples here are contemparies! What are your thoughts?</p>
<p><br />
== Yes.. mostly from the source I cited... I have it in front of me now and it is invaulable. I checked it out of the Virginia Beach local libary... it seems a compliation of various authors under the title. The author of this particular passage, Benard Hamilton, cites other sources himself.... is it sufficient that I attribte him and not the others... or should I also cites his others... such as Bucher and William of tyre? A few bits on Eleanor and and Melisende I got from a book called Uppity Women of Miieval Times, Damsels Not in Distress, the Lady in the Tower; Medieval Courtsey Lititure for Woman. I do recognize there is a slight feminist leaning to some of the authors (especially of Uppity Women... but WHAT a good read) but as many of this material is already cited elsewhere I trust the interpitations. I never realized that in the Dark Ages women had more rights then the later Middle Ages and Rennisance! What a step backwords! According to more then a few of these sources women could even own land in England during the time of Empress Maude and expect to recive it back if the marrage was annuled/divorced!</p>
<p>Further Question... I have seen Empress Maude's name always with a 'e' behind the 'd'... is this a more Wiki-way to universilize names by dropping the 'e'? ==</p>
<p><br />
Hello, thanx again for mor ecopy editing... my spelling is horrible! I read your artical on the Melisende Psalter... great stuff! But for clarity I had a question. In your artical you list Fulk as the one who commissioned it... I am uncertin if this is so. According to Benard Hamilton in the Mideveil Women artical he writes that Melisende had it commissioned for her. This would make sense as she was known for her patronage to Chrurch, and in keeping with her status as a monarch and dynast. It is possible Fulk had it commissioned, but he would have to had it cleared with Melisende.</p>
<p>It would make sense if he had it commissioned in 1135 or 1136 to reconcile with Melisende... but this is a stretch in light of the absolute control of the situation Melisende had 1136 onwards, and donations to the church previously, and with the suport of church leaders.</p>
<p>Either way, you are the history major so I defer this to you... and feel our two articals should be better reconciled reguarding this.... <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a> 00:57, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think your Benard Hamilton and my Benard Hamilton are one and the same! In the Mideival Women book where I am using -almost- all my material he wrote a very nice chapter entitled "Queens of Jerusalem". It follows about 8 queens, and he writes about how marrying into the female family was more likely to reflect stability, as the men were oft killed in action.</p>
<p>I became interested women in power in the mideival world because there is much reissitance in some forums I participate in that whish to regulate women to no role at all. I had searched the libary and found Melisende and this artical Benard Hamilton wrote and it has become the cornerstone for a thesis I am working on... and I touched on it before in the Melisende artical and you rightly edited it out, about how three very powerful women were chosen over their male relitives to rule after their fathers. Whats more is this happened in the three most important realms in the 12th century. All three were in the same social-cultural realms, or very approximate. I think that is important.</p>
<p>Anywho.. that was a tangent!</p>
<p>I am going to the libary in the morning to see if we have that book here... I would love to read it! I will countinue to add what Hamilton says in this book.. and please come in behind me to be sure nothing is left out.</p>
<p>One difference I noted was he suggests in this peice that Agnes had more direct influence on choosing Guy as regent and never hints that Baldwin was coerced by Guy himself into choosing him. I would liek to reconcile that for sure. Also, I read ahead and the artical on Sibylla seems as though she were a pawn, but he says she held more power then the artical on wikipedia. We can resolve this. I am sure Hamilton worte about Sibylla in your book too.</p>
<p>Lastly, how do you feel about placing an image of the Melisende Psalter on the Melisende page? I think as it is such a masterpeice of her reign (whomever commissioned it) that it would be a badge and credit worthy of display on her page as well. If you are willing to do that... could you do it? I am not that expierenced with posting yet.<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a> 23:05, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the Melisende, the Melisende Psalter looks FANTASTIC! Also, Alberia Torkenkluvin added another fantastic image at the top.. I NEED to know.. is this from the psalter? And if it is so.. am I interpeting it correctly to be Melisende, as Queen, accepting fealty from a vassel? If Fulk commisssioned it for Melisende it might even be his 'apology' and submission after he was all but deposed in the Palace coup, when the Queen was restored to her rights... your thoughts<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a> 00:14, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a text box around the Melisende Psalter image on the Melisende page.. and wanted to enlarge the other image of the queen accepting feality. I could not find instructions on how to enlarge the image, however. Can you help me enlage the top image to the same size as the Melisende Psalter?</p>
<p>I am very excited by the page.. it looks very special now with additional illistrations!</p>

<p>Hello.. I seem to have uncovered a date discrepancy and I know you can help. We know Sibylla died in 1190, and Guy tried to claim the crown dispite the Haute Cour endorsing Isabelle as Queen. However, it says on Guy's page he was crowned in 1192 right after a battle, and yet Hamilton he says Isabelle was proclaimed Queen after Sibylla as Guy only held the crown matromonial- though he does not give the coronation date. We can imagon that tehre was much confusion as the kingdom was almost compleatly conqured. What do your sources say on the cronology of this time? One can imagine great chaos as the kingdom was practically conqured. Who crowned Guy after Sibylla's death? and why was he the forced to Cyprus?</p>

<p>I really like how you fleshed out Baldwin II more! Great job. I visited the French and German Wikipedia sites on Melisende, and there is almost no info there- that is sad to see, so I emailed their most recent posters (hopefully they might read English as well) so they might possibly update their Melisende.</p>
<p>The point to this is.. they have a copy of the Jerusalem coat of arms, and I would think we would want to use that too, incorporating that in all the kingships. What do you think on that? Also, at the libary I have found atleses showing the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the middle ages, are these public domain for Wikipedia purposes? Lastly, on the sources you list under Baldwin II, are you citing the actual work by William of Tyre, or a translation? If you are reading a translated work of William of Tyre then it should be accompanied by the translator's name, publisher and date of publication. I know you have access to more material then I do reguarding the middle ages... so know the material is beyond question. But others would not... and at least would not be able to get their hands on the actual works by William of Tyre.205.143.204.110</p>
<p>HA! In the biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine the author cites William of Tyre, and this is how she credits his work: William of Tyre. A History of Deeds done beyonde the Sea (trans. and ed. E.A. Babcock and A.C. Krey, 2 vols., New York, 1943; reprinted 19976)</p>
<p>I was courious myself on how one would attribute that. It seems she is citing an English translation.. is your book the same as hers or simular? If simular it seems appropriate to list it like she does, if you are translating and interperting the text from the origional latin then I haven't yet found the correct format. I also want to properly credit the artical in Midevial women correctly. 205.143.204.110</p>
<p>I would love to read that book!</p>
<p>YES so you have the book now Medieval Women?! That is exactly what it's title is! Have you read through the Queens of Jerusalem? Does the naration fit with what has been witten and your own interpertaions? Also.. we should correctly format the attibution.... the positions here should be creditable. There is a second quote in the Melisende artical by william of Tyre, it too is in latin but was not directly translated... can you look that up... it was the quote about Melisende.."reseditque regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat"<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a></p>
<p>LOL.. reread your message.. you do not have the bood&#160;:(</p>
<p>Anyway... yes.. I'll read more on Rosalind, the book is invaulable sourece material for further exploration. I am interested in far more then Midevial Women though&#160;:) Its is simply what has obsessed me as of late because I know now what other people said about women is not compleatly true. And there seems to be another connection... the Gnostic-inspired Cathars, under their customs, from 1000's to the Albiginian Crusade, women were more or less equal, and in the Aquitaine author Alson Wise says women could inherit and hold property and administer them automoniously from their husbands estates well into the mid 1200's. Boulonge, where Baldwin I and II and ultimatly the entire Jerusalem line, is from also was a Cathar stronghold. I would not be surprised if that was a contributing factor to Baldwin II;s ease in designating Melisende his heir.</p>
<p>Where would you direct me reguarding female inheritance and their ability to excercise their rights in this periode? What other plausable examples can I research?</p>
<p>So far, I have uncovered authors and books that point out that women excercised much political authority and soical accume in the Dark Ages. Often women represented the link with the prior rulership, and an invading leader would wed the widow of his former enemy, as a show of unity between the conqured and conqurers. During the dark ages, these women sat in council with their husbands and were associated with them in their policial decisions. by the time the Catholic church excercised more influence women were loosing their rights, from thir positions of authority, their ability to engage in commercial activites, and eventually they were excluded from their inheritance or even administering their inheritance, as this became property of the husband, this was by the First Crusade through out to the Albiginian Crusade. The only places which seem to have allowed greater equality for women, according to the authors of the books, is in Cathar regions, and according to John Davies, in under the secular laws of Hwyl Dda in Wales.</p>
<p>I am very much open to other sources, but there is a reason why the common conception of womens roles in the middle ages was that she held no power. Yet, I am finding authors who suggest that they did excercise power and influence by rights and laws common in their realms at the times they lived. Where would you direct someone researching this?</p>

<dd>Well, I suppose the justification is that serious classics scholars are somewhat wary of Wikipedia. I have a certain amount of respect for "smart mobs," but the idea often breaks down in the classics entries. Almost no "real" classical scholars work on the site, mostly because they don't trust it. The WCD aims to integrate a wiki structure with a focus on classics and the academic standards of classics. Another factor is the problem of "hot" topics. The root of the project was an Alexander wiki. Those of us who work on the subject are sick and tired of rehashing the ethnic and sexual issue. The <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> entry here is real battleground of these things, and it turns people off.

<dd>Well, fight the good fight. I imagine the Crusades are subject to similar battles. Oh, I forgot, my other interest is ancient divination and magic. That means the two Wikipedians who, say, read Greek and are interested in the topic are constantly shoved aside by teenage Wiccans whose sources tell them otherwise or who want to link to their tarrot site. Anyway, good luck. <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectiodifficilior_4a42.html" title="User:Lectiodifficilior">Lectiodifficilior</a> 02:40, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Adam! Question.. is it possible to claim past credit for edits one made without being "logged in"? Way back when I first discovered Wikipedia, I rewrote the <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboo.html" title="Naboo">Naboo</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corellia.html" title="Corellia">Corellia</a> articals based off source material I had available. I was not logged in and they remain numbers now. You have read my writting style and I belive you can identify that the rewrite is indeed mine. The question is.. can I be given back credit for that? I will understand if it is impossible. It is just that now the artical is being quoted amongst the Star Wars circles, and the giest of the articals came from the source material I had then. Not to be egotistical, but I would liek to claim some of that credit.&#160;:) What do you think? Is it possible?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm trying to organize <a href="../../../l/e/g/Category%7ELegislators_19d1.html" title="Category:Legislators">Category:Legislators</a>. I'm trying to arrange it so that each country gets one entry for its national legislators (e.g. U.S. senators and U.S. House members are put into <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_U.S._Congress_5b15.html" title="Category:Members of the U.S. Congress">Category:Members of the U.S. Congress</a>, which is then put into the legislators category.

<p>HA! a "premptive mention to prevent a Bloom fan" from mucking it up! I LOVE that! Anywhos, I am courious about the actual plot of the movie, and how they will actually protray they characters. I am sure it will be far off the mark. Though mayhap they will capture the drama of a people in te grip of history, about to lose their world (albiet only 80 years old by that time).</p>
<p>To clarify: Sibylla dies of epidemic in 1190. Hamilton wrote that though Guy atempted to retain his position, the surviving members of the Haute Cour recognized Isabelle as Queen. He does not mention when she was crowned though. During this periode I have learned that her marrage to Humphry was annuled and she married Conrad of Toron. hamilton is silent on the role Richard Lionheart and the French King played in their endorsement of Isabella, but certinly the surviving members of the Haute Cour held more authority over the title given their previous position in the country.</p>
<p>My questions is: was Isabella endorsed as Queen on her half sister's death in 1190? Why do our sources here list her as queen in 1192? Was not Guy simply 'bought off' with Cypres (not REALLY such a raw deal, I mean.. it was a Kingship title of a nation, and already secured for him). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a></p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind reply. I found <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/hotel" class="external text" title="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/hotel" rel="nofollow">this</a> piece of information in the meantime, which I'm afraid implies that you are a "distinctly old-fashioned" person&#160;;-). But seriously, your explanation makes a lot of sense to me. My guess would be that the h consonant is much more distinct when it's in a stressed syllable, which would explain why the use of a/an varies in front of an unstressed h.

<p>Hi Adam, Thanks for the tip. It seems if "dead=alive" then the empty template Template:Infobox pope/alive is inserted which ignores the death parameters. If "dead=dead", the Template:Infobox pope/dead is used which adds a couple of rows to the infoxbox. You still need to put all parameters in the template, whether used or not. I'll have a think about how this might be used in the battlebox templates. It would probably mean adding a new parameter which means updating all articles that use the template. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 22:42, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy; saw your comment on the Sebastien Lefebvre Vfd. AFAICT, a "vanity" article isn't neccessarily limited to one written by a member of a group or the subject of the article or someone associated with the subject. Vanity is a catchall term that includes "non-notable and non-encyclopedic articles about people." Anyone can write a "vanity" article about someone that they're not personally involved with. Given the recent astouding proliferation of band stubs, this may need clarification on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 18:11, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, you've been around here for a while, so you're definitely more experienced than me, but I think this is a bit of relatively recent but useful "instruction creep" attempting to deal with the proliferation of non-enyclopedic and non-expandable stubs. Check out the last month or so of VfD. Maybe we should create a Wikineologism to help clarify this, say, "fanity" articles. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 18:40, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 919 date comes from the second paragraph of the History section. Since the intro said "as early as" the earliest justifiable date ought to be used. If you want to stick with the earliest definitively recorded date, perhaps the intro should use different wording. I couldn't come up with a non-kludgy way of saying "by 776, but perhaps even earlier, like 919 or the 13th century" (see <a href="../../../7/7/6/776_BC_6b2b.html" title="776 BC">776 BC</a>) so I just changed the number.

<p>Hey there just writing you with a quick tip based on what you wrote on the "[[Microsoft_.NET_Passport" wikipedia "discussion" page eons ago.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>There's a website <a href="http://www.archive.org/|www.archive.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archive.org/|www.archive.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which basically keeps 'backed up' copies of old webpages that it happend to surf across and puts them into an archive. You had mentioned the site FireFly and you're in luck they have some left over HTML pages from the 1998 FireFly.com website. The only thing about archive.org is they don't really keep many images assoc. with most websites because images I assume would take up huge amount of space on their servers. But check it out, if you think you recall where you saw it , it might be able to jog your memory. I don't know the site well enough to find where the message boards were, but thought you might remember it well enough you can probably find it in a second if you wanted to.

<p>I have found that uncareful choice of words and different perceptions of meaning can be the cause of great confusion and misunderstanding. I am very surprised that you called my comments a "rant". Perhaps you are not aware of the nuances of the term? Rant, while it <i>can</i> refer simply to an emotional or bombastic declaration, usually connotes that something that is said in anger or disgust (especially in reference to writings on the internet). Since the comments contain neither anger nor disgust (cloaked or evinced), "rant" is a misleading term.</p>

<p>Hi Adam. Thanks for the note. There was not a lot wrong with the article when I put the tag on, but I seem to recall that I felt the bottom section seemed a bit "fractured" (maybe I should have added some detail to the talk page). Anyway, I like your changes (the sources are good too) and I agree that the tag should be removed as the article looks fine to me now.

<p>Did we every qualify exactly when Isabelle was crowned? Hamilton sugested that it was clear to all Jerusalem Lords that Isabelle was queen after Sibylla died. There may have been some lords that suported Guy, but considering the president set in previous succession examples his authority died with Sibylla. I wish for clarity on this point, because he might have tried to maintain his own authroity from 1190 to 1192, but he would be a usurper during this periode as through the succession practices the kingdom was following the crown passed to Isabella, and through her her husband as consort. I have been looking this up with little success myself, so have not altered anything as nothing seems definitive.</p>
<p>by the way.. what did you think of the movie? I was so confused about Balin of Iblin because I never read he was a blacksmith from France! lol. Though Eroul did write that Sibylla and Balain developed a close relationship in 1177 and she wrote passionate letters to him, whe would have been about 17 then. And subsequently she was forced to marry Guy.<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a></p>

<p>Differing geography? wow. I was most excited about seeing Jerusalem itself, and kept looking for "Melisende's ghost"! lol. I noticed a very quick scene of Raymond "partying" in the castle. Preseumably that was the wedding festivities. During this periode it was compleatly correct that Queen Maria and her daughter would have been excluded. I am going to alter the Sibylla page to mention the alleged relationship between Balian and Sibylla, which would have occured between 1177 and 1180. As a historian did think it worthy of note. The Iblins were ambitious to have her married into their family so it is not that far fetched after all.</p>
<p>To the Guy/Isabella question. I agree it was a chaotic time. But considering the traditional succession practices, and considering that Isabella was seen as the rightful queen by all save Guy and his faction, whould not the correct succession box on the Sibylla page read Isabella rather then Guy? His atempt to hold on to power faild him, and ultimatly he was bought off with Cypras. I would see Isabella as Sibylla's ultimate successor, not Guy. Even in light of the chaotic time. Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Same source, Mideival Woman. I had left it out origionally because Hamilton wrote a whole paragraph on it... then said that it may be a suspect account as Eroul was employed by the Ibelin family. Because of this I left it out, as it could not easily be proven that Sibylla did write to him. However, Hamilton himself suggests that it may be true because of the large sum of money Salidan demanded, and he let him go on "security". Salidan may have also assumed that Baldwin would be the next king, or else why would he have demaned such an exhorbant amount then all but release him? Also, the Emporer Manual- according to Eroul and Hamilton, granted Baldwin the money. He would be exceedingly generous if he didnt think he had something to gain by granting Baldwin the money. In the talk page I could I guess type the entire paragraph? There is more there too... about Agnes and Maria Comena that is not on their pages. And about Isabella. The paper was written focused on the eight most influenceial 12th century women in Crusader Jerusalem. I have not yet touched on Isabella because there is a discrepancy reguarding her succession.</p>
<p>I think it most proper that we list Isabella as succedding her sister. Certinly in the minds of the most influencial members of the Haute Cour, those gathered in Tyre, Isabella became Queen because she was next by blood to the previous monarch, and because of the 1183 agreement, and because she was Almeric I's next heir.</p>
<p>It would certinly be appropriate that we list on Guy's page that he atempted to retain his position. But he held no right to the crown after Sibylla's death. Benard Hamilton thought this, and I assume teaches this. So it would be more appropriate to list Isabell as Sibylla's heir, in my humble opinion. (by the way.. I have HUGE late fee's on this libary book. I am looking to see if I can get Barns and Noble to order me a copy from the publisher, as well as some of the translations you suggested!)</p>
<p>I know it is pure accidemic speculation, but HAD Sybilla been able to marry Baldwin of Iblin instead of the detestable toad Guy, she and her children would have "united" the rival Courtney and Iblin factions in court! Lol. And mayhap, things would have worked out different. On a compleatly Fruedian note, it would not be a stretch if Sibylla had an affair with Balian himself, mayhap transfering her affection from one brother to another, it has happened before.</p>
<p>Thank you for the copy editing. I am atrotious! What do you think on the Sibylla to Isabell rather then Sibylla to Guy succession box?<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrachenfyre_10ce.html" title="User:Drachenfyre">Drachenfyre</a> 07:14, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, could you explain for me why you assert that some PM's are styled <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_Honourable_8da6.html" title="Right Honourable">Right Honourable</a> why others are only <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honourable.html" title="Honourable">honourable</a>?

<p>Adam Bishop has suppressed the following introduction:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the popular imaginations of East and West, the complex phenomenon of the Crusades has resolved itself as a series of symbolic and instructive frozen vignettes. Popular history can be recognized as a form of pseudohistory in part by the use made of such imagery. Genuine history is as unclear as the motivation of strangers, and often has little immediate relevance to current events. Popular history is crystal-clear and full of implied prophecies and other vividly direct relations to modern times.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there a phrase in this very carefully worded text that is <i>factually incorrect</i> or that presents a point-of-view that is not within the mainstream? Is there something objectionable in these axiomatic commonplaces? Perhaps there is an uneasy sense that it might be "witty". Would it be more acceptable if it were rephrased in more pedestrian language? Can Adam Bishop provide an alternative introduction to the popular usages of Crusades material, one that distinguishes popular from authentic history, so that the section can be returned to <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusade</a>.

<p>Removed: <b>[[Greek language|Greek]]: Δυρράχιον / Dyrrhachion</b> from the article of the same reason as the user Dori mention above.</p>
<p>The city was a Greek colony in the begining of 6th century B.C. known as Epidamnos/Epidamos and not Dyrrhachion., The Greek form Dyrrhachion comes from the Latin name Dyrrhachium, and the Greek form is not known by others then modern Greeks. The paragraph where Durazzo and Dyrrhachium is mentioned should remain since this two form are very popular, Dyrrhachium is the ancient name for Durrës and Durazzo is another name for Durrës, while Dyrrhachion is just a Greek modern name for Durrës and not known by others then Greek speakers. The Greek form is very irelvant, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dyrrhachion&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dyrrhachion&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">Dyrrhachion</a> gives only 681 hits on google search and almost all the website are in Greek, while the latin form <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dyrrhachium+&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dyrrhachium+&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">Dyrrhachium</a> gives 6 130 hits and almost every site is in English. Then we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Durazzo&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Durazzo&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">Durazzo</a> that gives 71 300 hits and many are in english... The Greek form is not used in English and is not a bit popular for english speakers or anyone els then Greeks.. there is also no Greek minority living in the city, not likely, so why mention the new Greek term for the city?... The Greek name is irelevant and not a good headword, it will not remain in the article.. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> 07:28, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Poll There is a poll in the talk page of Macedonian Slavs article here:</p>

<p>Some people are lobbying for changing the article's name to Macedonian without any qualifier. As it seems, a number of these people come from the Macedonian/Macedonian Slav wikipedia project.

<p>While looking through Edbury's History of the Kingdom of Cyprus the other day, he claims to have compiled a list of the great sergeants of Cyprus through most of the Lusignan period and the titular great sergeants of Jerusalem at the same time.

<p>Adam, a new user has created an article <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_Greece_3163.html" title="Medieval Greece">Medieval Greece</a> that redirects to <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, and then changed the Middle Ages template, removing Byzantine Empire and replaceing it with Medieval Greece.
