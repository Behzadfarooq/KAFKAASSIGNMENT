<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Warlock_5b7b.html" title="Edit section: Publication history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Publication history</span></h2>
<p>In 1972 star Marvel creative team <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Thomas_1d9f.html" title="Roy Thomas">Roy Thomas</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Kane_c7c4.html" title="Gil Kane">Gil Kane</a> decided to revive Him as a hero, renaming him "Adam Warlock" and testing him out in the first two issues of the new "tryout" series <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Premiere_2034.html" title="Marvel Premiere">Marvel Premiere</a></i>. Apparently reception was good, since they gave Warlock his own eponymous series.</p>
<p>The series was not successful; by issue #2 creators Thomas and Kane had minimal involvement, and the plots became redundant, including unpopular twists on classic Marvel characters with inconsistent artwork. The sales were so low that the magazine was discontinued with issue #8 (Oct. 1973), ending with a cliffhanger. The storyline was finally concluded months later in the pages of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_Hulk_3526.html" title="The Incredible Hulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></i> issues #176-178 (June-Aug, 1974).</p>
<p>Many famous comic characters experience a sort of "new origin"; a certain writer or artist (or occasionally both) does a defining run on the feature, solidifying the character beyond their original creation; <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s run on <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp_Thing_e627.html" title="Swamp Thing">Swamp Thing</a>, for instance, or Frank Miller's work on both <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil.html" title="Daredevil">Daredevil</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>. Comics auteur <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Starlin_b282.html" title="Jim Starlin">Jim Starlin</a> has played a similar role for more than one Marvel hero; he brought his talents to bear on Warlock beginning in Feb. 1975 in <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_Tales_90d3.html" title="Strange Tales">Strange Tales</a></i> #178. Starlin began with a brief outline of the character's history thus far.</p>
<p>After <i>Strange Tales</i> #181, the series continued directly to the now-resurrected <i>Warlock</i> #9 (the consecutive issues 8 and 9 having been separated by two years and seven Warlock appearances in other titles). Starlin continued the Warlock vs. His Future Self storyline, and incorporated a continuation of the story of his mad villain <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>, who was the focus of Starlin's epic run on <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar-Vell_89f9.html" title="Mar-Vell">Captain Marvel</a></i> (#25-33, March 1973 - July 1974) and who continues to be his most returned-to character today.</p>
<p>Starlin's combination of under-the-radar philosophy, complex plotline, and psychedelic cosmic art was not immensely popular until years later, but it was popular enough for the Warlock series to continue under his control, even after the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magus_%28comics%29.html" title="Magus (comics)">Magus</a> story was concluded.</p>
<p>After a few issues outside of the epic storylines (including a story involving a comatose earthling called the Star Thief slowly destroying the universe, and concluding with Warlock apparently too physically large to go back to Earth due to a twisted extension of an obscure cosmic theory), loose ends seemingly begin to be tied up with issue #15 (Nov. 1976), wherein Warlock decides to continue his fight against evil and another <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a> storyline begins. However, the series was cancelled once more with no issue 16.</p>
<p>Warlock next made an appearance in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Team-Up_9f4e.html" title="Marvel Team-Up">Marvel Team-Up</a></i> #55 (March 1977), also featuring <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> and some of the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elders_of_the_Universe_bd01.html" title="Elders of the Universe">Elders of the Universe</a>. This story, written by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Mantlo_aa55.html" title="Bill Mantlo">Bill Mantlo</a> and drawn by then-unknown <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Byrne_35d2.html" title="John Byrne">John Byrne</a>, had little relevance to Starlin's meticulous storyline, but it introduced the fact that the Elders each possessed a gem similar to Warlock's.</p>
<p>Starlin finally completed his epic in <i><a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a> Annual</i> #7 (1977), in which Thanos attempts to destroy the universe a second time, killing Warlock's dearest friends <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pip_the_Troll_1ce1.html" title="Pip the Troll">Pip the Troll</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamora.html" title="Gamora">Gamora</a> (Thanos' attractive green-skinned ward and Warlock's possible love interest, dubbed "the most dangerous woman in the universe", introduced in the Magus storyline). Warlock is able, however, to take their souls into his gem, thus saving them (though their physical bodies die). In the end he too perishes, his spirit living on with those of his departed friends and enemies in the world of the soul gem, where everything is at peace.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s Starlin was able to keep away from his neo-cosmic opera, killing Captain Marvel not long later. But at the start of the '90s he couldn't resist, and when he brought his writing talents to the popular <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Surfer_9bd6.html" title="Silver Surfer">Silver Surfer</a> comic (with issue #34), he also brought Thanos. Warlock was not far behind, and the Starlin Surfer issues lead directly into the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Gauntlet_056f.html" title="Infinity Gauntlet">Infinity Gauntlet</a> mini-series, in which Warlock plays a major role.</p>
<p>This resurrected interest in the character, and besides getting his own series (titled <i>Warlock &amp; the Infinity Watch</i>) he was also the star of two sequels to <i>Gauntlet</i>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_War_f142.html" title="Infinity War">Infinity War</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Crusade_78f1.html" title="Infinity Crusade">Infinity Crusade</a>, getting a second running series (<i>Warlock Chronocles</i>), other miniseries, and many notable guest appearances. However, soon readers began to note that each Infinity series told what was in effect the same story repeating over and over again; readers of the Starlin Warlock and Captain Marvel reprints that came out around that time noted that those two stories were nearly identical, and were near-identical to the Infinity stories as well. Starlin's major '80s work, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreadstar.html" title="Dreadstar">Dreadstar</a>, told a similar story; some fans looked at Starlin as utilizing recurring themes, while others viewed his work as endless repetition. Either way, popularity waned and in Feb. 1994 <i>Chronicles</i> was cancelled; that October featured Starlin's last script for <i>Infinity Watch</i>. No more epics were planned, and July 1995 <i>Watch</i> was cancelled as well.</p>
<p>Warlock appeared every so often in cameo roles in the more cosmically-oriented heroes' titles and had some prominence in the <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/Rune.html" title="Rune">Rune</a></i> crossover. At the end of 1998 he returned (with Pip and Gamora) in a four-issue miniseries with a promising storyline ending with the reunited Watch on earth, but nothing more ever came of it. 2004 saw another four-issue series, a reimagining of the character in an extremely artistic way. Both of these miniseries were, like the original 1972 series, simply titled <i>Warlock</i>.</p>

<p>Warlock began as "Him", an artificially-created human, "born" in a cocoon at a scientific complex called "The Beehive". The goal of his creators, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Enclave_%28comics%29.html" title="Enclave (comics)">the Enclave</a>, was to create and subsequently exploit the perfect human. Shortly after he first sprang from his cocoon (which he is capable of creating around himself for protection and rejuvenation), he battled the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_3810.html" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, but soon became aware of his creators' plans for him and rebelled. Having had no parents, childhood, nor any life experience whatsoever (other than the data implanted by the Enclave), Warlock lacked maturity and restraint. Seeing the problems of the world, the being known only as Him reformed his cocoon and fled into space, in slumber.</p>

<p>However, he was soon caught in an asteroid shower and endangered, being saved in the nick of time by the alien being <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watcher_%28comics%29.html" title="Watcher (comics)">the Watcher</a>, who sent Him back to Earth. He ended up in a military atomic research center, which he took over after it was abandoned. It was there he came in contact with the mighty <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29_b08e.html" title="Thor (Marvel Comics)">Thor</a>. Seeing mankind's wrongs, Him despised humanity, and because of this (and the fact that he decided to take Thor's sometimes paramour <a href="../../../s/i/f/Sif_%28comics%29.html" title="Sif (comics)">Sif</a> to become his mate) they did battle. Him finally fled the raging thunder god (in the throes of the Warrior Madness), retreating to the safety of his cocoon<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Here, it is said, Warlock died his first death.</p>
<p>Warlock was transported to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Earth_%28comics%29_3725.html" title="Counter-Earth (comics)">Counter-Earth</a>, an attempt by the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Evolutionary_56cc.html" title="High Evolutionary">High Evolutionary</a> to create a Utopian society out of the framework of the original Earth. It had fallen under the influence of the nefarious <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man-Beast_b6cc.html" title="Man-Beast">Man-Beast</a>, a <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf.html" title="Wolf">wolf</a> that had been genetically modified into humanoid form by the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Evolutionary_56cc.html" title="High Evolutionary">High Evolutionary</a>, and Warlock (the High Evolutionary's surrogate son) was sent to become the savior of this new Earth and deliver its inhabitants from the evil of the Man-Beast.</p>
<p>Warlock faces this supreme villain, the Man-Beast, in the <a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval_office.html" title="Oval office">oval office</a>. Warlock also fights the Hulk, partners with him, then is crucified to save Counter-Earth, and is subsequently "resurrected" from his cocoon. Warlock's recreation of Christ's murder and rebirth on Counter-Earth led to the creation of a planet-wide organized religion. After the battle, a seemingly enlightened Warlock leaves his followers with words of hope, and goes to seek out other worlds. The "beast of humanity" metaphor is made very clear as he flies away<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

Adam Warlock sees The <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magus_%28comics%29.html" title="Magus (comics)">Magus</a> face.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On a desolate planet, Warlock laments his failure to accomplish the good he attempts and all the destruction he inadvertently causes (his attitude substantially changed from the enlightened optimistic stance of his last appearance). Soon he learns from a damsel in distress of an intergalactic menace known as the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magus_%28comics%29.html" title="Magus (comics)">Magus</a>, a powerful being who has set up a genocidal religion/militia known as The Universal Church of Truth, ruling a thousand worlds with an iron fist. Warlock feels compelled to battle evil once again, and with his mischievous new loincloth-clad, hedonistic, cigar-chomping friend <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pip_the_Troll_1ce1.html" title="Pip the Troll">Pip the Troll</a>, he journeys through many perils of the body, mind, and soul to the Magus himself. Warlock's trials include addiction to his aforementioned Soul Gem (which has become bonded to his own soul, and cannot be removed without killing him), resisting the temptation of a power-offering woman ruler, a massive one-sided trial against him, a simulated surreal clown-world (from which he emerges partially insane), and fighting lots and lots of alien grunts. It is revealed that the Magus is a future incarnation of Warlock himself, supremely powerful due to a near-infinity of metamorphosing in his cocoon, plus the natural knowledge of future events possessed by any time-lost future individual. The Magus was sent back in time by the cosmic being, the <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-Betweener_d5ee.html" title="In-Betweener">In-Betweener</a>, as a force for 'Life' to offset <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>' role as a champion of Death. The In-Betweener had driven the Magus mad and released him thousands of years in the past on a planet called Sirius X, which he would rename Homeworld. Thus Warlock finds he has this to look forward to.</p>
<p>Thanos (whose mysterious aims were then totally unknown) also held the secret of time-travel, and therefore was unseen by The Magus' knowledge of present/future events. He locked himself in mortal combat with the Magus, while Warlock entered Kismet (a dimension whose capabilities have yet to be fully explained), destroyed the timeline where he would become the Magus, and emerged in the future and took his future self's soul into the soul gem (for all intents and purposes killing him), retroactively preventing Magus from ever existing (thus having an early death at his own hands to look forward to instead of power and evil). The <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a> get involved and, with his leadership, they nearly stop Thanos (who has taken up the Magus' plans for himself). Warlock is taken out of the battle when the Warlock of a few months past comes to take his soul (see above), but is content to leave his miserable existence. The end of the issue finds him in a green paradise inside the Soul Gem with all the souls ever taken by it, living together in loving/accepting harmony. But Thanos is still on the loose; this is wrapped up in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Two-in-One_aa86.html" title="Marvel Two-in-One">Marvel Two-in-One</a> Annual</i> #2, in which Spider-Man and the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing_%28comics%29.html" title="Thing (comics)">Thing</a> join the fray, and together Earth's heroes (with a final appearance of Warlock from beyond death) kill Thanos by turning him into a statue.</p>
<p>These issues proved popular enough to be collected in a six-volume deluxe-format miniseries in 1983, and again in 1992.</p>
<p>The story of Warlock was briefly revisited in <i>Marvel Two-in-One</i> #61-63 (March-May 1980) by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Gruenwald_9ef2.html" title="Mark Gruenwald">Mark Gruenwald</a> and Jerry Bingham, which finds The Thing coming into contact with <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kismet_%28comics%29.html" title="Kismet (comics)">Her</a>. Created by the Enclave to be the female equivalent of Him, Kismet wants to find Warlock and become his mate. After contact with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starhawk_%28comics%29.html" title="Starhawk (comics)">Starhawk</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondragon.html" title="Moondragon">Moondragon</a>, and the High Evolutionary, Warlock's grave is visited on Counter-Earth, and the High Evolutionary explains that Warlock's conveniently-forgotten too-big-to-be-in-the-world thing from the Starlin years was all in his head, tying up the last loose-end and proving finally that he was indeed dead. Warlock did not appear again in the 1980's, even in Starlin's groundbreaking graphic novel, <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar-Vell_89f9.html" title="Mar-Vell">The Death of Captain Marvel</a></i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Warlock_5b7b.html" title="Edit section: The Infinity Gauntlet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Infinity Gauntlet</span></h3>
<p>In 1990, Starlin began writing what was arguably his third character-defining run for Marvel, this time starring the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Surfer_9bd6.html" title="Silver Surfer">Silver Surfer</a> (<i>Silver Surfer</i> Vol. 3 #34-50, with the exception of #39, an unrelated story), drawn by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Lim_9ae2.html" title="Ron Lim">Ron Lim</a>. After Thanos' return at the bidding of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Marvel_Comics%29_6774.html" title="Death (Marvel Comics)">Death</a> herself, the mad villain collects all six <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Gems_3dd1.html" title="Infinity Gems">Infinity Gems</a> (in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thanos_Quest_9fb1.html" title="The Thanos Quest">The Thanos Quest</a></i> #1-2) and through them becomes <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipotence.html" title="Omnipotence">omnipotent</a>. The Surfer, along with <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drax_the_Destroyer_fe3e.html" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax the Destroyer</a>, is exiled by Thanos to the Soul Gem, and meets Warlock, Pip and Gamora. Warlock, who while living in the Soul World had taken to the life of a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> and had not fought while there, releases the Surfer and Drax from the Gem, then decides to join the fight against Thanos.</p>
<p>The souls of Warlock, Pip and Gamora left the Soul Gem and inhabited recently-deceased corpses, which metamorphosed into their bodies (Warlock employing the cocoon technique for additional power). Once again the entire Marvel Universe is involved in the battle in a six-issue mini-series entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Infinity_Gauntlet_c831.html" title="The Infinity Gauntlet">The Infinity Gauntlet</a></i>, after a gauntlet he dons studded with the six Infinity Gems. Warlock was instrumental in Thanos' defeat here as well, and in the end obtained the gems for himself. Having lived so long in the Soul Gem's strange world and spent so much time with the gem, he was able to understand the workings of Thanos and the Gauntlet, giving him an edge over his foe. What made Warlock most ideal in leading the heroes and cosmic beings against Thanos was that he stood outside the realms of Order &amp; Chaos because of the circumstances surrounding his conception, the trials of the Magus, and his time in Soul World. Most importantly, no doubt, was the destruction of his own timeline, making it very hard to predict his fate. This was clearly shown when <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamora.html" title="Gamora">Gamora</a> wore the Time Gem and got inaccurate visions of Warlock's future, and explains why <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chaos_d4fd.html" title="Lord Chaos">Lord Chaos</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_Order_c61c.html" title="Master Order">Master Order</a> wished Warlock as their leader against Thanos (representing, paradoxically, the opposite of both).</p>
<p>Warlock was soon forced to separate the Infinity Gauntlet's gems to separate bearers after the cosmic beings of the universe and the Living Tribunal deemed Warlock unworthy to carry the Infinity Gauntlet. When Warlock asked why Thanos was allowed to wield the power, Warlock was told that it was because he was a being of existence, and Warlock was a created being. Warlock kept the Soul Gem for himself, and split the rest of the gems among the members of the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Watch_05c0.html" title="Infinity Watch">Infinity Watch</a> including his friends Pip and Gamora, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drax_the_Destroyer_fe3e.html" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax the Destroyer</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondragon.html" title="Moondragon">Moondragon</a>, and one mysterious, unseen person who was later revealed to be Thanos himself. Warlock was given his own series again, <i>Warlock and the Infinity Watch</i>, beginning in Feb. 1992, written by Starlin. Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet had unforeseen consequences; in attempting to control his emotions to better wield the Gauntlet, Warlock purged all good and evil from his being, leaving him a being consisting entirely of logic. The "moral" aspects of his persona in turn took on physical forms: the evil half became a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half became the self-styled <a href="../../../g/o/d/Goddess_%28comics%29.html" title="Goddess (comics)">Goddess</a>. Each attempted to gain control over the universe, and each was thwarted and exiled to the world of the Soul Gem, where they had no substance and (Warlock assumed) would pose no threat to anyone (in <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_War_f142.html" title="Infinity War">Infinity War</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Crusade_78f1.html" title="Infinity Crusade">Infinity Crusade</a></i>, completing the Infinity Trilogy of the early '90s). During this time Warlock was so popular he was given a second series, <i>The Warlock Chronicles</i> (beginning in July 1993). <i>Chronicles</i> ended with issue #8 in February 1994, and Starlin's last issue on <i>Watch</i> was #33 (October 1994); the series continued for nine further issues, finally ending with the Gems being stolen by the alien vampire called <a href="../../../r/u/n/Rune_%28comics%29.html" title="Rune (comics)">Rune</a> and the disbanding of the group in #42 (July 1995).</p>
<p>Some time later, Warlock was killed by Rune and the Gems disappeared into a parallel universe, the "<a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraverse.html" title="Ultraverse">Ultraverse</a>", where Warlock found himself again reborn. Warlock eventually returned to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a>, and encountered Thanos and the former members of the Infinity Watch a number of times more. He starred in a miniseries shortly thereafter, in which he fought the reanimated corpse of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28Marvel_Comics%29_d1af.html" title="Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)">Captain Marvel</a>.</p>

<p>Warlock's next major appearance was in the <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Abyss_67ef.html" title="Infinity Abyss">Infinity Abyss</a></i> miniseries. Warlock was found to be living in an intergalactic Insane Asylum, encased in a self-generated cocoon. Warlock was reincarnated with a slight different appearance after a clone of Thanos asked Moondragon to revive him. Warlock assisted in preventing a universal crisis against <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanos.html" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>' clones, and ended up watching over Atleza, a being posed to keep the cosmos from falling into the Infinity Abyss. He also engaged in a romantic relationship with Gamora. Later, Warlock, being outside the cosmos, was able to convince Thanos to restore the Marvel Universe which he had destroyed after receiving ultimate power (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Marvel_Universe%7E_The_End_ed54.html" title="Marvel Universe: The End">Marvel Universe: The End</a></i>). He assisted Thanos in his first reformed quest (<i>Thanos</i> #1-6, published originally in 2003-2004), and later on assisted <a href="../../../s/h/e/She-Hulk_caad.html" title="She-Hulk">She-Hulk</a> (She-Hulk 2004 #7-8).</p>
<p>In recent events, Gamora appeared sans Warlock in the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilation_%28comics%29.html#Annihilation:_Ronan" title="Annihilation (comics)">Annihilation: Ronan</a> miniseries, and the Soul Gem was retrieved by the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminati_%28Marvel_Comics%29_aba7.html" title="Illuminati (Marvel Comics)">Illuminati</a> and is currently held by <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Strange_ff58.html" title="Doctor Strange">Doctor Strange</a>. The circumstances under which Warlock came to be separated from Gamora or lose the Soul Gem are as yet unknown.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Warlock_5b7b.html" title="Edit section: 2004 Warlock miniseries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2004 <i>Warlock</i> miniseries</span></h3>
<p>In the 2004 <i>Warlock</i> mini series by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Pak_7fcc.html" title="Greg Pak">Greg Pak</a>, another Warlock was created by the Enclave. This new Warlock was meant to be the savior of the human race. He would be a god among men and 'fix' our world. He had a failsafe device installed in his head (which resembled the placement of the Soul Gem) that prohibited him from questioning his role as god of Earth. The new Warlock was befriended by his designer Janie. Janie managed to get through to this Warlock and override his failsafe. The new Warlock, confused by all the deception and the contradictory way of the human condition, chose to destroy the Earth.</p>
<p>All this, though, turned out to be an elaborate fantasy inside Janie's head and part of an attempt by the Enclave to condition her for their own purposes. However, the original Adam Warlock projects himself into the simulation and was able to give her a chance to see humanity and feel compassion for it in a way Him wasn't able to comprehend when he first emerged from the Enclave's labs. Janie emerges from her cocoon at the Enclave as a new Warlock and quickly leaves. The series concluded with her planning to help Earth in her own way, having learned valuable lessons from the original Warlock. It is left unclear if this series is in the same continuity as the mainstream <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Warlock_5b7b.html" title="Edit section: Power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Power</span></h2>
<p><b>Strength Level:</b> Warlock possesses superhuman strength, allowing him to lift (press) 4 tons. He can use his cosmic powers to increase his strength to a maximum of 40 tons for less than one hour. The incarnation of the Magus must have possessed even greater strength, given that he could engage Thanos in hand-to-hand combat (Thanos himself could fight the Thing and Thor simultaneously).</p>
<p><b>Known Powers:</b> Adam Warlock possesses a number of superhuman properties and powers derived from his artificially determined genetic structure. His bone and muscle tissue is denser than human, endowing him with superhuman strength and resilience. Among his body's special adaptations are an enclave of cells able to tap and transform cosmic energy for personal use. Warlock could use this energy to enhance his physical strength, endurance, and powers of recuperation. He could also employ cosmic energy to negate the force of gravity beneath him, enabling him to fly. In an Earth-like atmosphere, Warlock was able to attain the speed of sound (770 miles per hour). He could use his cosmic energy to locate and enter natural space-warps (discontinuities in the fabric of space) in order to traverse interstellar space. He can also project cosmic energy from his hands as concussive force.</p>
<p>Warlock's energy-manipulating powers waned at the time he was given the soul-gem by the High Evolutionary. No longer could he direct concussive force from his hands or enhance his strength. Whether this power limitation was caused by his symbiotic relationship with the soul-gem or some other factor is not yet known. When Warlock was summoned from the soul-gem to defeat Thanos, he seemed to possess these cosmic powers once more.<br /></p>
<p>Adam Warlock is able to spin a cocoon around him at will in a matter of seconds. He did so infrequently during his short life, usually to protect himself from mortal harm, and usually he would emerge from the cocoon at a further level of physical or mental maturity. It is not known where the substance of the cocoon came from, or where it went after he emerged from it.<br /></p>
<p>Warlock's unique history and experiences have also granted him status as being "outside the forces of destiny," allowing him to play a part in cosmic affairs that would be impossible for other beings, despite their levels of power. He has been known to disappear and reappear in combat situations with opponents ranging from mere soldiers to Galactus himself, whether or not this has any connection to his unique relationship with reality has not been explained. Once, in the pages of the Infinity Gauntlet he was even able to hide from Nebula in plain sight<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, even though at the time she had possession of the Gauntlet.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Abilities:</b> Warlock gained a great deal of first-hand experience at hand-to-hand combat over the course of his life, and eventually became quite formidable. Warlock also is an accomplished self-taught philosopher. Able to fly, even in space.</p>
