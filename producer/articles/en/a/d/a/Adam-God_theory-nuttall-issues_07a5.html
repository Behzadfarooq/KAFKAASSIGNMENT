It has been suggested that this article or section be <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">merged</a> with <i><a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-God_theory_1919.html" title="Adam-God theory">Adam-God_theory</a></i>. (<a href="../../../a/d/a/Talk%7EAdam-God_theory-nuttall-issues_b75a.html" title="Talk:Adam-God theory-nuttall-issues">Discuss</a>)</div>
<p>The article <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-God_theory_1919.html" title="Adam-God theory">Adam-God theory</a> argues several reasons to question a particular assumption. This page contains those arguments.</p>
<p>The article says, "Because Nuttall also notes that at this private evening meeting several matters or “Works” concerning the temple were considered by those present, many writers have assumed that this journal entry contains the “lecture at the veil.” For example, Theorists Robert Black and Fred Collier both assume that Nuttall’s reference to the “Works” in the temple refers to what Black chooses to call “the sermon before the Veil.” Unfortunately, they give no reasons for this assumption. Similarly, most other writers simply assume, without discussion, that the text of this journal entry represents President Young’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 lecture delivered in the St. George Temple, despite the fact that Nuttall plainly states in the often omitted introductory sentences of his journal entry that this text was delivered on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 at the residence of President Young. This unquestioned assumption that this journal entry contains the text of Brigham Young’s <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 lecture at the veil is very surprising because there are several good reasons to question that assumption."</p>
<p>The reasons argued are:</p>
<p>First, Nuttall records that he heard the specific statement recorded in his journal directly from President Young at the President’s own residence during an evening meeting with five other Church leaders on Wednesday <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877. Nuttall never claims in this journal entry, or in any other statement, that this particular text is the lecture at the veil delivered by President Young on the previous Thursday in the St. George Temple. In deed, Nuttall never claims that this text was ever delivered by anyone in any temple at any time. Why anyone would suppose that this text is the lecture at the veil given on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 despite Nuttall’s clear statement as to the actual date, time, place and manner of its delivery has never been explained.</p>
<p>Second, there are no known corroborating, contemporary records in which it is claimed by anyone that this text is the lecture at the veil. For example, although Nuttall specifically mentions Wilford Woodruff as being one of those present at this evening meeting, Woodruff’s own journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 does not even mention the evening meeting, let alone quote the text of President Young’s discourse delivered that evening.</p>
<p>Woodruff’s entire journal entry for this particular evening reads: “Feb 7 1877 I spent the day in the Temple. W Woodruff gave second Anointing to (Josiah /Guile/ Hardy and his wife Ann Dunston Hardy) (Matthew Clayton) (Elizabeth Graham Macdonald for and in behalf of Sarah Johnson Macdonald, &amp; Fanny Vancott Macdonald Anointed to Allexander Findley Macdonald). H. W. Bigler held the Horn J L Nut tall Recorder. We baptized 386 for the dead. John L Smith Baptized. D H Cannon Confirmed 185, A. H. Raleigh 61, H. W. Bigler 77, D. D. McArthur 63.” Woodruff gives no hint of what he did after he left the temple for the day.</p>
<p>Third, Nuttall’s journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 is far too short to be the actual lecture at the veil. Woodruff records in his journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877 that Brigham Young presented “a lecture at the veil” in the St. George Temple on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> that required approximately thirty minutes to deliver. (“President [Young] was present and deliverd a lecture at the veil some 30 Minutes.” Wilford Woodruff, 7 Wilford Woodruff's Journal 325 (1 February 1877)). In comparison, the text of Nuttall’s journal entry for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 does not require more than a couple of minutes to recite. Even if this text were some shortened form of the actual lecture at the veil, there is clearly much more to the full lecture than the few lines Nuttall has penned in his journal. In fact, other writers have concluded that, at best, this <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> journal entry represents only Nuttall’s personal summary of some additions made to the full lecture at the veil. ( “The copy of the veil lecture which Nuttall describes is not presently available. But on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> Nuttall summarized in his diary additions to the lecture which Young made at his residence in Nuttall's presence.” (D. Buerger, The Mysteries of Godliness 111 ( 1994 )); “The sermon that followed was added to the Lecture at the Veil and was incorporated into the ceremony of the Temple as an essential part of the Endowment. . . . . The following is that part of the Lecture at the Veil which was delivered by President Young at his home in St. George, Utah, on the evening of February 7th, 1877:” (F. Collier, 1 Unpublished Revelations 116 (introduction to Part 75) (1981)).)</p>
<p>Fourth, in other journal entries recorded after <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877, Nuttall states that he had not yet finished organizing the text of the lecture at the veil delivered in the temple on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> 1877. For example, three days after this evening meeting, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">10 February</a> 1877, Nuttall records that he was “[w]ith Bro. W. Woodruff engaged in writing the lecture for the endowments to be read to Prest. Young. Spent the evening at Prest. Young's house, did not finish our work.” In other words, three days after the date Nuttall wrote the instant text in his journal he was still working on the text of the actual endowment lecture and had not yet finished it. In addition, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">20 March</a> 1877, some six weeks after the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> meeting at President Young’s home, Nuttall records that he “[c]opied part of lecture at the veil, . . .. . . . Prest. Young called in and gave us further instructions as to our workings, left temple at 6 P.M.” Nuttall does not here state the purpose for which he was copying part of the lecture at the veil, but it appears clear that he and President Young were still working on the final text of that lecture.</p>
<p>Fifth, there is at least one document by Nuttall himself which appears to exclude the instant text from being the actual lecture at the veil. In 1892 Nuttall wrote a letter to the First Presidency in which he appears to claim that the lecture at the veil was dictated in the temple, recorded by both himself and J.D.T. McAllister, put into proper form and then submitted to and approved by President Brigham Young.</p>
<dl>
<dd>MEMORANDA</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In January 1877, shortly after the lower portion of the St. George Temple was dedicated, President Brigham Young, in following up in the Endowments written, became convinced that it was necessary to have the formula of the Endowments written, and he gave directions to have the same put in writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shortly afterwards he explained what the Lecture at the Veil should portray, and for this purpose appointed a day when he would personally deliver the Lecture at the Veil. Elder J.D.T. McAllister and L. John Nuttall prepared writing material, and as the President spoke they took down his words. Elder Nuttall put the same into form and the writing was submitted to President Young on the same evening at his office in residence at St. George. He there made such changes as he deemed proper, and when he finally passed upon it said: This is the Lecture at the Veil to be observed in the Temple.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A copy of the Lecture is kept at the St. George Temple, in which President Young refers to Adam in his creation &amp;c.</dd>

<dd>(L. John Nuttall, “Memoranda” (3 June 1892)) (BYU Special Collections, Mss 188, Letterpress copy book #4, p. 290.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The text recorded in Nuttall's journal for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877 does not met any of the criteria set out in Nuttall’s Memoranda. Instead, the Nuttall journal text was delivered and recorded at the residence of President Young, was not submitted to President Young for his approval, and J.D.T. McAllister is never mentioned. Clearly, this text does not met the circumstances Nuttall himself ascribes to the production of the actual lecture at the veil.</p>
<p>Sixth, this text is clearly not complete. In paragraph 31 of the Nuttall text there are clearly noted 4 (or 5) blank lines between paragraphs 30 and 32. These blank lines are an obvious indication that something is missing from this text. Whatever this text is, it is not even a complete transcript of Young’s statement on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> 1877.</p>
