	    <p>Hullo there. Welcome to Wikipedia. Nice work on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sandman_f116.html" title="The Sandman">Sandman</a> pages. I'm afraid I shan't be reading all of them myselff, as I've not yet read all the books (wikipedia contains spoilers...&#160;;-) ). There's a page of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedians.html" title="Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> somewhere that you're welcome to add yourself to. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a> 16:39 Sep 1, 2002 (PDT)</p>
<p>Thanks. Yes, I mentioned somewhere (somewhere obscure, I fear) that the Sandman pages could do with the spoiler warnings added. I might do that myself in a bit. I shall track down the Wikipedians page. I'm attempting to draw Neil Gaiman's attention to his entry here in the hopes he'll post it on his blog and even more rabid fans than I (I do hope my stuff doesn't reek of positive bias) will improve on it... <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></p>

<p>Hi - just a heads up about your new article on RATM: there was an article on them already at <a href="../../../r/a/g/Rage_Against_the_Machine_f104.html" title="Rage Against the Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> (that capital T makes all the difference). Your new article is better, but you might want to have a look at the other one, integrate anything that needs to be, and then move it across to the lowercase T version (which I guess is the correct title - in any case it doesn't much matter so long as there's a redirect from the other). It's usually best to do a quick search on anything you're planning to start a new article on to make sure there isn't one already - the search function ignores caps as far as I can tell, but the presence of a capital letter in the title makes for a differnt article, if you see what I mean. And good work on the Sandman stuff, btw --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<p>When you edited <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napster.html" title="Napster">Napster</a>, you said "companies are singular, not plural." This is true in North America, but not in Britain - the person who wrote the article may be British. I assume you're not going to start "correcting" all instances of -ise and -our to -ize and -or, so you may wish to ignore other dialectal variations as well. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">user:Montrealais</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Eh? I'm English, check my user page&#160;:). I've always seen the singular usage in English media. From the Finance page of the Guardian today:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Weekend reports suggested Cadbury had hired the investment bank to advise <b>it</b> on ways to structure a deal."</p>
<p>"Granada TV is in talks to sell the format to <b>its</b> hit TV series, I'm a Celebrity: Get Me Out of Here, to an American TV network."</p>
<p>"British Airways, which once called <b>itself</b> "the world's favourite airline", is this week facing relegation..."</p>
<p>and so on. Where do you see the plural usage? --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the singular for companies has made its way across the pond, but one still often hears teams in the plural: e.g., "Ipswich have reshuffled a Worthington Cup tie,..." (would be "has" over here) --LDC</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fine, let me amend to say: too many authorities use plural for groups ("the government have" and so forth) for it to be regarded as a solecism. - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">user:Montrealais</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see "groups" as one coherent mass as you both seem to. Ispwich are a football team, not a company. A government is, well, a government, not a company. I happily consider football teams to be plural and companies to be singular and it hasn't caused my brain to melt yet. Am I just odd?&#160;:). Theory - maybe it's because so many teams have contractions that are explicitly plural - "The Rams", "The bulls", "The red devils" or whatever. This applies to American sports, too... --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></p>

<p>You wrote in the RC log: "(moved over here (KILL ALL SUBPAGES). couldn't do a proper move because this was already a redirect to the page i wanted to move *from*.sigh.)" -- the trick is to delete the redirect page first so the page can be moved. BTW, you a sysop now? -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. So I couldn't do that. I suppose I could be. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Did you actually try the move? I changed the code a while ago to allow moving a page onto an existing title if that title was just a redirect to the source; but maybe the redirect had some history of its own or something.</p>
<p>Ah. Guilty as charged. No, I didn't, I just assumed it wouldn't work. *slaps own wrist* --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Yup. There's a message about it on the ML somewhere - it was decided that eveyone would be allowed to move pages, since it's no longer dangerous (talk page gets moved too). --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></dd>

<p>Hi Adam, I've added in quotes from the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act onto the Talk: Australia page. Your quotes are correct. The constitution quotes show using your quotes what the answer is to the straight-forward question; is Australia a republic or a constitutional monarchy? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 00:18 Feb 13, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't quite know what you mean by "correct"...they're "authoritative", if you count the OED as an authority, and "accurate", since I just copied and pasted, but correct? Tricky.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Correct as in correctly taken from the OED. I think the problem is that in theory all constitutional monarchies are republics in so far as they are ruled by their people, and only reigned over by their monarchs. The days when the monarch <i>controlled</i> a country, at least in democracies, are over. So the general principle applied is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it has an elected head of state, its a republic</li>
<li>if it has an inherited monarch, its a monarchy.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Our friend on the Australia page kept insisting that Australia was a republic, which must come as news to the people in Australia who voted not to become a republic a couple of years ago!!! No amount of dictionaries, references, etc seemed to convince him. In the end, three of us (myself, Tannin and Mintguy) had to 'stand guard' so to speak, over the pages, reverting them every time he tampered with them to <i>declare</i> Australia a republic. When finally just about everyone collectively shouted 'stop. You are wrong' he stopped . . . and went to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">Constitutional monarchy</a> page, which he then began adapting to <i>declare</i> Australia a republic there (which was illogical - if it was a republic, it wouldn't be on the page in the first place, and even as a monarchy it wasn't until he kept 'doctoring' the page.) It took three reversions to stop him 'doctoring' <i>that</i> page. So, after endless rowing,10 reverts and everyone who came near either page telling him he was wrong, he has either</p>
<ul>
<li>gone of Wikipedia, (hopefully not)</li>
<li>got the message (hopefully)</li>
<li>or is looking for another page on which to declare the 'Australian republic'!!!<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Who says Wikipedia isn't fun sometimes. At least it beats a character called DW a couple of weeks ago who spent his entire time telling everyone they were a 'moron', 'asshole', 'phoney'. etc until he was banned. Pity. I miss wondering what page of the dictionary of insults he had got as far as reading each day! <i>Slán</i> (Irish for goodbye) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 03:06 Feb 13, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam, if you feel the urge to veer off-topic now and then and chat about computer stuff in a smaller and more congenial environment than Anand's or Tom's (or HardOCP, for that matter), slip over to <a href="http://www.storageforum.net/forum/" class="external text" title="http://www.storageforum.net/forum/" rel="nofollow">Storage Forum</a>.

<dd>Tannin, I think this is more a problem with Wikipedia - there's no real place to have those kind of small discussions. They don't really seem in place on the wikipedia mailing list (which I quit reading anyway), there's no wikipedia forums, and no-one seems to use the wikipedia IRC channel. It's a shame. Thanks for the suggestion, but I have too many forums to read every day as it is&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWill_ff0a.html" title="User:AdamWill">AW</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just so. The list is getting way too cluttered with chit-chat to be useful. Personally I avoid IRQ and all those pop-up IM things on the twin grounds of security and being able to get some work done. -- T</dd>

<p>Hi Adam. For a second I thought that I might have met you in England, but quickly dismissed that when I saw the words ¨Mandrake Linux¨ on your user page. Of course, cooker!

<p><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_3bdf.html" title="History of the Soviet Union">History of the Soviet Union</a></p>
<p>The Soviet Union (USSR) was a federated state, containing ~22,402,200km2 in eastern Europe and western Asia, which existed from 1922 to 1991. Its origins date to the October Revolution of 1917, in which the later leaders of the Soviet Union overthrew the Provisional Government of Russia, which itself had replaced the Romanov tsarist <b>regime</b> earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Actually <i>regime</i> not <i>government</i> is the correct word to use regarding the situation under Saddam's rule. A government operates under a clearly defined governmental structure that is constitutionally defined. A less organised governmental structure, in which flexible authority is vested in one individual or an autocracy is generally described as a regime in terms of political science definitions, just as one writes about the Tsarist regime, not the Tsar's government, as government carries with it implicit meanings of governance that simply did not apply under the Tsar, Saddam's rule, the <i>Ancien Regimé</i> of pre-revolutionary France, etc . And 'Saddam' is 100% correct. The fact that many articles on wiki refer to <i>Hussein</i> rather than <i>Saddam</i> is an example of how in some areas wiki falls well short of proper encyclopædic standards. But every time an article is rewritten to replace the ludicrous <i>Husseins</i> by the proper <i>Saddam</i>, some people (mainly American, who rely for information on the ignorance of much of the US media) throw a tantrum and promptly change it back to Hussein, making wiki's articles a laughing stock in the middle east. Hussein is in effect a disambigulation word to clarify that the Iraqi leader was the son of Hussein rather than a different Saddam. But Hussein is not a surname. According to one linguistic expert, using Hussein as a surname is the equivalent, in the case of Queen Elizabeth the second, of treating 'the second' as a surname. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 00:01 Apr 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that "The II" is not the same as "Smith." Nevertheless, don't take for granted the meaning of "surname" -- aren't all surnames "disambiguation names" -- "No I am not <i>that</i> John, he's John Jones, I am John Smith?" <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>All surnames are disambigulation names. But not all disambigulation names are surnames. In many cultures a <i>different</i> name is used as the representative name. In Iraq Saddam Hussein means Saddam, son of Hussein. Hussein on its own means . . . well Hussein. Which Hussein? Are you talking about someone called Hussein? If so, who? Saddam however means a specific person, which is why most of the world (but the US and its media) if uses either Saddam Hussein or Saddam, not Hussein. That is the correct format, as advised by linguistic experts and used by the BBC, ITN, Reuters, AP, etc etc. That was how it was used even by the US in the early 1990s. But for some reason the news media chose to abandon the standard format and to its own (inaccurate) thing, which wiki (most of its users being american and so used to hearing CBS, NBC, ABC etc say <i>Hussein</i>) unfortunately copied, though thankfully that linguistic error is now being corrected. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 18:11 Apr 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: Monkey Island. Installment is the perfectly correct American English spelling. We add extra l's to lots of words that British English doesn't. There is no need to keep changing words back and forth between dialects. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 01:47 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adam, regarding my edits to the Sandman article - I must confess I didn't read it carefully or realize (realise) that it was written from the British side of the language. I have a spell checker that I use sometimes to check Random Articles when I have a little spare time. The downfall is that sometimes I just go through looking for spelling not reading the article carefully. Since you've pointed this out to me, I will be more careful in the future. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernkes_fb14.html" title="User:Fernkes">Fernkes</a> 02:44, Nov 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>

Since you are among the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_8bec.html" title="Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits">top 2000</a> Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at <i>minimum</i> those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information:</p>

</ul>
<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>. The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 1</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:</dd>
<dd>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 2</b></dd>
<dd>I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:</dd>
<dd>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" with "<b>{{MultiLicensePD}}</b>". If you only prefer using the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, I would like to know that too. <i>Please let me know</i> what you think at my <b><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk page</a></b>. It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>| <a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk)</a></p>
