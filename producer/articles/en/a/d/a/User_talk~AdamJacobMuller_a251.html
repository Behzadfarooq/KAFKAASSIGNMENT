Here's the difference: for Tokyo itself (Tokyo-to, the governmental district covered by the article), the population is 12 million; the figure of 33 million is for the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Tokyo_Area_305f.html" title="Greater Tokyo Area">Greater Tokyo Area</a>, which includes not only Tokyo, but also <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiba_Prefecture_953f.html" title="Chiba Prefecture">Chiba Prefecture</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanagawa_Prefecture_7bd6.html" title="Kanagawa Prefecture">Kanagawa Prefecture</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saitama_Prefecture_0f23.html" title="Saitama Prefecture">Saitama Prefecture</a> (and thus has a much larger population.

<p>Hi, it's nice of you to try and intervene, but some people might think you were trying to be misleading by placing a {{protected}} notice on a page that isn't actually protected. I'm afraid actually protecting a page from editing is a feature limited to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a>.

While I assume that it's covered by <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, lack of the necessary information will likely lead to it being deleted down the road -- which has been happening to many images.

<p>I have retrieved a Spring 2005 "registration confirmation" which, sure enough, features the "old" seal. It is one of those large blue envelopes you receive prior to each semester.</p>
<p>It is true that most universities has both a logo and a seal. But, I think the precedent is to use the seal, if it is available; for example, see <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a>. The <a href="http://www.bu.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.bu.edu/" rel="nofollow">BU website</a> displays only the logo with the seal nowhere to be found, just like the Pace website. Yet, the seal is still used in the artcile. Not sure what the reasoning is, but I think it makes the article (and the university) look more professional. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 01:17, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding you comment in template:user OS:GNU/Linux, I would like to remind you to please <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">refrain from personal attacks</a>. Furthermore, just because I like the name GNU/Linux, it does not mean I am an "RMS fanboy" (which is also a sexist remark, BTW). It could also mean that I think that "Linux" is ambiguous as it can refer to both the operating system and the kernel, and thus can be potentially confusing to users and make people think that FUD attacks against the kernel (such as that by SCO) are really against the whole operating system. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where">Where</a> <a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where">(talk)</a> 13:00, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop changing the image on the Survivor front page, the Exile Island logo that is used is an old screengrab from the reunion episode of Guatemala and looks out of place amogst the other clearer images. There is absolutely no order to the logos, it makes zero sense. Furthermore, the Palau logo is oddly shaped.

<p>The reason I removed "Pearl Islands" is because I never recall anyone saying that it takes place within the Pearl Islands. The most specific location that we're given is Panama.

Would you mind explaining how any of this is fancruft or unverifiable?</p>
<ol>
<li>The air date (which is the only info that was added), is definitely neither fancruft or unverifiable.</li>
<li>The "next time on survivor" bit could possibly be misconstrued as fancruft, but it's the only verifiable bit of information about the episode next week beyond the date/name so it's notable enough to include for the next week.</li>
<li>The bit about the voting history is (IMO) very interesting, and something even *I* didn't know. I did check that episode (off my DVDs) so what they say did happen, I can't say for a fact that that has never happened at any other point, but to my knowledge it has not occured at any other point.</li>

<dd>I'm glad your not going to "get into" an edit war over it, but, quite simply, there is no reason *not* to link to <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> in both places and it makes more sense to link to <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> in both places. What exactly makes it "not look right"? Also, please don't misrepresent the situation, the word is linked twice in the same paragraph, not twice in the same sentence.

<dd>Honestly, I just looked at the anon users vandalisim (the edit summary gave it away, there is no way that adding a category about winning a nobel prize to an article about a nobel prize winner is POV) and reverted that (you beat me to it actually), I didn't see any good reason not to have both categories in there (seeing as the article says that he won both prizes) but if the Nobel one is no longer being used...

<dd>Hi, They were given to me by a friend on a survivor spoiling board that i'm on, I asked and he agreed to license them under the GFDL to put them on wikipedia. They are raster copies of vectorizations of the official logos, basically what this means is that the original raster logo is converted into vector art, which is converted back into vector images. The result is a logo that is sharper and clearer than the other logos and most likely look more like what the original logos looked like. The logos are offiical in the sense that they duplicate every aspect of the original logos. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamJacobMuller_cc91.html" title="User:AdamJacobMuller">AdamJacobMuller</a> 05:53, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I visited a link on the Academy Awards page. The link was to someone's blog and had a biased opinion. As someone who works in the film community, I did not believe that the person's opinions reflected the true nature of the Oscars and what they stand for. The blog was a personal site and critical of Oscar choices, no coherent with Academy procedures. I felt it was important to delete the link to the blog to ensure the neutrality of the Oscars is upheld.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 200.50.30.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.50.30.76_0ec0.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.50.30.76">contribs</a>) 2006-03-14 19:22:13 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Simply because something does not conform to the rules that are established by an external entity does not mean that the content does not belong on wikipedia, if we followed the guidlines for what was acceptable commentary as established by a particular orginzation then most articles would be devoid of any critical commentary whatsoever. I'm not saying that the people who are commenting on the situation are right, or wrong, it's not the job of wikipedia to jude but the job of wikipedia to inform people that there are questions being raised. You are right however that the section, as written that you reverted was highly <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>. It was written in a very bad tone, if you check the article as it is now it has in fact been re-written and is now re-written in a much more neutral way. To remove the content as you did is to deny that there is a discussion going on, to re-write the content as <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> did is to <b>fix</b> the actual problem, in this case that the text was written in a highly POV way. It is always preferable that you simply correct things that you find objectionable rather than simply blanking sections. In addition, your edit summary does not help (<i>remove absurd POV bilge</i>) and is something that does not make people believe that you are acting in good-faith. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamJacobMuller_cc91.html" title="User:AdamJacobMuller">AdamJacobMuller</a> 06:53, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can't MOVE a freakin page to one that already exists Without copy/paste. The article I'm trying to get rid of is "Dieties of Kobol", the proper name is "Lords of Kobol" (as it's refered to in subsequent articles and redirected to Dieties of Kobol.

<dd>you can't do that as a non-administrator, and for a very good reason.

<dd>It does matter though, the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requires for purposes of copyright that all parts of an article be attributable. This means that when you copy/paste move the page it appears that you were the sole editor and creator of the page in question, which is not the case. While the original contribuitors could be tracked down not having the content in the right place is going to make things substantially more difficult if the question of copyright should ever come up. I treat every article with the same care, every article is equally important to wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamJacobMuller_cc91.html" title="User:AdamJacobMuller">AdamJacobMuller</a> 06:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, this really isn't a bot, since all changes that the program makes are monitored by myself, the bot does not take any action that I do not explicetly approve. It's probably closer to AWB, but without the annoying interface. Basically, it works something like this. I gather a list of page names, from, for example the <b>File Links</b> on image pages, I craft a regular expression to do the replacement, for example, something like this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"#[Ii]mage:[Tt]exas[_ ]state[_ ]flag\.png#" "Image:Flag_of_Texas.svg"</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, this covers all possible ways that a page could link to a file, both captilization and underscores or spaces. I take both of theses things, and then run the script, it logs in to wikipedia, fetches pages till it finds one that has the target string (with file links, if you include (not subst) a template on a page it will show in File Links even though it's not directly included in there. Now, once it finds one that is changed, it shows me a <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> of the old and new revisions (similar to what would occur with the preview function). I can then accept or reject the change. Basically, this isn't really a bot, it's more along the lines of <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AutoWikiBrowser</a>, it doesn't ever do <b>anything</b> without my interaction <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamJacobMuller_cc91.html" title="User:AdamJacobMuller">AdamJacobMuller</a> 08:23, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I wrote about this to Essjay on Wikia, but I think he's not going to respond for a while - so I deciced to bug you since you're the only one with dev access on Countervandalism.org, right? I wanted to ask that would the source code for resetpass be available since I think it's really useful extension that I'd like to install on my wiki. Thanks in advance!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoosa_c56f.html" title="User:Roosa">Roosa</a> 13:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
