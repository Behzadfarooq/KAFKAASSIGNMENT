<p>please place comments at the foot of the page:</p>
<p>My understanding was that the ultimate decision was that people who are much better known by their non-peerage title should be at that, while any questionable case should be at the peerage title. Eden is certainly of the former - check out the links list, for instance - every single link goes to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Eden_2907.html" title="Anthony Eden">Anthony Eden</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 04:12, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adam, if there'd been general agreement that we should do that, I'd be all with it. But there was not, and I feel bound to respect the consensus that was arrived at. The consensus, as far as I'm aware, was "people who are really not best known by their peerage titles should not be listed under them". Anthony Eden (and Arthur Balfour, HH Asquith, David Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin, Clement Attlee, and Harold Macmillan) are certainly better known without their peerage titles. So if the consensus arrived at is to mean anything, we should leave them, at least, at their common names. Beyond those seven, Robert Walpole, and Bertrand Russell, I'm pretty game for moving just about anybody else to a page with their peerage title in it. At any rate, given that the title is bolded at the beginning of the article, I don't see that information is being supressed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 04:40, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>So tell me what is the correct procedure for reversing redirects between two articles, for people who don't have the power to delete articles? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:16, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this particular case, where the page with the peerage title was a redirect to the page without and there was no edit history apart from its creation for the former page, then there was no need to delete, the system will allow you to swap the pages moving the latter to the former. In the general case there are two options, either apply to become an admin because you want to have this ability on a permanent basis, or ask an admin to help you out. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a></dd>

<p>Robert McClelland</p>
<p>Adam, seems there is an American politician by the name of Robert McClelland as well. Fairly notable actually, no article written as yet, but will probably be fairly long. I've started to gather info for it, but thought I'd ask your preferences for disambiguation. My proposal is to use <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McClelland_8084.html" title="Robert McClelland">Robert McClelland</a> as a disambiguation page with links to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McClelland_%28Australian%29_d680.html" title="Robert McClelland (Australian)">Robert McClelland (Australian)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McClelland_%28American%29_038a.html" title="Robert McClelland (American)">Robert McClelland (American)</a>.

<p><b>Andrew Bartlett</b> I thought it helpful to clarify the gender of the Senator that Bartlett assaulted. I don't mean to sound sexist, but I do think that the idea of a man assaulting a woman, even if there is nothing sexual about the assault, is particularly repugnant to the public. I know that in absolute terms it makes no difference whether the victim is male or female, but according to <i>public perception,</i> I doubt that the event would have generated quite the same degree of public outrage had the accosted Senator been male. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 01:07, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Viscount Dunrossil</b> All Peerage titles, when they are created, have to derive from one or more parts of the Queen's realm, given after the title. Have a look at the London Gazette website (search for 'Barony') to see some contemporary examples. Lord Gowrie, ex Gov-Gen, was created 'Baron Gowrie, of Canberrra, Australia, and of Dirleton, county East Lothian' on 20th December 1935. However the placename is not part of the title and he was known as 'Lord Gowrie'. William Shepherd Morrison was created, on 12th November 1959, 'Viscount Dunrossil, of Vallaquie in the Isle of North Uist and County of Inverness'.</p>
<p>Some peers want to take the same title as other peers, which is not allowed. So in this case they add an additional placename within their title to tell them apart. This may or may not be the same as the placename after the peerage title. Hence, when Janet Young was given a peerage by Edward Heath, she was created (on 24th May 1971) 'Baroness Young, of Farnworth in the county of Lancashire'. This meant that Michael Young, who took his peerage on 20th March 1978, had to be 'Baron Young of Dartington, of Dartington in the County of Devon'. Former Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home became 'Baron Home of the Hirsel, of Coldstream in Berwickshire'. Roy Jenkins became 'Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, of Pontypool in the County of Gwent'.</p>
<p>It seems the Viscount himself did not understand this custom as his entry in 'Dod's Parliamentary Companion' for 1960 has him as using it. One can hardly expect the Commonwealth Parliamentary Handbook to know better, but anything after the comma is not used in a peerage title. If you check other lists of the peerage you will not find it used.</p>
<p>I suggest a compromise: start the article "<b>William Shepherd Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil</b> of Vallaquie" etc., and then in the text say "he was made a Viscount, taking the title Viscount Dunrossil, of Vallaquie. Although not part of his formal peerage title, he customarily included the reference to Vallaquie, a small Hebridean island where his parents were born."</p>
<p>Incidentally he was a complete idiot. In one of his more memorable rulings as Speaker, he said that the House of Commons could not debate the exercise of the Home Secretary's right to ask the Queen to commute death sentences, as it was sub judice, but could debate it after someone had been hanged. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 10:10, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Queen Mother Dr Carr, as long as the policy exists, we will have to be content with "Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon." I would note that that same unfortunate policy would require titles like "Lord" and "Lady" to be included, as in <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Alfred_Douglas_5c5b.html" title="Lord Alfred Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>. Therefore, we should "logically" move the page to "Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon." Perhaps doing so would demonstrate the folly of the policy. "Elizabeth, Queen Mother" would be the most common name, but it is incorrect, so I am not sure as to how to advise you regarding what the appropriate title would be. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 15:38, Apr 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your offensive remarks are unsuitable for any meaningful exchange of thoughts, but the last thing we lose is hope:</p>
<p>Compare with ANY compilation of historical maps of Poland and Prussia, and you'll see that West Prussia wasn't renamed to the Polish Corridor. Nor were there any area corresponding to the Polish Corridor in pre-1772 Poland, nor was it the effect of any other of the many wars in the area. Large parts of West Prussia were, but no identificable sub-territory of West Prussia. Although the created Corridor corresponds slightly better with a combination of earlier borders and the borders of "ethnicities" as drawn up by German authorities, it is still no close match. The borders of 1919 were, in the area of the Polish Corridor, drawn up ad hoc by the Peace Conference, and your idea that the Peace Conference somehow first should have created a new Poland and then transferred the Corridor to this creation might be correct in some strange technical understanding of the Conference's inner workings, but it does not correspond with the realities on the ground. Such a notion could have been valid for the plebecite areas, but hardly for the Corridor.</p>
<p>What's your goal? Will you tell all people who have other sources than you that they understand nothing? When will you realize that your conduct is a dishonor for yourself?</p>

<p>Hi Adam. As you are going through a Greek phase, could you have a look at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Greek (disambiguation)">Greek</a>? It looks to my uneducated eyes as if the classification of various stages in Greek history used there is different from that used in your history of Greece series. The links don't really go to useful places, which makes disambiguating difficult. I think perhaps <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paideia.html" title="Paideia">Paideia</a> should be removed (it doesn't seem relevant to me) and the list under <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a> should be changed to reflect the history of Greece series. <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenic_civilization.html" title="Hellenic civilization">Hellenic civilization</a> is now a redirect, so that should go too I think - but I'm not really sure how best to fix this, and you seem like the best person to ask for advice.

<p>I am british, but have lived in South Africa for 6 years or so - and can give you all the poop on the Elections :-) A synopsis is that the ANC polled the most in all provinces, only two they did not get a majority, KZN and Western Cape. In the Western Cape they will be in coalition with the NNP, a fading star of the Apartheid era, and KZN is a problem. The ANC could govern with almost anyone as a partner, but it is asking for trouble to not have the IFP involved. The IFP are fed up with the ANC, did (in their mind) disastrously at the polls, and if they scraped all other parties together could just hang in and govern there. The only sensible course is for the IFP and ANC to govern in coalition again, but it was a rocky road last time, and will be rockier again this time. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a> 06:48, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you made it in Paint, you didn't happen to save it as a bitmap (.bmp) in addition to saving it as a JPEG, did you? JPEG compression works by actually introducing "fuzz" into the image to make it more easily compressible; the higher the JPEG compression, the more "fuzz" in the image. Bitmaps, GIFs, and PNGs don't do this. They save the image exactly as it was created. (Bitmaps don't usually perform any compression, though, so the files are pretty big, and GIFs have a maximum of only 256 colors and are surrounded by cloudy patent issues.) For this reason, PNGs are preferable for things like maps and flags and diagrams, where fuzz is especially noticeable, especially around the edges of text. JPEGs work fine for photographs, which are what JPEG was designed for, because they're full of nuances like shadows and blurriness that tend to hide the fuzz.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Converting a JPEG to a PNG doesn't help things, because the fuzz will still be there. If you saved a copy of your original map as a bitmap, then that can be easily converted to a PNG. Newer versions of Paint have the capability to save as PNG. You could also download a free image program called <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.irfanview.com/" rel="nofollow">IrfanView</a> to save it as a PNG, or e-mail it to me at abodeman@yahoo.com and I'll convert it.</dd>

Kim Il-sung</p>
<p>It's all too absurd to get into an argument about. I just saw a documentary tonight in which they said "Kim-il sung has been embalmed in the constitution as eternal president". :)AndyL 08:02, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't know how well informed you are on North Korea but I've been looking for someone to take a look at what I've written in the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Workers_Party_8741.html" title="Korean Workers Party">Korean Workers Party</a> article. Any feedback would be appreciated. Incidentally, the author of "From Stalin to Kim Il-sung: The Formation of North Korea 1945-1960" (the excellent source book I used) is an academic who now lives in Australia. His name is Andrei Lankov. AndyL 08:05, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Marshal of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>In this article you write "It was succeeded by the rank of Marshal of the Russian Federation, which has been held by only one person. " Any idea who that one person is? AndyL 08:11, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll leave the Marshalling to you since I know nothing about him. I was quite surprised by the Beria information myself since it contradicted things I'd read earlier (particularly Medvedev) but it's from Amy Knight's 1993 biography "Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant" which is based on declassified documents. Its quite a fascinating read, I highly recomend it and as far as I can tell the book has been widely accepted as authoritative and no one seems to be disputing her findings. AndyL 08:42, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Knight also felt that Beria's "liberalism" was tactical (it would be difficult to conclude otherwise). I thought her comments on the role of the 1953 German rising on sealing Beria's fate was quite insightful (she argued that it shook the confidence that Malenkov and Molotov had in Beria and caused hem to back Khrushchev's putsch against him).

<p>I'm sick of Eddie. They got him back to do the Logies this year because he's a "brilliant presenter", but that's a load of bull. He's boring. They should bring back Shaun Micallef and leave Eddie off our screens for 12 months so the overexposure can wear off. I mean, Eddie is trying to style himself as "Mr Television" - but to tell the truth I'd even rather have Bert Newton or Jamie Durie. We've all tested our IQs (twice - though some of us know our IQs aren't supposed to change, and if they do then the two IQ tests were not weighted the same), and even tested our driving skills (which was unfair - one of those questions in there was for a yellow sign with a traffic light- we do not have those signs in Western Australia).

The first time this happened in 1959, it was decided that the return dinner for the President of the United States would be held at the Canadian, not the British, embassy. It has become traditional for the Queen to incorporate visits to the United States into some of her longer Canadian tours. I seem to recall the last time the Queen was accompanied to the land border accompanied by a mounted guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with full dress and cavalry lances etc., and flew her Canadian royal standard throughout the visit.

<p>I disagree with your appraisal of the aftermath section here. It is a tidy and appropriate close to the delineation of the split. As you agree by its inclusion, you think it appropriate to indicate that Russia and China ultimately resolve the dispute. Yet, this statement should be as historically supported as the previous information in the article. The aftermath may need reducing, but certainly not this elimination.

<p>I put in a new conclusion that I think is more appropriate. At the very least, it is a succinct version of what is pragmatically necessary to conclude.
