<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>In response to the allegations against him in the “Summary of Evidence” Al Gazzar replied:</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/e/Adel_Fattough_Ali_Al_Gazzar_371f.html" title="Edit section: Training at the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba camp">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Training at the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba camp</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>He denied he had ever been a member of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, or that he had ever said he was a member of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.
<ul>
<li>He acknowledged meeting some people who were members. He argued that it made as much sense to state that meeting Lashkar-e-Tayyiba members made him a member as it would to say metting the Tribunal members made him a member of the US Army.</li>
<li>He pointed out that the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba only accepted members who were from Pakistan, and that he was from Egypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al Gazzar said that the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba was supported by and tied to Pakistan Government.</li>
<li>The Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is composed of believers from the one of the branches of Islam that was opposed by, and opposes, the believers who compose the Taliban and al Qaeda. This makes it very unlikely the groups would be allies. Members of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba who traveled to Afghanistan could expect to be immediately discharged.</li>
<li>Al Gazzar acknowledged paying a two day visit to the Al Aqsa facility. He didn’t train there. As an Egyptian officer he didn’t need any training.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>“...I visited the camp for two days. I didn’t train there. I was an Egyptian Officer. I don’t need any kind of training. I visited the camp after I was invited by the LT. It is not actually a camp it is a joke. It’s not a camp it is several tents on the top of a mountain. They take people from the streets and give them training on the Kalashnikov <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> then send them to <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> to fight. About 95% of them are killed crossing the border by <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. If you want to visit this camp you can go to Pakistan and ask anybody and they will tell you where it is. It is not a secret camp. Anybody can visit there it is an open camp.”</i></dd>

<p>Al Gazzar's Personal Representative added some details from their interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Al Aqsa camp was sponsored by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Services_Intelligence_9c5f.html" title="Inter-Services Intelligence">ISI</a>.</li>
<li>He would not have been allowed to train there, because he was not a Pakistani.</li>

<p>Al Gazzar acknowledged traveling from Pakistan to Afghanistan during Ramadan, around the end of November 2001. He was working for the Saudi Red Crescent. He was working at a Saudi Red Crescent refugee camp on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The camp provided refugees with medicine, tents, food and clothes. He made a brief crossing to help refugees, and was caught in an Americn air raid two hours later, and woke up in a Pakistani hospital in Quetta.</p>
<p>While he was in the hospital in Quetta he received visits from the Governor, and other Pakistani big-wigs. When he tried to talk to them about the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba they warned him not to rock the boat. After 25 days in the hospital in Quetta he was told that he was going to be moved to a more modern hospital, where the surgeons would be able to take better care of his leg. Instead he was transferred to American custody. The Americans took him to Cuba, where he lost his leg.</p>

<p>Al Gazzar responded to the allegation that he was involved in the assassination attempt as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“This has got to be a very big joke. I was in Egypt from 1995 to 2000. I didn’t leave Egypt until August 2000. The attempt occurred in 1995, which means I stayed there for five years after this attempt. Do you think I would stay there for five years if I were involved in such a thing? Besides that in January 2004, the Egyptian Government sent a delegation to Guantanamo. They met me twice here. After the interview they sent a report to the CIA. They mentioned in the report that I am not a member of any organization either in Egypt or outside Egypt and that I was not involved in the assassination attempt. They daid I should be released at once because I was innocent. This report is in my file. I was told about the report from the Egyptian delegation and from my interrogator Big Jim. After the delegation left the island, Big Jim, stood up when I entered the room, shook my hand, said thank you and said I would be released.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Al Gazzar pointed out that the assassination attempt occurred in Ethiopia, while he was at home in Egypt.</p>

<p>Al Gazzar confirmed the two hour excursion he made the day he was wounded was his only visit to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Al Gazzar said he had his ID papers with him when he made his excursion.</p>
<p>Al Gazzar said he traveled from the refugee camp, into Afghanistan, to drive to a village near the border for religious work.</p>
<p>When Al Gazzar was asked why he thought the Pakistanis turned him over to the Americans. He responded that he believed he was sold for a bounty of $10,000.</p>

<dd><i>“A former Egyptian army officer acknowledged that he had undergone training in Afghanistan at a camp run by the Kashiri group, Lashkar-i-Taibi. However, he said, he had been listening to the BBC in February 2001 and heard an announcer describe LiT as a terrorist organization. After that, he said, he quit the group and had never had anything to do with them again. How had he supported himself in Afghanistan over the following year? He had, he said, relied on charity from his fellow Muslims.”</i></dd>
