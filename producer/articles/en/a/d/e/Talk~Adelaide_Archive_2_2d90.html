<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adelaide: City of Corpses?</span></h2>
<p>I remember watching a TV programme a couple of years ago about Adelaide having a terrible Murder rate. Is or was this the case as it seems like such a nice place in the photos. Holden 27</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I recall, there was a British documentary made a few years back, on the Peter Falconio disappearance (in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a>), that mistakingly claimed that Adelaide was the 'murder capital of the world' - a ludicrous suggestion. The show's producers later retracted the comments, removed them from the production and aired an apology. In reality, I think either <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogota.html" title="Bogota">Bogota</a> have the highest murder rates. Althougth, at the time of the documentary, there had, unfortunately, been a recent spate of murders - the Snowtown killings.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 09:56, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To put it another way, even though the rates of murder and other violent crime are quite low, but when something does happen (<a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowtown.html" title="Snowtown">Snowtown</a>, the Beaumont kids, etc) it tends to be grisly and creative enough to get media attention. Our murderers embody a spirit often heard among the city's prouder residents: we're fewer in number but that much more artistic, classier even, than the rest of the country.&#160;:p <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_c0d4.html" title="User:Jiminy Krikkitt"><b>J</b></a>.<b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJiminy_Krikkitt_f78f.html" title="User talk:Jiminy Krikkitt">K</a></b>. 13:15, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a strange analogy, but then Adelaide is a very strange place. Of course the Snowtown murders are an embodiment of Adelaide's unique style. ( what a ludicris offensive statement ) As an interstater, the first thing I noticed was how much poverty and mental illness there was in this city. Dear old Adelaide is a place of extremes. It exhibits a seedy underbelly of extreme feralness while claiming a mantle of high culture on the other. The murders here have recurring themes that centre around pedaphiles, homosexuals and transvestites. Lord knows why the government tries to attract migrants. The truth is that unless your kids have a university degree they are likely to end up working in a factory or within the service industry. Even with a degree you may not find a decent job and will have to leave.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 211.29.3.129 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.29.3.129_214c.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.29.3.129">contribs</a>) 17:29, 28 January 2006.</small></p>

<dd>I think you missed Jiminy's sarcastic tone. Adelaide is no different to any other city in the prevelance of mental illness and poverty (what a ludicrous and offensive statement!). The way Adelaide does differ, which you were close to getting at but ultimately failed with your limited no-doubt Susan Mitchell-derived insight, is that the underbelly is rarely brought to light as it is so frequently in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 08:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Huge Urban Area</span></h2>
<p>Adelaide has a very large urban area for a city of 1.1 million and its suprising the urban area is so large considering Adelaide overall on average has the highest density of people per square Kilometer (615/km²) out of all five major Australian cities. I mean the Northern suburbs extend quite far but the Southern suburbs just go on and on. I made a relevant reference to this under the section "Urban Layout" but someone took it away. Why? what I said is true and I'm from this city so I think I play a role in adding to the page on it. User talk:You Are Here 20:43, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, I've noticed some people putting Categories on the Image page, and then the pictures end up at the bottom of the Category page, below the articles.

<dd>In the sense that Adelaide extends to Wilunga, Adelaide is situated on the Fleurieu Peninsula, which in fact begins in the "City" of Onkaparinga near Flagstaff Hill/Happy Valley.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 10:58, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adelaide doesn't extend to Wilunga. That would take the boundries of Adelaide past McLaren Vale (for instance), which is a separate region (eg: "The McLaren Vale Wine Region"). Most tourism sites seem agree that the Fleurieu is south of Adelaide, eg: <a href="http://www.fleurieupeninsula.com.au/location.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fleurieupeninsula.com.au/location.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.acta.com.au/maps/fleurieu.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acta.com.au/maps/fleurieu.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<dd>Is there a universal definition of "Peninsula"? For tourism purposes, the FP is south of Adelaide, although Mclaren Vale is considered to be on the FP. Looking at your suggested links and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Earth_e2fe.html" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a>, sensible places to draw a straight line to cut the peninsula would be <a href="../../../s/e/l/Sellicks_Beach%2C_South_Australia_4c64.html" title="Sellicks Beach, South Australia">Sellicks Beach</a> to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middleton%2C_South_Australia_9555.html" title="Middleton, South Australia">Middleton</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_285a.html" title="Port Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a> to Milang or <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington%2C_South_Australia_adfb.html" title="Wellington, South Australia">Wellington</a>.

<dd><a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula.html" title="Peninsula">Peninsula</a>: "A peninsula is a geographical formation consisting of an extension of land from a larger body, surrounded by water on three sides." Based on that definition (and some browing on maps from atlas.sa.gov.au) I'd suggest a line from Goolwa to Aldinga Beach would be appropriate.</dd>
<dd>Further research shows <a href="http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/pno/pnores.phtml?recno=SA0024324" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/pno/pnores.phtml?recno=SA0024324" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=176313" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=176313" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I think we can conclude that the Fleurieu starts well south of Adelaide.

<dd>Cyberjunkie's right, As a local, i think most consider the Fleurieu to start somewhere between the northern tip of the City of Onkaparinga (at Darlington) and the top of O'Halloran Hill - Adelaide city is not on the Fleurieu, greater Adelaide is <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliyoung_3a01.html" title="User:Oliyoung">Oliyoung</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Picture at top of page</span></h2>
<p>I added an image to the top of the Adelaide page, showing the skyline. It was promptly moved, and I would like to object to this - the first thing people see when they visit the site is a drab coat of arms and a contents page. An immediate picture helps to make the article seem more interesting. Compare to the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> page.</p>

<dd>Bad coding and layout breaks the layout in firefox - not the addition of images. For the most part, more interesting visual representation will do a lot more for the readability of the article rather than a more drab statistics bar at the top of the page. If someone can balance an introduction, two images and the statistics bar properly than it should be done. Removing it rather than fixing it is the easy and not the appropriate way out.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Headings</span></h2>
<p>Recently, there has been a proliferation of sub-headings in the article. Whilst these headings have been accompanied by truly valuable information, I would like to advise against their use. Generally, (and having being involved in several FAC's I can attest), headings are avoided as they un-necessarily inflate the contents table and interupt the flow of the prose. (It used to be possible to create sub-headings that did not appear in the contents, but the recent MediaWiki upgrade repealed this function.) I have revised the page to reflect this.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 11:14, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't a more diverse amount of headings simply break the text down so it's eaiser to read and differentiate? I havent been able to correctly judge yet - but the for the most part I'd see an enlargement of the contents list as proof of the article's concise and diverse amount of information. In most featured city articles (which I believe the ultimate aim for Adelaide should be) they have a diverse contents list. I've been the one adding most of the information and breaking down/expanding the articles and whilst I wouldn't want to upset the norm, my goal would be a feature-quality article on Adelaide and want to pursue any means to that end. - <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelgabrielsen_5781.html" title="User:Michaelgabrielsen">G</a> 11:48, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Headings by themselves are necessary; sections do enhance the presentation of information. However, <i>sub-headings</i> really do not contribute anything, and are avoided in preference of defined paragraphs. I too would like to see Adelaide become a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a>, although much remains to be done in that regard. Perhaps the best guide or template for Adelaide is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, which is itself the subject of an effort, driven by <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a>, to achieve feature status for Australian city articles. Canberra is being modelled on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, an article frequently invoked as a benchmark for city articles. I have over the past few months been compiling information I plan to use in this article (especially with regards to demographics and history/culture), but am about to enter an especially hectic period of the university semester. The further reading section I added contains two books of particular usefulness. There is also a very brief (almost deficient) to-do list on this page. Please add ideas to it that you think necessary.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New section? CDB &amp; Parklands</span></h2>
<p>New section: "Layout of Adelaide"??</p>
<p>I am thinking about a new section for this article becuase there is no separate article for the CBD (this one potentially includes information about the whole metro area from Reynella to Munno Para). Where would it be best to put info about the layout and arrangement of the CBD itself and the parklands? In the tasklist there is mention of a section that would include "Light's vision" which would be great I think - not just relevant in history section because it is also about the present. Look forward to working on this, but where - in a new section or a new article?</p>
<p>The layout of Adelaide section would include: summary and/or list of the major features in and around parklands and CBD - eg. Botanic gardens, Himeji gardens, lists of major streets, North Tce, Rundle St, etc.</p>
<p>But maybe this is the wrong way to go about it. After all precincts like Norwood Pde deserve the same attention as Rundle St, but isn't in the CBD/Nth Ad/parklands and would miss out...</p>
<p>--Lisa 05:11, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the task list I created for this article, I indicated I thought discussion of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light%27s_Vision_2d13.html" title="Light's Vision">Light's Vision</a> could take place under a then non-existent geography section. The beginnings of a geography section has since been created, but Light's Vision is not yet discussed. However, I am not certain this is the best format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I think we need to recognise that this article needs to discuss Adelaide in terms of its metropolitan area, including the city proper. To clarify terms, the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_business_district.html" title="Central business district">CBD</a>, in an Adelaidean context, is the "Square Mile" or, historically, "South Adelaide". The CBD does not include <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Adelaide_e628.html" title="North Adelaide">North Adelaide</a> or the metropolitan area. (By some interpretations, it may not even include some areas of the Square Mile – but let's not complicate things further). The "City of Adelaide", as per the council area, encompasses the CBD, North Adelaide and the Parklands. If we are to talk about Light's Vision, it is in reference to the City of Adelaide. Only the City could be said to have a particularly notable layout. The metropolitan area is as haphazard as any other city. However, it too should be discussed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking about over city articles, I have a few ideas on how we might structure the Adelaide article. I think the best example of how this article should be structured is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> – which is about to enter FAC, and is based on <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. As an Australian city that was also planned (but in a more complete sense), it has a basic structure that we should follow. By and large, it pretty much already conforms. However, because Adelaide is unique (and homogeneity is not always best) we shouldn't be afraid to format differently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of similarity in terms, I looked at <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. It also has an original city proper – the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a> – that was encased by a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> that developed around it and a metropolitan area beyond that. The London article has a "London Districts" section that details the areas that compose London. Perhaps we could model a section on this, possibly entitled "Layout of Adelaide" as Lisa suggests. Under it we could discuss the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Adelaide_ff46.html" title="City of Adelaide">City of Adelaide</a>, and regions in the metropolitan area. These need to be defined. What are the regions or areas of Adelaide? We could divide Adelaide into Northern-, Southern-, Eastern- and Western Suburbs or we could go further and talk of the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_285a.html" title="Port Adelaide">Port</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holdfast_Bay_c5b3.html" title="Holdfast Bay">Holdfast Bay</a>, the Foothills, the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Plains_790d.html" title="Adelaide Plains">Plains</a> and Wilunga.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alternatively, we could have two sections: one to discuss the City of Adelaide itself ("Layout of Adelaide" again?), and another, "Suburbs of Adelaide" (as used in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>), for the metro region. Under "Suburbs of Adelaide" one could talk of the original satellite villages such as Norwood and Glenelg and the process of surbanisation, well as the suburbs themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the separate articles, I think we should have <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Adelaide_ff46.html" title="City of Adelaide">City of Adelaide</a> like the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a> for more extensive discussion of the City – including its Parklands, streets and CBD – instead of articles like <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_central_business_district.html" title="Melbourne central business district">Melbourne CBD</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_central_business_district.html" title="Sydney central business district">Sydney CBD</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Damn. I've rambled on again. Sorry! This is something that we need to figure out before we really start working on the article. Perhaps we should transfer this to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Adelaide_4bf6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Adelaide">WikiProject Adelaide</a>?

It should not be listed. As no other editor has voiced support for its inclusion, the consensus is for its <i>exclusion</i>.

I suspect the user is in some way associated with the company, and is seeking to promote it here. As an aside, once the media section is rewritten, most of those stations now listed will not be shown. Instead, only <i>major</i> stations, determined by ratings, will be discussed. The rest will perhaps be relegated to a List of Adelaide radio stations. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 16:18, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</div>

<p>Hi all, sorry i had a few issues trying to figure out this talk page thing, but glad to discuss the issues with this link. I shall cover off a few point now, 1) i have no affliation with the station, except that i am an avid listener to it 2) There seems to be an issue becuase its not licenced as a comercial station, thats true it is not. But currently laws in Australia do not regulate webradio station that are non comercial , except for the fact that this station is licenced with APRA, and therefore is licenced to its fullest capabilities. I beleive the station should be listed on this page because of the following reasons 1) its extremely unique to Adelaide (infact Adelaide first and only webradio station. 2) Has conformed to all licencing policies. 3) For these reasons and that it does seek to support Adelaide artists and the 'arts' in general it should be listed in the main index.

<dd>No the issue is that the consensus of regular editors here is that (at present) PlasticAge Radio is not notable in Adelaide.

<p>Hi Adelaide editors. I have temporarily protected the page to stop the revert war over the inclusion of the above mentioned internet radio station. In my experience internet radio stations have to be quite significant in terms of site traffic and so on to pass through the deletion process, this station's site has a page rank of three million + on Alexa (1 is most popular site on the internet). So how about a straw poll to guage concensus amongst editors to decide if a mention of this site stays in this Article?--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 08:01, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Melbourne-Adelaide rivalry</span></h2>
<p>This has nothing to do with the article but I'm wondering it for my own sake, did Adelaide and Melbourne have any rivalry before the Grand Prix was moved, are they rivals outside of the field of securing economic opportunities? I put "arch-rivals" in the grand prix paragraph but that's how feelings between the two cities seemed to me. I was about to put "long-standing rivals" instead but that might be untrue as I didn't pay any real attention to interstate politics before the change in venue. For all I know Sydney and Melbourne might have a greater rivalry. - <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDiceman_dc75.html" title="User:Diceman">Diceman</a> 16:56, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's rivalry on Adelaide's part, much the same as the Sydney-Melbourne rivalry is predominately a Melbourne thing. In our case it's probably just an extension of the SA-Vic rivalry, which again, is mostly on our part. In my experience, Victorians don't really give a shit about Adelaide - they're more pre-occupied with Melbourne being usurped by Sydney as Australia's pre-eminent city.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 03:04, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cyberjunkie is pretty much right about that but Sydney has never usurped them in the sense that Sydney has always had a stronger resonance with others from o/s and here as Australia's centre. Melbourne's relationship with Adelaide has always been playing the bigger, bullying brother. While we are on this topic, thought this article was interesting. Talks about how the rivarly kind of started (SA v Vic):</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the rivalry originates from the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia-Victoria_border_dispute_5806.html" title="South Australia-Victoria border dispute">South Australia-Victoria border dispute</a>. However, I've always thought it had more to do with sport - in particular Aussie Rules, and whether the VFL (now AFL) was better than SANFL. The VFL always had a larger fan base and so more money, which is what matters in the end. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPingku_bd3f.html" title="User:Pingku">Pingku</a> 06:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photos</span></h2>
<p>Further to the previous discussion about photos...</p>
<p>I know this is not a tourist brochure but I miss those other two photos that were up the top of the Adelaide article a few months back. And that "View of the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges" photo, while quite artistic and beautiful is of very little informational value in my opinion. Perhaps some slightly more zoomed in pics for geography? And for education, some photos of the universities might be nice...</p>
<p>One editor suggested making a gallery of thumbnails of pics of Adelaide. I think this might be a good way to include all acceptable photos of Adelaide in one spot so 1) we, the editors know where they are; 2) readers have access to images that add value in a small way; 3) we all can have a single repository of copyright-free photos of Adelaide.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Urban Layout</span></h2>
<p>Good start on this section. However, I should just mention that there was not opposition to Light's design of Adelaide, but his choice of <i>site</i>. Governor Hindmarsh, being the obstinate and authoritarian man that he was, insisted most stridently that Adelaide be a harbour (or coastal) city and advanced the Port River, Holdfast Bay, Kangaroo Island and Boston Bay (Port Lincoln) as locales - the latter two of which would have certainly seen the colony fail. Ultimately though, it was not his decision, and Light and his supporters obtained support the Commissioners in London (much to Hindmarsh's chagrin). --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 13:58, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just a quick question. The article stated that Light's layout was inspired by the garden city movement. However, that article states the movement didn't start until 1899. So either that article is wrong or the Adelaide article is erroneous. Does someone want to check on that?</p>

<dd>It's not celebratory of Dunstan. Like him or not, the era of his premiership is pivotol to the development of modern Adelaide, so much so that almost all literature (that I've come across) agrees.

<p>What I don't understand is how in the main body of text it says that Adelaide's population is almost 1.3 million, yet on the side in the fact box it states that it is 1,124,315 (to me, that is closer to 1.1 million!) . Would someone please be good enough to correct this difference, either by defining what regions are used to define these populations or correcting the wrong one so they match (which I presume is 1.3 million). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrances76_502f.html" title="User:Frances76">Frances76</a> 05:13, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems okay, although I'm unsure. I think Health should have a subsection, as well. I think it's reasonable to separate public transport from other modes; however, the Road Network part could be troublesome.

<p>Hi, featured city articles typically have, health, transport (usually the longest of the three) and utilites; its important not to break that into to many subsections as it really extends the table of contents. So, they are the three infrastructure sections I'd aim for. A Y Arktos did a comparison of the material in the features cities which you guys may find interesting ,it is at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECanberra_9e12.html" title="Talk:Canberra">Talk:Canberra</a>.</p>
<p>If I can offer some peer review the transport section currently in the article is getting a little long, there is too much historical detail and transport cruft (someone in Rome isn't going to care if John Howard opened the airport). More generally try and keep the article around 40 kb, we did it for Autralia, so it should be possible here. The history section for example is a bit more padded than it could be to convey the really interesting things from Adelaide's history. It's probably also a good idea to replace as many of the non-free images in the article as possible, try the commons and flickr - it'll make the FAC process easier when the article is ready.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 03:00, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sport &gt; Port Adelaide Football Club</span></h2>
<p>Oliyoung removed an update to the Port Adelaide Football Club suggesting it was about something called PortPower, There is no such thing called Port Power. There is however the Port Adelaide Football Club est 1870, that was formerly known as the Magpies, the club no longer plays in the SANFL and now plays in the AFL, the clubs team is nicknamed <b>"Power"</b> and the club had a long and proud history in the SANFL up until 1996. The PAFC website will show you the club history, which is correct and the PAMFC website also points out the PAFC joined the AFL. Why do so many take it unto themselves to try and change the clubs history and what the club tells you about itself&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I removed a statement that alluded that the Port Adelaide Football Club (AFL) is the same entity as the Port Adelaide Magpies (SANFL). The Port Adelaide "Power" are a seperate club from the "Magpies". To quote the Magpie's wikipedia entry "in 1995 an organisation separate legally from the existing one but intended to carry on the old club's heritage and culture, the current Port Adelaide Football Club, was incorporated to further the bid."</dd>

<dd>Well, the point behind the notability guidelines is that you don't need knowledge of the music scene, if they've charted, had X record sales etc, then they're notable, it gives us a testable and consistent protocol for future additions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adelaide more dull then Perth?</span></h2>
<p>Just been flicking over the Perth discussion as well as this one, and am surprised that no one has dubbed Adelaide dull, boring or even resorted to it's famous 'overgrown country town' label. I have spent many years in both Adelaide and Perth, and in 2006, would confidently say that Perth is far less dull then Adelaide. The 'Perth lifestyle' seems enviable! Perth also presents more economic prosperitity than most parts of Australia (in line with NW WA exports). Not trying to start another inter-city bicker, Just find it hard to believe that this page does not already start on the topic of dullness- as Perths' does. Unfair i think. Any subscribers?</p>
<p>No. Its sheer opinion, easily refuted by someone else's perception and hence does not belong here. Something some Wikipedia subscribers simply cannot grasp.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unique Kaurna ceased burnoffs when "pushed out"?</span></h2>
<p>&lt;&lt;Among their unique customs were burn-offs (controlled bushfires) in the Adelaide Hills which the early Europeans spotted before the Kaurna people were pushed out by settlement.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The chevronned quote is bizarre: 1. the Kaurna were not the only indigenous in Aust. to use burn-offs 2. there is no connection between their burn-offs and their expropriation 3. the verb "pushed out" is a not atypical downplaying of what actually happened ie land theft, as recognised eg by Edward John Eyre in his writings in the early 1840s. As Henry Reynolds writes, the 19th century British were much more honest than many Australians these days.</p>

<p>I once heard current lord mayor Michael Harbison speak about the concept of Adelaide's layout, which Colonel Light also used in Christchurch NZ, and Toronto. Apparently the grid layout interspersed with city squares, and the parklands "green belt" is derived from a medieval italian concept for the "perfect city", where every block of land would have park frontage (roads in those days being park-like). However I have never seen any documented reference to this "catonaic" urban plan and wonder if anyone knows anything further about it. I've also heard that the width of the parklands roughly corresponds to the range of a 19th century cannon.
