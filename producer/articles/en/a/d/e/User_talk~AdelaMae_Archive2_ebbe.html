<p>The religion split more or less inverted the meaning of the {{User religion|invisible pink unicorn}} userbox. Previously it said something like "This user doesn't really believe in the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a>". Now it says "This user is religious". Not likely... I've removed the box from my page. <a href="../../../h/f/u/User%7EHFuruseth_afc4.html" title="User:HFuruseth">HFuruseth</a> 02:27, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that the person who took over doing the split after me didn't go around fixing the userpages of everyone who used the old {{User religion}} splits to refer to the new, split templates. Now that the template has been split, anyone whose userpage used to contain {{User religion|whatever}} is going to see the default {{User religion}} box. The template you want is {{User IPU2}}. If I ever have free time (I can only hope!) I might see what I can do to fix this problem for others. It even took me a while to notice it on my own userpage. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 04:03, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. Thanks for the info. BTW, something similar has happened to {{User wikipedia|anti-administrator}}, I don't know whom to tell about that. And the IPU2/IPU2 boxes lost the image from the original. Anyway, no big deal for me, maybe I'll take all this as a hint to remove a bunch of my userboxes instead:-) <a href="../../../h/f/u/User%7EHFuruseth_afc4.html" title="User:HFuruseth">HFuruseth</a> 04:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...but the vandal you reported on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> had a final warning from yesterday, not today. It depends on the admin looking at it whether that would constitute a non-warned vandal. I did block the vandal, because they've been blocked and warned multiple times before.

<p>Bandia dhuit, Adela Mae. I am curious about something. Since there will definitely be interest in a WikiProject for neopagan-related articles, and you already set it up, why not just formally make it a Wikiproject in its own right? In my opinion, it deserves to be listed as such.</p>

<p>As I remember, the last spam that was handed out was on the 20th of December last year, so I think it's time for another update. First and foremost, the new Advisory Council and Administrator General have been elected. They consist of <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">myself</a> as Admin General and <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Titoxd</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> as the Advisory Council. We as a group met formally for the first time on the 31st of Decembe. The minutes of this meeting can be found at <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM_e471.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM">WP:ESP/ACM</a></b>.

<dd>Those templates are supposed to be used extremely sparingly, so in some sense, I guess you could say only those who know how to use them are "in the know". There really wasn't any discussion I was aware of.

<p>Am I correct in inferring that this anonymous harasser is being dealt with by administrative blocks? If so, that is what I would favor. I do not like the idea of long-term unilateral administrative action against registered users, but disruptive anonymous editors are a different matter altogether. (Also, his cowardice and hypocrisy in claiming to identify posters by their true names when he hides behind anonymity is appalling.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 16:28, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You wrote: <i>I do not believe blocking this user will be a loss to Wikipedia because I do not get the impression that this person was here to contribute to Wikipedia.</i> I agree. He appears to be a hostile disruptive editor. I don't know if he also makes any good edits, but even if he does, the benefit is outweighed by the harm. Anonymous disruptive editors are in some ways easier to deal with than signed-in disruptive editors. Anonymous disruptive editors are usually just blocked, while "obsessional" editors typically have to be banned by the ArbCom. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 17:31, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AdelaMae - you are correct - only the developers actually have the technical ability to permanently remove information from Wikipedia. An administrator who deletes a page only puts the edits into a state where the content is only visible to admins - the information is still technically accessible.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't have a very good answer to give you regarding your question. I don't know where would be the best place to go. From what I've seen, usually, people just post these requests on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, and from there, the information is removed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I should have blocked 65.182.172.x the very first time I encountered this problem. Unfortunately, the situation was quite new for me. At least I will know what to do in the future. The fact is, this problem should not have escalated to this point. It should have been capped right at the start, so in some sense, it was a failure on my part. This issue of privacy on Wikipedia is probably something that is beyond my ability to answer adequately at the moment.</p>
<p>I can tell you that if I were to receive a request to remove personal information from Wikipedia, I would follow through with that to the best of my capability - it just makes sense to do so. In your case, which 70 edits are you referring to? Which page history is it in? You don't need to point out every single edit - that would be a waste of time. I can look for these myself in the page history. Just let me know which page it is on. Once this is done, I might go and delete the RfC so that the record of those edits will be gone. Let me know what you think. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 06:02, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Honestly, it's already in the google cache. I'd personally prefer to have the RfC serve as documentation of the events even if it has to be taken to someone's user space. This fellow will be back, whether it's with a different IP in the same block, a proxy IP or a username. I googled the fellow who the anon user kept mentioning by name as my "secret identity" and the first hit was this incident on wikipedia. (Apparently the guy has <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7ETheism_archive_1_092d.html" title="Talk:Theism/archive 1">edited here before</a>, but I cannot find a contribution history for his user name.) Regardless, I think AdelaMae's concerns about the potential for things like this to escalate before admin intervention is a real concern, and honestly I am still a little disatisfied with the way it all went down, although that is not anyone's fault. There seems to be some problems with the administrative function of notification and dealing with harassment and outright stalkers. It was like watching a train wreck. BTW, does the 3rv rule apply when someone is engaging in ad hominem or vandalism? Thanks for all you've done to help us out on this, Happy Camper. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberdenizen_2f21.html" title="User:Cyberdenizen">Cyberdenizen</a> 08:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason why the response was unsatisfactory was partly because, in my opinion, adminstrators are not trained explicity to handle such things on Wikipedia, myself included. Thinking back, had it occurred to me that this might be a recurring problem, I would have done things differently. Yours and AdelaMae's concerns are simply not addressed very well on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, sometimes it is only experiences like this which help bring attention to issues that are not being adequately addressed on Wikipedia. It is clear that the procedures need to be more transparent, both to the newcomer, and for the experienced volunteer. When I get a chance, I will try and update the relevant policy pages - at least on the bright side, this is actually possible!</dd>

<dd>Well, in the post above, I was suggesting that I might delete some of the edits, but after looking at the page history, I think I will leave it as is, especially since AdelaMae has already sent the list to someone to take a look at. It has been escalated to the point where I think I have done as much as I can to help out.</dd>

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details).

<p>Thanks for your message. I read the discussion on TfD. It looks like the usual bogus bullshit to me. Most editors steer clear of that page and crap userboxes get kept by landslides. Luckily, there are admins who will do the right thing anyway. This template should be speedied under T1. It's homophobic and clearly divisive on that account. I look askance at editors who want it kept. It's like you ran up a flag.

<dd>If by saying "I look askance at editors who want it kept. It's like you ran up a flag," you mean to imply that you think I am homophobic, you are badly mistaken; I am a lesbian and a card-carrying member of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Campaign_db83.html" title="Human Rights Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>. However, the box merely expresses an opinion on same-sex marriage, and it seems obvious to me that so long as we allow any userboxes expressing opinions on same-sex marriage, we must allow <i>all</i> userboxes expressing opinions on same-sex marriage; we can't discriminate against those opinions we don't like. This interpretation of Wikipedia policy was borne out by the consensus on the TfD - and I would like to remind you that 22 editors voted to keep, which is more than even vote in the average AfD, so your claim that the discussion only went that way because the page is neglected is unwarranted. Therefore, there is (at the least!) debate as to whether this box meets the speedy criteria, and when there is debate as to whether a page meets the speedy criteria, the procedure is to take it to 'X'fD for discussion. Also, please note the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">official deletion policy</a>: "In general, if an article has had a deletion discussed and this did not result in a "delete" decision, the article should not be immediately renominated for deletion." This is doubly true in a case like this where there was not only no consensus to delete, but there was in fact a very clear consensus to keep. Repeatedly nominating this template for speedy deletion, despite the demonstrated consensus that it should be kept, is inappropriate and against policy. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:10, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By "you", I meant "you" general, not "you" Adele. Your wanting it kept was inexplicable to me. Now I understand. You want it so that your faction can express its (equally divisive) views (although you don't display any such box yourself). "Repeatedly nominating this template for speedy deletion, despite the demonstrated consensus that it should be kept, is inappropriate and against policy." You're simply wrong. The template is contra CSD T1 and should be deleted. If you managed to create a "consensus" to keep "User hates niggers", would you insist that it should be kept?

<p>Thanks for your message. I'm not picking on this particular userbox. It just happens to have come to my attention. I tend to deal with whatever's in front of me. I do take your point. Were I an admin, I'd happily delete all userboxes of this type. I would as soon rid us of "user supports gay marriage" as "user thinks gays should not get married". I'm not pushing a particular POV here, although I do have one.</p>
<p>I have followed the Userbox deletion wars as it happens. My view originally was that it was a huge fuss about nothing, but on reflection, I've been converted to the view that userboxes that divide Wikipedians into pros and antis are not a good idea. The template thing is the clincher for me. If the boxes were just drawn on user pages, I don't think they would have aroused people's interest so greatly. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:55, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

One occasionally comes across editors who have thousands of good edits, but because they may not get around as much as others, their contributions and hard work often go un-noticed. Sadly, these editors often leave the project. As Esperanzians, we can help to make people feel appreciated, be it by some kind words or the awarding of a Barnstar. A project the size of Wikipedia has thousands of editors, so there are plenty of people out there who deserve recognition, one just has to find them.

I understand some of the delimna going on with Wikipedia. I do personally think that we reference a specific religon like Wicca or Santeria, it would be iportaant to use the capitolization forms. The terms neopagan, and pagan have been so widespread, to the average reader it probably won't make much of a difference. But then your bubble is burst when you have the extremist pagan slam his fist in your face (figuratively I am speaking, I hope), you didn't capitolize it! If you make the claim that only specifice religions and Proper names are to be capitolized, but not the names of movements or traditions, maybe then you'll have some leverage. As a former Wiccan, now I just term myself "A Believer in Deity", I know how agrivating it can be to please people with such widespread beliefs. We are supposed to be open-minded, but like any other religion we fall prey to the hands of the ever fateful "my way is right, therefore yours isn't." Such childish behavior, and we're supposed be adults. I'd hope that if you make the claim about the capitolization issue in a section titled "Why these words aren't capitolized" and explain the situation, maybe people would be less upset by it. Often I read articles on Wicca, where Wicca is sometimes capitolised, but in other places in the text it will read "wicca." I personally think you should give yourself credit, and make an effort to place on the page an explanation for whichever route you chose. At least people then would have an understanding why you did or did not capitolizwe a word.</p>

<p>It is important to note that classical Roman, Greek, mythology is not neo-paganism. Sure neo-pagans may incorporate the mythology into their religious structure. Simply put, neo-paganism has adopted classical mythology. The gods and goddesses of these mythologies should therefore be placed under the category mythology, and not under neo-paganism. Or at least that is my opinion.</p>

Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>.

However, all matters listed on this page must not be of an argumentative nature. You do not need to be a member of Esperanza (or this program) to place or fulfill requests on this page.
