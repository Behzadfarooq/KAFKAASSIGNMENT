<p>i think it's great that you added the adena culture to wikipedia... i have long had an interest in local archaeology (in live in sw pennsylvania) and the adena and hopewell cultures are some of the most interesting. on a side note- do a google search for "octagon moonrise" that site has some interesting info about the celestial alignments of the newark, oh mounds (hopewell) - you'd probably be interested in it...</p>
<p>but there is no archaeological evidence, at least none that holds up under scrutiny, that ANY native american cultures (pre-columbian or not) had significant numbers of people that tall. i am a member of the Society for Pa Archaeology and have participated in many discusssions on how this myth first developed. most archaeologists believe that it simply lies in misinterpretations made by early archaeologists (from the late 1800s and early 1900s) based on the layout of the bones they would find. and once stated in their findings, and embedded the conscience of those interested, well... those myths have persisted to this day.</p>
<p>so i would, if i were you, remove that portion of your entry. it is simply wrong. other than that, i liked the article.</p>

i always forget how to sign my responses. if this doesn't work, my wikipedia name is "los diablos" - feel free to comment on my talk page.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and it is inappropriate to give resources as "search Google". If you think that turns up useful material such as names of books, directly list the names of the books. This article can be reused in many different ways, not just as a Wikipedia web page. If the page is printed, or if someone can't use Google in China, but they have a library or a bookstore, the names of the books will still be useful. Also the results of a Google search can change radically over time, as their software and the web evolves; a search that works well today may not work so well in six months. Stop by the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Help desk</a> or the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Village pump</a> if you need further guidance. However, it is completely OK to put the Google hints on this Talk page to help other editors do more research.</p>
<p>Incidentally, don't expect much feedback from peer review now, since the article is far from ready for that level of scrutiny. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 21:22, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, on average the Adena males were 5 ft 6, and women 5ft 2.Yes it's true that the people, overall, were not very tall. However, The very tall ones were infact the honored ruler class--The skeletons of those found in the actual burial mounds. These elite guys were averaging about 6 feet in height, with some men 7 feet or more in stature.</p>
<p>I can think of a number of tribes who had men as tall as 7 feet within the last several hunbdred years:</p>
<p>The Rappahannocks of Virginia, Susquehannocks of Pennsylvania, Karankawas of Texas, and the Seris of Tiburon Island-- all had reported men of very tall stature among their tribes.</p>
<p>Many of the first Spanish and English explorers, though fanciful, did report coming across men of uncommonly huge size. John Smith speaks of the Susquehannocks as giants. DeSoto's captains report coming across a Seri Indian so tall, the tallest man only came to the giant's chest.</p>
<p>But it would be foolish to take everything out of context and say that the Native Americans were giants in general... Infact, most were rather average, with some very tall, and some very short among the different tribes.</p>
