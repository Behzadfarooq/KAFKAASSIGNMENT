<dd>I would argue that even the reference desk is not a place for homework questions. If the questioner has got this far it does not seem unreasonable to expect them to read the articles. At the reference desk it is appropriate to answer by pointing out the relevent article but not to give the answer. I'm not saying we should not give help in finding the answer but just handing it over seems a little lame. Some questions at the reference desk are obviously not homework so i would normally be happy asnwering such questions. Obviously it is a bit subjective trying to draw the line between the two. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 19:09, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont understand why is GTP used in some reaction in place of ATP eg. in gluconeogenesis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenosine_triphosphate.html" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a> and <a href="../../../g/t/p/GTP_f3ea.html" title="GTP">GTP</a> are energetically equivalent (i.e., the same amount of energy can be harnessed from ATP as from GTP), their use in biochemical reactions is <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme.html" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a>-dependent. Some enzymes, such as <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succinyl-CoA_synthetase_c0d7.html" title="Succinyl-CoA synthetase">succinyl-CoA synthetase</a>, use GTP to drive <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalysis.html" title="Catalysis">catalysis</a>. Others, like <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexokinase.html" title="Hexokinase">hexokinase</a>, require ATP instead. Which <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleotide.html" title="Nucleotide">nucleotide</a> gets used depends heavily on the specificity of the enzyme in question, which in turn depends on the enzyme's <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amino_acid.html" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> composition and secondary/tertiary structures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, for what it's worth, the production of <a href="../../../g/t/p/GTP_f3ea.html" title="GTP">GTP</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenosine_triphosphate.html" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a> by certain enzymes is inconsequential since GTP can be converted to ATP via <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substrate-level_phosphorylation.html" title="Substrate-level phosphorylation">substrate-level phosphorylation</a>. --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">Diberri</a> 22:54, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe there is also an anabolic/catabolic and protein/fat/carbohydrate/nucleic acid distinction at work in there as well. My guess is there is separation to allow the cell to target energy resourses to specific pathways. Can anybody confirm this? --Anonymous</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I know that this discussion is over a year old, but it's been sitting unanswered for far too long. I'll find the answer and look it up. â <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 18:25, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is partially untrue. While the reason for ATP's role difference over GTP is unclear (in terms of etiology; and may be arbitrary) there *is* a clear distinction between the usage-modes of ATP vs. GTP. Outside of reactions where they are used as synthetic accessories, ATP is used primarily as an energy exchange medium; the breaking of ATP's phosphodiester bonds are used to perform irreversible work, and the ADP is typically immediately released by the enzyme involved in the process so that it may be recycled. HOWEVER, the energy released by GTP is used to irreversibly change the conformation of the enzyme, sort of a molecular switch. The resultant GDP remains bound to the enzyme, altering its conformation, and thus its function. Later, accessory proteins called GEFs (GDP/GTP exchange factors) remove the GDP and allow the process to recycle. So in this case energy is used to ratchet the enzyme through three states - apo, holo-gtp, and holo-gdp. The conformations (and functions) are different in all three states, and the halflives of each state are carefully titrated by evolution to enable the molecule to correctly perform its function. Thus GTP is not merely an "energy store" but an accessory for molecular switching. UTP in eukaryotes has a general use as a transport handle; small molecules are often tagged with UDP to get them across certain lipid bilayers. "alternative" (i.e. non-rna-synthesis) roles for CTP have been less well explored.</dd>

<dd>ATP cant be stored as such so "eating it" would be pointless, furthermore it is constantly being utilised by the body so the effects would be very short term. Further to that the body would use its ATP in ~3s during very intense explosive exercise (ie first 10m of 100m sprint), but rapid regeneration occurs via creatinephospate (ie ATP+CP energy system). You can increasine CP stores in the muscle via <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatine.html" title="Creatine">creatine</a> supplementation and in fact that is what weight lifters and body builders do, it is a proven ergogenic aid. hope that helps somewhat. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrengthCoach_fa6d.html" title="User:StrengthCoach">StrengthCoach</a> 20:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The leaving of the first proton (any of the four in the "phosphate" part) gives a net (-) charge to the whole molecule wich makes it dificult for a second proton to leave, thus resulting in a higher (or lower, depending how you look at it) <i>p</i>K<sub>2</sub> value. The same applies for the third leaving proton - its <i>p</i>K<sub>3</sub> is even higher (lower). Without any cations only two of the phosphate -OH groups would dissociate, inside the cell the divalent cations (mostly Mg<sup>2+</sup>) would shield the charges resulting from the leaving of the first 2 protons bringing the net charge to 0 - this will allow the last two -OH groups to dissociate. - <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 18:55, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON BIOCHEMISTRY, but I just watched the most recent episode of the TV show ER on TiVo and the numbers they quoted disagree with this article. On ER a "biochemistry professonr" said that there was 1/2 lb of ATP in a human body (I assume that means ADP + ATP since they are inter-converted) and he also said that each molecule was recycled 300 times per day. If I understand this article, the body has 0.1 mole x 507 g/mole = 50.7 g which is less than 1.8 ounces instead of 8 ounces. Also this article says ATP is recycled 2000 to 3000 times per day instead of 300. I doubt that the writers of ER just made up these numbers - I hope they came from some expert. So what do the experts on Wikipedia say about this discrepency? - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankH_ef3c.html" title="User:FrankH">FrankH</a> 04:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are the numbers I have at hand for an average size human at rest. I can drag out the reference if you are interested. This does not help with your figures above
<dl>
<dd>9 x 10<sup>20</sup> molecules of ATP are metabolised each second.</dd>
<dd>65kg of ATP produced each day per person (obviously we don't gain weight this is reflected in the high turnover of the molecule.</dd>
<dd>Consume 700g glucose</dd>
<dd>Excrete 1kg carbon dioxide</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Given those numbers 65,000/50.7 would suggest that the turnover (recycle) is 1300. Given my figures are for at rest the wiki article would appear to be in the right ball park. If the quantity of ATP is nearer 220g, as suggested by ER, then the turnover rate would be 300 as the show suggests. So the disputed figure here is the total ATP in the body (I would argue that is ATP, ADP and AMP). I suspect ER had the correct amount of ATP turned over each day but overestimated the amount of ATP in the body. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:19, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Also a suggestion for section "1 Chemical Properties". Figures of -12 kCal/mole and -7.3 kCal/mole mean nothing to me, so when it says "This massive release of energy...." it would be very helpful if there were a comparison that would be more meaningful to me. For example, compare the energy content of common sugar or fat per gram to the energy content of ATP per gram. Any expert able to supply this kind of comparison? - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankH_ef3c.html" title="User:FrankH">FrankH</a> 04:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not that simple and it is a misrepresentation to say there is a massive release of energy. That needs to be changed. In fact ATP the terminal phosphoanhydride bond is an intermediate energy bond. Also you seem to be equating the energy of ATP with the whole molecule but we are only dealing with one chemical bond in ATP. The -7.3 kcal/mol (or -12 kcal/mol depending on the physiological concentrations) above is the free energy available for work after the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. I could tell you that glucose has almost 686 kcal/mol for the oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and that provides enough energy to synthesis about 36 ATP molecules from ADP. Since the synthesis of ATP would require at least + 7.3 kcal/mol the energy required would be 36 x 7.3 = 263. Consequently not all the energy from glucose oxidation would be used and there is an efficiency of about ~40% (actually very good compared to most machines). I think this is partly what you were hoping for although i do not think it is what will make it more meaningful.</dd>
<dd>The key is to compare the free energy available from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP compared to other similar reactions. The hydrolysis of <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glucose_6-phosphate.html" title="Glucose 6-phosphate">glucose 6-phosphate</a> to glucose releases -3.3 kcal/mol. on the other hand the hydrolysis of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphoenolpyruvate.html" title="Phosphoenolpyruvate">phosphoenolpyruvate</a> to pyruvate releases -14.8 kcal/mol. As i said ATP is an intermediate energy molecule. This make sense since it is reactions such as <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphoenolpyruvate.html" title="Phosphoenolpyruvate">phosphoenolpyruvate</a> to pyruvate that can phosphorylate ADP back to ATP by <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substrate_level_phosphorylation.html" title="Substrate level phosphorylation">substrate level phosphorylation</a>. For such a reaction to occur it has to release more free energy than is required to make ATP (7.3 -12 kcal/mol) and of course it does. If ATP was a high energy molecule it would be much harder to synthesis it in the cell. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:22, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, the molecule that the professor pointed to in that episode and called "ATP" wasn't actually ATP; it was the supramolecular complex called "ATP synthase", whose role is to make ATP. I guess a small molecule just doesn't look as sexy on screen as a huge protein.

<dd>Since this is a question of turnover, we are discussing ATP; how many ATP molecules are produced per unit of time. If one condsiders this value for any given day it is much greater than the total pool of ATP, ADP and AMP.

<dd>Actually none of these molecules stores energy per se. Fats and carbohydrates produce most of their energy only when burned in oxygen, and even the breakdown of glucose to lactic acid produces energy only because it's hydrated lactate and the bonds in COOH are also more powerful and stable than anything in a sugar or alcohol. The problem with ATP is that generations of students have been told that there's something special about those phosphate bonds, that they give energy when broken. They don't. All chemical bonds take energy to break, or they wouldn't exist in the first place. Energy from ATP is obtained when the phosphate bonds are broken AND the products are hydrated. It's the hydration energy that drives the whole process. If you didn't have water and the proper concentrations, the thing would go nowhere. In that sense, water is sort of the "second fuel" which make this process go, in somewhat the same way that oxygen is the forgotten part of the energy that "exists" in a bit of food. Actually the energy isn't in the food per se, but rather can be extracted from the potential combination of food/fuel and oxygen.

<p>I don't really agree with the figure of 200-300 mole of ATP for daily need. It would mean 150kg of ATP and I heard in a biophysic course that it was about the third of that . Should somebody add a reference to back those figure, and gave some precision about this need (ie, is it the effective comsuption of all our cells are what we need to eat as energy but fail to convert in atp?) <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.224.181.243 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.224.181.243_d443.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.224.181.243">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>There is a Nature article that cites 9 x 10<sup>20</sup> molecules of ATP are metabolised each second at rest. I'll have to find the reference again but it is the one i used to get the figure at the top of this talk page. If true, that equates to 130 moles per day.

<dd>IMO, pretty much anything but the idealized version. It looks like 1xdn is just an "ordinary" structure, not some high-resolution study of ATP or anything, and I imagine the angles are somewhat flexible; you can probably use whatever ATP conformation gives the best view of its shape. I rather like the current one. (I'd also go hydrogenless for the space-filling view at least.) <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't gotten around to editing the actual article much, but - I like how the animation shows the 3d structure but would rather see the rotation slowed down a bit. Also, having it in the same rough orientation as the others (ie, vertically flipped 180) might be clearer. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 07:50, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I like the animation! Maybe a bit slower. In general I prefer licorice-like depictions rather than space filling because in space filling I find it hard to grasp the atomic structure.
