	    <p>'<i><b>Following are some Islamic concepts referenced by Quranic Verses.'</b></i></p>
<p><br />
<b>Increase &amp; Decrease in Emaan</b> Al-Imran (003).173 Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us God sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs."</p>
<p>Toba (009).124 Whenever there cometh down a sura, some of them say: "Which of you has had His faith increased by it?" Yea, those who believe,- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.</p>
<p>Al-Kahaf (018).013 We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced them in guidance:</p>
<p>Mariam (019).076 "And God doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return."</p>
<p>Al-Ahzab (033).022 When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: "This is what God and his Apostle had promised us, and God and His Apostle told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.</p>
<p>Muhammad (047).017 But to those who receive Guidance, He increases the (light of) Guidance, and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil).</p>
<p>Al-Fatah (048).004 It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers, that they may add faith to their faith;- for to God belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Noor ya Bashar</b></p>
<p>Al-Kahf (018).110 Say: "I am but a man like yourselves, (but) the inspiration has come to me, that your God is one God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner.</p>
<p>Al-Anbiya (021).003 Their hearts toying as with trifles. The wrong-doers conceal their private counsels, (saying), "Is this (one) more than a man like yourselves? Will ye go to witchcraft with your eyes open?"</p>
<p>Al-Anbiya (021).034 We granted not to any man before thee permanent life (here): if then thou shouldst die, would they live permanently?</p>
<p>Al-Furqan (025).007 And they say: "What sort of an apostle is this, who eats food, and walks through the streets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him to give admonition with him?</p>
<p>Al-Furqan (025).008 "Or (Why) has not a treasure been bestowed on him, or why has he (not) a garden for enjoyment?" The wicked say: "Ye follow none other than a man bewitched." Al-Furqan (025).020 And the apostles whom We sent before thee were all (men) who ate food and walked through the streets: We have made some of you as a trial for others: will ye have patience? for God is One Who sees (all things).</p>
<p>Fussilat (041).006 Say thou: "I am but a man like you: It is revealed to me by Inspiration, that your God is one God: so stand true to Him, and ask for His Forgiveness." And woe to those who join gods with God,-</p>
<p>Yunus (010).002 Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves?- that he should warn mankind (of their danger), and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!"</p>
<p><br />
<b>Khilafat</b></p>
<p>Yunus (010).013 Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their apostles came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!</p>
<p>Yunus (010).014 Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave!</p>
<p>Yunus (010).015 But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: "Bring us a reading other than this, or change this," Say: "It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come)."</p>
<p>An-Nur (024).055 God has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance (of power), as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their state), after the fear in which they (lived), to one of security and peace: 'They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me. 'If any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Ilm-ul-Ghaib (Knowledge of Unseen)</b></p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).032 They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."</p>
<p>Al-An'am (006).003 And He is God in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, and what ye reveal, and He knoweth the (recompense) which ye earn (by your deeds).</p>
<p>Al-An'am (006).050 Say: "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing?" Will ye then consider not?</p>
<p>Al-An'am (006).059 With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).</p>
<p>AL Araf (007).187 They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time? Say: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone): None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you." They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof: Say: "The knowledge thereof is with God (alone), but most men know not."</p>
<p>AL Araf (007).188 Say: "I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God willeth. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith."</p>
<p>Toba (009).101 Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty.</p>
<p>Yunus (010).020 They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The Unseen is only for God (to know), then wait ye: I too will wait with you."</p>
<p>Hud (011).123 To God do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goeth back every affair (for decision): then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.</p>
<p>Ar-Ra'd (013).008 God doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion.</p>
<p>Ar-Ra'd (013).009 He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High.</p>
<p>Al-Nahal (016).077 To God belongeth the Mystery of the heavens and the earth. And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twingkling of an eye, or even quicker: for God hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Al-Kahf (018).026 Say: "God knows best how long they stayed: with Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share His Command with any person whatsoever.</p>
<p>Taha (020).110 He knows what (appears to His creatures as) before or after or behind them: but they shall not compass it with their knowledge.</p>
<p>Luqman (031).034 Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with God (alone). It is He Who sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does any one know what it is that he will earn on the morrow: Nor does any one know in what land he is to die. Verily with God is full knowledge and He is acquainted (with all things).</p>
<p>Al-Ahzab (033).063 Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, "The knowledge thereof is with God (alone)": and what will make thee understand?- perchance the Hour is nigh!</p>
<p>Fatir (035).038 Verily God knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men's) hearts.</p>
<p>Az-Zukhruf(043).085 And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all between them: with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment): and to Him shall ye be brought back.</p>
<p>Al-Hujurat(049).018 "Verily God knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth: and God Sees well all that ye do."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Death of Prophet(SAW)</b></p>
<p>Al-Imran (003).144 Muhammad is no more than an apostle: many Were the apostle that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to God; but God (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.</p>
<p>Al-Imran (003).185 Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception.</p>
<p>Az-Zummer (039).030 Truly thou wilt die (one day), and truly they (too) will die (one day).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Auliya Allah (Friends of God)</b></p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).071 He said: "Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord: dispute ye with me over names which ye have devised - ye and your fathers,- without authority from God? then wait: I am amongst you, also waiting."</p>
<p>yousaf (012).040 "If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which God hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but God: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not...</p>
<p>younas (010).062 Behold! verily on the friends of God there is no fear, nor shall they grieve;</p>
<p>younas (010).063 Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil;-</p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).002 This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear God;</p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).003 Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;</p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).004 And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Taqleed (Blindly Following)</b></p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).170 When it is said to them: "Follow what God hath revealed:" They say: "Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers." What! even though their fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance?</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).003 Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends or protectors, other than Him. Little it is ye remember of admonition.</p>
<p>Al-Anbiya (021).052 Behold! he said to his father and his people, "What are these images, to which ye are (so assiduously) devoted?"</p>
<p>Al-Anbiya (021).053 They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them."</p>
<p>Al-Anbiya (021).054 He said, "Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers."</p>
<p>Al-Maidah (005).107 When it is said to them: "Come to what God hath revealed; come to the Apostle": They say: "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following." what! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance?</p>
<p>Luqman (031).021 When they are told to follow the (Revelation) that God has sent down, they say: "Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers (following). "What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the (Blazing) Fire?</p>
<p>As-Saffat (037).069 Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path;</p>
<p>As-Saffat (037).070 So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps!</p>
<p><br />
<b>Invoking Supplication to other than Allah</b></p>
<p>Al-Fatiha (001).004 Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek.</p>
<p>Al-Baqara (002).186 When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also, with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in the right way.</p>
<p>An-Nisa (004).116 God forgiveth not (The sin of) joining other gods with Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this: one who joins other gods with God, Hath strayed far, far away (from the right).</p>
<p>An-Nisa (004).117 (The Pagans), leaving Him, call but upon female deities: They call but upon satan the persistent rebel!</p>
<p>Al-Ana'am (006).071 Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides God,- things that can do us neither good nor harm,- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God? - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the ear th, his friends calling, come to us, (vainly) guiding him to the path." Say: "God's guidance is the (only) guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds;-</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).191 Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created?</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).192 No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves!</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).193 If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace!</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).194 Verily those whom ye call upon besides God are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful!</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).195 Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: "Call your 'god-partners', scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite!</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).196 "For my Protector is God, Who revealed the Book (from time to time), and He will choose and befriend the righteous.</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).197 "But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves."</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).198 If thou callest them to guidance, they hear not. Thou wilt see them looking at thee, but they see not.</p>
<p>Yunus (010).022 He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea; so that ye even board ships;- they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they cry unto God, sincerely offering (their) duty unto Him saying, "If thou dost deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!"</p>
<p>Ar-Ra'd (013).016 Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) God." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to God partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "God is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible."</p>
<p>Al-Hajj (022).073 O men! Here is a parable set forth! listen to it! Those on whom, besides God, ye call, cannot create (even) a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! and if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition!</p>
<p>An-Naml (027).062 Or, Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves its suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides God? Little it is that ye heed!</p>
<p>Saba (034).022 Say: "Call upon other (gods) whom ye fancy, besides God: They have no power,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: No (sort of) share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to God.</p>
<p>Fatir (035).040 Say: "Have ye seen (these) 'Partners' of yours whom ye call upon besides God? Show Me what it is they have created in the (wide) earth. Or have they a share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book from which they (can derive) clear (evidence)?- Nay, the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions.</p>
<p>Az-Zumar (039).038 If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, "God". Say: "See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides God,- can they, if God wills some Penalty for me, remove His Penalty?- Or if He wills some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?" Say: "Sufficient is God for me! In Him trust those who put their trust."</p>
<p>Ghafir (040).060 And your Lord says: "Call on Me; I will answer your (Prayer): but those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in Hell - in humiliation!"</p>
<p>Ash-Shura (042).031 Nor can ye frustrate (aught), (fleeing) through the earth; nor have ye, besides God, any one to protect or to help.</p>
<p>Al-Ahqaf (046).004 Say: "Do ye see what it is ye invoke besides God? Show me what it is they have created on earth, or have they a share in the heavens bring me a book (revealed) before this, or any remnant of knowledge (ye may have), if ye are telling the truth!</p>
<p>Al-Ahqaf (046).005 And who is more astray than one who invokes besides God, such as will not answer him to the Day of Judgment, and who (in fact) are unconscious of their call (to them)?</p>
<p>Al-Ahqaf (046).006 And when mankind are gathered together (at the Resurrection), they will be hostile to them and reject their worship (altogether)!</p>
<p><br />
<b>Obey Allah(S.W.T) and Obey Rasool(SAW)</b></p>
<p>Al-Imran (003).032 Say: "Obey God and His Apostle": But if they turn back, God loveth not those who reject Faith.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Sects &amp; Firqabandi</b></p>
<p>Al-Imran (003).103 And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude God's favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth God make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Ahl-e-Bait (Household of Prophet)</b></p>
<p>Al-Ahzaab (033).006 The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties, in the Decree of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of Allah). Al-Ahzaab (033).028 O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of this World, and its glitter,- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner. Al-Ahzaab (033).029 But if ye seek God and His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter, verily God has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward. Al-Ahzaab (033).030 O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for God. Al-Ahzaab (033).031 But any of you that is devout in the service of God and His Apostle, and works righteousness,- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance. Al-Ahzaab (033).032 O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (Allah), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just. Al-Ahzaab (033).033 And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless. Hood (011).073 They said: "Dost thou wonder at God's decree? The grace of God and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!"</p>
<p><br />
<b>Tasarruf-e-Auliya</b></p>
<p>Al-Imran (003).026 Say: "O God! Lord of Power (And Rule), Thou givest power to whom Thou pleasest, and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest: Thou enduest with honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: In Thy hand is all good. Verily, over all things Thou hast power.</p>
<p>Al-A'raf (007).158 day: "O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Apostle of God, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death. So believe in God and His Apostle, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in God and His words: follow him that (so) ye may be guided."</p>
<p>Hud (011).006 There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on God: He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record.</p>
<p>Al-Mulk (067).001 Blessed be He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things hath Power;-</p>
<p>Al-Mu'minun(023).080 It is He Who gives life and death, and to Him (is due) the alternation of Night and Day: will ye not then understand?</p>
<p>Al-Mu'minun(023).084 Say: "To whom belong the earth and all beings therein? (say) if ye know!" Al-Mu'minun(023).085 They will say, "To God!" say: "Yet will ye not receive admonition?" Al-Mu'minun(023).086 Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Throne (of Glory) Supreme?" Al-Mu'minun(023).087 They will say, "(They belong) to God." Say: "Will ye not then be filled with awe?" Al-Mu'minun(023).088 Say: "Who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things,- who protects (all), but is not protected (of any)? (say) if ye know." Al-Mu'minun(023).089 They will say, "(It belongs) to God." Say: "Then how are ye deluded?" Al-Mu'minun(023).090 We have sent them the Truth: but they indeed practise falsehood!</p>
<p>Al-Ankabut(029).060 How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is God who feeds (both) them and you: for He hears and knows (all things).</p>
<p>Saba (034).036 Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Provision to whom He pleases, but most men understand not."</p>
<p>Ya-Seen (036).083 So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.</p>
<p>Az-Zariyat(051).058 For God is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for ever).</p>
<p><br />
