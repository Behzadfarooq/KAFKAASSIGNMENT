<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Al-Hakim Acknowledged traveling from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan, via Pakistan. He said that he left China in 1999, looking for work and that he was planning to work his way to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. In Pakistan he had applied for a visa to Iran. He heard about a small community of Uyghurs in Afghanistan, where he could receive military training, to use against the Chinese occupiers of Turkistan.</p>
<p>Al-Hakim said that the camp was in poor shape, and that the Uyghurs spent most of their time reconstructing the buildings. He acknowledged getting a couple of days training on the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>. (Some other Uyghurs said they received only a few hours.)</p>
<p>Al-Hakim said he was told the property was made available by "some big tribe". He said he had no idea if the property had anything to do with the Taliban. He said when he arrived no one spoke about the ETIM or any other organization. He said he was not invited to join any organizations.</p>
<p>Al-Hakim acknowledged fleeing the American bombs. But he said he had no ties whatsoever with anyone who had attacked the USA.</p>
<p>Al-Hakim acknowledged that 18 Uyghurs had fled the camp together, were captured together, and brought to Guantanamo together. However he said they weren't fighters.</p>
<p>In answer to questions from the Tribunal's officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al-Hakim repeated that he had no resentment or animosity against the United States. He hadn't attacked the United States, and he had no intention of doing so in the future.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim said he had never been a member of a political party or organization.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim found out about the camp from an Uyghur he met in Pakistan named Abdulla Salim. Salim said he could go to the camp, and he would let him know when his visa for Iran was ready.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim said he wanted to go to Turkey because the Chinese occupiers didn't treat their native Turkish people well. He said he had heard of a leather-work factory in Turkey that paid good wages to people from Turkestan who were skilled in leatherwork.</li>
<li>Al-Hakim said he had traveled to Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan on legitimate travel documents. He didn't need a visa to cross into Afghanistan.</li>

<p>Abdulhehim's witness was <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakker_Qassim_9111.html" title="Abu Bakker Qassim">Abu Bakr Qasim</a>. He testified he met Al-Hakim in a bazaar in Kyrgyzstan. He said they did the same kind of work, but that it was difficult for them to do business in Kyrgyzstan because the local police kept trying to squeeze them for bribes. He said that the police had killed some men who wouldn't pay a bribe. This was why they wanted to try to get to Turkey.</p>
<p>Qasim said they had left their passports in Pakistan because they didn't need them to cross the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, and the man helping them get their visas needed access to them to get the visas.</p>
<p>Qasim said that they were at the camp for about three months. That in addition to the construction work they had learned to read the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a>.</p>
<p>Qasim said that camp was run by a person named <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Haq_%28Uighur%29_8866.html" title="Abdul Haq (Uighur)">Abdul Hag</a>.</p>
