<p>Since 1) the dicdef would never be an article of its own, and the word can be satifactorily explained inline, 2) there only one other "Adelphia-thing", and 3) for better or worse, "Adelphia" by itself is now primarily associated with the company for the next half-century, I merged the splitout back and reduced disambig to the lightweight topline form. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 14:21, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Turns out there's an ultra-obscure other meaning, so needed <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelphia_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Adelphia (disambiguation)">Adelphia (disambiguation)</a> after all. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 14:27, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Considering that Adelphia will basically cease to exist (pending FCC approval) in about 3 months or so, I thought it was important to elaborate on this. The article's overall structure needs to be redone, big time, but I'm too tired to attempt it myself this early morning... <a href="../../../m/p/w/User%7EMPWard_2c1d.html" title="User:MPWard">MPWard</a> 05:18, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have changed a lot of the information within the article. Most of the information was out of date, such as a "proposed" aquisiton of Adelphia. I changed the article to reflect that the company no longer exists and that the aquisition has been completed. If you feel like anything needs to be changed or added, please do so. <a href="../../../a/j/w/User%7EAjwebb_7a85.html" title="User:Ajwebb">Ajwebb</a> 01:28, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel this article is very tainted with personal opinions regarding the culprits. The fact that they were found guilty is a shining example of corporate culpability, not federal impotance! There should, at least, be another view in addition to the one already present.</p>

<p><i>69.201.148.182</i> made massive changes to the Adelphia trial details, stuff that should have stayed IMO, including trial strategies. All this from an anonymous poster.

<hr />
<p>I need help</p>
<p>Do not know where to go.</p>
<p>Lawrence Friedman the Chief Administrator in Wash DC of the DOJ US Trustee has resigned for "personal reasons" and I cannot get anyone to be jurisprudent.</p>
<p>Stockholders are getting reamed "daily" in the US Bankruptcy Court</p>
<p>Especially in Wilmington DE.</p>
<p>The FBI tells me to go to the DOJ,, the DOJ sends me to the OGE,, the OGE sends me to the OIG,, the OIG sends me to the OPR and the OPR tells me to go to the FBI or the DOJ</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the case of eToys 01-706, KB Toys 04-10120, Kmart (closed) Stage Stores Inc. there is abundant bankruptcy Fraud out the Wazoo! The Wall Street Journal printed an article about it on July 25, 2005,,, then Peg Brickley of the Dow Jones Bankruptcy News hit the wires with the Chief Justice decision to sanction Traub Bonacquist &amp; Fox.</p>
<p>This has the hand of Mitt Romney (Gov of Mass.) as the chief of all the companies involved.</p>
<p>Shareholders, the public, Creditors etc are being slaughtered by the millions (billions) at a time.</p>
<pre>
the System will not give me time of day in blowing the whistle on these guys. I even worked with the WSJ not to make the story about Laser Haas v the Lawyers, knowing that in the end they would just divert the attention from them to me and escape the wrath of justice. 
</pre>
<p>That has failed as "the blind eyes of justice" has now adapted a whole new meaning in the Wilmington Delaware Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>My first issue on appeal is being heard by His Honor Jordon in Wilmington Delaware District Court on Monday Nov 14.... I removed the appeal to the District Court in hopes of escaping the power and corruption that is within the DE Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>This is a big story, right up your alley.</p>
<p>These are BAD Guys and we have smoking guns all over the place.</p>
<p>They have threatened my business and physical demise and they have made the life of a shareholder who has dared to agree with me (Robert Alber) a living hell.</p>
<p>The lead counsel for the Creditors Committee did place in, secretly a new CEO of the DEBTOR eToys, Barry Gold,,,,That counsel is Traub Bonacquist &amp; Fox,,,,</p>
<p>The Court found them guilty (in a minor fashion) and ordered Traub to pay $750,000.</p>
<p>They have acquired more than $200 million in their schemes in eToys, KB, Stage and Kmart.</p>
<p>The shareholders of all those entities are getting screwed and the US Trustee office is in on it.</p>
<p>Lawrence Friedman as Chief Administrator of the US Trustee has resigned from Wash DC RR Donnelley and Goldman Sachs divested themselves of each other to the tune of $350 million. Roberta DeAngelis was replaced as Trustee of Region 3. Frank Perch (asst US Trustee) has resigned.</p>
<p>Traub and Barry Gold worked for Stage Stores,,, Stage was owned by Mitt Romney and Bain,,, Bain owns KB,,, Traub has confessed that he paid Barry Gold 4 payments of $30,000 each after Stage but before eToys. Then Barry Gold was hired by eToys and Traub and Barry Gold then negotiated the sale of eToys to KB.</p>
<p>The list of offenses is well over 50.</p>
<p>The Chief Judge Mary Walrath has turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King stated an injustice against anyone is an attack on Justice everywhere.</p>
<p>Whether the Court likes my pathetic existence is not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is that Bankruptcy reform occurred this month to stop Fraud by the average guy.</p>
<p>If you are an above average guy, all you have to do is be friends of a Judge and you can get away with millions.</p>
<p>The law changed to stop the Fraud.</p>
<p>Or did it.</p>
<p>The law also included a "Repeal" of the need to disclose if you are an investment banker.</p>
<p>Bain is an investment Bank.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is an investment Bank.</p>
<p>They are happy.</p>
<p>The question is are YOU?</p>
<p>Sincerely; Laser Steven Haas</p>
