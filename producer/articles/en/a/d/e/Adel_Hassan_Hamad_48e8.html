<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<li><i>The detainee was employed by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Assembly_of_Muslim_Youth_b15e.html" title="World Assembly of Muslim Youth">World Assembly of Muslim Youth</a> (WAMY) in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> for approximately one and one half years until the time of his capture 18 July 2002.</i></li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/e/Adel_Hassan_Hamad_48e8.html" title="Edit section: Testimony">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Testimony</span></h3>
<p>Hamad denied being a member of al Qaida, and said that he disagreed with their views. In his opinion Islam forbids killing innocents. Hamad pointed out that if he was a member of al Qaida he never would have traveled to Sudan on his annual vacation in June 2002.</p>
<p>Hamad denied that WAMY supports al Qaida. He said his charity worked to help Afghan refugees, providing them with food, medicine, clothes and education, building charter schools, educational training, and also works in the health department by establishing hospitals, small clinics, and also digging water wells, building mosques.</p>
<p>Hamad confirmed that he worked for LDI for fourteen years. But he denied it had any ties to terrorism.</p>
<p>Hamad denied ever having any contact with any members of al Qaida.</p>
<p>Hamad went on to assure his Tribunal that he did not have any enmity towards the USA.</p>
<p>In answer to questions from his Tribunal's officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hamad said his last job for WAMY was hospital administration and the distribution of food, clothing and medicine to refugees.</li>
<li>Hamad said he had a diploma in air conditioning systems and a Master in Islamic studies.</li>
<li>Hamad said he left LDI in 1999 due to layoffs which had been triggered by policy changes due to the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>. LDI was a <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwaiti</a> charity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hamad concluded by telling his Tribunal that his interrogators had decided within his first month and a half of detention that he was innocent, and told him that he could expect to be released shortly.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards were not authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they were not authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>Instead, they were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<p>The factors for and against a detainee's continued detention were always separated out into categories. Most detainees’ transcripts preserved this breakdown. However the Recorder for Hamad's hearing did not preserve this breakdown in Hamad's transcript.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Although Hamad had explained to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal that his name was really Adel Hassan Hamad the officers on his Board kept calling him Hussein.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>The detainee related he joined the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Brotherhood_ed9f.html" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> in Sudan during the early 1980's <sup class="noprint">[</sup><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>].

The Hira Institute is run by an organization named <a href="../../../l/a/j/Lajnat_Al-Da%27wa_al_Islamia_0890.html" title="Lajnat Al-Da'wa al Islamia">Lajnat Al-Da'wa al Islamia</a> (LDI).</i></li>

<li><i>After the 9/11 attacks, and due to the war and increased violence in the area, the detainee was told by Afghan government officials to leave Afghanistan.</i></li>
<li><i>A 23 September 2001 copy of "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brotherhood_Letter_4375.html" title="The Brotherhood Letter">The Brotherhood Letter</a>" published by the Muslim Brotherhood Information Center was found during the capture raid in the detainee's home.</i></li>
<li><i>Several identification documents were seized from the detainee's home at the time of the raid and his arrest, including a <sup class="noprint">[</sup><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] U.N. refugee card for his downstairs neighbor.</li>
<li><i>The detainee initially claimed neither the Muslim Brotherhood newsletter nor copies of his neighbor's United Nations refugee cards reportedly found at his home were his.</i></li>
<li><i>The Muslim Brotherhood (MB) developed as a fundamentalist Islamic belief community in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

<li><i>Zahid Al-Sheikh has been identified from other sources as an extremist with terrorist ties.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee stated he was familiar with Shamshani Refugee Camp. He distributed food to the camp on two occasions. The detainee stated the camp was run by <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar_430b.html" title="Gulbuddin Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>.</i></li>
<li><i>Gulbuddin Hikmatyar (variant of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar) found <a href="../../../h/i/z/Hizb-I_Islami_Gulbuddin_8476.html" title="Hizb-I Islami Gulbuddin">Hizb-I Islami Gulbuddin</a> (HIG) as a faction of the <a href="../../../h/i/z/Hizb-I_Islami_2ecc.html" title="Hizb-I Islami">Hizb-I Islami</a> party in 1977, and it was one of the major mujahedin groups in the war against the Soviets. HIG has long established ties with Bin Laden.</i></li>
<li><i>In the early 1990s, Hikmatyar ran several terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and was a pioneer in sending mercenary fighters to other Islamic conflcts. Hikmatyar offered to shelter Bin Laden after the latter fled Sudan in 1996.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee took a vacation to Sudan in June 2002. Before he returned to the office, detainee called his supervisor to find out about the situation of NGOs in Peshawar, Pakistan after hearing about the arrests of the [[Revival of Islamic Heritage Society workers.

<li><i>The detainee stated <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Zawahiri_862a.html" title="Al-Zawahiri">Al-Zawahiri</a> and Usama Bin Laden were not Muslims and any acts their group perpetrated were against the Muslim faith.</i></li>
