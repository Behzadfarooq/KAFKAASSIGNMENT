<p>I recently viewed the series again and I have corrected some of the one-sided statements about Atia as well as expanding her personality and character history sections. The Atia article is terrible one-sided because they make her out to be a lot worse then what she really is in the story and the whole "fertility ritual" was completely false, the ritual with the bull was a normal sacrifice done by temples. Atia was merely taking part to ask the mother goddess if Octavian would be safe! Also, no one has mentioned Atia's clear affections for her son and daughter, so I added a small part to her personality. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamblunt100_8576.html" title="User:Camblunt100">Camblunt100</a> 17:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Daftman, I don't know who you think you are but you have butchered this article and edited so much of the good stuff that is of interest to fans!

<p>Well the article proposes facts about Atia's intentions which have not been verified, says she has done things that she clearly has not and the list goes on. 90% of this article needs to be scrapped and rewritten. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnoliasouth_3d28.html" title="User:Magnoliasouth">MagnoliaSouth</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagnoliasouth_5910.html" title="User talk:Magnoliasouth">Talk</a> 14:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If this article's as fabriated as you claim, how come no one else has said anything about it or made any similar complaint? I suspect the only one who feels this way is you, and an entire article cannot be changed to suit one person. And from the extent to which you believe Atia is misrepresented in this article, are you sure you saw this series at all? Perhaps you bought the wrong box set, or put on the wrong TV channel 80.41.22.159 12:46, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>are completely untrue. Atia never attacked (or "beat up"; what kind of wording is that anyway?) her daughter, nor did she flog her. She did threathen her with a whip but only threatened, or at the very most attempted to flog her. Atia never attacked Octavia with it at all. In fact, the whip never even touched her daughter. As for "beating up" Octavian, she slapped him which hardly qualifies as beating up anyone and besides, this is an article not a blog and "beating up" anyone is not good writing. I move that these be stricken from the article, or at least the article reworded so that it is actually correct. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnoliasouth_3d28.html" title="User:Magnoliasouth">MagnoliaSouth</a> 13:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Attention: when Octavian intervenes, Atia IS actually chasing AND striking Octavia with the whip (hence Octavia's screams!), which most of us would call "launching a violent assault". Yours is the false statement when you claim "the whip never even touched Octavia", which is ridiculously untrue. Might I suggest you saw a censored version of that episode if you don't recall any physical violence in that scene! As for the use of the phrase "beating up", it was the first phrase that came to mind and I didn't see a problem as I was sure others would come along eventually and reword it themselves without making an international crisis out of it.

<dd>First, please sign your comments as per Wiki protocol. Second, I own the DVD and the scene shows an <i>attempt</i> by Atia to hit Octavia, and is a lousy one at best. My conviction, and claim, stands. There is no "beating up" nor "launching a violent assault". <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnoliasouth_3d28.html" title="User:Magnoliasouth">MagnoliaSouth</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagnoliasouth_5910.html" title="User talk:Magnoliasouth">Talk</a> 15:56, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dictionary.com defines <b>launch</b> as "to burst out or plunge boldly or directly into action". What I saw was Atia violently attacking her daughter, hitting her with the whip and definitely making more than enough contact to warrant 'launching a violent assault'. The term "launches a violent assault" stands until I hear more than just your opinion on the matter, though to be honest I find this a rather bizarre/trivial debate to be having!

<p>A request for comment is being made due to the nature of the words in the attached article. It is believed that some sentences in the article are not factual, and some are of an opinion. Additionally, there is mention of specific episodes where the character performs actions and it is disputed on whether or not these actions did or did not occur. 15:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've not seen anybody judging Atia by today's standards in this article; but let's call a spade a spade. Her behaviour would define her as a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villainess.html" title="Villainess">villainess</a> and a <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitch.html" title="Bitch">bitch</a> quite frankly, even by Roman standards (murdering your daughter's husband was not the accepted norm, you know). This is not to say Atia is a detestable character, in fact I only watched the whole series mainly for her and her conflicts with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servilia_of_the_Junii_ef6d.html" title="Servilia of the Junii">Servilia of the Junii</a>, and she has to be my favourite character. But she's not <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Poppins_48ce.html" title="Mary Poppins">Mary Poppins</a>, and it would be silly to start trying to justify her actions, as she is fictional not a real person, so one can only take what you see and relate it factually in this article. If she behaves furiously then she should be described as "furious", if she's sexually voracious then she should be described as such, not "but that's not fair because Roman women were often promiscuous, so her behaviour is perfectly normal so stop victimising her!" Atia's reaction to the news of Caesar's death would be described as <i>devastation</i>, but her reaction to the news of her children's incest was hardly the same was it? She didn't attack Servilia when she told her about Caesar's death as she was "devastated". She attacked/threatened/whatever Octavia and Octavian because her most overpowering emotion at the time was rage/fury. Atia is villainous with a capital <i>V</i>, she's a bitch with a capital <i>B</i>, and I love her with a capital <i>F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S</i>! But it seems like no one can say a bad word against her without her 21st century PR people jumping on the defensive, practically threatening to sue for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>, lol! 80.43.4.50 16:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just reread the Atia article. It was way off on facts from the show in regards to Atia and Servilia rivalry. Also it went into far to much detail about Servilia. In fact most of the personality section was about Servilia and it was incorrect. Please remember the page is about the character Atia. There is a page about Servilia. Also in regards to actions taken with the children. Please be sure of facts in regards to this show before editing. I edited it to reflect the show's plots and characters more accurately. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmadscientist_2c50.html" title="User:Amadscientist">Amadscientist</a> 16:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>Since the bulk of this talk page is discussing the "poor state of the article" from months ago, I wanted to note for new editors that it's in pretty good shape now.

<p>What explanation can be given for the kissing of her daughter's neck and cheek so strangely in Season 2, Episode 8 aside from the implication of an incestual relationship? Can anyone propose how this is to be considered at this time?
