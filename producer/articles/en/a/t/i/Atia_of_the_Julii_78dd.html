<p>The HBO website provides the following character description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Niece of Caesar, Atia of the Julii is snobbish, willful, cunning, and sexually voracious. In a culture in which women lack formal power and men leave for years on military campaigns, the wives, daughters, and mothers have built powerful networks and alliances completely independent of the men's worlds. Atia is among the women who serve as the shadow rulers of Rome.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Portrayed as the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-heroine</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femme_fatale.html" title="Femme fatale">femme fatale</a> of the series, Atia is greedy and ambitious, and will do virtually anything to get what she wants. Seduction, humiliation and violence (including murder) are all tools acceptable to her; Atia's occasional hypocrisy is overshadowed by her general acceptance of her own fairly corrupt and unethical nature.</p>
<p>Fiercely protective of her family and their social status, Atia's motives usually involve advancement or self-preservation for the Julii. Her manipulations often extend to her own relatives; feeling that she knows best, Atia will not let even her children thwart her plans. Seeing a more advantageous match, Atia forcibly divorces her daughter Octavia from her first husband (and later has him eliminated).</p>
<p>Atia has a vicious rivalry with the mother of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_%28character_of_Rome%29_c825.html" title="Marcus Junius Brutus (character of Rome)">Brutus</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servilia_of_the_Junii_ef6d.html" title="Servilia of the Junii">Servilia of the Junii</a>, who is having an affair with Atia's uncle, Julius Caesar. Atia's machinations end the affair but incite Servilia to scheme against both Caesar and Atia for vengeance.</p>
<p>Atia occasionally shows moments of weakness and more sympathetic traits. Her romantic feelings for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Antony_%28character_of_Rome%29_72ee.html" title="Mark Antony (character of Rome)">Mark Antony</a> sometimes cloud her judgement and make her vulnerable to his whims, and as much as she seeks to control her children, she will humble herself if necessary to assure their love for her. When Atia's schemes or attempts at seduction fail, she is often unable to maintain her composure and shows genuine distress.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/i/Atia_of_the_Julii_78dd.html" title="Edit section: Season One">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season One</span></h3>
<p>Atia's first scene in the series sees her using her sexuality to bribe <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timon_%28character_of_Rome%29_1298.html" title="Timon (character of Rome)">Timon</a>, her freedman, into giving her a white horse he intended to sell at the market. Successful, she informs her twelve-year-old son Octavian that she intends him to take the horse to Gaul as a gift to their uncle Julius Caesar. When Octavian goes missing after being kidnapped by Gauls, Atia partakes in a special ritual in which a bull is sacrificed on a platform above her, drenching her in its sacred blood; she asks the gods to protect Octavian and see him safely to Caesar.</p>
<p>Taking her rivalry with Servilia to a new level in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ram_has_Touched_the_Wall_6860.html" title="The Ram has Touched the Wall">The Ram has Touched the Wall</a></i>, Atia pays to have graphic sexual depictions of Servilia and Caesar drawn on every street corner, humiliating Caesar's wife <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calpurnia_%28character_of_Rome%29_d263.html" title="Calpurnia (character of Rome)">Calpurnia</a>. This ends the affair, but causes Servilia to curse both Caesar and Atia.</p>
<p>In the episode <i><a href="../../../e/g/e/Egeria_%28Rome%29_516b.html" title="Egeria (Rome)">Egeria</a></i>, Atia is concerned about her son Octavian and his apparent lack of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virility.html" title="Virility">virility</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masculinity.html" title="Masculinity">masculinity</a>; she hires <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titus_Pullo_%28character_of_Rome%29_3217.html" title="Titus Pullo (character of Rome)">Titus Pullo</a> to train him as a fighter and to take him to a brothel for his first penetration. Upon Octavian putting on the <i><a href="../../../t/o/g/Toga_virilis.html" title="Toga virilis">toga virilis</a></i> and observing how his fighting skills have improved, Atia suggests that he join a military academy.</p>
<p>Though a widow, Atia is by no means resigned to celibacy and spinsterhood. She suggests to her lover Mark Antony that if they married, his social status would be elevated enough to seize control over Rome in Caesar's absence; however, Antony rejects her aggressively. Nonetheless, he later confides in Octavia that he finds himself wretched without Atia and they quickly make up their differences.</p>
<p>When Atia learns her daughter Octavia has seduced her brother Octavian into committing incest (under Servilia's influence) in <i><a href="../../../u/t/i/Utica_%28Rome%29_5763.html" title="Utica (Rome)">Utica</a></i>, Atia loses control and furiously confronts Octavia with a whip. When Octavian intervenes, snatching the whip from her and declaring, "I am your son, not your child. You will not strike me anymore!", Atia replies, <i>"Will I not?"</i> and strikes him to the floor with a blow to the face. Following this event, Octavia runs away and Octavian leaves to convince her to come back. Atia takes revenge on Servilia by having Timon and her slaves publicly humiliate her: they pull Servilia from her litter, strip and beat her in the forum and cut her hair.</p>
<p>When Caesar is assassinated by the Senate, Servilia invites Atia to her villa to tell her the news in person. Worried what Servilia may be planning, Atia insists her son accompany her. Atia is devastated by the news, and somewhat shaken by Servilia's vow to make Atia suffer, "Slowly and deeply, as you made me suffer." Octavian remains composed and calm, eyeing Servilia coldly.</p>
<p><a name="Season_Two" id="Season_Two"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/i/Atia_of_the_Julii_78dd.html" title="Edit section: Season Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season Two</span></h3>
<p>With Octavian's input, Mark Antony manages to broker a peace between Caesar's supporters and the conspirators, ensuring the safety of himself and Atia's family. Soon Antony is welcoming Caesar's former mistress <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleopatra_%28character_of_Rome%29_c9bd.html" title="Cleopatra (character of Rome)">Cleopatra</a>, Queen of Egypt, to Rome; he dismisses her request for public acknowledgement of Caesar's son <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarion_%28character_of_Rome%29_7c73.html" title="Caesarion (character of Rome)">Caesarion</a> with derision. He assures a jealous Atia that Cleopatra is unappealing. Later, at a party for the Egyptians, Atia plans to have guest Servilia kidnapped and murdered; Octavian and Antony put an end to the plot as Cleopatra arrives with fanfare. Atia is unimpressed with the Egyptian Queen, whom she feels is beneath her; as Cleopatra is leaving, Atia whispers in her ear, "Die screaming you pigspawn trollop."</p>
<p>When an attempt by Servilia to poison Atia fails, Atia has her rival kidnapped tortured horribly. Finally Timon, disgusted by Atia's cruely and overcome by an attack of conscience, sets Servilia free, throttles Atia and leaves her gasping for breath.</p>
<p>The growing rivalry between Mark Antony and Octavian puts them literally at war with each other; seeing the need for them to unite against the powerful armies of Brutus and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Cassius_Longinus_%28character_of_Rome%29_e3f6.html" title="Gaius Cassius Longinus (character of Rome)">Cassius</a>, Atia goes to Mark Antony in Cisalpine Gaul to secure an alliance.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Mask_%28Rome%29_298c.html" title="Death Mask (Rome)">Death Mask</a></i>, both Brutus and Cassius have been killed in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philippi_fb19.html" title="Battle of Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a>, and Atia has one final encounter with Servilia. Broken and alone, Servilia curses her rival before publicly killing herself; despite their animosity, Atia is clearly unnerved by Servilia's death. Soon, Atia suggests that the marriage between her and Mark Antony finally occur as a show of unity between Antony and Octavian. The men agree that such an arrangement is necessary, but to Atia's surprise it is her daughter Octavia who is betrothed to Antony. Understanding that Octavia's childbearing age makes her more suitable for the match, Atia goes along with the marriage — but is furious.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/A_Necessary_Fiction_768d.html" title="A Necessary Fiction">A Necessary Fiction</a></i>, Atia and Mark Antony have resumed their affair, and Octavian's darker side emerges further when discovers this betrayal (and that fact that Octavia is involved with his friend, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Agrippa_%28character_of_Rome%29_31f6.html" title="Marcus Agrippa (character of Rome)">Marcus Agrippa</a>). He commands Antony to leave Rome indefinitely, or be publicly shamed with Octavia's adultery, and sends Atia and Octavia into seclusion (under armed guard) at Atia's villa. Antony manages a goodbye at Atia's doorstep with guards keeping them from embracing, and promises that when the time is right he will send for her. This never happens, and these are the last words he ever says to her.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/t/i/Atia_Balba_Caesonia_c1fe.html" title="Atia Balba Caesonia">Atia Balba Caesonia</a> (born <a href="../../../8/5/_/85_BC_7d40.html" title="85 BC">85 BC</a>) was the second daughter of <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>'s elder sister <a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliae_Caesares_%28sisters_of_Julius_Caesar%29_8a2b.html" title="Juliae Caesares (sisters of Julius Caesar)">Julia</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Atius_Balbus_0ce6.html" title="Marcus Atius Balbus">Marcus Atius Balbus</a>, son of a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Senate_0c85.html" title="Roman Senate">Senator</a> from Aricia. Atia herself had two sisters, not mentioned in the series, and was a cousin to <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompey.html" title="Pompey">Pompey</a> through her father.</p>
<p>Atia's first husband was <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Octavius_ffa8.html" title="Gaius Octavius">Gaius Octavius</a>, a Senator of obscure provincial origins. By him she had a daughter, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octavia_Minor_5b2a.html" title="Octavia Minor">Octavia Minor</a> (Octavius already had a daughter, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octavia_Major_9500.html" title="Octavia Major">Octavia Major</a>, from a previous marriage), and a son, Gaius Octavius (<a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar_Augustus_565f.html" title="Caesar Augustus">Octavian</a>). After Octavius died in <a href="../../../5/9/_/59_BC_63d6.html" title="59 BC">59 BC</a>, Atia married another Senator, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucius_Marcius_Philippus_cc30.html" title="Lucius Marcius Philippus">Lucius Marcius Philippus</a>, who was a devoted step-father to her children. He would have been present throughout the period covered by <i>Rome</i>, however the character in the series is known to be unmarried.</p>
<p>Contrary to <i>Rome'</i>s representation, <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> describes Atia Balba Caesonia as a pious, devoted mother and an ideal Roman matron; little other detail is known of her. There is no historical evidence to suggest that she was romantically involved with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Antony_ea43.html" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> or in a contemptuous rivalry with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servilia_Caepionis_7277.html" title="Servilia Caepionis">Servilia Caepionis</a> (basis for the character Servilia of the Junii), as is dramatized in the series. It is not known what involvement she may have had in the political intrigues of Julius Caesar or Octavian, but she did fear for her son's safety and at some point urged him to renounce his rights as Caesar's heir.</p>
<p>Atia died in the year <a href="../../../4/3/_/43_BC_6916.html" title="43 BC">43 BC</a>, before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philippi_fb19.html" title="Battle of Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a> in which the legions of Antony and Octavian defeated <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_28b9.html" title="Marcus Junius Brutus">Brutus</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Cassius_Longinus_7a5a.html" title="Gaius Cassius Longinus">Cassius</a>. In the series, she outlives these events and even lives to see her son become the first Roman Emperor.</p>
