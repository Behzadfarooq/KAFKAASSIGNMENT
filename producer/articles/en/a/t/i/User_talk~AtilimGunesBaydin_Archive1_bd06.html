<p>I noticed you did a really great job on that article. However, it would be really good if the article also could include the events in the late 70's and early 80's.

<dd>Thank you for the answer. I am sorry for the mess I made while inserting the new photo - thought it would like better from the beginning. I dont have any special feelings for the photo - so feel free to replace it. And, compared to other Turkish university articles - for instance our main rivals at <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogazici_University_15d0.html" title="Bogazici University">Bogazici University</a> - the ODTÜ article is rather comprehensive.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">İlham Əliyev</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a message I try to send to every Turkish native speaker about a dispute I have on Wikipedia about the spelling of Azerbaijani proper names. In this dispute, some people find unbearable that the President of Azerbaijan is spelled "<a href="../../../i/l/h/%C4%B0lham_%C6%8Fliyev_5196.html" title="İlham Əliyev">İlham Əliyev</a>". Their argument is that "Ə" is not an English letter, so Azerbaijani language doesn't use the Latin alphabet and so the article can't be named with such a spelling. And they propose to rename this article into "Ilham Aliyev" (note they <b>don't</b> propose to rename it into "İlham Aliyev", nor into "İlham Äliyev").</p>
<p>I'm strongly against the move, because either it means every foreign names with diacritics or special letters must have a name with only the 26 letters of the English alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) and such articles as "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Bront%C3%AB_76d8.html" title="Charlotte Brontë">Charlotte Brontë</a>", "<a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek_fabe.html" title="Leoš Janáček">Leoš Janáček</a>", "<a href="../../../i/s/m/%C4%B0smet_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC_8bb6.html" title="İsmet İnönü">İsmet İnönü</a>" or "<a href="../../../d/e/r/Dervi%C5%9F_Ero%C4%9Flu_15e1.html" title="Derviş Eroğlu">Derviş Eroğlu</a>" must be renamed "Charlotte Bronte", "Leos Janacek", "Ismet Inonu" and "Dervis Eroglu", or even "Dervish Eroghlu"&#160;; or it means only Azerbaijani names are concerned and it is a move specifically against Azerbaijani names, because Azerbaijani doesn't use the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>If you have an opinion about it, you can vote and read the arguments on <a href="../../../i/l/h/Talk%7E%C4%B0lham_%C6%8Fliyev_1eaf.html#Survey_on_move" title="Talk:İlham Əliyev">Talk:İlham_Əliyev#Survey_on_move</a>.

<p>Hey, I have a question about the reversion you made on the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Language_cf7b.html" title="Turkish Language">Turkish Language</a> page. If the changes I made were irrelevant, I apologize, but, in regards to readability, I found it much easier to read when the text was <i>not</i> in the boxes. The italics and the colors make it kind of confusing...is there a preferred format to be used? I just wish there was a better way to box text withotu that particular drawback.--<a href="../../../e/v/k/User%7EEvKnight13_f34c.html" title="User:EvKnight13">Kızılderili</a> 00:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, AGB. I totally agree on the textbox thing. If we can find a better way, that'd be good. It's nice to meet you too. As you can tell from my userpage, I am <i>not</i> actually Turkish, but I have a bit of a complex. My singing teacher and good friend is (well, a Greek), but her husband is Turkish, and the family is Türkçe speaking. The mother and I are both from the south, and when I told her I was of Native American descent, she started to call me Kızılderili, which was quickly shortened to Kızıl canım. And so began my Turkish infatutation. lol.--<a href="../../../e/v/k/User%7EEvKnight13_f34c.html" title="User:EvKnight13">Kızılderili</a> 04:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, first all of thank you for your comments, i strongly agree with you in most places. Now, its 06:55 in Ankara, and i'm rather sleepy, but we can contact each other anytime you want. I'll try to write something now, maybe tomorrow i'll continue. Years ago (6 or 7) i interested in Turkish Language (linguistics and history) and i got some resources. Some of them are stored in my database. I've just searched the name Agop in my computer and found one of them. It is related with the 3. Language Conference "3. Dil Kurultayi" dated as 31.08.1936 (written in both Turkish and French). It was related with "sun language theory", and there are many Turkish contributors along with Agop Dilacar and also foreigners. Most of them are unfortunately unknown to our community. You're certainly right, what happened especially between 1923 to 1938? As far as i know Atatürk supported Turkish Language (also Sumerian, Hatti,...) and Turkish History (also Anatolian history, archeology, antropology) studies himself and contributed almost all of them. For this reason, Atatürk's own archive maybe the best place to be researched. However, along with Atatürk, we know that there are many other contributors, but the information about them is also missing. We can communicate each other to share information. I've a terrible habbit that i always try to save my documents. I'll find them alhough years have passed. By the way, we can also contact each other via e-mail. Sorry, i'm really very tired and very sleepy. I even do not know how reach my bed, cause i'm in my office at the Physics Department of Middle East Technical University. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">e104421</a> Good night or good morning&#160;:) Not: Neden Turkce yazmadigimi sorma.</p>

<p>Hi, and I hope I have used the suitable word in Turkish. Thank you for your message. The image you made was much neeeded. In the greek wikipedia we have translated most of the article on the Turkish language and I have done much work on it. So this was a good addition. One possible mistake <a href="../../../m/a/p/Image%7EMapOfTurkishSpeakers.png_dd12.html" title="Image:MapOfTurkishSpeakers.png">Image:MapOfTurkishSpeakers.png</a> is that at the legend you have listed Macedonia both at the countries with Turkish as official language and at 25,000-100,000 category. Generally, in the greek wikipedia we are trying to expand articles on languages spoken in Greece and so now the article on Turkish is probably one of the most detailed. Unfortunately, I do not speak the language (though my grandmother, a <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greeks_0fbb.html" title="Pontic Greeks">pontic greek</a> was a native level speaker and my mother still uses some words), but I have an academic linguistics backround which helps and I strongly believe that the multilingual past and present of the Balkans should be highlighted.</p>
<p>Your article on <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Language_Association_afd5.html" title="Turkish Language Association">Turkish Language Association</a> is highly informative too. Really, did you know that the adoption of latin alphabet in Turkey caused an effort by greek intellectuals afterwards to adopt the latin alphabet for greek language too?</p>

<dd>Hi, I passed the changes to the map you made to the greek wikipedia. In the USSR and the ex-USSR countries their was a powerful <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_shift.html" title="Language shift">language shift</a> to russian. For example, an important number of immigrants of greek origin came to Greece from ex-USSR after 1991 and claimed to speak greek, but, in fact, they can only understand and speak russian. So generally I am cautious with numbers of speakers from the ex-USSR. More generally, I believe the number of speakers given in wikipedia or elsewhere is more of a hint than the actual situation.</dd>

<dd>It is true that my grandmother came to Greece with the Lausanne population exchange. It was sad and difficult times for both sides of the Aegean, especially for ordinary people. And it is really even more sad that sometimes today people seem to forget the catastrophic effects of such controversies and are been carried away by nationalistic feelings. Unforunately, Wikipedia also becomes part of this kind of controversies, but it is nice to know that there are also people around, lots of them, who don't want to coordinate in this politics of hatred.

<dd>Hahaha, no problem. I found it somewhat amusing that there are websites dedicated to correcting Turkish grammar. Perhaps it's slang? I do know one slang prhase: <i>kuyruklu yalan</i> ("lie with a tail", right?). Anyways, in English you probably know there are similar cases. Many people get lazy and write "thru" instead of "through" because it's easier. To me it doesn't really matter that much, but because it's easy to write it becomes more widespread.

<dd>Ok, as u wish.. I was just trying to create a template to link all the Turkey articles together since we still dont have seperate templates for different subjects except politics and foreign relations (since yesterday).. I think that more templates are needed, so I thought that this was the best solution until a better review later.. I also think there shouldn't be other articles listed under see also, but I didn't have the time to design all the subtemplates that we need (arts in Turkey, religion in Turkey, demographics of tr, military of tr etc) in order for those other articles listed under see also to be removed, so I put them there as a temporary solution without removing other entries (i was aware of that, but i cannot do everything&#160;:))), at least this way it will be easier to keep track of articles until everything can be updated to a satisfactory status since they will be all interlinked.. The template looks to be in the middle, since most of the articles are gravely too short!!&#160;:)) u r right about other country articles that i mentioned, but dont forget that all those articles have many subtemplates that we dont have, so therefore they dont have the same problem of interlinking - we are still trying to get the basics sorted out&#160;:))) We still dont have articles <i>art in Turkey</i>, <i>religion in Turkey</i> etc.&#160;:)) What i did is not the ideal, i know, but I will try to keep on updating as we go along.. We should also try to get Wiki Project Turkey back on, nearly all Turkey related articles dont seem to be satisfactorily interlinked and therefore it is hard to work on improving them coz they are not organized under one heading.. cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 15:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Altaic</span></h2>
<p>Hi, You know my proposal "see Altaic controversy". Khoikhoi insisted on putting extra "disputed" notice which is misleading (what the is dispute is unclear in this way). I do not understand why he is so keen on this "disputed" warning, although in my version the controversy is also implied. Could you please also mention about this to him? I think he does not take my opinion seriously. Kind regards <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 17:51, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Promotional images</span></h2>
<p>No, not every single one. In going through the promotional images, I have found many that are reasonable uses of fair-use. However, both of the pictures you mention are of currently alive and active musical performers, correct? People could easily go to their shows and take pictures of them, or even write them (or their management) and ask for photos licensed under terms we can use. Therefore we shouldn't be using fair-use images of them.</p>
<p>I think you might be looking at this the wrong way. All contributions, be they text, images, sounds, or whatever, need to be freely-reproduceable for all purposes, <i>with a very few narrowly-defined exceptions</i>. That's the one of the main purposes of Wikipedia. I don't see why these images should be among the few exceptions to the general rule. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 22:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, to be fair, the tag <i>does</i> say it should only be used when "...a free image could not be created to replace it".
