<p>Hi about text additions and deletes, every time I comment with it; and I agree with the above remarks. Discussions can be held on the page's discussion page, and for example they are being held on the back of the article on Trouton-Rankine. Please don't copy non-relevant text from articles into other articles (but if it wasn't you, then just ignore this sentence). Oh and don't forget to sign your comments!&#160;:)) <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 22:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I know that they do not get signed unless I log in. Anyways, looks like we are disagreeing rather strongly on principle.</p>
<p>Please do not remove <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">speedy deletion</a> tags from articles. If you do not believe the article deserves to be deleted, then please replace the speedy deletion tag with {{subst:afd}}}, and you can make your case for keeping the article by following the instructions by clicking the "Show" button in the AFD box on your page.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I noticed that you removed some comments from an article talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Trouton-Rankine_experiment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36607112" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Trouton-Rankine_experiment&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36607112" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I assume it was an accident (it is a big no-no). I can also see, that you removed comments from your own talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ati3414&amp;diff=36472472&amp;oldid=35631127" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ati3414&amp;diff=36472472&amp;oldid=35631127" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. While being more of a gray area, it is generally frowned upon.</p>

<dd>Hi, I have moved the section in question to the talk page for discussion. To me, it appears to be original research - do you have a source for your calculations? <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 00:46, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ati. I apologize for the opacity of my argument, hopefully the examples that I have placed on the original page have satisfied you. The discussion appears to be getting a little bit lengthy on the "age" page and I would be happy to continue it here.Rickert 01:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

No, they haven't and your continuing deletion are bs. Try to understand the method first, without listening to the bs of the guy that has no clue.</p>

What do you mean by this. You said on my userpage "Don't mess with my article on Earth Age' If you don't understand it, talk to me, don't move it around and don't redirect it. Thank you.ati3414" What makes it your article??? Tell me what makes it your article. Wikipedia is a community, it is Wikipedia's article, not yours. Remember, you are a contributor to Wikipedia, you did not created it. You don't <b>own</b> the article, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that <b>ANYONE CAN EDIT</b>. AFDs are driven by concensus from Wikipedians. Does this means, any article you create, cannot be deleted, moved or redirected. So if I nominate another article you created for deletion, then I must ask you. This is ridiculous. We have a duplicate page here. Btw please post your comments on my <b>talk</b> page, not on my userpage.

<dd>Can you convince "VSmith" to leave it alone, now that we found a compromise? <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> 00:45, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't take this the wrong way, but I'm still not sure what the link actually adds to the article. Yes, it shows a simple calculation, but its usefulness in science has been brought into question. Perhaps you could think of a way to present your calculation as an educational tool, and a useful reference.</dd>
<dd>You could argue, perhaps, that a link to the calculation may help laymen appreciate the complexity of the actual calculations, as to many laymen, even your calculation is mindbogglingly complex. Of course, <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">VSmith</a> may argue in response that adding the calculation may give an unrealistic impression of the calculation that are actually used.</dd>
<dd>The second best advice I can give you, perhaps, assuming you have some control over the pdf you linked to, is to edit that document to carry a disclaimer, explaining that the calculation is based on some rather large assumptions, and should not be seen as definitive. Please look at your calculations are try to openly criticise it as much as possible. Candor. Once the link has been accepted (assuming it is) you should leave the document alone.</dd>
<dd>The best advice I can give you is to relax. Don't accuse other editors or policy of being 'the reason wiki is such a mess'. Don't suggest that what other editors say is 'bs'. We are all here to work together. You may find it easier to get people to see your point, when you are civil to them. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 01:03, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion,I already did that.Vsmith seems to take delight into removing my writeup, he even took vengeance on it when it was listed in the "External Links" (which, according to wiki should have been ok).

<p>Hi,<br />
Please stop reverting <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a>. Two people have decided that the external link doesn't belong on the article. I can imagine three reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The computational example is not very encyclopedic, partly because computational examples in general aren't encyclopedic unless they relate specifically to something in an article, and partly because of the assumptions that it makes.</li>
<li>It belongs in an article on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_decay.html" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> or <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Age of the Earth">age of the Earth</a>, not on half-life.</li>
<li>It's a PDF, which is deprecated according to <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_link_71bb.html#What_should_not_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External link">this policy</a>.</li>

<p>I see somebody has reverted your edit, which indeed misses the point. You have the MECHANISM for how the photon energy in a box shows up as an extra weight g* (E/c^2). But this extra weight is not at all "pseudo" weight. It's as real as any weight and it's due to the mass of the trapped photon(s) bouncing back and forth. Single free photons have no mass, but single trapped ones do, since they are forced into a 2-object system, which has a COM frame, which gives the photon energy an invariant mass.</p>
<p>You'll notice, BTW, that your explanation applies to any particle in a box, not just a photon. This is the mechanism by which all trapped particles show their mass or weight in a system. Note that for a relativistic massive particle, this mass is proportional to relativistic momentum γmv, which means that the "mass" or "weight" measured for it is not just the rest energy, but the total energy. So the kinetic energy of the particle gets "weighed" too, and shows up as mass of the box. Interesting stuff, yes? <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 00:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yes, it is intereting but misleading. I don't think the "extra weight" is anywhere close to g* (E/c^2) and I don't think the explanation based on E is correct. I think that the explanation based on p is the correct one. I also think my explanation is much cleaner.<a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> 05:13, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't. For the mass of the system is the same, even if the photon never hits the sides of the box. And even if you have no g-field. Systems of photons have mass, even with NO box. So do systems of decay particles from an event, a fact that high energy physicists use alll the time. I use the box in gravity field only as a teaching tool so you can "weigh" the mass of the energy inside (including heat, light, and kinetic energy of box particles). But the invariant mass of a system is there as the COM frame total energy, whether you actually "weigh" it or not. Or CAN weigh it or not. And yes, the extra is exactly what I said. Do the math and you'll see. Or I'll do it for you. I probably HAVE done it somewhere on some talk page. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 05:18, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For a citation for the fact that the 'relativistic mass of a photon' is not zero, see for instance:</p>
<p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/photon_mass.html" class="external free" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/photon_mass.html" rel="nofollow">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/photon_mass.html</a></p>
<p>Begin quote:</p>
<p>This question falls into two parts: Does the photon have mass, after all it has energy and energy is equivalent to mass?</p>
<p>This question comes up in the context of wondering whether photons are really "massless," since, after all, they have nonzero energy and energy is equivalent to mass according to Einstein's equation E=mc2. The problem is simply that people are using two different definitions of mass. The overwhelming consensus among physicists today is to say that photons are massless. However, it is possible to assign a "relativistic mass" to a photon which depends upon its wavelength. This is based upon an old usage of the word "mass" which, though not strictly wrong, is not used much today. See also the Faq article Does mass change with velocity?.</p>
<p>The old definition of mass, called "relativistic mass," assigns a mass to a particle proportional to its total energy E, and involved the speed of light, c, in the proportionality constant:</p>
<pre>
               m = E / c2.                                    (1) 
</pre>
<p>This definition gives every object a velocity-dependent mass. End quote</p>
<p>Therefore it is not incorrect to say that photons have relativistic mass. It would be incorrect to say that photons have invariant mass. The faq makes this quite clear.</p>
<p>I would add a textbook reference, but I don't have any textbooks so old that they actually use relativistic mass.</p>
<p>Due to NPOV, "relativistic mass" gets somewhat more play on wiki than it does in modern physics textbooks.</p>
<p>If you still disagree, cite some sources, per wiki:verifiability. I would strongly suggest citing your sources in the talk page before making any edits. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPervect_20ec.html" title="User:Pervect">Pervect</a> 18:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which are irrelevant because they all discuss photon rest mass, which we all agree is zero. The rest mass of kinetic energy is zero, too. So what? The doesn't mean internal kinetic energy doesn't contribute mass to objects at rest. Of course it does.

<dd>There is no such thing as rest/relativistic mass for the photon. There is no mention of "rest" mass in the Roderic Lakes paper. There is no mention of "rest" in the Proca equations dating back from 1937 that are the foundation of the experiments on photon mass. There is no mention of "rest vs relativistic" in modern textbooks.When we say that the photon mass is zero we mean that the ONLY mass of the photon we can talk about has been assigned to be zero by QED and has been confirmed to be nearly zero by experiment. The only thing under discussion is the "photon mass" which has a limit of 6*10^-17 meaning that it cannot be equal to E/c^2 which would put a limit of about 3eV on the ONLY photon mass that we can talk about.That is, one can never attribute E/c^2 to the photon mass. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> 23:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
