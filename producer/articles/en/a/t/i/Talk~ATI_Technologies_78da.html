<p>I think that ati should redirect here whenever you type ATI or ati. I assume that over 90% of people typing those keywords are looking for this article. I just changed the logotype by uploading ATI_Logo_0903.png If I should rather have deleted existing ATI logo.png and replaced it with the new image, say so (or just fix it). As it is, there are two ATi logo images on Wikipedia, one of which no longer matches the official one (and it had that ugly placement of (r) anyway). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 20:25, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's with the "NOTE: If you are planning on using or using linux (OS) Its not worth the hassel to get an ATI graphic card since there poor drivers arent real good. If you plan to use linux I would recommend an Nvidia Graphic card." at the end? I recommend we delete it, it seems just a teeny bit unprofessional. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasty_4107.html" title="User:Easty">Easty</a> 13:25, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am wondering if calling the Radeon Xpress 200 ATI's first chipset is really true. I seem to recall a few motherboards out there boasting ATI chipsets (such as the 320M for the regular Athlons and the 340M for Pentium 4's and more recently the 9100 IGP for the Pentium 4's) while I guess the 3x0 series might not qualify as chipsets in the truest sense of the word (as, I seem to recall the boards using southbridges from VIA or some other manufacturer) I'm pretty sure the 9100 series had southbridges manufactured by ATI, thus making it ATIs first true chipset. For now I'll just leave the article as-is because I may very well be wrong but someone who has more time on their hands may want to look into the issue a little more. - Kilroy1231 3.3.05</p>
<p>ATI used an ALI southbridge for the earliest chipsets, but that changed with the <a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/chipsets/display/ati-igp9100.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/chipsets/display/ati-igp9100.html" rel="nofollow">9100</a>. Since I wrote 30% of the present ATI page, excuse me if I have no hesitation in correcting this nonsense. Well spotted. Okay, I just split motherboards out to their own section. Its just a stub, but its a start. When I get the time /energy, I still want to fill back the current trends section to at least the Rage chips. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 20:36, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I've now changed the layout, to fit with the one used on the <a href="../../../n/v/i/Nvidia.html" title="Nvidia">nvidia</a> page. ATI and nVidia are really twin companies these days, doing the same sort of things, so I think it makes sense to sync the layout for consistency of look and feel. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 14:02, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just put in a vote for deletion for a new page on the 9250. Jeesh, here is the rule guys. We do a page for each NOTABLE series of cards. The same rule for both ATI and nVidia. Copying out benchmark scores and spec sheets on every part nVidia or ATI ever made, really is not what an encyclopedia is about. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 20:26, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does this page ignore ATI's past mistakes/failures/questionable actions yet it lists Nvidia's?</p>
<p>This article should be about ATI, why is every other sentence I see nVidia? Not just see nVidia - but I see over-blown publicity. This article seems a bit biased, is it really necessary to mention nVidia's name so much?</p>
<p>ATI also made a sound card called the Stereo F/X in 1992.</p>
<p>Well, how do you discuss ATI without reference to NVIDIA? Its like asking someone to write a history of AMD, without any mention of Intel. Thats an absurd point. Then you say its like a fan page? Well, on the one hand you say its all about NVIDIA, then in the next sentance you seem to be saying it goes on and on about ATI. A wholly inconsistent set of observations. ATI has been the world's largest discrete graphics card company for the last 2 years, the products must have been pretty wonderful in that period, to beat out a company as tough as NVIDIA. Are you going to argue the 9700 and 9800 were bad products? Because I think you'll get flamed like crazy if you edit the page to say that. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 14:19, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For me, 24.470 signing people is not "some", and many Linux/ATI users don't know about this petition, so that probably talking about 200.000 to 1.000.000 of users. Moreover, I have a Radeon 8500 mobility and Linux, and the fact is just in front of me for the last 2 years. Afterwhat went I see and read a petition like this, I think you are really nice with ATI ("ATI's inadequate drivers"&#160;: I understand that ATI did nothing, and that Linux programmer try to fix it with "inadequate" things.).</dd>
<dd>I leat this like this, and just put this discussion in the article discussion page. Yug
<dl>
<dd>I do not use the proprietary drivers (by principle), and my computer does not feel slow (I don't play 3D games), so "Linux + ATI = really slow computer" is not categorically true. I do think 25000 users qualify as "some", considering the many millions who are Linux users. Speculation on how many could potentially sign the petition are just that; speculation.

<p>It's not a matter of spelling anyway. It's a matter of typography, and a company doesn't decide the typography of it's name -- that's up to the printer, who follows a standard. In standard English typographies, "ATi" just isn't valid. Bryan Henderson 07:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know much about business or economics and the wiki article is not particularly clear. At one place it suggests it's a merger, at another place it suggests AMD is buying ATI. So is this a merger or is AMD buying ATI? According to the AMD page it's a merger but according to Yahoo <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060724/bs_nm/ati_dc_4" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060724/bs_nm/ati_dc_4" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> AMD is buying ATI. Also the Yahoo page states it's subject to ATI shareholder approval but doesn't mention AMD shareholder approval so again it makes me think AMD is buying ATI (although maybe they just didn't mention that shareholder approval was needed). <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree. <b>I'm the guy who wrote most of the ATI, NVIDIA, AMD, and other key IT pages</b>. Its just too much detail for a summary page. Sadly, we have someone called <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">User:MureninC</a> going round the IT section vandalising pages at the moment, and none of the editors seem willing to do anything about it. He routinely breaks guidelines, and does not adhere to / respect consensus. He just reverts when I try and fix things, and correct the factual errors he has inserted. HELP! I'll try deleting the incident (AGAIN) and see what happens. Its the duty of whoever reverts to post to the discussion page, if not, I'll have to take this up with a senior editor, with a view to having the <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">User:MureninC</a> account suspended. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 15:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Something that remains unresolved i.e. the WIKI is presently peddling information I know to be wrong on the <a href="../../../v/i/a/VIA_CoreFusion_e33d.html" title="VIA CoreFusion">VIA_CoreFusion</a> page. This guy is so clueless as to be positively dangerous. What gets me even more, is that having been proven to be wrong time after time on technical issues, he keeps coming back, challenging me to reply to him. I try top walk away, and he keeps posting, as if craving attention from me. MureninC why do you keep posting? What contribution to the MIT debate did your last post make? Answer - none at all. As usual, you're just trying to get attention. Either debate the facts, or go away. You slandered my work, then added factual errors not present in my text.

<p>In my opinion, ATI's neglect for the free software community is very relevant to the article, but the mentioned section does not convey that very well. I think the section should be rewritten to explain how ATI is said to neglect the free software community, and mentioning Stallman's incident as an indicator that a conflict exists. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 05:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even Stallman wouldn't think it was important if a cop hadn't shown up, but ATI had nothing to do with that. The people in charge of the event tried to throw him out and he wouldn't go so they called the cops. He's trying to spin it into a "corporate fatcats abuse their power to oppress the little guy" case when it's really just a matter of, he was making a nuisance of himself and wouldn't leave so they called the police.

<dd>I find the whole open driver cause to be controversial. On one hand it allows people to write free drivers. On the other hand, it exposes the IP of ATI. It is a great threat if say NVIDIA can gain advantage if that open code shows them things they didn't know. It also exposes some of how the hardware functions. That risks jobs. Not just evil greedy manager people jobs, but the jobs of the hundreds of engineers who toiled to produce that code. That is not a worthwhile risk IMO. ATI does do Linux drivers (Linux being where open code is most demanded), and they are getting better.</dd>
<dd>Which regards to this Stallman guy, some guy being a jackass at a conference is not worthy of its own paragraph. Sure, it could be referred to in the context of ATI's closed code practice. But right now it sticks out as if it's some huge issue and just casts this strange "ATI is evil" feeling over the whole article. And I don't think that such spotlight exposure is "relevant" or really proper for NPOV encyclopedic content.

<dd>The documentation that is required in order to write a fully functional driver DOES NOT reveal any details on how the hardware itself is designed, it only tells you how to communicate with the hardware effectively. Are jobs in the car manufacturing industry lost because of the repair manuals that show how to repair a car? ATI releasing programming documentation does not provide any advantage to NVIDIA — in fact, it'll only be disadvantageous to NVIDIA, because it would mean that ATI is going to be fully supported by every FOSS distribution out-of-the-box without any user configuration being necessary.

<p>Look, I know I created the AVIVO page, but stream processing is the AMD brand for AVIVO. Its the same thing. Programming shaders to do CPU like tasks. This is a summary page, if AMD are branding CPU like functions as 'stream processing' then AVIVO is no longer relevant. Its an expired marketing term. ON a summary page, I don't see space for an expired marketing term from the (old) ATI company. Its just not relevant any longer.

Quote: "<u>but stream processing is the AMD brand for AVIVO</u>"
</pre>
<p>NOT true. My two questions:<br />
1. Did somebody mentioned AVIVO supports "Hardware-Assisted" <b>MPEG2</b>, <b>H.264</b> and <b>VC-1</b> (WMVHD?) decoding?<br />
2. Did anybody mention the "stream processor" <i>does</i> the work as hardware assisted decoding of MPEG-2, H.264 and VC-1 videos? (Or should I say "<i>use</i>"?)</p>
<p>Or, you mean that "Stream processor" is a product for video decoding?</p>
<p>"Stream Processing" from "AMD" provides a "thin hardware interface" named as "Close To Metal", it allows programmers to write codes to use the instructions inside the GPU, and what does AVIVO has to do with THAT (other than decoding videos)!? (AVIVO though has a "converter"... A video converter)</p>
<p>It is known that AVIVO is an accelerator on video playback (yeah, the ATI saying), and "Stream processing" is simply using GPU to do (32-bit?) precision floating-point calculations, and I personally do not think they are the "same thing".</p>
<p>BTW, the AVIVO capabilities are provided using a external chip (named as "Theater"? I forgot), which I think "AMD Stream processor" do not need that in the FP calculations. And currently AVIVO is still being implemented on graphic cards that branded as "ATI", from X1900 series to X1300 series.</p>

<dd>The comment "<i>That is to say the computation complexity of GPUs has moved so far from the fixed functions of Direct-X 7 requirements, that actual code programming is now possible, for specific application scenarios.</i>" is awkward at best – while GPUs have indeed became more complex, they're nowhere near the flexibility of a CPU. And a chip does not have to be complex simply to do vector processing, they just need a larger number of dedicated pipelines. It's just the fact that vendors haven't officially exposed the vector processing capability to third party programs running on the CPU until now, AFAIK. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 16:06, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, by programming the shaders. There is no dedicated AVIVO hardware. That contribution in itself proves how little how know about graphics hardware. Anyone with such demonstrated ignorance, should NOT be editing IT pages. <b>Please only edit areas you know something about</b>. I see you’ve reverted the page, I'm going to have to stick another relevance tag on to trigger more discussion. I'm not here to be your personal IT tutor, I simply don’t have the time. AVIVO is software programming of shaders, stream processing is software programming of shaders. Its different names for the exact same thing. AMD have moved over to stream processing as their preferred terminology, AVIVO is a redundant marketing term, and not worthy of space on what is supposed to be a brief corporate overview of ATI’s key technologies.</p>

Decoding a video stream with a pure vector processor (such as the pixel shaders) implies that at least <i>some</i> of the processing has to be done on the host CPU due to the inflexibilities of vector processors, whereas a dedicated decoder could be designed not to. Furthermore, AVIVO and stream processing do not appear to be mentioned together anywhere, and AVIVO is never mentioned as an application of the exposed stream processing capabilities.

<p>I'll try and sort some links for you then. Again, you clearly expect me to be your personal tutor, and its just that I don't have the time for this, generally.

<dd>Well its true. You want me to be your personal tutor. I think this is where the WIKi 2 proposal comes from. You've just got too many people editing pages now, with no real grasp of the subject matter. I'm spending all my time bogged down in discussion on chat pages, and I'm not interested in that. If people won't allow me to write in areas where I have expertise, I really start to loose interest in the whole WIKI project. AVIVO deserves a page (I created it), and it deserves a mention, but going forward stream processing is the big thing. The main ATI page can only ever be a brief summary of the key moments in ATI's history. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 16:34, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, finally you provided some sources for your claims, thank you. However, note that the sources merely say that pixel shaders are utilized for decoding video, not that it's being done over the same stream processing infrastructure exposed to CPU for generic vector processing needs – I don't think it's fair to say that they are the "same thing" merely because they both utilize pixel shader pipelines.</dd>

<dd>As you decided to complain about people debating/doubting your edits, keep this in mind: If you had <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> on the article, your edits would be less likely to be contested if they are indeed correct. And note that you're supposed to cite sources <i>always and unconditionally</i> when writing articles, <i>not</i> just when people complain, as the quality of Wikipedia is based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> (yes, this same link is displayed in bold right below the edit box, however you appear to have never read what it's about). Due to the inherent nature of Wikipedia, people are <i>not</i> supposed to trust the "expertise" of editors, but the sources those editors cite. If you can't find a good source, leave a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} template and hope someone else finds one, and meanwhile readers will know to take the claims with a grain of salt. No wonder your articles are contested, as you do not comply with the policy at all. If your articles did cite sources, and someone made an edit that contradicts with your source, you would be welcome to politely revert the edit saying that it contradicts with the given source.</dd>

<dd>And you still can't stop the personal attacks, can you? Where did I imply I wanted a "personal tutor"? I clearly stated that I wanted <i>evidence</i> to support your claims.

<p>If I state something is the case, I assumed you as an intelligent person, using key word searches in Google, could verify for yourself, that what I said was factually correct. Clearly my basic assumption that you as a would be editor were capable of performing key word searches in Google, was flawed. I apologise for that. I should have recognised at an earlier point, you needed one-on-one tuition in the area of IT. Its just a question of time. I don't have the time to walk everyone though everything I've ever written for the WIKI line by line, reference by reference. As I said, AVIVO does deserve a reference, but fundamentally, its just software code on the shaders. If there is a error in something I've written fine, if you want to add references, fine, but I'm not wasting my time like this again. Before editing the WIKI, all editors really should make their own efforts to use Google, and get some of their basic facts straight. Thats only being reasonable, I think. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 19:20, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh Wise, Great And Intelligent Person, unfortunately I must inform you that Wikipedia has policies for a reason, and they are formed with a consensus between other Intelligent People like you. Minions like me have to stick with adhering to them, but if You disagree with them, You can stop editing Wikipedia and contest the policies on their respective talk pages: <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia_talk%7ECivility_b7b4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Civility">Wikipedia talk:Civility</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_44f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability">Wikipedia talk:Verifiability</a> — but more importantly — don't complain when running into problems that could have been avoided by following policies. When people request for citations, you're supposed to provide them per the policies. Citations are not <i>just for me</i>, but for anyone who wants to verify the claims presented in an article. The policies explain why this is necessary for assuring the factual accuracy of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No wonder you don't have time for talk pages, as you spend most of your time and energy on attacking people and not their arguments, facts or reasoning. I'm having a <i>very</i> hard time picking out what it is that you actually disagree with, so since I may not be able to address them adequately, you are actually making the situation worse for yourself (and especially so when people react to your personal attacks by taking offense).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but stream processing is an interface provided by the GPU vendor to utilize the vector processing capabilities of the GPU from the host CPU. So far your cited references have only established that AVIVO also utilizes the pixel shaders, and <i>not</i> that AVIVO also relies on the same stream processing interface between the GPU and CPU. There is nothing to stop the GPU from coordinating AVIVO playback by itself [whether using pixel shaders or not] instead of bothering the host CPU [while obviously CPU itself has to initiate the playback and feed the data]. One of your provided reference says: "<i>Avivo is a branding concept that encompasses the whole of the "video pipeline," from the capture stage using ATI's Theater products to the decoding, playback, and display output stages that happen on a GPU.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if it is true that AVIVO utilizes the CPU stream processing interface, your previous edits clearly state that "stream processing" and "AVIVO" <i>are the same thing</i>, which they are not — AVIVO would <i>run on top of</i> the stream processing interface, but in such a situation, one is not a substitute for the other, they refer to different things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Contrast this with your previous statements about the relation between AVIVO and stream processing:
<ul>
<li>The article used to say: "<i>The original launch of this technology was AVIVO, but stream processing has subsequently become the preferred brand under AMD's ownership</i>"</li>
<li>Your edit message: "<i>AVIVO is stream processing - same thing</i>"</li>
<li>Edit message: "<i>One last time - AVIVO is the pre-AMD brand name for stream processing</i>"</li>
<li>Another edit message: "<i>AVIVI is an obsolete marketing term from the old ATI - stream processing is new AMD name for same thing</i>"</li>
<li>You on this talk page: "<i>stream processing is the AMD brand for AVIVO</i>"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can you now see what I'm talking about? Or if I am incorrect, you could inform me <i>briefly, what</i> exactly is it that I am missing? I can promise we can end this argument quicker if you were even a little bit constructive. And you will definitely propose this again, so I will answer up in front: no, I do not want you to be a tutor, and I am not asking you to provide a long explanation. One sentence will do. I am uninterested in your opinions of how much I know about "IT" or what your estimation of my IQ is.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 21:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AVIVO is AMD/ATI's name for their "advanced" video-in-video-out (A-VIVO). It's a play off the VIVO of their older cards. Stream processing is a branded GPGPU functionality. It's like NV's CUDA in a way I believe. I see no evidence on AMDATI's site of AVIVO being abandoned. They will undoubtedly always have a term for their video support. We'll see soon enough if R600 get's AVIVO too. I can't believe this is so controversial. They've always had some sort of video terminology. Fullstream, Videoshader, etc. --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwaaye_95d7.html" title="User:Swaaye">Swaaye</a> 05:54, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing to clarify here, the stream processing is something away from <a href="../../../c/u/d/CUDA_a33b.html" title="CUDA">CUDA</a>, where CUDA is a programming language, and stream processing is an AMD-ATI (DAAMIT) brand to do calculations on the GPU, providing an so-called "thin hardware interface" as CTM as mentioned in the first reply of this discussion wrote <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.71.240.18.html" title="User:202.71.240.18">202.71.240.18</a>. CTM is capable of handling other stream processing languages such as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Lib_Sh_9336.html" title="Lib Sh">Sh</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/BrookGPU_a174.html" title="BrookGPU">brook</a>, with software support (currently PeakStream), programmers can use the stream processing languages to use resources of the GPU directly through Close to Metal (CTM) instead of going through the 3D API layer. The CTM is NOT a stream processing language as CUDA or Sh, but rather a way for faster stream processing. --AMD64 07:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>And so, somebody told me that AVIVO and stream processing are "codes". O RLY? I can devide the computer into two parts: "Software" and "Hardware" where "software" are purely made up of codes (Machine codes, programming codes), am I right? So I can reach a conclusion that even the "PureVideo" is the same as "CUDA" in some extent as they are all codes to utilize the GPU. Am I right? Sheesh.</s> (This is mere flamming, please ignore this paragraph, thank you) --AMD64 07:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and somebody tell me about the "Google" stuff, huh? "Factually correct", huh? Please do tell me about that! the "K10 is dead or delayed" article in TheInq, remember that!? Please do not tell me that the word "I Think" would be EQUAL TO that being "a fact"!! You do not even know the differences between "FACTs" and "SPECULATIONs". Okay here, let's just say you believe in wahtever theInq says about the IT, make that GOLD, and tell everybody that "you're stupid, please do a GOOGLE SEARCH before editing articles in wikipedia, especially MY articles!!". Then I have nothing to bother or ask you now and for ever. DAAMIT. --AMD64 07:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
