<p>Hi, i want to add the flag of Gokturks from the Turkish wiki but do not know how. Would you help adding the image? Cheers <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 17:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, There is an image in the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish people</a> article info-box shoving Fatih, Kanuni, Ataturk and Sezen Aksu. I propose instead of Sezen Aksu, it's better to insert an image of world-wide recognized Turkish musicians such as <a href="../../../p/e/k/Pekinel_sisters.html" title="Pekinel sisters">Pekinel sisters</a> or <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idil_Biret_7e7c.html" title="Idil Biret">Idil Biret</a> ,... I tried to change the picture but failed, you can see from the edit history. If you agree, lets do it. If you're any other proposals, you're welcome! <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 13:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was blocked cause of edit warring on Eurasian nomads related articles. Now, turning back to the info-box. Yes, i also support the idea of having more woman in the info-box. Lets choose the candidates. In my opinion, Pekinel sisters, Ayla Erduran, Gulsin Onay, Yasemin Dalkilic (world record-setting free-diver), Sevgi Soysal (writer), Muazzez Ilmiye Cig (sumerolog), Sabiha Gokcen would be suitable. In addition to these, i also support having Aziz Nesin's photo. Regards. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 12:20, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Lets make the total number of images in the info-box twelve. My list is as follows 1.<a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a> 2.<a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleiman_the_Magnificent_4f7d.html" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> 3.<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atat%C3%BCrk.html" title="Atatürk">Atatürk</a> 4.<a href="../../../o/k/t/Oktay_Sinanoglu_49e7.html" title="Oktay Sinanoglu">Oktay Sinanoglu</a> 5.<a href="../../../n/a/z/Naz%C4%B1m_Hikmet_f2cb.html" title="Nazım Hikmet">Nazım Hikmet</a> 6.<a href="../../../a/z/i/Aziz_Nesin_0bcd.html" title="Aziz Nesin">Aziz Nesin</a> 7.<a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabiha_G%C3%B6k%C3%A7en_3263.html" title="Sabiha Gökçen">Sabiha Gökçen</a> 8.<a href="../../../p/e/k/Pekinel_sisters.html" title="Pekinel sisters">Pekinel sisters</a> 9.<a href="../../../i/d/i/%C4%B0dil_Biret_71c1.html" title="İdil Biret">İdil Biret</a> 10.<a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahit_Arf_a011.html" title="Cahit Arf">Cahit Arf</a> 11.<a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasemin_Dalkilic_688c.html" title="Yasemin Dalkilic">Yasemin Dalkilic</a> 12.<a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebnem_Ferah_d41e.html" title="Sebnem Ferah">Sebnem Ferah</a>. I know the last two are very young but, i think, well-known. Otherwise, we could look for two Turkish woman from wiki-bio pages or reduce the number of images to ten. Actually, too many musicians are in the list. Any other proposals? Regards. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 13:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ermeni yanlisi, boluculer yada yunanlilarla diplomatik diyalogunuzu cok olgun bulmakla beraber, bu kahpelerin tutumlarini burada ne iyilik nede kotulukle notralize etmek mumkun degil.

<dd>Hey s'up. Wait a minute before you change the Statistics to Statistical! I am aware of the problem, and in English Statistical doesn't make sense. It should be statistics, it is the website of the DIE who cannot speak good english: Devlet Istatistik Enstitusu, not Devlet Istatiskel Enstititu&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 17:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we could find such statistics it would be nice. I suppose that the only solution that would remain otherwise is to stick to the actual version, and direct people to relevant articles for them to discover the debate on this issue. I understand the point of ethnicity figures not being included (you know why&#160;:)), but I suppose for religion I would have imagined that there would be at least some large-scale private surveys. I suppose the reasons are similar to one for ethnicities..

<p>No worries, I was not sure about adding the whole list, I might later add some of the important ones with explanations e.g Atatürk's Thought Club, Turkish Folklore Club (THBT), Robot Society, IEEE and ILKYAR society.

<dd>Really wanted to clean it up so that we wont even have editwars in the Turkey article! That was actually the case when I first came on Wiki. You are right about the Ataturk article, but I had thought that I would spend less time cleaning the Turkey article. I am sorry that it kinda forced up some work on the others! In any case that article is next up on the priority list. But the article is fairly good, and mostly need referencing work.

<dd>Yeah, ok, i have not understood the message above:). Perhaps the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also provides some relevant data. About Brazil, i will try to take a look myself, by combining excellent knowledge of Latin and negligible knowledge of Portuguese LOL. I think it is clear enough for the english speakers that the term "Turkish diaspora" would never refer to e.g. the Uzbeks. apropos, as far as i know, there are no <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">diaspora</a> articles referring to families of ethnic groups, so, i doubt that there would be any misunderstandings... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:07, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the 1991 census, the Turkish minority formed approximately the 50% of the Muslim minority in Thrace, plus about 2,000 in the Dodecanese. This would mean about 60-70,000 today (the sources in the respective articles' external links). but i've chosen not to add a fact tag in the 90,000 figure, nor to dispute that number, since, as a Greek myself, this would seem suspicious:) <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:28, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tried to find a number for the Turks in Brazil, but seems that i did not make it... The word "Turco" (Portuguese for "Turk") appears a lot on the net, but it mostly has to do with a town (or whatever) in Brazil and with the Arab immigrants who went there during the Ottoman times... I also used a brazilian governmental page in which i had seen the number of the Greeks and of their descendants in Brazil, but it seems to have been modified since the last time i visited it, and i cannot navigate there well (cause of lack of knowledge of the language). hope u will find info in Turkish sources.

<p>Hi Atilim, I just posted some edits to the 'Discovery' section of House of Virgin Mary. You have reversed some of my changes. Can we discuss this? Tencents 02:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC) (dualmonitors@gmail.com)</p>
<p>Nice improvements, I like the new photographs - wish I <i>could</i> see the red line you refer to (it's not there even in the high res image), and "restorated" should be "restored" or you could replace "restorated part" with "restoration". Tencents 14:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK Atilim, I'm done. You still need to correct the photo titles, including the first one, and in your Archaeology section, the restoration date is wrong. The building is recorded as still roofless in 1949. Orginal restoration was undertaken by Sr. Marie de Mandat-Grancey, head nurse of the French hospital at Izmir, during the 1890's. She actually bought the property and owned it until 1910. So the major restoration was done in or around 1950, when the Turkish government put in the access road and international pilgrimages really began. Two other small points, which I offer for your meditation: It's not really a restored chapel, it's a restored home that is now a shrine. The second is that the Romans and Orthodox don't really have an argument about the fact of the body of Mary being taken to Heaven. What they argue about - which is difficult to believe but it's true - is the actual mechanics of her assumption... whether the body was assumed WITH the soul or whether the lifeless (dormant) body was assumed and reunited with the soul in Heaven. So we all agree, She was taken up into Heaven, body and soul. So you could simply say: "... and lived there until she was taken up into Heaven."</p>
<p>Blessings upon you. Tencents 15:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Final point: When you search 'house of the virgin mary' (lower case) you get 'no page with that title exists'. Is it possible for you to fix that? It would be nice if other search queries could find the page too, like 'house of mary' etc. As to me doing those changes? OK. I'll <i>try</i> to get to it. You've been there? Wish I had! Tencents 15:56, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm amazed how on the ball you are with respect to the changes I make. You don't seem to miss a thing, which is impressive! 'Citation needed' (on the 1950 date)... it's on the way, but it will take a few days. (AND THANK YOU... for making the search work for lower case!) Tencents 01:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nice beginning, your article on the Church of Mary. Yes, I would like to work with you on that. Allow me introduce myself a bit: I'm looking for work at the moment so I've got some time to spare. When you are young, life is uphill... I'm on the downhill bit! Skills? English (highly literate), general history, Biblical history, research. With a project like this we can only do the best we can do, with the resources that we have. That first article (House of the Virgin Mary) is still far from perfect BUT between us we have managed, I think, to significantly improved it. And that IS an achievement. If we can do that for the Church of Mary, I will be very happy. What about yourself? Do you speak the language (Turkish), because I called Izmir yesterday (archdiocesan office 90+(0232)484.05.31) to find out what they had on Meryem Ana Evi, hoping that someone would speak English, but I was out of luck. Their records would be the definitive account, by the way, because it was the archbishop (from 1879-1909) Andrea Timoni, who supervised the rediscovery in 1891 and the validating research work, that became the basis for Rome's acceptance of the site. Do you work for Wikipedia, like are you paid for what you do? Tencents 14:51, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And how do you upload images?Tencents 15:09, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Waiting for your reply Tencents 18:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No problem. Hope you did well! 24.235.210.123 21:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your support of the need for the "Turkic alphabets" article. The present scholarship and findings of the last decades opened huge layers of the inscriptions, and supprted the analises made by Malov and Scherbak in the middle of the last century, that the alphabets used by Turkic peoples in different times were distinct alphabets used in different states in different combinations. The redirect and merge attempt amounted to deletion of the contents without proper public scrutiny. In the course of content dispute, I restored the article, and intend to add references to the various corpuses of inscriptions. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 07:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, I'm looking forward to your contributions. My <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Turkic_ee63.html" title="Proto-Turkic">Proto-Turkic</a> stub is still very shoddy, and you shouldn't rely on the phonological information too much (it's extremely contracted at best). I haven't been able to find a reasonable date estimate for Proto-Turkic (that is, the last common ancestor of the known Turkic languages, viz., Rona-Tas's "Proto-Turkic<sub>0</sub>"), but I suppose the mid 1st millennium BC will come close. For this reason, it would be extremely interesting to evaluate claims that the <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issyk_inscription.html" title="Issyk inscription">Issyk inscription</a> may be Turkic, since it would date close to Proto-Turkic, but so far I've found no reasonable proponents of the claim (just the "Turko-Sumerian in 4000 BC" crowd, which should of course be disregarded completely in sane linguistic debate).

<p>The free encyclopedia idea is good and I support it. There is obviously some substantial money behind Wikipedia and I would be vaguely interested to know 'who', and what their agenda is, but the chances of honest disclosure in that area would be very low. The original encyclopedists of the Enlightenment certainly had an agenda and encyclopedias are far too powerful in the shaping of culture to be ignored by the 'movers and shapers'... as it were. But that apart, I don't mind what their agenda is, so long as a window is left open to publish the truth.</p>
<p>You said that: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true." That's brilliant sophistry, Atilim, but it just doesn't happen to be valid. Once the correlation between "reliablility" and "truth" is lost - which is rapidly happening in many fields in our society - that rule would allow absolutely anything to published as 'fact', regardless of it's truthfulness, based on the brute power (I.e. 'credibility') of the published opinion, so that the Wiki would become nothing more than An Encyclopedia of Modern Superstitions - to which I am not much interested in contributing. No, the REAL threshold for inclusion is whether it is true, which one substantiates by attribution to credible sources. It is true, for example, that Mary lived in the house at Ephesus, which we can know from the mystical revelation, the attitude and approval of the Church and the scientific evidence of history, archaeology, social anthropology, etc.</p>
<p>I'm not personally too much interested in colating other people's opinions, like some Dickensian clerk. What I want to do, and what you probably want to do, which is part of our inate human creative impulse, is to shed a little light, bring what is true into focus, contribute some original thought to the store of human knowledge. Without that 'mission', the work - all our human work - would be clerical in the extreme and completely uninteresting.</p>
<p>The uphill downhill analogy is not 'ageist', it's one that models life quite well I think. It comes from my own experience in mountaineering. You struggle to the top, full of dreams and optimism. You reach the summit and savour the moment. It's a wonderful feeling... but then it's time to go down. It's not the climb, it's not the summit, or the view or the feeling that really makes life what it is. That's all the 'self willed' part, the boast, the independent man doing it his way and trying to make his ego's mark. But the downhill gives you time to reflect on what it's really all about and a chance to try to make some adjustments.</p>
<p>OK, on the Turkish phone call subject, I was not intending to use a phone call as a 'source'... give me credit!!! The point of that was that the Archdiocese would have the original historical records, which I would like to get hold of, but I don't speak Turkish. I was hoping that they could at least direct me to the best published English version of the facts, that was all.</p>
<p>On the Church of Mary, I'm checking our local university library for material. I'll see what I can find and get back to you with it. Sound good? And by the way, thanks for your very helpful explanations.</p>

<dd>By the way, I was just perusing the Turkish language article and I really think that it can make FA, also because it is not a controversial political article, but more a technical and academic one. I just ran into a good and serious survey published in Milliyet about the linguistic and ethnic repartition in Turkey (the first serious one since the 1965 census actually). I posted the link at Talk:Turkey, but there it is: <a href="http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/03/22/guncel/agun.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/03/22/guncel/agun.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I will use it to update the demographics section at <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and related articles over time, but we can also use it for Turkish language, and if we put some more pictures and copyedited the article many times the article can become FA. Maybe we can submit it to peer review soon.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 02:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're welcome! I agree with Baris BTW, Turkish language has FA potential. As for 'memleket'&#160;:-), I am from Izmir, but live in Istanbul. Cheers! --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 12:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
