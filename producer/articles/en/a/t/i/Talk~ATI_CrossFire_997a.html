	    <p>Honestly, I think this article's bias gets in the way with saying anything helpfull. A max res at FOOxBAR is worthless if the frequency is something ungodly low like 52hz. Who wants to see thier screen freaking flicker? I'm sure plenty monitors can't even display that low!! Something _usefull_ on the other hand, like say 70hz, or if you're talking about the kind of people who buy ati cards, something more indulgant like 90hrz would be _informative_. Lastly, the article mentions being able to dual screen as an advantage over SLI, but it fails to elaborate on that. Currently, I'm dual screening at a modest 2048x768@@70hrz... If the current physical limitations of crossfire apply to the total resolution, then there is no point in using two screens.</p>
<p>(now, if it feels like I'm biased, it so happens I'm using niether technology. My **##00 chipset ****** gpu with two heads will last me untill vga is obsolete, thankyou&#160;:D</p>

(ps, this is constructive criticism: I am not going to fallow up on any responces anyone has to this.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. They have failed to mention that for many people, 60Hz can be physically painful to use on CRTs. It also states that crossfire has wider compatibility, which I personally feel is an extremely bad lie - even now, users cannot customise crossfire profiles for the best performance, with driver updates (and faith) being required. How the writer managed to say that having your expensive master card slow itself down and disable pipes is cheaper than SLI is truly beyond me... This level of favouritism is offensive. I myself am not pro-nVidia; I believe that with the two companies in such a gridlock any amount of 'fanboyism' is a bad idea. I simply want the truth to be shown. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">AthlonBoy</a> 13:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both CrossFire and SLI appear to need a special motherboard. I can't find any explaination of why this is. It <i>could</i> be because you need to have two 16x PCIe lanes, but I don't think that's the case because I've heard of systems using two 8x instead. Even more confusing, why do you need a special mobo for the nVIDIA 7950, which only uses one slot?</p>
<p>Can someone explain this for me? Or better yet, put a good explaination in the article?</p>

<dd>Its less about hardware requirements and more about pushing their own brands. SLI requires an nForce SLI motherboard because the drivers only allow SLI to work on this motherboard. There have been other motherboards with a pair of 16x slots (mainly with one being the full 16x, the other being 4x) that have worked with two cards in SLI with driver hacks, including a dual Xeon motherboard on which SLI was first shown. Performance doesnt seem to be as great on these boards though, implying some special logic inside an nForce SLI board, and you'd be locking yourself in to a very old driver set.</dd>
<dd>ATi have opened up CrossFire to be used on Intel motherboards officialy, namely the 975X. It should be noted that neither the 975X or ATi's own Xpress 200 chipset have nothing special to enable CrossFire, which would theoretically mean that this CrossFire implementation doesnt need a special motherboard. The new Xpress 3200, however, has been advertised as having accelerated GPU-to-GPU logic inside its Northbridge, which the 975X and Xpress 200 dont have. (Cant remember where I read that, so I cant citate it.) This logic, along with full dual x16 lanes per slot, makes the 3200 a bit faster in 'masterless' CrossFire than other boards, and may be needed for the new R600 GPU to work in CrossFire (as there wont be any Master cards). Thats just speculation though.</dd>
<dd>As for the 7950, that uses two GPUs with SLI implemented internally. (The SLI article has a more in-depth explanation of this.) In theorey that means you dont need anything special on a motherboard to enable it, but some boards need a BIOS update to use one, as they werent designed with anything like this in mind. It has been certified and proven to work on a wide range of chipsets, be they nVidia, Intel, or even ATI. There havent been any reports of the GX2 not working on a specific chipset yet, so its assumed that with a BIOS update, any board will support it.</dd>
<dd>Hope that helped clear stuff up. I suppose some of that should go into the articles, but its hard for me to write that without it becoming NPOV. -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">AthlonBoy</a> 12:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What i'm trying to say is, there hasnt been a case I know of where a GX2 <b>doesn't</b> work. The page on the NVIDIA website shows you what nVidia have tried it with, and what BIOS revision. It doesnt mean that a board not on that list wont work, or an older BIOS version is problematic. Mainly its NVIDIA covering themselves. For example, the list has the A8N-SLI Deluxe, but not the normal A8N-SLI, and a GX2 works just fine on one of those. There is no technical reason why a 7950 wouldn't work in any standard motherboard, and NVIDIA aren't stopping you from using any motherboard.</dd>
<dd>Its similar in a way to the Athlon64 X2. This has widespread compatibility with every socket 939 chipset out there, including ones that came out in the year before it. But not the VIA K8T890; this one chipset won't accept an X2, despite being made months after it. NVIDIA are mainly shifting the blame away from themselves should another chipset have such a hitch. -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">AthlonBoy</a> 21:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know I have looked like a bit of a nazi for removing any entry saying Catalyst 6.7 allows X1900GT masterless crossfire, but now there's a source, it's all good. (The driver notes diddn't mention it, strangely, but whatever.) My beef is, I don't think that you can go masterless without losing a chunk of performance. Like <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/powercolorx1900gtcf/5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/powercolorx1900gtcf/5.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it's half as fast on that first graph, even with two x16 lanes! And instead of starting a revert war, I thought it best to bring it to the talk page.</p>

<dd>AthlonBoy, that anon IP was me, and you are very welcome, yes now there is proof, I knew I saw it somewhere the first time I modified this article, just couldn't find the proof at the time. But, about that link, the graph and actual FarCry data (bar graph) don't align in terms of scale. See the plotted graph starts with an initial FPS of 50, so going up by 10s, it seems that the speed is about 50% by looking purely at the difference between the plots, but looking at the bar graph directly under it, you'll see that the performance hit is more like 18% compared to Cabled CrossFire, but this is at high resolutions with a bunch of IQ settings on. So, its not THAT much of a performance loss, and will only noticeable in games that run below 60fps, due to the fact that the human eye can only see 60fps maximum anyways. Can't wait for R600 "interal" CrossFire details. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by WuZheng (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__WuZheng_bb01.html" title="Special:Contributions/ WuZheng">contribs</a>) 4:13, 19 Sept 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Ach, I diddn't see the different scales. My bad. Though the eye can see changes far faster than 60Hz, monitors rarely breach 85Hz. That said, it's a moot point what the eye can see, this is about performance, and switching to masterless crossfire loses you 20% in this case. Seems good enough for me then, i'll just put the number in. -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">Skorpus McGee</a> 17:42, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Honestly, I don't see the point in mentioning this as a disadvantage anymore as the older-generation technology is obsolete, those cards are extremely hard to find nowadays, and I have a hunch that ATI has discontinued the CrossFire editions. Its good information to know, but maybe we should put it in seperate "History" section and out of the Disadvantage, I feel that these sections (advantages/disadvantages) should be up to date with what is currently used/available as opposed to what is not being used/available, thoughts?--WuZheng 13:23, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It just struck me, in the advantages section masterless crossfire in the mid-range and below segment is listed. But SLI can do that too. While you lose performance from taking the SLI bridge out on a mid range card, masterless crossfire suffers in the same way, and you can't bridge them together there. There's also no good reason to not use an SLI bridge - the pins are there, SLI motherboards come with a bridge, so it only makes sense to take it off for testing purposes. In that regard, bridged SLI is more efficient than bridgeless SLI and masterless CrossFire of similar cards.</p>
<p>What does everyone else think? -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">Skorpus McGee</a> 13:27, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the argument is slightly out of context, ATI CrossFire solutions at the low-mid range can ONLY operate on PCI-express communication, whereas nVidia cards have an option, you can dig up some benchmarks, but you'll see that SLI'd 7600s vs. CF'd X1600s represents somewhat of a performance gap, but really this is due to architectural differences more than CF vs. SLI. In its own right, I'm sure that bridged SLI has more bandwidth available for Multi-GPU configurations, but at the same time no one has done an outright comparison (at least I think no one) between low-mid range CF and bridgeless SLI. Dig that up if you will, and if its significant in one way or the other, change this article accordingly. --WuZheng 16:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, even the most exhaustive google search turns up nothing but forum posts about bridgeless SLI announcements. I'd be willing to say that it makes no difference if we're talking about 7600s and X1600s, which was really the point of me bringing it up - if SLI can do it, why is it listed as an advantage for CrossFire? -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">Skorpus McGee</a> 19:29, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe it is an advantage in favour of ATI's technology because of the fact that CF'd low-mid range cards operate solely on it, in such a way that there is no alternative for these lines of graphics adapters and that they are advertised to be solely reliant on PCI-express communication. SLI is somewhat different in this sense, nVidia doesn't advertise that it's cards can do this and would probably rather have you use/buy a bridge than run it without. Therein lies some sort of advantage for PCI-express CrossFire. And, again if any of us happens to find significant information regarding performance comparisons between bridgeless SLI and low-midrange CF we will have to change the article accordingly, but we haven't so the advantage, for now, stays.--WuZheng 22:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Upon reading the existing Hexus review in the article, I see that at its best, dongleless CrossFire (Splinter Cell: CT test) yields almost negligible differences, and in ATI's traditional rendering weakpoint (OpenGL tests) we see that the CrossFire deficit is larger, which leads me to think that clearly ATI could have something here for them as what they are doing with PCI-e CrossFire is exemplifying what true multi-GPU setups should look like, plug it in and it works, no dongles, bridges, etc. The next step would most likely be multi-GPU with different brands of video cards, like Alienware's now defunct VideoArray project. I stand by my belief that dongleless CrossFire remain an advantage.--WuZheng 22:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, dongle is indeed the correct term. ATi themselves have stated this fact, though I can't remember where. -<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">Skorpus McGee</a> 10:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that Crossfire Physics should probably be mentioned somewhere in this article. -RK 216.9.142.155 18:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've seen neither head nor tail of Crossfire physics since it's original 'announcement'. There were plans for X1900-based physics, but they've evidently been canned. The same goes for the 8800, and nVidia even have three-GPU-supporting motherboards these days. Despite that, there is no official word that any kind of GPU physics exists. Don't get angry at me, I'm just as miffed as you are, but ATi made the original announcement, nVidia made a counter-announcement, and... nothing happened. Nowadays all either companies bother talking about are GPGPU functions. ATi brag about folding@home, nVidia about compiling C++. Not only that, but GPU physics on the whole seems to be veering away from the dedicated-GPU realm, and towards the shared-GPU realm, where the thread controller on the GPU manages physics and 3D rendering on the one GPU. It's quite certain that nVidia are going this way, and where one leads, the other seems to follow - that being the case it will end up having no ties to Crossfire at all.</dd>
<dd>'Course, none of this debate seems factual enough to go in the article.&#160;:( <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">Skorpus McGee</a> 21:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nvidia's plans for SLI physics were to be implemented at the driver level and only used 2 cards in SLI configuration, one for graphics and one for physics. The 8800 does include a physics solution called quantum physics that uses part of the GPU's stream processors for physics and does not require SLI. I think that is what you were talking about with the shared GPU, but this is only made practical by the flexibility of the stream processors. I think that CF physics should at least be mentioned, even if it is to state that the plans for x1900 based cards using it have been canceled. -RK 216.9.142.201 18:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
