<p>Atif’s kindergarten started in Model town Lahore at Kimberley Hall School. His first stage manifestation was in a fancy dress show at his school when he was in grade 1 where he performed as <a href="../../../i/m/r/Imran_Khan_09cf.html" title="Imran Khan">Imran Khan</a>, the former captain of Pakistan's national cricket team. Since then cricket was like a passion to him. He was never tired of playing cricket for hours in his car porch whether it is scorching sun outside or even raining. At that time he was not used to listen any kind of songs. At the age of 9 in 1991 he was shifted to Rawalpindi/Islamabad where he continued his studies in Saint Paul's School. He started playing Basketball and he use to lead his school team for various matches. Atif came back to Lahore in 1995 where he continued his studies in Divisional Public School Model Town. For his immense passion for cricket he was selected in his school team as a fast bowler. Atif cleared his 10th grade in 14 years of age with a distinctive edge that he has always been the youngest boy in the class because of his double promotions while he was in Kimberley Hall. Atif started his HSc in PAF College Lahore. He was in his college team as well where he presented his college in other cities. Beside his studies he was putting his maximum time in practicing for the professional cricket. During his college life he come across with some interest in music. He attended <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_Institute_of_Computer_Science_9806.html" title="Punjab Institute of Computer Science">Punjab Institute of Computer Science</a> (PICS) to do his Bachelors in Computer Science (BCS). Aslam's eldest brother owned a collection of more than 8,000 songs of almost all music genres, from which Atif absorbed a wide range of music at home. As a good learner he quickly grasped the control of voice, though at that time he was not interested in singing. Aslam's passion was still to enter the Pakistani cricket team as a fast bowler and he was right on track while practicing at the net at the Shapes Club Lahore where Imran Khan used to come and give tips to him for bowling.</p>

<p>The twist in the story comes when one day he was singing with his friends at the college canteen. His friends insisted him to participate in the singing on Independence Day celebrations at PAF College Lahore and Sargodha in 1998. He performed there and won the competition. After HSc, Atif Joined Punjab Institute of Computer Science Gulberg Campus. This time studies were much more demanding as compared to the previous ones. He was forced to sacrifice his time playing cricket in order to do well in school. However, his hobby of singing continued when he entered in the singing competition of his college, where there were a total of 8 participants. The media team entered Atif’s name in the competition at the eleventh hour and he won the competition singing a hit number of Pakistani band <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strings_%28band%29.html" title="Strings (band)">Strings</a>' <i>Duur</i>.</p>

<p>Aslam kept winning these competitions every semester until he announced that he would not participate in future competitions so that someone else could also win. He found Goher Mumtaz, a talented guitarist, at this time. Together, they started doing mini concerts for their friends. Atif used to primarily sing songs from <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junoon.html" title="Junoon">Junoon</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strings_%28band%29.html" title="Strings (band)">Strings</a> song at these concerts. The size of the audiences kept on increasing. They performed concerts for their college, McDonalds and some other restaurants as well. Atif recorded the legendary song <i>Aadat</i> at Mekal Hassan’s Studio. Mekal injected his professionalism in the song to make it worth listening time after time. Atif formed the band and named the band as <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal.html" title="Jal">Jal</a>, which means water, the essence of life. The song got popularity on the different musical websites on Pakistan. . The song was also played on such Pakistani <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio stations</a> as FM100 and FM105. The <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">music video</a> for <i>Aadat</i> was shot one day in a warehouse in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>. Soon it came out to be a super hit, topping the Pakistani music charts. On the base of this one song, “Jal” began their tour of Pakistan—such was the strength of “Aadat”. However, whilst on tour, personal problems led to a verbal bust-up resulting in an unannounced and indefinite hiatus, during which Atif launched his solo career.</p>

<p>Atif Aslam, after leaving <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal_%28band%29.html" title="Jal (band)">Jal</a>, released a new solo album, <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal_Pari_ce8d.html" title="Jal Pari">Jal Pari</a> (meaning "Mermaid") which was a big hit. Other than Aadat, 'Dil Harey', 'Woh Lamhey', 'Yakeen' became favourites of Pakistani music fans. Though his songs were liked by many, his first solo music video of 'Mahi ve' did not received much praise. On the other hand <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal_%28band%29.html" title="Jal (band)">Jal</a>, with their album "Aadat" and hit music video "Woh Lamhay" emerged as one of the top bands of Pakistan. As both the <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal_%28band%29.html" title="Jal (band)">Jal</a>, “Aadat”, and Atif’s album, <i>Jalpari</i>, shared certain tracks (such as “Aadat”, “Wo Lamhey”, “Dil Harey”) an unofficial war over rights began which resulted in both sides claiming to possess hard proof to support their respective claims (that, they alone owned the concerned songs). The hype this feud gave to both Atif and the new <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jal_%28band%29.html" title="Jal (band)">Jal</a> was extraordinary and split the musical nation with the fans of each side backing their respective favourite.</p>

<p>Whilst the drama of lyrics &amp; composition ownership continued in Pakistan, <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> director <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahesh_Bhatt_d4f4.html" title="Mahesh Bhatt">Mahesh Bhatt</a> called Atif Aslam to seek his consent to include "Woh Lamhey" in the soundtrack of his new motion picture, <a href="../../../z/e/h/Zeher.html" title="Zeher">Zeher</a> (2005). The song (especially the remix version) became a hit &amp; dominated airplay on almost all major FM stations throughout <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> for a period of 6-8 months.

<p>He recorded a song for the movie <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalyug.html" title="Kalyug">Kalyug</a> (2005), entitled <i>Juda Hokey Bhi</i> - a slight variation of the ever famous <i>Aadat</i> song. Like with “Wo Lamhey / Bheegi Yaadein”, a slow version became the theme for the movie and part of the official soundtrack, whilst a remixed version was released to hit the radio stations and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desi.html" title="Desi">desi</a> clubs worldwide.</p>
<p>After recording for <i>Kalyug</i>, an <a href="../../../i/r/a/Irani.html" title="Irani">Irani</a> director in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> contacted Atif and within very little time, Atif recorded three songs for that same director’s Hollywood movie, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_Push_Cart_4403.html" title="Man Push Cart">Man Push Cart</a> and was rewarded with a small cameo role in the movie.</p>

<p>In December 2006, Atif Aslam released his much anticipated album called "Doorie" along with the video of the title song "Doorie" in India and Pakistan. Some of the songs in the album include "Hum kis galli", "Maula", "O re piya". The album was produced in collaboration with Indian lyricists and composers. A month later the video of "Hum kis galli" was released. Like the video of "Doorie", it was shot in India. The album is a huge hit in both countries, especially India.</p>

<p>The Bollywood style of music and videos in "Doorie" has diappointed many of Atif's fans in Pakistan who had been liking Atif for his "Jal Pari" style songs. About this Atif said "Touring internationally made me think that I should take my music global by releasing it worldwide. I collaborated with a lot of people and thought up a plan for a commercial album, which is not my type of music; which is not ATIF. I just wanted to explore that side of the music. When I composed and wrote these songs for Doorie, I kept in mind that this album has to be commercial". He also told that he would soon be releasing an album named "Hangami Halaat" which would be an original 'atif style' album. Regarding his videos he says "I think that was a requirement because the Indian audience can never accept my 'stupid' 'Mahi Vey' video or my 'stupid' 'Rangoun Mein' video. They have a different concept about a pop or a rock icon. He has to be a heart throb. Girls here can't sit on motor bikes, in India girls ride them. It's a different culture altogether. They (my Indian videos) are for an international audience."<a href="http://www.pakstop.com/pmforums/showthread.php?t=42419" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pakstop.com/pmforums/showthread.php?t=42419" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Controversies began surrounding Atif from the beginning of his solo career. Many of Atif's critics accused him of stealing songs from former band mate Gohar Mumtaz. Both Atif and Gohar laid claim on songs like "Aadat", "Dil Harey", "Woh Lamhey" and "Zindagi". Still no one knows whose creations actually these songs are.</p>
