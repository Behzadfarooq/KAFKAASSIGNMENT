<dd>Glad you found a good image. Another quick way to find images is to click on the German wikipedia link. (if the article has a german version) The German wikipedia doesn't allow fair use images.

<p>Hi Atavi! I undid your edit on the RogerWilco page regarding the name apparently being based on the Roger Wilco (Space Quest) game. Please don't take offense, but I couldn't find anything to support that theory. It seems much more likely that the name of VoIP "radio" software (as characterized by the program's use of old fashioned radios) is simply based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure" rel="nofollow">radio voice procedure</a>. As far as I can see, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wilco_%28Space_Quest%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wilco_%28Space_Quest%29" rel="nofollow">Roger Wilco (Space Quest)</a> did not feature any voice communication features, and the article suggests that the name of the game itself is also based off the radio voice protocol.</p>
<p>If you have some reputable sources indicating that the RogerWilco VoIP app is indeed named after the above mentioned game, then please readd the link with a citation to the source. Thanks! --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBattlehamster_20ee.html" title="User:Battlehamster">Battlehamster</a> 19:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Battlehamster. No offence taken. I looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure" rel="nofollow">radio voice procedure</a> link, and I must admit that you must be right. In all probability the program name is based on the radio voice protocol (as is the name of the game). I am only embarassed that I had no idea (about wilco being part of the protocol), and that's the reason I immediately made the connection to the only familiar thing.&#160;:)</dd>

<p>As a side note, one can say that the Nicaraguans were completely justified in throwing the Somoza regime out of office for their years of brutality and authoritarianism while at the same time criticize the FSLN leadership for being puppets of Moscow. The two are not mutually exclusive. Far too often revolutionary movements have been hijacked by individuals whose only aim was power, not the betterment of the people.</p>

<dd>As far as brutality and authoritarianism goes, I am not convinced. As far as I know brutality was Contras territory. I am sure that in an armed conflict, both sides must have committed acts of brutality, but to blame the Santinistas for systemic power thirst goes too far. Now, for authoritarianism, I can't have an informed opinion.</dd>

<p>"Atavi", It is nice to see that you are "not convinced" of the Sandinista's brutality. But the thousands of victims that suffered the brunt of Sandinista brutality cannot afford the luxury you have. You do not care that even the leftist and anti-American Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Commission have documented Sandinsita atrocities. The Nicaraguan Commission of Jurists states that the Sandinistas carried out over 8,000 executions within the first three years of the revolution. The Sandinista prison "Las Tejas" was the site of beatings, sleep deprivation, and torture with electric shocks on political prisoners. The Sandinitas imprisoned and killed over 15,000 Miskito Indians through the forced relocation of these indigenous people. By contrast, the Somoza regime never interfered with and even ignored the Miskito Indians. During the Somoza years, Nicaraguan emigration was a trickle comparable to other Latin American nations. Once the Sandinistas seized power, Nicaraguan emigration was a flood of panicked humanity fleeing the new "marxist utopia". Thousands of Nicaraguans that dared to defend their private property from Sandinita thieves were imprisoned, tortured and executed by these totalitarian marxist criminals. Whereas the respect for private property was a core feature of the Somoza years. Sandinista street terror-gangs called "turbas divinas" would beat and maim Nicaraguan protesters, dissenters, and anyone deemed a "threat" by the communist commisars. Sandinista CDS (Comite de Defensa Sandinista) units would serve as neighborhood block spy cells to monitor and report people's movements, speech, associations, or anything suspicious to the Sandinista communist masters. Whereas as under Somoza there was no equivalent to these totalitarian trappings. Under Somoza there was freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to travel, and freedom of religion; as the Sandinistas would never have seized power were it not for their skillful exploitation of these freedoms. During the Somoza years many newspapers and journalists were staunchly anti-Somoza, such as the martyred journalist Pedro Chamorro. The number of free independent newspapers and/or journalists during the Sandinista dictatorship is zero. You deny that the Sandinistas had a "systemic thirst for power". While the average Nicaraguan lived in squalor, Sandinista commandantes pilfered millions into their foreign bank accounts and lived like the marxist millionaires they were. While the children of average Nicaraguans--any boy capable of holding a rifle--were robbed of their innocence through the forced conscription into the Sandinista Army, the children of Sandinista commisars were exempt from conscription and enjoyed a luxurious pampered childhood. The Sandinistas imposed a rigid class system where these rich Sandinista kingpins were the "nomenklatura" privileged class lording it over their captive masses. This is the Sandinista's idea of "equality". While communist guerrilla war-mongers--like the Sandinistas--are sanitized and lionized by leftists everywhere, anti-communist guerrillas need to be demonized and discredited by agitprop about "brutality" and "war crimes" etc. Simply put, whenever the rebel forces are marxist-leninist then leftists ignore brutality, atrocities and war crimes. But when the rebel forces are anti-communist or pro-american (like the Contras) then leftists open the gates of propaganda about "savage brutality and war crimes etc." The only reason the Nicaraguan elections were finally held in 1990 was because the Contra rebels had the Sandinista communists hammered and frustrated. The net result of Contra guerrilla warfare is free and fair elections. The net result of Sandinista guerrilla warfare is reducing Nicaragua to a marxist gulag and more than 10 years of totalitarian brutality, plundering, and misery. You will never admit the truth about the Sandinista communist monsters you defend, but the KGB itself was much more honest about the FSLN's function. KGB files recently revealed by Vasili Mitrokhin state that the Soviet's orientation for the FSLN (Sandinistas) was as a "sabotage-terrorism group" True to their genesis, sabotaging and terrorizing the Nicaraguan people is what the Sandinistas do best.

<dd>Now then. I won't claim to know all the facts about Nicaragua, but I do wonder whence you get your facts. Secondly, why do I warrant a long paragraph about the Sandinistas? As far as I can remember, I haven't made any controversial edits. This discussion started because in the talk page and in the article itself I doubted the authority of Mitrokhin's testimony, but this is the most substantial contribution I remember to have made regarding the Sandinistas. About the Contras, I've added reliable references about CIA drug money -declassified US documents- and not much else. Why am I so important then, so as to write this long paragraph?</dd>
<dd>If all you say about the Sandinistas is true, then you have a point. But you seem to make a saint out of Somoza as well.</dd>
<dd>Are you from Nicaragua I wonder? Because you seem to know a lot and be completely convinced about it, indicating that you have first hand experience.</dd>

<dd>Yes, images from news sources, and especially from news agencies such as Reuters and AP, are almost never fair use: they fail the "effect on the potential market" test. Since the news agencies are in the business of selling these images, if Wikipedia distributes the images for free, we're reducing the market for those images. Further, news images used in articles of current events also fail the "nature of the use" test: articles on current events are very similar to news reports, so Wikipedia's use would not be considered a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformative_use.html" title="Transformative use">transformative use</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 17:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for your addition, but sorry, I'm going to revert it. Point is, the inscription on the coin is just Standard <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>, i.e. basically <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attic.html" title="Attic">Attic</a> (the form "βασιλέως" occurs only in the Attic dialect and no other form of Greek). The local speech of the population, whether it was Greek or not, would have been different in any case. That the ruling elites of Macedon were using Attic/Koine for official purposes is not in doubt, but that has very little relevance for the question of the ethnicity and linguistic identity of the population at large. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I understand and concur with your point, I don't understand why the image has to be removed. In the article ruling class is also discussed.-<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtavi_ce6f.html" title="User:Atavi">Atavi</a> 09:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Want to re-introduce it with a clearer caption? Perhaps something like "Coin of Philip V, inscribed 'ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΦΙΛΙΠΠΟΥ', illustrating the official use of <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a> in Macedon".

<p>hi -- good to know someone is out there working on iran-contra.</p>
<p>i deleted the unsourced statements because 1) they had been up for a month without any backing, 2) they contradict the topic of the subsection, which is "contra drug links." if the heading were something else, then fine 3) the statements are self-contradictory. for instance, if the Hitz report <i>confirmed</i> contra drug links, in what way is it a whitewash? and 4) statements like "most of the Iran Contra scandal personalities were pardoned by President Reagan[citation needed] and then resurrected by the George W Bush administration" are plainly made up. according to the rest of the article, it was Bush who pardoned Cap Weinberger, not Reagan. and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Negroponte_0561.html" title="John Negroponte">John Negroponte</a> is the only figure of significance serving in the current administration. and 6) POV is obvious in "whitewash" "problematic" and "ill-fated endeavor"</p>
<p>now, the other parts of that section i thought were fine. but the last paragraph just doesn't seem salvagable.</p>
<p>i sympathize with your effort to be patient and neutral towards yr fellow users, but we are all the authors of this piece, n'est-ce pas? and when i author things, i have sources up front. don't we all? Davidstaniunas 18:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi!</dd>
<dd>In the end I agree with you.</dd>
<dd>POV is a serious problem in the paragraph.</dd>
<dd>When anyone writes something, he or she is expected to be able to back it up immediately with sources.</dd>
<dd>As you say, I was trying to be patient.</dd>
<dd>I think the paragraph can be deleted, but there are two facts mentioned there that can be salvaged; the pardon by Bush -and not Reagan as you point out- that is sourced; the death of Webb. I am not a coroner, but when anyone hears of two gunshots to the head, they have to wonder how a person was able to shoot oneself twice in such a vital spot.</dd>
<dd>I'm glad too that you're there working to make the article better.</dd>

<dd>Aye, I've been back to Iran-Contra once or twice since September and noted the changes. Seems like little apart from your edits to drug links has happened. Lot of heat in the talk page; no light. I really think there needs to be a better skeleton, moving chronologically as events happened, not as we discovered events. So that instead of every I-C revelation being written as, "On X date in 1992, so-and-so testified that this happened in 1985," we can write "In 1985, this happened" and just source it.</dd>
<dd>I think the best possible outcome for I-C is for it to be an accounting of events, strictly Iran-Contra events, and for things like "fallout," "questions," "current members of the administration" to just be linked to on separate pages. To my mind, something like drug links should have its own page (wait, it does doesn't it) and should just be linked to under "See Also."</dd>
<dd>I've been looking at the Walsh report, trying to put together a timeline.</dd>

<p>Hi Atavi</p>
<p>I think I'm posting in the right place to send you a message - I'm a new user, so many apologies if I'm in the wrong place (and feel free to delete if I am).</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks for picking up on my edit - yes it is pretty interpretive: I hadn't noticed because I was aiming at undoing the presentation of the opposing view as unquestioned fact.</p>
<p>I'm worried though that you will think I'm either an Alma-fan or simply a feminist, with no musical/biographical interest in Mahler - and that I'm posting with removing misogynist views as my only agenda. Actually I have no interest in Alma - I'm writing my Musicology PhD on Gustav. I just believe that the traditional musicological attitude towards Alma actually gets in the way of any kind of sensible understanding of Gustav's life - and music. I think the accusation that Alma's behaviour is meddling and petty either needs to be seen as a historical phenomenon itself --- and needs contextualizing, or should be felt to be too messy an issue to handle in a short biography of Gustav.</p>
<p>So I've gone back and suggested losing the description "petty" altogether - as I think it's probably simplest. What do you think?</p>

You'll find that a lot of useful material was removed (vandalized) by TDC and his Admin pal, MONGO.

Why he's still allowed to edit at all is beyond me. Thanks for your help.</p>
