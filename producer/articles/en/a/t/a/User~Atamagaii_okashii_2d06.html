<ul>
<li>contains quotes from Dr Charnzia Blasega</li>
</ul>
<p>"Most young children today only hear about the "regular" styles of music. Scales, intervals and notes dominate these rigorous structures. But I, Dr. Charnzia Blasega, believe that this is restricting young childrens' ability to grow and mature as musicians. By bringing this book to classrooms, I hope to provide a broader understanding of the whole world of music - because the small selection students are given today is just not the whole picture."-Dr. Charnzia Blasega</p>
<p>Dr. Charnzia Blasega was born in North-West Reblofistakstan and was orphaned at a young age. She then migrated by camel to the Isle of Zlatzikistan at the age of 15, where she was found by compassionate island natives who took her in as their own. This is where she developed her love of raw, alternate styles of music. She was exposed to many different tribal music styles and, of course, the very famous Beroplipofraksony-Zlatzikistanian tango. In her adulthood, Charnzia began to explore her heritage and returned to Reblofistakstan to study the Reblofistakstanian march slav. Once she understood the complexities of this music, she felt free to compose some of her own, and earned herself a Junreflukin Award for Most Outstanding Piece for her piece entitled "March of the Grantskalns".</p>
<p>Dr Charnzia Blasega now lives in Reblofistakstan, her first home. She enjoys scratching her feet, speaking Gakwakknowlian, and showing others her talent of making bird noises in her sleep.</p>
<p>Dr Blasega has recieved wide aclaim from many famous persons such as Oprah Winfrey, Hans Zimmer, Borat, Russell Brand, Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer.</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey was quoted as saying, after Charnzia appeared on a special un-aired episode of her award winning day time TV show; "Wow, that was amazing, I can't believe that after all the celebrities I have itnerviewed, this was truelly the first time I have ever been star struck y'all!"</p>
<p>Here is an extract from an email that Dr Charnzia shared on her website from gore Verbinski; "...Me and Jerry (Bruckheimer) are in the initial stages of planning another POTC movie. And as soon as we heard of Charnzia Blasega, we knew we had our next star! I'll email you further to confirm details, but I'd like to chat with you about the movie in LA...."</p>
<p>Borat is quoted as saying [regarding Dr Blasega]; "Hi, my name a Borat, this is my cousin and sister Dr Charnzia Blasega, she is very famous musician of Reblofistakstan...she like mama's cooking"</p>
<p>Russell Brand is an especially big, self proclaimed Dr Charnzia Blasega fan.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from an interview that was conducted by the children of Burkina Faso's capital, Ougadougou;</p>

<p>Dr Charnzia Blasega is very much connected to the home country, she still grazes upon the land and is often glimpsed in the forests and throughout the villages. She is currently engaged to one of her cousins, Vladimyr who is approximately half her age (fifty). Dr Charnzia Blasega hopes to continue her life until at least nine months into the future. Another claim to fame that Charnzia has is that she can see into the past. Although her gift only goes back ninety years or so. Dr Charnzia Blasega hopes that her teachings of obscure music styles will open up many opportunities for people in the home country. Charnzia believes that if she can raise awareness of the hardships her people face every single day, such as having to walk to find fresh grazing grass, monthly tzatziki shortages and many nuclear testing catastrophies, such as her second cousin Igor who now walks with using his face, she will be able to make a difference in how people see the home country and how her people live. Dr Charnzia idolizes people like Michael Jackson and hopes that through her music, she will, just like her idol, be able to touch generations of children and adults alike. Dr Charnzia Blasega's webpage can be visited on: www.reblofistakstanmusic.blogspot.com She would appreciate people visiting her site because every person who visits automatically donates to the plight of the Reblofistakstanian people, in particular, Dr Blasega's cousin who walks using his face, who is now the richest man in the region of Reblofistakstan and Zlatzikistan, he owns a cattle, a wall and many many women. His entire riches have been valued at 250 american cents. That's approximately five times more than the Chief of Reblofistakstan and all of the people in the region's earnings put together! Dr Charnzia wishes to thank you in advance, through her telepathic noodle mantra.</p>
