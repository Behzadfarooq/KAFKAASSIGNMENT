<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The Atari ST was a notable <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a>, based on the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_68000.html" title="Motorola 68000">Motorola 68000</a> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a>, with 512&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/b/KiB_e91c.html" title="KiB">KiB</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_Access_Memory_609b.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a> or more, and 3½" <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a> as storage. It was similar to other contemporary machines which used the Motorola 68000, the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Amiga_e8db.html" title="Commodore Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a>. Although the Macintosh was the first widely available computer with a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_user_interface.html" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI), it was limited to a monochromatic display on a smaller built-in monitor. The Atari ST was the first computer with a fully bit-mapped color GUI. It had an innovative single-chip graphics subsystem (designed by Shiraz Shivji) which shared the full amount of system memory, in alternating clock cycles, with the processor, similar to the earlier <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Micro_b28d.html" title="BBC Micro">BBC Micro</a> and the Unified Memory systems that have become common today. It was also the first home computer with integral <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface_7dd0.html" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</a> support.</p>
<p>The ST was primarily a competitor to the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Amiga_e8db.html" title="Commodore Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> systems. This platform rivalry was often reflected by the owners and was most prominent in the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_Scene_1851.html" title="Demo Scene">Demo Scene</a>. Where the Amiga had custom processors which gave it the edge in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">games</a> and video market, the ST was generally cheaper, had a slightly faster CPU, and had a high-resolution monochrome display, ideal for business and CAD. Thanks to its built-in <a href="../../../m/i/d/MIDI_46f1.html" title="MIDI">MIDI</a> ports it enjoyed success as a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_sequencer.html" title="Music sequencer">music sequencer</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controller.html" title="Controller">controller</a> of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_instrument.html" title="Musical instrument">musical instruments</a> among amateurs and professionals alike, being used in concert by bands such as <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangerine_Dream_cbf2.html" title="Tangerine Dream">Tangerine Dream</a> and 90s UK dance act <a href="../../../8/0/8/808_State_6cad.html" title="808 State">808 State</a>. In some markets, particularly <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the machine gained a strong foothold as a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_business.html" title="Small business">small business</a> machine for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer-aided_design.html" title="Computer-aided design">CAD</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop_publishing.html" title="Desktop publishing">Desktop publishing</a> work.</p>
<p>The ST was later superseded by the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_TT_7306.html" title="Atari TT">Atari TT</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_Falcon_a23f.html" title="Atari Falcon">Falcon</a> computers.</p>
<p>Since Atari pulled out of the computer market there has been a market for powerful <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_TOS_6595.html" title="Atari TOS">TOS</a>-based machines (clones). Like most "retro" computers the Atari enjoys support in the <a href="../../../e/m/u/Emulator.html" title="Emulator">emulator</a> scene.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Edit section: Tramel Technologies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tramel Technologies</span></h3>
<p>At <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_International_e701.html" title="Commodore International">Commodore International</a> an argument involving Commodore's chairman (and largest shareholder) <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Gould_7cc7.html" title="Irving Gould">Irving Gould</a> and Commodore founder <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Tramiel_0540.html" title="Jack Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> ensued over Tramiel's desire for his sons to take more active executive roles within Commodore. The argument resulted in Tramiel's immediate departure from Commodore in January of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>Tramiel immediately formed a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_company.html" title="Holding company">holding company</a>, <b>Tramel Technologies, Ltd.</b>, and began to visit various US computer companies with the intention of purchasing a company. Tramiel visited Mindset (run by Roger Badersher, former head of Atari's Computer Division) and Amiga where Tramiel told Amiga staff that he was very interested in the chipset, but not the staff. Tramiel set his chief engineer - Shiraz Shivji the task of developing a new low-cost, high-end computer system. The original design considered using the <a href="../../../n/s/3/NS32032_9aa6.html" title="NS32032">NS32032</a>, but in talks, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Semiconductor_416b.html" title="National Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> couldn't supply the chip in the numbers or price that the project required. In retrospect this proved to be fortunate as a prototype built on the NS32032 benchmarked slower than the 16/32-bit 68000.</p>
<p>The project, codenamed "RBP" for 'Rock Bottom Price', began to form between April and July 1984 into a design that was almost identical to the ST that eventually shipped. The design was a combination of custom chips and commonly available parts in a highly integrated single-board design, fully equipped with standard and custom ports.</p>
<p><a name="Amiga_contract" id="Amiga_contract"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Edit section: Amiga contract">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amiga contract</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the ST, Atari's computer division developed and sold a line of home computers based on the 6502 CPU with a set of custom VLSI processors - ANTIC (DMA), CTIA/GTIA (Graphics), POKEY (AUDIO) and PIA (I/O)from 1979 through 1982 as the Atari 400 (16K) and Atari 800 (48k), in 1982 Atari introduced the 1200XL which was too closed a design and was replaced with the 600XL/800XL series. Atari prepared several high-end computers for introduction in 1984, but these were cancelled when the Tramiels took over Atari. Several months prior to the release of the ST line, Atari released its 65XE (64K) and 130XE(128k) computers to replace the XL series 6502 8bit computers.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Miner_3e37.html" title="Jay Miner">Jay Miner</a>, one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_2600.html" title="Atari 2600">Atari 2600</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_8-bit_family.html" title="Atari 8-bit family">Atari 8-bit</a> of machines, tried to convince Atari management to invest big money into creating a new chipset and console/computer idea. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_tank.html" title="Think tank">think tank</a> called <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_Corporation_6215.html" title="Amiga Corporation">Hi-Toro</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and set about designing this new chipset. The company which was later renamed Amiga started selling various video game controllers and games while it developed its "Lorraine" computer system.</p>
<p>During development, Amiga had run out of capital to complete the development of its Lorraine chipset, and the "Warner owned" Atari had paid Amiga to continue development work.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design. Atari had plans for a 68000 based machine, code named "Mickey", that would have used custom chips, but details are sparse.</p>
<p>The following year, Tramiel discovered that <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Communications_d927.html" title="Warner Communications">Warner Communications</a> wanted to sell Atari, which at that point was losing about $10,000 a day. Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and world wide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered talks. After on again/off again negotiations with Atari in May and June of 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) that July.</p>
<p>As more executives and researchers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new company <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_Corp._ba27.html" title="Atari Corp.">Atari Corp.</a> after the announcement, Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets. This was intented to in effect, bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.</p>
<p>One of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff and cancel almost all ongoing projects in order to review their continued viability. It was during this time in late July/early August that Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract.</p>
<p>It turned out that Amiga was supposed to deliver the Amiga chipset to Atari on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, 1984. The Amiga crew, having continuing serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that Spring (one of which had been Tramiel and his <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor-transistor_logic.html" title="Transistor-transistor logic">TTL</a>, which ended quickly given his desire to replace nearly everyone at Amiga). Having heard rumors that Tramiel was in closed negotiations to complete the purchase of Atari in several days -- at around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari - Amiga entered in to discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. So instead of Amiga delivering the chipset, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds invested into Amiga for completion of the Lorraine chipset. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage Tramiel immediately used the situation to countersue Commodore through its new (pending) subsidiary, Amiga, which was done on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with that technology. The suit tried to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless and do to Commodore what they were trying to do to him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Commodore, the Amiga team (according to conversations by Curt Vendel of Atarimuseum.com directly with Dave Needles of Amiga and also with Joe Decuir of Amiga) was sitting in limbo for nearly the entire summer because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer system or the team's fate was known. Finally in the fall of 1984 Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset to be improved, the OS developed and the hardware design completed. This delay bought Atari several additional months in 1985 to release Atari STs to Atari User Groups in June 1985 and to go into full retail sales of the Atari 520ST in September of 1985.</p>
<p>So far as the Atari vs Amiga lawsuit - in March of 1987 the two companies had settled out of court in a closed decision.</p>

Soon after the buyout <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> to the platform, but the delivery date was out by about two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Research_dde6.html" title="Digital Research">Digital Research</a>, who were working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_Environment_Manager_20d7.html" title="Graphical Environment Manager">GEM</a>. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was eventually rejected due to the risk.</p>
<p>Digital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the "Monterey Team" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Jim Tittsler was Atari key OS engineer overseeing "Project Jason" (aka - The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers.</p>

<p>CP/M-68K was essentially a direct port of <a href="../../../c/p/2F/CP_M_29aa.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a>'s original, mature operating system. By 1985, it was becoming increasingly outdated in comparison to MS-DOS 2.0; for instance, CP/M did not support sub-directories and did not have a hierarchical file system. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new <a href="../../../d/o/s/DOS_a58e.html" title="DOS">DOS</a>-like operating system specifically for GEM, <b>GEMDOS</b>, and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_TOS_6595.html" title="Atari TOS">TOS</a> (<b>Tramiel Operating System</b>). This was beneficial as it gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drive storage disks, plus programmers had function calls similar to the <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_PC_7073.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a> DOS.</p>

<p>The design shipped in June 1985 to Atari User Groups and then in September 1985 for general retail sales as the <b>520ST</b>. The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under a year. Atari had originally intended to release versions with 128&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/b/KiB_e91c.html" title="KiB">KiB</a> and 256&#160;KiB of RAM as the <b>130ST</b> and <b>260ST</b> respectively. However, with the OS loaded from floppy into RAM, there would be little or no room left over for applications to run. The 260ST did make its way into Europe on a limited basis.</p>
<p>Early models shipped with <i>TOS</i> on disk, but were designed with <a href="../../../r/e/a/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a> sockets to make for easy upgrading to the future ROM based <i>TOS</i>. These became available only a few months later, and were included in all new machines, as well as being available to upgrade older machines. By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an <a href="../../../r/f/_/RF_modulator_3c65.html" title="RF modulator">RF modulator</a> (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST<small><sup>M</sup></small>.</p>
<p>Atari had originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other <a href="../../../d/e/v/Device_file.html" title="Device file">devices</a> simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping, and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the ST was less expensive than most machines, including the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh Plus</a>, and tended to be faster than most (<i>external link:</i> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/3015/16bit.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/3015/16bit.html" rel="nofollow">price comparison</a>). Largely as a result of the price/performance factor, the ST would go on to be a fairly popular machine, notably in markets where the foreign exchange rates amplified prices. Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was "power without the price." In fact, an Atari ST and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminal_emulation.html" title="Terminal emulation">terminal emulation</a> software was much cheaper than a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Equipment_Corporation_0f47.html" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">Digital</a> <a href="../../../v/t/2/VT220_c4a7.html" title="VT220">VT220</a> terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.</p>

The Atari 520ST</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 520ST was an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>. By the time the 520ST reached the market, however, consumers demanded a keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason, the 520ST was a fairly large and awkward computer console.</p>
<p>Adding to this problem was the number of large cables needed to connect to the peripherals. This problem was addressed to some degree in the follow-on models which included a built-in floppy disk, though this addition resulted in the awkward placement of the mouse and joystick ports to a cramped niche <i>underneath</i> the keyboard.</p>
<p>Early 520ST owners became accustomed to the "Atari Twist" and the "Atari Drop" service procedures. "Atari Twist" seemed to help discharge built-up static electricity (Atari soldered-down the metal shielding to fix the problem) while the "Atari Drop" appeared to help re-seat chips which may have become partially unseated over time.</p>
<p>The case design was created by Ira Valenski - Atari's chief Industrial Designer. The ST was basically wedge shaped, with a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The majority of the machines had keyboards with soft tactile feedback resulting in a "cheap" feel, with rhomboid function keys across the top edge. The original 520ST design used an external floppy drive; the 1040ST-style case featured a built-in floppy drive. The power supply for the early 520ST was a large external brick while the 1040ST's was inside the machine.</p>

<li>ST cartridge port (for 128 KiB ROM cartridges)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of its <a href="../../../b/i/-/Bi-directional.html" title="Bi-directional">bi-directional</a> design, the Centronics printer port could be used for joystick input and several games made use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.</p>
<p>Atari initially used single-sided <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">disk drives</a> that could store up to 360&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">kB</a>. Later drives were double-sided versions that stored 720&#160;kB. Due to the early sales of so many of the single-sided drives, almost all software would ship on two single-sided disks instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_adopter.html" title="Early adopter">early adopters</a>. ST magazines wishing to cater to the entire audience while still supplying a large amount of material on a single cover disc had to adopt innovative custom formats to work around this problem. Another sticking point was that while the Atari double-sided drive could read IBM-formatted disks, IBM PCs could not read Atari disks. This was a formatting issue that was later resolved by third-party software formatters and TOS upgrades (1.4 and higher).</p>

Atari ST 1040</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Atari later upgraded the basic design in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> with the <b>1040ST<sup>F</sup></b> (also written <b>STF</b>). The machine was generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_drive.html" title="Floppy drive">floppy drive</a> into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The 1040 shipped with 1&#160;<a href="../../../m/i/b/MiB_e64c.html" title="MiB">MiB</a> of RAM, and the same design was also used for the new 512 KiB <b>520STFM</b>, which replaced the earlier models in the market.</p>
<p>The <b>1040ST</b> was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&#160;MiB, and when the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it became the first computer to break the $1000/MiB price barrier, and was featured on the cover of <a href="../../../b/y/t/Byte_Magazine_0a17.html" title="Byte Magazine">Byte Magazine</a>. However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the <i>XE series</i> of the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_8-bit_family.html" title="Atari 8-bit family">Atari 8-bit family</a> of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.</p>

<p>Initial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market, with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.</p>
<p>To address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the <b>ST1</b>. First debuted at Comdex, 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the <b>Mega</b>, this new machine included a detached high-quality keyboard, stronger case (to support the weight of a monitor), and internal bus expansion connector. The upcoming SLM804 <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_printer.html" title="Laser printer">laser printer</a> would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It would attach to the Mega through the ST DMA port and have the Mega computer render the pages. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MiB (a 1 MiB version, the <b>Mega 1</b> would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package.</p>
<p>A custom <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitter.html" title="Blitter">blitter</a> co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the <b>Mega 2</b> and <b>Mega 4</b> machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly-written programs using the screen VDI commands could use the blitter seamlessly since GEM <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_programming_interface.html" title="Application programming interface">API</a> was a higher-level interface to <i>TOS</i>.</p>

<p>For about the first four years, no major design changes in the ST <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platform_%28computing%29.html" title="Platform (computing)">platform</a> took place as Atari focused on manufacturing problems and distribution.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Edit section: ST enhanced">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ST enhanced</span></h3>
<p>In late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari.html" title="Atari">Atari</a> released the <b>ST<sup>E</sup></b> (also written <b>STE</b>), a version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. The STE featured an increased colour palette of 4096 colours from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution), <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genlock.html" title="Genlock">Genlock</a> support, and a graphics co-processor chip called <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitter.html" title="Blitter">Blitter</a> which could quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics sprites) around in RAM. It also included a new 2-channels digital sound chip that could play 8-bit stereo samples in hardware at up to 50 kHz. Two enhanced joystick ports (EJP) were added (two normal joysticks could be plugged into each port with an adaptor), with the new connectors placed in more easily-accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were compatible with joypads from Atari's <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_Jaguar_8e7f.html" title="Atari Jaguar">Jaguar</a> console. RAM was now much more simply upgradable via <a href="../../../s/i/m/SIMM_8ffb.html" title="SIMM">SIMMs</a>. Despite all of this, it still ran at 8&#160;<a href="../../../m/e/g/Megahertz.html" title="Megahertz">MHz</a>, and the enhanced hardware was clearly designed to catch up with the Amiga.</p>
<p>The <b>STE</b> models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_software.html" title="Application software">applications</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer_game.html" title="Personal computer game">games</a> written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable (sometimes, this could be solved by expanding the RAM). To make matters worse, the built-in floppy disk drives could not read as many tracks on a floppy disk as the built-in floppy disk drives on older models. While this was not a problem for most users, some games used the extra tracks as a crude form of copy protection and as a means of cramming more data onto the disk, and formatting as many as 86 tracks on an "80-track" disk was a common space-expanding option in custom formatting utilities. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behaviour with a few applications (such as First Word Plus).</p>
<p>Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare, generally being limited to serious art, CAD or music applications, with very few games taking advantage of the hardware as it was found on so few machines. Quality did, however, seem to substitute for quantity, as the coders who took advantage of the new abilities used them to their fullest.</p>
<p>The last STE machine, the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_MEGA_STE_86c3.html" title="Atari MEGA STE">Mega STE</a>, was a STE in a grey <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_TT_7306.html" title="Atari TT">Atari TT</a> case that ran at a switchable 16&#160;MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_68882.html" title="Motorola 68882">Motorola 68882</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floating_point_unit.html" title="Floating point unit">FPU</a>, built-in 3½" floppy disk drive, <a href="../../../v/m/e/VMEbus_957e.html" title="VMEbus">VME</a> expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's <a href="../../../l/o/c/LocalTalk_6fa7.html" title="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a>) and an optional built-in 3½" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44 MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.</p>

<p>In 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_TT_7306.html" title="Atari TT">TT</a> (32-MHz, 68030-based TT030). Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard drive enclosure.</p>
<p>The final ST computer was the multimedia <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_Falcon_a23f.html" title="Atari Falcon">Falcon</a> (also 68030-based, operating at 16 MHz, but with improved video modes and extensive custom chip provisions, particularly high-quality audio DSPs). Although 68030 microprocessor was capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon used a 16-bit bus which impacted performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST<sup>E</sup>. After-market upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.</p>
<p>Released in 1992, it was cancelled by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licenced the Falcon design from Atari and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with a 500 MB hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case).</p>

<p>Following the exit of Atari from the computer market, Medusa Computer Systems manufactured some powerful 3rd-party Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used <a href="../../../6/8/0/68040.html" title="68040">68040</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/0/68060.html" title="68060">68060</a> processors, based around multimedia (particularly audio, but also video), CAD and office uses.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of a hardware supplier, there is a small active community dedicated to keeping the ST platform alive. There have been advancements in the operating system, software emulators (for Windows, Mac &amp; Linux), and some hardware developments. There are accelerator cards, such as the CT60 &amp; CT63, which is a <a href="../../../6/8/0/68060.html" title="68060">68060</a> based accelerator card for the Falcon, and there is the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_Coldfire_Project_3fb1.html" title="Atari Coldfire Project">Atari Coldfire Project</a>, which aims at developing an Atari-clone based on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldfire.html" title="Coldfire">Coldfire</a> processor.

<p>The ST was the first <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a> with built-in MIDI ports, and there was plenty of MIDI-related software for use professionally in music studios, or by amateur enthusiasts. The popular Windows/Macintosh applications <i><a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubase.html" title="Cubase">Cubase</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic_Pro_df63.html" title="Logic Pro">Logic Pro</a></i> originated on the Atari ST. Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's KCS, contained a "Multi-Program Environment" that allowed ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.<a href="http://tamw.atari-users.net/omega.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://tamw.atari-users.net/omega.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Even today some people (such as <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatboy_Slim_8cef.html" title="Fatboy Slim">Fatboy Slim</a>) are still using the Atari ST for composing music.</p>
<p>Music <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracker.html" title="Tracker">tracker</a> software was popular on the ST, such as the <i>TCB Tracker</i>, aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').</p>
<p>An innovative music composition program that combined the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) was called <i>Quartet</i> (after its 4-note polyphonic tracker, which displayed one monophonic stave at a time on colour screens).</p>
<p>Due to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replay_Professional_e000.html" title="Replay Professional">Replay Professional</a> product featured a sound sampler that cleverly used the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog-to-digital_converter.html" title="Analog-to-digital converter">ADC</a>. For output of digital sound, it used the on-board frequency output, set it to 128 kHz (inaudible) and then modulated the amplitude of that.</p>
<p>In addition to the sound sampling functionalities, the availability of software packages with MIDI support for music composition and efficient sound analysis contributed to make the Atari ST a forerunner of later computer-based all-in-one studios.</p>

<p>Also popular on the ST was professional <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop_publishing.html" title="Desktop publishing">desktop publishing</a> software, such as <i><a href="../../../p/a/g/PageStream_7775.html" title="PageStream">PageStream</a></i> and <i>Calamus</i>; office tools such as word processors (<i><a href="../../../w/o/r/WordPerfect_dbcd.html" title="WordPerfect">WordPerfect</a></i>, <i>WordWriter ST</i> and others), spreadsheets and database programs; and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade, all being largely targeted or even limited to high resolution monochrome-monitor owners.</p>
<p>Graphics programs such as <i>NEOchrome</i>, <i>Degas</i> &amp; <i>Degas Elite</i>, <i>Canvas</i>, <i><a href="../../../d/e/l/Deluxe_Paint_b7a2.html" title="Deluxe Paint">Deluxe Paint</a></i>, and <i>Cyber Paint</i> featured advanced features such as 3D design, animation. One paint program, <i>Spectrum 512</i>, used palette switching tricks allowing the maximum number of colors to be displayed on-screen at once (up to 46 in each scan line - the STE never had a Spectrum4096, but other more minor applications filled this speciality niche, one even going so far as to trick the shifter into displaying a maximum 19200 colours).</p>
<p><a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_computer_graphics_c308.html" title="3D computer graphics">3D computer graphics</a> applications (like The Cyber Studio), brought 3D modelling, sculpting, scripting, and most important, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_animation.html" title="Computer animation">computer animation</a> (using <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_encoding.html" title="Delta encoding">delta-compression</a>) to the desktop.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Edit section: Software development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Software development</span></h3>
<p>The Atari ST had a wide variety of languages and tools for development. 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, <a href="../../../h/i/s/HiSoft_8ab7.html" title="HiSoft">HiSoft</a>'s Devpac), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal), C compilers (like Alcyon C, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lattice_C_43a9.html" title="Lattice C">Lattice C</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megamax_C_23c3.html" title="Megamax C">Megamax C</a>, Mark Williams C, <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Compiler_Collection_cfca.html" title="GNU Compiler Collection">GNU C</a>, Aztec C), <a href="../../../l/i/s/LISP_4799.html" title="LISP">LISP</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prolog.html" title="Prolog">Prolog</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logo_programming_language.html" title="Logo programming language">Logo</a> and many others.</p>
<p>The initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. At $5,000, this discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement).</p>
<p>The ST came bundled with a system disk that contained <i><a href="../../../s/t/_/ST_BASIC_adc4.html" title="ST BASIC">ST BASIC</a></i>, the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as <i><a href="../../../g/f/a/GFA_BASIC_9776.html" title="GFA BASIC">GFA BASIC</a></i>, FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to actually be supplied as a ROM cartridge instead of on disc) and the relatively famous <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/STOS_BASIC_programming_language_f3a1.html" title="STOS BASIC programming language">STOS</a></i>, a cousin of AMOS on the Amiga, and powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and an innumerable host of good quality shareware and public domain games.</p>
<p>Even novelty tools such as <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoot%27Em-Up_Construction_Kit_0068.html" title="Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit">SEUCK</a></i> were available.</p>

<p>The ST enjoyed success in gaming due to low cost, fast performance and colorful graphics.</p>
<p>Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Molyneux_0fb5.html" title="Peter Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Bell_d069.html" title="Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Minter_859e.html" title="Jeff Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/z/Jez_San_4bd7.html" title="Jez San">Jez San</a>, James Hutchby, Dimitri Koveos and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Braben_fb44.html" title="David Braben">David Braben</a>. The first real-time 3D role-playing computer game, <i><a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeon_Master_%28computer_game%29_a233.html" title="Dungeon Master (computer game)">Dungeon Master</a></i>, was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Falcon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Falcon (computer game)">Falcon</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2363.html#History" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator">Flight Simulator II</a></i> made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, <a href="../../../m/i/d/MIDI_Maze_862b.html" title="MIDI Maze">MIDI Maze</a> used the midi ports to connect with other machines for interactive networked play. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by computer game magazines of simply being ST ports.</p>

<p>Utility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST (HyperPaint II by Dimitri Koveos, HyperDraw by David Farmborough, <a href="../../../3/d/-/3D-Calc_1d78.html" title="3D-Calc">3D-Calc</a> spreadsheet by Frank Schoonjans, and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Arts_8921.html" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a>).</p>
<p>There was a thriving output of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shareware.html" title="Shareware">shareware</a> software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, public domain software libraries that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up Bulletin Board Systems.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid 90s and the birth of the modern, publicly accessible internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical world wide web browser applications are available and usable on the ST.</p>

<p>Very early machines included the OS on a floppy disk due to it not being ready to be burned to ROM (Like the <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_1000.html" title="Amiga 1000">Amiga 1000</a> had) This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) <a href="../../../r/e/a/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a> versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 KiB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 KiB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari (and Commodore) trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became ST<sup>F</sup>s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 KiB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 KiB RAM) double density drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS - 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an <a href="../../../r/f/_/RF_Modulator_883c.html" title="RF Modulator">RF Modulator</a> that allowed the machine to be hooked to a colour TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50 Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the <b>520ST<sup>M</sup></b> (or <b>520STM</b>). Later <b>F</b> and <b>FM</b> models of the 520 had a built in double-sided disk drive instead of a single-sided one.</p>

<p>A number of machines were released in the ST family. Here they are, in rough chronological order after the original 520ST:</p>
<ul>
<li>520ST+ - Name for early 520STs with 1&#160;MiB of RAM, but without floppy disk</li>
<li>260ST - European name for the 520ST with 512&#160;KiB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&#160;KiB models from the 1&#160;MiB models</li>
<li>520ST<sup>M</sup> - a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output</li>
<li>520ST<sup>FM</sup> - a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive</li>
<li>1040ST<sup>F</sup> - a 520STFM with 1&#160;MiB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk, but without RF modulator</li>
<li>1040ST<sup>FM</sup> - a 520STFM with 1&#160;MiB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk with RF modulator</li>
<li>Mega ST (MEGA2, MEGA4) - 1040 with 2 or 4&#160;MiB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved "<a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza_box.html" title="Pizza box">pizza box</a>" case with a detached keyboard. Early models did not include the BLiTTER chip; most did. Included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector.</li>
<li>520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup> - a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, the BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040 style all-in-one case</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_MEGA_STE_86c3.html" title="Atari MEGA STE">Mega STE</a> - same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16-MHz processor, in the TT case</li>
<li>STacy - A <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_computer.html" title="Portable computer">portable</a> (but definitely not <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop.html" title="Laptop">laptop</a>) version of the ST. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard <a href="../../../c/_/c/C_cell.html" title="C cell">C cell</a> flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut, and soon discontinued the machine.</li>
<li>ST Book (later version portable ST), vastly more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this - notably the backlight, and internal floppy disc drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (1 MiB - though you could fit a lot into 1 and a half floppies back then) of internal flash memory 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disc to a 'real' desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light (the idea of a switchable green LED backlight seeming not to have inspired the Atari technical department as it did many wristwatch manufacturers), it is fixed to the 640x400 1-bit mono mode (not even greyscale emulation of colour in low res is offered), and no external video port was provided. For its limitations, it gained some popularity as being the most utterly portable 'real' computer of the day (slim, light, quiet, reliable, and with a long battery life, even by today's standards for all 5), particularly amongst musicians already used to using the original computer and perhaps having lugged a STacy or even a full ST + Monitor + accessories rig on tour.</li>
