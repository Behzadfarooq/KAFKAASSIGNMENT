<p>The picture here is somewhat lacking.

The image at it's image page is also having some difficulty.

<p>The paragraph about the ABC being a specific purpose machine was in there because that point is important. The ABC could solve linear simultaneous equations.

<dd>You're not making much coherent sense. It is indeed important to note that the ABC was not a stored program computer and it's totally irrelevant that ABC <i>might</i> have been developed further. It never in any incarnation showed any stored program traits, so it was not a stored program computer. That's an undeniable fact and is a trait that distinguishes later designs from the ABC.

<dd>The stored program concept was already around when ABC was designed and constructed (as it was when ENIAC was built, and when Von Neumann published his famous draft of EDVAC). Your anachronism is moot; the idea of the stored program came out of computers from this period and is thus very relevant to discuss. To use your own example, it is appropriate to discuss prior and following optical disc schemes in the <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> article. Notice that it talks about CD-ROM and Blu-Ray. There's an obvious difference between comparing the fundamental designs of contemporary early electronic computers and throwing something totally non-sequitur into the article like an optical disc format from decades later. I'm fairly convinced you realize this difference, but I suspect you are just being facetious to try and prove your point.</dd>
<dd>To make things more concrete, articles like <a href="../../../e/n/i/ENIAC_3400.html" title="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus_computer.html" title="Colossus computer">Colossus computer</a> discuss the limitations of those computers in comparison with contemporary designs, so why shouldn't this one? POV is trying to remove relevant comparisons from this article and spam text designed to demerit Mauchly in unrelated articles. Concern for the quality and completeness of an article is not POV.</dd>
<dd>As for the ENIAC page, I haven't the slightest clue what you're talking about; a brief glance at the history of that page shows that I have never made a single edit to it. If something you wrote was removed, it wasn't by me. Now I turn your question back on you: who are <i>you</i> to demand that you are the only person here conceivably correct about what an article <i>should</i> and <i>should not</i> include? -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 00:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The stored program <i>concept</i> had been around since Babbage's design for the Analytical engine in the 1860's. Babbage doesn't get credit for BUILDING the first computer because (a) His Difference engine wasn't programmable - and hence not a computer and (b) his Analytical engine was never constructed - so whilst he came up with the idea of programmability - he doesn't get credit for building it. So, in this context, the ABC is in the exact same situation. As it was actually built, it wasn't programmable - and the Difference engine beat it to the claim for first digital calculator - and the concepts that might someday have made the ABC into a fully programmable computer are beaten by the Analytical engine - which also might someday have made it as a fully programmable computer. So whichever way you slice it - Babbage beat the ABC to the "first ever" slot whether you believe programmablility is or is not a requirement to be called a computer - and whether or not the thing has to be actually BUILT to get a claim to fame. Either way, the ABC is just an evolutionary step. ENIAC (probably) gets the true claim to be the first actually functional programmable device...which in my books makes it the first true computer to actually work with the Analytical engine to be the first to be designed. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 06:17, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a>, I agree with all of your points, but I nevertheless think your recent edits were too aggressive. First of all, the "some claim" dodge is very weak. I also think that substituting "calculator" is simply trolling. The ABC was a "computer", just not in the modern sense of the word, as "digital general-purpose reprogrammable stored-program computer" has taken over the term. Clearly there are still partisans on this topic (our dear anon is obviously one of them), so why stick a finger in their eye? A reliable, NPOV source (<i>Computer</i> by Cambell-Kelly and Aspray, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-465-02989-2</a>) calls the machine a "computer", though it points out that "the evidence" of the degree to which Mauchly was influenced (or stole ideas) is "massive and conflicting".</p>
<p>I think a much more NPOV position is that the ABC "may have been the first digital computer", that it certainly was "the first machine that used binary arithmetic", but that it was not a general-purpose computer in the modern sense and "never came into fully reliable operation", and only in the 1960s did the full extent of Atanasoff's contribution become widely known. The Book <i>Engines of the Mind</i> also supports this story, and the author interviewed Atanasoff in person before his death! -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 08:03, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, using the term calculator is a bit brash and very debatable. By some measures, the ABC was certainly a computer of some sort. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 16:29, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify, personally I would tend to agree with Steve that the ABC is closer to a digital calculator than a computer, <b>but</b> I can empathize with those who would call it a computer. I don't think it's fair to slap either label on it without a good bit of explanation. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 16:31, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Additionally, you two are confusing a definition and a term with that of a name. A calculator is a calculator by name. Even a programmable calculator is not called a computer (which you agree that it is) because it's name is "calculator" and happens to be programmable (an adjective) — ergo programmable calculator. If I had a fancy-enough-for-you alarm clock, you still would call it an alarm clock because that is what it is by name and function. Or an extremely modern copying machine that is programmable...is still a copying machine by name. Or the next gen TVs (post-HDCP) that may run a java virtual machine for such functions as playing games or decrypting encrypted channels — it's still a television by name. Just because none of them are called computers does not make them any less of a computer. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 15:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree, of course. We are not seeking to change the correct name of the device (it is and always will be "Atanasoff-Berry Computer".

<dd>Agree also. I'm not debating that it was called "The Atanasoff-Berry <i>Computer</i>" - that's a historical fact. I'm not even debating whether it was reasonable to call it a computer by the standards employed at the time (when, bear in mind, a human being who operated a mechanical desk calculator for a living was called a <i>computer</i> and Church, Turing and Von Neumann had barely started to think about this). I'm saying that by the standards of modern language, we define a computer as something that passes the Church-Turing test. It's a solid, mathematical, demonstratable definition - and I'm pretty sure it covers all the bases for actual usage of the word. I'm also asking (begging, pleading) for those who claim that my definition is wrong to PLEASE offer us a better definition so we can discuss that. Then we could search for modern references to back it up and come to some sort of a conclusion. Simply saying that my definition is wrong doesn't resolve anything - we would still need to know what is right - we would still need to change the opening sentence on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">Computer</a> page in order to correct it to match whatever alternative definition is shown to be correct. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:41, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have reverted <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a>'s edits. The reason has more to do with writing and English than with content. The first sentence says "Atanasoff-Berry <b>Computer</b>", so there is no reason to repeat <i>computer</i> three or four words later in the sentence. A computer is a computing device, all computing devices may or may not be computers -- the dichotomy sets up the (enlarged) section on the controversy. Regarding naming the court, the top section is an Overview -- the court details are included in the controversy section. It is not important for someone reading the the opening section to know exactly which court, though you could say "federal patent court" or whatever if you really wanted to. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 20:24, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed that the ABC diagram, which is claimed to be PD as a work of the US government, actually seems to belong to Iowa State University. If that's the case the copyright status should be changed and the image may need to be removed/replaced.

<dd>Anything made by the federal government is in the public domain. However, ISU works are not that of the federal government so it is tagged incorrectly. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 01:48, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there may be missing words in the following sentence, which doesn't seem to be grammatically complete.</p>
<p>"Much of Atanasoff's work was not widely known until rediscovered in the 1960s, and conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer." <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 09:11, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the following quotation is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28logic%29.html" title="Tautology (logic)">tautology</a>:</p>
<p><i>Simply put, Atanasoff either is or is not the inventor of the first electronic special-purpose computer.</i></p>
<p>As such, I'm not sure what it adds to an encyclopedic article. The fact that it's quoted from a book doesn't give it any greater usefulness. Can anyone provide any thoughts as to why this quotation is useful to readers seeking guidance on Atanasoff's role in the development of computers? <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 10:38, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A couple of months have gone by and no-one has come up with any support for including the above tautology in the article.

<p>The article says: " The machine, initiated in 1937, was capable of solving up to 29 simultaneous linear equations and was successfully tested before the project was abandoned in 1942..."</p>
<p>A reader could interpret this as meaning that it was first tested as a fully working machine in 1942. Does anyone have any sources that indicate whether this is correct, or was it in working condition earlier than 1942? <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 11:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The operational dates are not well documented. The Mollenhoff book says that the prototype which could add and subtract up to 8 digits was finished in the fall of 1939 (p. 47), and the full machine was built over the next two years. A 35 page illustrated description of the ABC was submitted around August, 1940 as part of a request for further funding, with a copy sent to a Chicago patent attorney (p. 49). A newspaper article in January 1941 described the "electrical computing machine" and said it would take about a year to complete (p. 51). The machine was functional, but it's I/O device used sparks to punch intermediate results on cards, and was somewhat ureliable. A $5,330 grant for continued development was received from the Research Corporation on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> (p. 52). The ABC was sufficiently complete in June 1941 for John Mauchly to spend four days examining and discussing the ABC with Atanasoff. When Mauchly returned to Pennsylvania, he was enthusiastic and wrote in a second letter in September, "Is there any objection, from your point of view, to my building some sort of computer which incorporates some of the features of your machine?" and "[If] I got the Moore School interested in having something of the sort, would the way be open for us to build an "Atanasoff Calculator" (a la Bush analyzer) here?" (p. 59) Atanasoff replied that they needed to remain circumspect until a patent application was filed. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 20:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded"</p>
<p>I believe more of the ABC was preserved than just a memory drum. The Burks books will provide definitive reference. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 19:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently I was remembering (from the first Burks book, and their Amazon.com reviews of their second) that ISU reconstructed two add-subtract mechanisms from vintage parts. I am uncertain as to what of this was donated to the Smithsonian and what remains with ISU, though I know both have exhibits and I have extensive photographs of both of them; the Smithsonian Information Age exhibit is at present closed. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 09:20, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
