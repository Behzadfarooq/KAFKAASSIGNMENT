<p>Actually, what I said was "Please don't move these pages without consensus." If there is no consensus for a change, the status quo wins out and the pages should remain as they were until and unless the situation changes. I truly am not nearly as concerned with which naming standard "wins out" as I am with ensuring that SPUI doesn't simply get to steamroll over everyone else with his blinkered ideas about what is "correct." Perhaps you'd be interested in explaining just what it is about the two of you that makes you so incredibly special that no one else's input matters? --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 00:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's obvious here we're using disambiguation wrong; the official names for state routes in California are State Route Number X or State Route X, not the proper noun California State Route X. Hence, the the word "California" is the disambiguation mechanism much like how "Lugo" is the disambiguation mechanism for <a href="../../../r/%C3%AD/o/R%C3%ADo_Grande_%28Lugo%29_00e5.html" title="Río Grande (Lugo)">Río Grande (Lugo)</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hondo_River_%28Belize%29_2e7a.html" title="Hondo River (Belize)">Hondo River (Belize)</a>. If the article was at Lugo Río Grande, which is an obvious violation of the disambiguation policy, and several people wanted to keep it at Lugo Río Grande "just because that's how it's always been," that would only contribute to disorder. If you want road examples, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoroute_%28Quebec%29_a995.html" title="Autoroute (Quebec)">Autoroute (Quebec)</a>, not Quebec Autoroute. Furthermore, the current 'status quo' system was also devised by spui a few years ago (all the article names were all over the place when CA/SR first started, and spui had moved all of them to create a uniform system). He realises that it's wrong now and is trying to fix it. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 00:37, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that your interpretation is the best way to meet the requirements of <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a>, which says at the very top: "When choosing a name for a page ask yourself: What word would the average user of the Wikipedia put into the search engine?" The page itself gives a dozen examples of articles where the common name used for the article title is at odds with a more "correct" name. My belief is that an average user, knowing that Wikipedia is a global encyclopedia, when looking for information on <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_Route_87_0440.html" title="California State Route 87">this highway</a> would be most likely to search on a variation of "<i>california state route 87</i>" or "<i>california state highway 87</i>". I can't imagine that someone in, say, Amsterdam or Singapore would ever think that "<i>state route 87</i>", disambiguated or not, would be the best search term to use when looking for information on a highway in California specifically. I may be wrong. But I may not be wrong.</dd>

<dd>Look, you seem like a reasonable person, and this is an issue on which reasonable people can disagree. I truly believe this is an impasse that can be resolved. I honestly <i>do not care</i> that much which standard ultimately prevails, so long as it's arrived at in a reasonable and civil manner. It's just wrong for one person to unilaterally decide that he knows best and that no one else's input matters. My contributions are as valid as the next person's, and so are yours, and SPUI's contributions are no <i>more</i> valid than anyone else's. If you're interested in resolving this peacefully through discussion, then I'm with you all the way. --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 16:16, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been wanting discussion, but now everyone on eiher side has turned so stubborn that it's practically impossible to resolve anything with a objective view now; everyone is caught up with what spui does that no one is discussing the acutal thing that matters anymore -- the naming convention. So with a lack of anything better to do i've been sort of inclined to join the move wars... but as of late i've been moving to editing other sorts of articles besdies highways now since it's going nowhere.</dd>

<dd>Anyways, I agree with what you're saying -- no one would search "State Route 76 (California)". This is also the point Rschen has been making a lot. However, I don't think many of the disambiguated pages WILL be the common search term. If I didn't do wikipedia, i'd prboably never use parenthesis in search things like "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Courier_%28typeface%29.html" title="Courier (typeface)">Courier (typeface)</a>" -- I'd type "Courier font". I'd search "X-files movie", not "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_X_Files_%28film%29_2da8.html" title="The X Files (film)">The X Files (film)</a>" and like the example I gave above, I'd search "California Rio Hondo River", not "<a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_Hondo_%28California%29_90cb.html" title="Rio Hondo (California)">Rio Hondo (California)</a>". Hence, I think all the disambiguation with parens IS at odds with the common anmes policy; nevertheless, it's the way things are disambiguated now (with the eception of City, State) <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 20:52, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be right. Personally I'm beginning to think that there's enough inconsistency among the way people talk about highways, with <i>state route X</i> over here and <i>state highway Y</i> over there and <i>"Illinois Z"</i> messing things up, to make it difficult or impossible to guess how users are likely to search for highways anyway. (One last thing though: why is <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_California_8f4f.html" title="Governor of California">Governor of California</a> an article, while <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_%28California%29_2072.html" title="Governor (California)">Governor (California)</a> isn't even a redirect?)</dd>

What's really needed here is for a group of people on both "sides" to agree to start from scratch, listen to each others' arguments in good faith, come to a decision that's grounded in policy, and agree to abide by whatever decision comes out of the process. My hand is out, if you'd like to shake it. --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 20:09, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point with Governors; I initially thought it was just another misimplementation of disambiguation, but: they all refer to the same governmental position / job, only in different states -- whereas the ( ) disamibuation refers to different objects of the same name... I dunno. That's the best explanation I can offer.</dd>

<dd>We should create a highway naming tribunal somewhere and get afew poeple from either side. To be honest, I don't think Rschen would make a good addition because we've offered him a lot of arguments but he steadfastly repeats his own arguments over and over again... but otherwise i'm all up for it. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 20:26, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He may have gotten a little too invested in the struggle, but I believe he's sincerely interested in working out a consensus solution. In fact, I believe there's only one person on either side who <i>isn't</i> interested in working out a consensus solution... no points for guessing who it is. I'm hopeful that the dialogue on <a href="../../../c/a/s/WT%7ECASH_48cf.html" title="WT:CASH">WT:CASH</a> will result in progress, but SPUI's already rejected anything binding, so I'm not optimistic. --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 21:44, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They look good, sorry for the delay, I've been swamped with work. But I suppose the border could be thicker, but not too much. I mean, if you look at some of those shield pictures, that's what they look like. Maybe enough so a 75+px image looks normal? I tried to play around with Illustrator, but it didn't work too well.

<p>Hi there! I see you have tagged a number of fonts which were PNG format, and subsequently moved to Commons in SVG. Have you talked to <a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynaBlast_e175.html" title="User:DynaBlast">User:DynaBlast</a> about the changes? I'd feel more comfortable going through with the deletions if you could point me to some discussion on the matter.

<p>A few weeks back I wanted to upload some font sample images, and I was wondering what format I should use for font samples.

As you can see, SVG is probably not the best solution because <i>you'd be in essence uploading chunks of the copyrighted font into wikipedia</i>. I had settled for high resolution PNG, but hadn't moved forward on that. I noticed all of your recent additions had been in SVG, and was wondering what your thoughts were on this?

<p>Okay, I'm won over to the idea that the font samples should be SVG, not PNG. So I'd like to go and upload new SVG samples to replace all the PNGs I previously created... but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to do it. I've got AI 12, but whenever I save a sample as SVG, it doesn't embed the fonts (even though I tell it to). When I look at the SVG source it looks nothing like yours. I'm stumped. Can you give me some tips, or point me to a walkthrough? I'm very frustrated with this.

<p>I understand... I've done that sort of thing before... in fact, the text just after your addition I added to help us over at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>... basically if SPUI's view is the consensus generated I would fully back it and support it. However... put it this way. Basically back in the early days, when only <a href="../../../c/a/s/WP%7ECASH_ec17.html" title="WP:CASH">WP:CASH</a> was around, no <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSRD_286b.html" title="WP:USRD">WP:USRD</a>, etc. it was probably okay to mass-move since you were the only editors. In a sense, unspoken consensus. However, that is no longer the case. I discovered how many people are now involved with highways as I had to notify each and every one of them, a process which took a few hours over DSL. Basically... the highway department at Wikipedia has changed, and you can't just start polices anymore--you have to get approval. Even last year you could get away with mass moves--as I did with West Virginia. However, we can't do that anymore.</p>
<p>I believe that out of style the "California State Route" should be kept, but I will support the convention that comes out of the debate, whatever it is. Basically, SPUI's mass moves angered a lot of people at California and Washington, and even when people requested that he stop, his not doing so was a bad move. In reality, none of us are in control of the Highways area anymore, regardless of seniority, and we have to get consensus before making massive changes.

<dd>No, I haven't implemented the checkered theme, however, I did a test of two rows. I would have thought it would be a bit busy, but since SPUI is complaining about it being "too big" and/or "busy" as is right now, I don't see how it could "hurt" the page. And I do agree with the VT -&gt; Route naming - I just carried it over IIRC from the old page. There is also no correlation between 2A and 8A. I think they are signed as such and not as ALT 2 or ALT 8 (as they are in Kentucky). <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 07:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, thanks for that long comment. It was a good read. =) Well, when I wrote the comment that "this was part of a format that was laid down before I got here", I was referring to the state highway articles that had already been written for the state of North Carolina. I assumed sometime in the past this issue had been argued and they decided to named them "North Carolina State Highway x". I just continued that tradition. When I wrote that commment I was a fairly new member to Wikipedia and had NO idea that there was a huge debate on it, resulting in states picking their own convention. I was the one who started the North Carolina Highways Wikiproject after noticing on the US Roads Wikiproject page that there wasn't one for my state. Then SPUI came along. I think he realized that I was new, so he to get me to go along with a name change from North Carolina State Highway 24 to NC 24. I bacially put his proposition on my WikiProject talk, asking the rest of the members involved what they thought. I personally didn't like the idea of just "NC x" because it was too vague, it was an abbreviation, and it conflicted with Congressional districts of the same name and nautical craft that use that format.</p>
<p>Well, as the debate ensued, I eventually found a link to the old poll on state highway article naming and read what was argued in the past. I even found articles for where members like SPUI and others had been banned for edit warring; I read a lot of the comments, arguments, etc. That's when I realized that our little argument about NC 24 was just a reoccurance of a huge issue that occurred months prior to my joining Wikipedia. Well, when the new state route naming convention came around, I thought about both of the proposals, drew conclusions, and commented about my findings.</p>
<p>My previous comment on NC 24 about "rules laid down before I got here" is no longer valid, because I now know the history behind those rules. Now, I can't really speak for the entire nation on this, but I think "Statename Term x" is <i>MUCH</i> better for North Carolina and a some of other states than the parentheses proposal. The word "state", in my opinion probably shouldn't be a part of the title though. I have listed my reasonings for this over and over why I think Proposal 1 is better and I will attempt to list them here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The road signs and addresses of residents living on a North Carolina state route read "N.C. Highway x", which is an abbreviation of "North Carolina Highway x"</li>
<li>Wikipedia policies say you should avoid disambiguation with parentheses if it can be avoided. I think it can easily be.</li>
<li>Since "common names" are usually derived from TV and by reading road signs, etc. I think Proposal 1 is the most common way of speaking the "common name" of the route.</li>
<li>Since it is on the road signs and addresses, it is an official name.</li>
<li>No Joe Schmoe would type "Term x (State Name)" in a search bar that is unfamiliar with Wikipedia's organization.</li>
<li>Proposal 1 would prevent confusion and bump up the articles on Google queries</li>
<li>Proposal 1 would not cause confusion where more than one state's routes are dicussed. Example: when describing a state route ends at another state route at the state line.</li>
<li>Nobody I know just says "State Route x" or "State Highway x" here. It's just not done! "NC x" is the most popular abbreviation, yes, but it's just that, an abbreviation.</li>
<li>Nearly every state's routes abbreviation has the state name first. Example: "NC x", "WIS x", "M-x", "K-x", "TX-x". Why can't the article have the state name first? Why do you not want it included?</li>
<li>Redirects can be made for Principle 2, so the pipe trick will still work with Principle 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, that's about all I can think of. I can't say that all these apply to all the other states, like your own California, but I know they apply to the Carolinas. Virginia, on the other hand, from what I gather never puts the state name at all. It just uses shields or small white plates to designate routes. All their routes have a shared name... for example "VA 23" would also be "Rich Handerson Highway". However, the state name is present in some legislation. Unless you are from Virginia, you probably wouldn't know this, so I think for the majority of the country's sake, we should still go with Principle 1. Do you understand my reasoning why I now choose Principle 1? I understand why people like Principle 2, but there are so many problems with it and in my opinion; it's just unnatural and conterproductive. Sorry for the long comment. =) --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooday.1_70f1.html" title="User:Gooday.1">TinMan</a> 20:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow, it must have taken a while to reply that much. You raise very good points and I agree with most of them, but I think there's a few things I need to say.</dd>
<dd><i>(note how this is different from principle I, which state that NC must use NC state highway X!).</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Principle 1 does not necessarily make the North Carolina articles "North Carolina State Highway x". The next step of the process will determine what each state chooses to use as a "term". For North Carolina, I plan to vote for "North Carolina Highway x". The word "state" doesn't have to be there, nor really needs to be there. For other states, they could choose not to use a term at all if they wanted, like "Michigan x" or choose some other term like "State Route", "Route", "State Road", etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Everyone calls them cars, but its correct name is automobile, and that should be where its article should be.'</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And that's where you have to decide between what is more important: common name or official name or uniform name. A balance between the three would be nice, but I know that's not always possible. Besides, a major reason "car" is not used is because there are many different types of cars: train cars, road cars (automobiles), etc. "Automobile" works best because it avoids disambiguation. Otherwise you'd have "Car (road)" or "Car (automobile)", etc. I think the same type of 'avoiding' should be used here, but like you said, whether disambig is needed or not in this case is opinion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Why should we settle for the article being at the incorrect (although could be) common name and having a redirect from its official name?</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What makes a name an official name? What the state DOT says? If the correct official name is "State Route xx", then I think adding "California", which is also a proper noun to the front is fine. I think "California Route xx" is common saying for someone outside of California, and I would think at least someone in Cali would say the same. I don't think that is incorrect. Maybe living in a state where that is correct is misguiding my judgement though. Yet, U.S. Routes are titled "U.S. Route xx" (or at least around here "U.S. Highway xx"). Do you know of a place where the "U.S." prefix is not used (that's not too informal)?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>It'd be hard to have one state with routes at both "California Highway 55" and "California The 55" -- hopefully even you'd agree that'd be ugly!</i>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that would be ugly, but I think "The 55" is far too informal; it may be very common, but you wouldn't see road signs reading "The 55" I wouldn't think.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I would like to say more, but I got to go. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooday.1_70f1.html" title="User:Gooday.1">TinMan</a> 12:45, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The new specimen and expanded article is mostly by NGAGAS, a typography student at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_Institute_of_Boston_044a.html" title="The Art Institute of Boston">The Art Institute of Boston</a>, her new specimen is clearer, and shows all alpha characters considerably bigger than the info box format. All biographical abd historical data is in the article, along with a clearer description of classification, and a discussion of physical characteristics. Best, Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a></p>
<p>Hi Atanamir. My student NGAGAS originaly deleted the info box, believing her speciment to be beter. It appeared to have been deleted and I attempted to restore it. By broken image do you mean it does not display? Thanks. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 12:08, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Atanamir. Is the image "250px-Bodonibodoni.jpg" rendering on your screen? I've checked the Bodoni article on a few different machines and that pic still seems to be broken.</dd>
