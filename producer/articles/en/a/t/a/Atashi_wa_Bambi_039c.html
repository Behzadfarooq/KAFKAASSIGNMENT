<p>Atashi wa Bambi (I am Bambi) is a short 3-volume series. The main characters are Mai (female in picture), Sen (dark haired on the right) and Yaezou (blonde on the left).</p>
<p><a name="First_volume:" id="First_volume:"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atashi_wa_Bambi_039c.html" title="Edit section: First volume:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First volume:</span></h2>
<p>The main character, Mai Yoshimura (吉村 麻衣 <i>Yoshimura Mai</i>) just started high school. Upon entering and whilst she is chatting to her friend, she gets hit in the head by a bag held by Sen Ishigan (石垣 泉 <i>Ishigan Sen</i>), a fellow classmate as she later finds out. Annoyed by his comments on her opening speech, she decides she hates him as she walks out of the classroom, again she gets hit on the head, this time with a soccer ball. The person who kicked it, Yaezou Azuma (東 八重蔵 <i>Azuma Yaezō</i>), who turns out to be best friends with Sen, apologizes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Tomo (Mai's best friend) suggests they meet up with junior high friends, which results in Mai denying and snapping off at her. Mai, although she seems shallow, during junior high she was very unpopular. As she used to wear glasses and was heavier as indicated by her previous classmates, whom she ran into during the streets. While she is in a daze, she is hit again on the head by a bag, again carried by Sen. As her old classmates whispering about an attractive guy knowing Mai, she suddenly clings on his arm and claims he is her boyfriend. Sen, though shocked, plays along, until they leave the area, in which he questions her, and Mai leaves.</p>
<p>The next day, Mai makes up with Tomo, her best friend from primary after an initial disagreement the previous day, and at the same time develops a crush on Sen. Yaezou points it out, and Mai denies it, it is then that Yaezou claims that "Sen is mine".</p>
<p>Mai believes him, and the next day avoids Sen and Yaezou, going as far to hide behind a tree. Despite that, she still likes Sen. Finally in class, after Sen being extremely suspicious from Mai continuing glancing at him, making her want to ask him. Outside of class, she asks Yaezou if it is really true and he confirms it, telling her she should give up.</p>
<p>Deciding she shouldn't make too much of a fuss, she continues school normally, until Sen passes her a juice container telling her to throw it away. Upon hearing him say so, she flees the class in anger. Later in PE, she talks to her best friend who questions her. Before she could talk much, the PE teacher rounds on her for slacking off, telling her to pick up the balls. In her anger, she kicks the container holding the balls, and ends up kicking the metal bar, and hurting her foot. Again the PE teacher rounds on her, and this time, Sen defends her. The PE teacher is angry at Sen's remark but after whispering something to him, the PE teacher was persuaded and left.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Sen is about to leave but notices that Mai is still sitting on the ground. Questioning her, she reveals that her leg has a slight problem (a bruise from when she kicked the container), and he wraps the bruise with his handkerchief as she did not have one. Moments later she asks if he is with anyone and he says he doesn't have a girlfriend, triggering her to ask if he has a boyfriend. Sen looks rather blankly at her, and Mai realizes that Yaezou was lying. Upon realizing, she lets go of Sen (she grabbed his collar while she was questioning him) and hobbles/runs off.</p>
<p>She ends up in a classroom, where she slams Yaezou's table much to his surprise and declares that she is not giving up, and mentally decides that Yaesou is her rival.</p>
<p>The next day while chatting to Tomo-chan, she actually blurts out that she is in love with Sen, and from then tries to hang around with Sen more. After hearing some girls ask him out, she miserably realizes that she isn't the only one that likes him. While walking outside, her papers blow away and she rushes to pick them up, and discovers Sen sitting against the wall, where he complains that he's sick of girls. A moment later, Mai asks if she can sit there and Sen agrees as long as she is quiet. Yaezou who is playing a sport, spots them and is surprised. Later in PE, with a teacher who is suddenly nice to her, to the point of annoyance, she storms off and spots girls asking Yaezou to give letters to Sen. Mai irritated, snatches the papers out of Yaezou hands and gives them back to the girls, telling them to not use Yaezou as a letter boy. Upon leaving them she turns upon Yaezou and demands why he let them order him around, which results him asking if it is him that she actually likes, which of course she denies. Annoyed by his other comments, she is about to storm off but he asks if she wants to walk home with him, letting her know that Sen also walks with him, resulting in her staying.</p>
<p>While they are waiting for Sen, Yaezou confesses that he is scared that if he takes one step further, he would lose his friendship with Sen. Mai attempts to cheer him up, saying that they both have to pursue Sen and not give up, in which Yaezou agrees. While this is happening Sen, amusingly, is on his way home.</p>
<p>The next day, after waking up with nightmares of the past, she walks outside and is promptly hit on the head by a ball, Yaezou rushes towards her, and crouches down to speak to her, asking if she remembered the promise from yesterday. Later in class, Mai asks Sen to help her with math in which he agrees, casually starting a conversation. As Sen and Yaezou walk the corridors, two girls go up and ask Sen out, in which he ignores them and walk past, telling Yaezou that they aren't his type, in which Yaezou asks about Mai but Sen did not hear him.</p>
<p>Later Yaezou confesses his problems to Mai, and finishes it off by telling her that she must play fair. At the end of the day, Mai walks into a classroom surprised Sen is still there, as he is waiting for Yaezou. As she leaves, she says that she finds school more enjoyable, because he is there. Sen and Mai then kiss in the classroom, much to Mai's surprise. Yaezou who was waiting outside the classroom, walks away.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atashi_wa_Bambi_039c.html" title="Edit section: Second volume:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second volume:</span></h2>
<p>The second volume begins with a flashback, of Yaezou in Grade One trying to write his name in Kanji. However he doesn't know how to write it as he only just learned hiragana. As he ponders how, another boy raises his hand and declares he is done. The teacher is astonished and remarks "Sen is already done", revealing the boy to be Sen, Yaezou's best friend to be. Later the teacher asks if everyone is done, and then the other boys start to tease Yaeozou, making him cry. Angry, he decides he hates Sen because his name is only one character, while his own is three. During class another day, he is teased again and he retaliates by pushing a boy over. After school, Yaezou hides under a playground and is found by Sen who tells him he should apologize. Yaezou refuses and Sen tells him off, telling him it is his fault he can't write his own name. Upon listening to Sen, Yaezou develops an admiration for Sen and decides that he will apologize to that boy tomorrow and tries harder to write his name.</p>
