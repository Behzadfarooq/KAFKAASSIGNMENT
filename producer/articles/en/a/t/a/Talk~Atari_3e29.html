<p>People keep comenting about this:</p>
<p>The company was originally known as Syzygy? (would somebody stop putting this in this article? This is not true!), referring to the alignment of planets and the sun (as seen several times in the movie 2001). When it was discovered this was in use by a Californian roofing company, the name was changed to a term from the board game Go.</p>
<p><br />
Has anyone got any references to back up this story. At which point we could add it back to the main article...<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_ca82.html" title="User:Alex">Alex</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_6318.html" title="User talk:Alex">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alex_3df3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alex">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>As I understand it, Bushnell initially wanted to name the company 'Syzygy' (sp?) but when he discovered the name was in use he went with 'Atari'. To the best of my knowledge, the company never actually operated under the first name, it was still just an idea at that point. When I get my copy of "Pheonix" out of storage (I recently moved) then I can look this up and be sure. -<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Mazurowski_bdbe.html" title="User:Dan Mazurowski">Dan Mazurowski</a></dd>

<dd>I've heard the "syzygy" story, and it's pretty widespread on the 'Net, but every version I've read is consistent with the above, that Bushnell liked the idea but found another company using the name, so he chose "Atari" instead. We could accurately say something like this: "Bushnell wanted to call the company 'Syzygy,' but when another company turned up by that name, settled on 'Atari' instead." If it's even worth mentioning. Personally, I'm just happy that we've built a reasonably complete history of the tangled family of companies. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Farquhar_5f96.html" title="User:Dave Farquhar">Dave Farquhar</a> 03:51, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, found the info on the origin of the Atari name. Bushnell and his partner Ted Dabney did indeed choose the name Syzygy, but then found it was already in use. They then considered using their initials, but found those were already in use as well (B&amp;D for Black &amp; Decker, D&amp;B for Dunn &amp; Bradstreet). So Nolan wrote down three words from his favorite game, Go. They were "Hanne", "Sente", and "Atari". He took this list with him to the California Secretary of State office, and asked somebody at the office which they liked best. Atari was chosen. This account is from Leonard Herman's book, <i>Pheonix</i>. -<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Mazurowski_bdbe.html" title="User:Dan Mazurowski">Dan Mazurowski</a></dd>

<dd>I have heard of the syzygy story and I believe it, but I believe it was never incorporated as that name.

<dd>The Expo has existed since 1997, but otherwise it's a valid statement. I reworked it.

<p>About the name; I've heard atari is a descriptive term to some situation in the famous board game Go.

<p>IMHO the article should be split into two: one for the original Bushnell/Time Warner/Tramiel Atari, and one for the GT Interactive/Infogrames Atari. They are two completely different companies that just share the name. This would solve many controversies, such as the founding year in the infobox: it is 1972 (the Bushnell year) or 1993 (the GT Interactive year). - <a href="../../../t/j/a/User%7ETjansen_647e.html" title="User:Tjansen">tjansen</a></p>
<p>You can further split Atari in that Atari Home Computers was split off from the company named Atari that did coin-op, Atari Games. (Unclear if it was a division or a completely different company.) You had two Atari's sharing the same name. Perhaps a disambiguity with an explanation is called for? - <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmccorm_a6b0.html" title="User:Jmccorm">jmccorm</a></p>

<p><br />
Its not Time Warner, just Warner. Time Warner wasn't until the late 1980's.</p>
<p>The new Atari Inc. is a seperate company now of which Infogrames is a major shareholder. The founding of Atari Inc. is not tied to GT Interactive/Infogrames, and should not be promoted seperately. Just changed some of the info to relfect this, but that part of the first passage (which is not editable) should be taken out.</p>
<p>Likewise it is not a completely different company from the Warner Atari Inc. as you are saying, any more than Atari Corp. was - they own all the same properties.</p>
<p><br />
Thirdly, Atari Home Computers was not split off. Atari Consumer (which included Atari Home Computers and the console division) was what was split off and sold to Tramiel to form Atari Corp. Atari Consumer was started back around '75 when they decided to go in to home consoles.</p>
<p>Atari Games was a completely different company, they were not two companies sharing the same name. What they did share was the fuji logo and the stylized representation of the word Atari. When Atari Consumer was sold, Warner split the rights to the logo, allowing Atari Corp. to use the original representation. Warner put the coin-op holdings under a newly created Atari Games division, which would share the logo but have to put the word Games with it. That company was taken over by Namco the next year and then directly by the employees after that. Because of some deals with Atari Corp. and a "friendship agreement" with Atari Corp. occured, and by the time Time-Warner Interactive was formed and eventually took over Atari Games, the rights to the logo were turned completely to Atari Corp. When WMS/Midway bought TWI and reinstated Atari Games, they had to license the logo. Once Hasbro obtained the Atari Corp. properties, Midway stopped licensing it and renamed the division to Midway Games West.</p>

<p>I believe most of this is duped info, but there was a New Article I made a redirect to here.</p>
<p>Atari Corporation is referred to the Atari company that existed from 1984 to 1996 and dealing with the consumer business (home consoles and videogames) as opposed to the Atari Games company who was developping arcade games.</p>
<p>When Commodre founder Jack Tramiel bought Atari Inc from Warner Communications in 1984, he only acquired the home computer and consoles divions of the company and had absolutely no interest in the arcade coin-op industry. As a result two independant Atari companies derived from the ex-Atari Inc, those companies being Atari Games who would stay at the hands of Warner Communications and exclusively be in charge with the development of Atari arcade games and the other company being Atari Corporation would deal with home console and computers. Like it was the case with Atari Games, Atari Corporation kept the same employees and staff that were before at Atari Inc. To the popular opinion Atari Corporation is considered as the original Atari Inc while Atari Games is simly considered as a brand new entity created from a spinoff. This perception can be attributed to a few reasons.</p>
<p>1)Atari Corp kept the Sunnyvale, California headquarters of the old Atari while Atari Games and its employees had to relocate in nearby Millipitas, California.</p>
<p>2)Atari Corporation only used the "Atari" label on the market while Atari Games had to use their full name "Atari Games" as a label.</p>
<p>3)Atari Corporation kept more employees from Atari Inc then Atari Games did since they retained two divisions out of three from the old Atari.</p>
<p>4)Because it was the arcade coin-op division and not the consumer side that was rejected by Tramiel, Atari Corporation is seen as the continuity of Atari Inc.</p>
<p>However many fans of the Atari arcade games do not agree and states that Atari Games is indeed the original Atari because when Atari was founded in 1972, it started as a arcade game developer, not an computer or console manufacturer.</p>
<p>Neither Atari Corp or Atari Games are alive today as both companies were shut down by their respective parent company. In the case of Atari Corp, they were closed when they were merged with San Jose hard-disk company. JTS immediately ceassed production of all Atari hardwares and sent most employees home with pink slip, keeping only 3 employees from Atari Corporation would now be engaged in JTS activities instead of Atari's. The Atari name still live on today as the branch was acquired by French company Infogrammes.</p>
<p>Atari Corporation was responsible for developping the Atari 7800, the Jaguar and the Lynx. Trammiel was known for its rationalisation practices and desire of saving costs by regurarily firing employees that did not met the company's expectations. Most employees who were fired at Atari Corporation were let go at the time when the company was still under ownership of Tramiel, not JTS. To the eyes of some Atari fans, Tramiel is responsible for the demise of Atari Corporation.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Regarding point number 3 above, the notion that Atari Corp. retained a large number of employees from Atari Inc. is misleading. While Atari Corp. may have indeed inherited a great many employees from Atari Inc., nearly all of them were summarily dismissed shortly after the sale, many arriving at work to find their desks already cleared out and their things boxed and ready for them to carry away.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should also be pointed out that Jack Tramiel did not have any more interest in game consoles than he had in arcade games. His purchase of Atari assets was actually because his company (Tramiel Technologies) needed a factory and distribution assets for the new computer they were developing (which eventually became the Atari ST). But to acquire these assets (which were as much a part of Atari's game console business as they were part of the computer business) he was forced to accept the extra baggage of the home video game business.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One final point - the 7800 was NOT developed by Atari Corp. It was designed for Atari Inc. by a company called GCC (they also developed the first 10 game cartridges, as well as a few accessories that were never released). The 7800 was launched ("test marketed") in California a month before Jack Tramiel's purchase led to the withdrawal of the unit from the market. Atari Corp. also did not develop the Lynx, this platform was developed by Epyx and purchased by Atari. As for the Jaguar, that was actually designed by a company called Flare Technology, though in that case Atari did at least fund the R&amp;D work. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Mazurowski_bdbe.html" title="User:Dan Mazurowski">Sir Smedley</a> 23:03, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Forgot to mention the Atari/Sega lawsuit that was settled Sept 28, 1994. Sega got to use Atari's patents but had to pay $50 million for past royalties. Sega had to buy 4.7 million shares of Atari stock for $40 million. Sega and Atari cross-licensed 5 games a year, except Sonic games. Maybe there should be a separate section just for lawsuits?&#160;:D <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 15:54, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I forget the exact details off hand, but the deal actually had some other conditions that made it utterly useless for Atari to capitalize on the cross-licensing deal (which is why no Sega games ever got licensed). I believe one of the conditions had something to do with waiting a certain period of time after the game had been released by Sega on their own home consoles. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 66.91.253.37 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.91.253.37_bd4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.91.253.37">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Can someone supply a better photo of a 2600 than that one taken against the orange tiles? Okay; it could do with some cropping and the removal of the wires.... but that's Photoshoppable. What I really don't get is the (totally irrelevant) Rio MP3 player sat on top of it. Why?!!</p>

<dl>
<dd>The Rio isn't totally irrelevant. The cartridge inserted into the 2600 is a 'Cuttle Cart', a fan developed unit that allows you to load games via an audio connection. This is the same method employed by the Supercharger back in the day - you put the Supercharger cartridge into the 2600, then plug in a cassette player and load games into the cartridge from audio tapes. The problem is that there is no mention of either the Cuttle Cart or the Supercharger anywhere in the article, so only game historians or 2600 fanatics know why it's there. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Mazurowski_bdbe.html" title="User:Dan Mazurowski">Sir Smedley</a> 23:09, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The list of 'current' Atari games is beginning to show signs of getting long and 'completist'. It's still okay, but it's growing fast. Perhaps we could have a separate "complete" list article and include a shorter list of the most notable titles here?</p>
<p>As these things get longer, I think that they can make the article look padded out, (can) make it harder to navigate and (can) slow the page load down. We're not at that stage *yet*, but it's worth considering.</p>
<p>If we went with a separate list article, what should it be called, and what should it contain? "Current" Atari games will date; "Infogrames" Atari games might not. Any thoughts?</p>

<li>What would a complete games list provide that <a href="../../../a/t/a/Category%7EAtari_games_5439.html" title="Category:Atari games">Category:Atari games</a> doesn't?

<p>The photo which claims to show an early version of the Atari video game system is completely wrong. This is actually a picture of a later "cheaper" system they came out with later (prior to coming out with the really really cheap models they came out with prior to ceasing production altogether). All the the early models have 6 toggle buttons on the front panel and not 4 (which is a dead give away this is a not even close to be an early model). These 4 button toggle models are also much lighter in weight wereas the early models were very heavy.</p>
