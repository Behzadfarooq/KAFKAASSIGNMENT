<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atavus.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Atavus race are the progenitors of the Taelons and Jaridians. It is generally believed that the Season 5-type evolved first, was subsequently altered by the <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimera.html" title="Kimera">Kimera</a> to become the Season 4-type, and then underwent a biological split to become the Season 2-type and the Jaridians, though it should be noted that this is purely speculation that happens to fit the myriad facts as presented by the series.</p>
<p>The Energy Vampire Atavus, who use the term as a proper name for their species, use inter-dimensional travel to move between stars. At one stage, a rebellious faction established an isolated colony on Earth.</p>
<p>The Atavus species as a whole encountered the Kimera at some point 8 to 10 million years prior to the events of the series. The Kimera allegedly altered the Atavus, transforming most of them into the Season 4-type, though the colony on Earth remained unaffected. The colony on Earth may have been cut off from the rest of the species or due to the method used to create the Season 4-type it may have been different. See <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atavus.html#Notes" title="Atavus">Notes</a>.</p>
<p>The Atavus colony on Earth was forced underground by asteroids three million years prior to the series, where they lay dormant in stasis chambers until they are resurrected when Liam Kincaid (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Leeshock_ee24.html" title="Robert Leeshock">Robert Leeshock</a>) joins the <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taelon.html" title="Taelon">Taelon</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaridian.html" title="Jaridian">Jaridian</a> species together.</p>

<p>The Season 5-type Atavus race appear as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanoids.html" title="Humanoids">Humanoids</a>. However, they have one major distinction; laser-like claws that protrude out of their fingers. These are used to drain the life force of sentient creatures. This is their method of feeding. The 5th season Atavus, unlike their Taelon counterparts, appear to be more transparently <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a>, and are highly sexual. Another distinguishing characteristic is the presence of slight ridges on their foreheads, which resemble a more pronounced version of the contours on Taelon heads.</p>

A Season 2 Atavus</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The season 4-type Atavus contains elements of both Jaridian and Taelon physiology, resembling a physical cross of a Taelon wearing his facade, and a Jaridian. They are seen only briefly, but possess the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaqarava.html" title="Shaqarava">shaqarava</a>, which they can use to channel energy into destructive blasts.</p>
<p>The season 2-type atavus do not closely resemble any of the other species beyond being humanoid in appearance. They also possess the shaqarava and can use it to send out offensive energy blasts or to drain the life force from a victim. These Atavus appear to be quite athletic. These Atavus arise when a Taelon's connection to the <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taelon_Commonality_e323.html" title="Taelon Commonality">Commonality</a>, their group sentience, is severed.</p>

<p>Additionally, the season 5-type Atavus used their technology to turn some humans into Atavus/Human hybrids. While these hybrids looked human, they possesed much of the strength and speed of the Atavus, as well as the energy claws and the need to feed on Human life force.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atavus.html" title="Edit section: Social Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social Structure</span></h2>
<p>The Atavus group resurrected on Earth is led by an individual named "Howlyn". His mate is known as "Juda". The Atavus leaders seem to acquire their position based on physical strength and prowess in individual combat with other Atavus. There also appears to be a type of hereditary nobility at work within the culture of this type of Atavus, which is responsible for some of their machinations and maneuvering.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atavus.html" title="Edit section: Notes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notes</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, the season-5 Atavus bear a vague resemblance to a Taelon mythological figure dubbed "the sleeper", who appears in renderings of ancient Taelon texts in the first season. It is unknown whether this is intentional on the part of the writers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The season-5 atavus were originally planned to possess the shaqarava. This idea was apparently dropped due to the expense of the required special effects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'Atavus' is used by <a href="../../../z/o/27/Zo%27or.html" title="Zo'or">Zo'or</a> as a label for the creature that his brethren devolve into when totally separated from the commonality. Only the season-5 Atavus use the word as a proper name for their species.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is interesting that <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rho%27ha.html" title="Rho'ha">Rho'ha</a> does not devolve into any of the known varieties of Atavus despite falling out of communion with the Taelon Commonality. Many in the fan community believe he may have retained a partial link with the Taelons, or that his psychic link with Captain Johnson allows him to remain largely Taelon. Rho'ha does nevertheless take on those aspects of speed and mindless aggression that characterised the season-5 'Energy Vampire' Atavus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The season 4-type Atavus is created when Da'an and a Jaridian temporarily merge the way they should have existed. It is possible that since both races had evolved this is an evolved form of the earlier Atavus. Another possibility is the Atavus on Earth had been cut off from the rest of the race for so long they took different evolutionary paths since they did not seem to know of either the Jaridians or the Taelons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Atavus of Season 5 presents several inconsistencies within the series. One is the use of inter-dimensional drive, which had been previously stated to have been developed by the Taelons and is one of their few advantages against the Jaridians. If the technology was developed before the split then the question remains why the Jaridians lack it. It is possible the Atavus developed it on their own without contact with the Taelons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Earth Atavus also use biotechnology that is more primitive than the Taelons. It is unknown if this, or the more crystalline-based technologies used by the Jaridians was originally used by the species.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A number of biological inconsistencies are also presented. At first it is strongly implied that as long as the Atavus of Season 5 has a constant supply of food they are immortal. Later, they became more susceptible to injury such as destruction of their hearts due to changes in human physiology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A major inconsistency involves Howlyn's son. His son and former mate refuse to feed on humans stating that on their homeworld they did not need to feed. It is unknown if on their homeworld their was an alternative food source or some other environmental factor. One possibility could be the energy Taelons evolved as the Atavus went into space and whatever factor could not be replicated by their technology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the series, they set out for the Atavus homeworld. However after millions of years of evolution, time and warfare it is highly unlikely their homeworld even exists since several have been mentioned, but destroyed due to the war between the Taelons and Jaridians. Also, whatever prevents them from feeding might no longer exist due to simple changes over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Alternative_explanation_of_different_Atavus" id="Alternative_explanation_of_different_Atavus"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atavus.html" title="Edit section: Alternative explanation of different Atavus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternative explanation of different Atavus</span></h2>
<p>Each of the appearances of the atavus represents a different variant of the species, the season 5 variant is the original species that left their homeworld (and caused all the problems in doing so due to lack of food source. The branch that became the Taelon/Jaridian ancestors were helped by Hag'el by giving them the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaqarava.html" title="Shaqarava">shaqarava</a>, while Howlyn's branch travelled to Earth and began feasting on the species who were alive back then (including <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominidae.html" title="Hominidae">hominid</a> ancestors of humanity).</p>
<p>One consequence of the gift of the shaqarava seems to be that the Atavus has a limited life span, whether this is the same on their homeworld is unclear, but the unaffected variety on Earth are exceptionally long lived if possessing a food source. As a result an immortality cult appeared, it is unclear as to whether the process which created the separation between the Taelon and Jaridian species was a process where one Atavus became a proto-Taelon and a proto-Jaridian, or whether two Atavus came together in some form of ceremony that left one as a proto-Taelon and the other as a proto-Jaridian.</p>
<p>The fact that the rejoining of the species produces one Atavus from a Taelon and a Jaridian suggests that Taelons and Jaridians represent two different <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divergent_evolution.html" title="Divergent evolution">divergent</a> species stemming from the Atavus race, which seems in keeping with the idea that neither can survive without the other because they are incomplete.</p>
<p>While the final lifespans of the Jaridians and Taelons are around 20 years and 4-5000 years respectively, it is likely that the Jaridians lived to a much longer age in the past since they have a large population and their fertility/early death problems would have prevented them from creating such a large empire, so presumably the reductions in lifespans of both species has occurred over the 8 million years since the split.</p>
<p>The final (and first seen) variant of the Atavus is that shown when Da'an is separated from the Commonality, which presumably shows how the Taelons were after the split from the Atavus species, but before the Commonality was formed. Whether they were as brutal as Da'an is in his atavistic state is debatable since they would have learned to control their impulses as they grew, while Da’an depended on the Commonality for the mental discipline that restrains the more primitive nature that he still possesses.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the Commonality was developed with the intention of suppressing violence, but the first 'true' Taelon Ra'jel does not appear to possess any <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaqarava.html" title="Shaqarava">shaqarava</a>, so it may be that prior to the formation of the Commonality the shaqarava had already become a vestigial organ, or that those proto-Taelons who formed the Commonality had ceased using it (and Ra'jel as one of these kept this ethos), eventually then it would have become vestigial, unless awakened by either human DNA or separation from the Commonality.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Jaridians never gave up their shaqarava, and continued on as a very passionate people.</p>
<p>It seems that by the time of the events of the series both species represent two very distinct principles, the Jaridians represent passion, while the Taelons represent reason, which is represented by the way in which they die, the Jaridians in fire and the Taelons running out of energy becoming cold and lifeless. Given that humans contain both natures, similar to the pre-separation Atavus, indicates why humanity is of interest to the Taelons, more so than other species and why Ma'el was so influenced by coming to Earth (although the episode "Dimensons" suggests that he was already a wise and enlightened Taelon before coming to Earth).</p>
