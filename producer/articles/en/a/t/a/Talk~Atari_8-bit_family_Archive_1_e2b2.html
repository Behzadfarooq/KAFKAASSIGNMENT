<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit summary re XL models</span></h2>
<p>Forgot to add summary of my edit. The 1200XL did not have a built-in BASIC like the subsequently released 600XL and 800XL did, so I deleted the reference to a buggy BASIC as being a problem of the 1200XL. However, the 1200XL did feature a new OS which was different enough from the OS of the 400/800 such that many programs (mostly games as I recall) were not compatible. To address the problem, Atari released an OS patch called "The Translator", which loaded what was essentially the same OS as the 400/800. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%26target%3D4.7.239.195_9927.html" title="Special:Contributions&amp;target=4.7.239.195">4.7.239.195</a> 28 January 2004</p>
<dl>
<dd>The translator disk loaded the older OS ver.B or OS ver.A on the XL/XE computers. Atari only released it on disk, no cassette version was planned or released. The problem with compatiblity was too many illegal calls and jumps were made by the offending programs. Alas, some of Atari's programs did that as well. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 03:55, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paged 128K memory card for the 800</span></h2>
<p>At least one company (can't recall the name) created a 128 kB memory card for the 800. It paged eight 16 kB pages into one slot's address space using a control register in the I/O space. We used this at NASA to create a proof of concept general aviation cockpit instrumentation suite; the displays could switch in 1/60th of a second, since the Antic display lists were within the paged memory.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">800XL expansion</span></h2>
<p>The article does not mention anything about the expansions of the 800XL. I have two Atari 800XLs sitting here. They can be expanded with an MIO (essentially a Active RAM drive that plugs into the wall socket and stays powered). The MIO allows you to boot from memory and even load games and software onto it. I could have my Atari booted and running a game before my screen warmed up. The MIO expanded the RS232 port so that you could hook up to 3 floppy drives stacked, a modem and a printer to it. A guy at HACE Atari computer club in Houston, Texas ran a BBS off of his Atari for YEARS on end. I have the BBS software for it as well, but I never ran it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The second generation: XL series</span></h2>
<p>Atari addressed the 1200XL's problems in the hastily-completed 600XL and 800XL, which were largely identical to the original Sweet 16 specifications. These machines also had Atari BASIC built into the ROM of the computer. By the time the new machines replaced it the Commodore 64 had already become the market leader, and Atari was unable to address this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 600XL and 800XL were NOT hastily completed. They were planned all along because the 1200XL was too expensive to build. The 600XL and 800XL were part of the family of Atari computers that also included the 1400XL and the 1450XLD. The problem was when Atari moved production overseas, manufacturing problems and delays left them with far fewer stock than they wanted for the all important Christmas season. A lot of companies (TI, Coleco) had production problems too. Commodore, however had plenty of computers on store shelves. THAT'S how Commodore jumped ahead of the others. I'm getting sick of the revisionist history that people constantly spew out again and again... This section needs a rewrite to fix facts and to get rid of the POV slant. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 19:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand how you could consider this to be POV, I'm not exactly who's POV you think it could be -- the C64 really was cheaper than the Atari machines, at least in every store I went to see them in (and as a teenage nerd, that was "a lot"). Likewise the market really was being dragged by Commodore, they were always the first to lower the prices during the "war".</dd>
<dd>Secondly the history is rather suspect. There was a very distinct delay between the introduction of the 1200 and the 600/800/14xx. I have all the promotional materials (although I may have chucked them recently when I moved), there's the 1200 batch, and then the "other" batch. I distinctly remember the 1200 arriving early in the year, and the 600/800 in the winter - by which time the season is over.</dd>
<dd>Finally the 1200 was a single-board machine (IIRC), like the later 600 and 800. As far as I can tell the only real differences were the keyboard and the cases.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I was too hasty when I used the word "hasty", but I believe the historical record is extremely clear: the 600/800 were introduced in order to replace the 1200, which is not only what it did, but what they said it was supposed to do. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 22:32, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's what I said, the 600XL and 800XL were to replace the 1200XL. They were not hastily completed, actually they were behind schedule. Atari moved engr. resources from the 1400XL and 1450XLD to the 600XL/800XL. I remember because I phoned Atari about the availability of the 1400XL and 1450XLD and their response was always "delayed, don't know when...". Atari moved their production over from domestic factories to overseas. This caused numerous problems that took valuable time and engineering resources. That's what burned Atari during X-mas. Also, Tramiel cut deals direct with retailers, bypassing the computer store owners (and infuriating them) to stock C64 computers. That's why you saw C64 on store shelves. I was there too, pal.</dd>
<dd>The 600XL/800XL did NOT come out "early" 1983. The 800XL <i>barely</i> made it in Christmas in 1983! No 1400XL or 1450XLD at all. A far cry from the 600/800XL in mid 83, 1400/1450XLD in late 83 as Atari advertised! And forget the 1050 drive, that was nowhere to be found&#160;:D</dd>
<dd>The 1200XL was a single-board machine, but with tons of parts. It was built in the US. Meaning "Expensive". The 600XL and 800XL were built overseas. Fewer parts, cheaper keyboard. Meaning "cheaper". Get it?</dd>
<dd>The price war was over-rated. How come Apple and IBM didn't get burned?(HINT: they didn't burn their bridges with computer store owners). The real reason was the market was OVERSATURATED. Too many brands of computers, not enought buyers. Remember Spectravideo? How about Osborne? Or MSX? The price war would have happened eventually. Tramiel started it to get at TI, but it snowballed and the rest is history. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 20:09, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Apple and IBM didn't get burned because they didn't sell into the same market. They sold primarily to business and scientific users, who were primarily interested in their expansion capabilities. It was only those competing with the C46 in the home computer market that got burned.</dd>
<dd>As to the dates, you are correct, I have backed them all off by one year by mistake. Fixing...
<dl>
<dd>Apple and IBM had their dealer network and markets. IBM had $$$$$ to spare. The price war really opened IBM's and Apple's markets even further, because companies starting making PC clones and Apple clones instead.

<dd>Re: "Not enough buyers". At the time of the price war, sales were booming. Even TI's sales were booming; the problem was that they lost money on each sale. Apple preferred to cede market share and maintain their prices, which they could do because they were an established standard.

<dd>With TI, you're right, they were losing money on each machine. It was their tactic of taking a profit loss in exchange for market share.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Memory interleaving</span></h2>
<p>Is the middle of this article <b>really</b> the right place to launch into a highly technical discussion of memory interleaving? And why would one possible compare it to the BBC, or a submarine?!?

<dd>He said the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Microcomputer_ec27.html" title="BBC Microcomputer">BBC *micro*</a>; that's a more valid comparison than a submarine. Whether the interleaving stuff should be there is another question. *I* found it interesting, but this article is specifically about the Atari 8-bits, so... I personally feel that you can't include everything. If the technique is worthy of in-depth description, it should have its own article (if it doesn't already; please check thoroughly first).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My vote; note the interleaving technique (or lack of it) in the Atari, and provide a link to a more detailed article. You may wish to use the information in the new article (if creating). Please remember to note its origins if this is decided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can't include every detail without making the page too unwieldy for a general audience. Good organisation helps, but there comes a time when information has to be separated out, made more concise, or simply removed. I think the "software only" modes section (although of interest to me) is starting to exhibit signs of this bloat. It's great, but.... this isn't a "complete Atari tech manual".</dd>

<dd>The 6520 PIA was designed with 2 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports. The Atari allow some access to control the 6520 PIA. The PIA was specifically designed to control peripheral devices through its I/O ports (in the Atari, joystick ports). People found uses for it such as a inexpensive printer port connection, robotics control, home security system control, etc. And NO, you could not modulate the monitor port as it was a analog output only. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 07:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early Machines: the 400 and 800</span></h2>
<p>As consumers discovered that the two machines were largely identical, they generally bought the lower-priced 400. All of these problems conspired to force developers to essentially ignore the features of the 800, and develop for the 400 as their target. Expansion cards were already rare, but cartridges for the second slot in the 800 were just as rare.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey Maury, how could developers focus on the 400 when the majority of software came on floppy?? As for the second cartridge port, I already explained that it became technically obsolete and was dropped (16kB and larger cartridges came out). <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 16:17, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Focussing on the 400 essentially consisted of ignoring those features that existed on the 800 alone. Perhaps I should re-word it that way?</dd>
<dd>The 16k cart was another issue entirely, it required bank switching which means only certain portions of the memory were available at any time. This simply is not as good as having a single, real, 16k cartridge slot. Had Atari done that instead -- which they could have easily -- then Atari BASIC would have been MS (a good thing) for instance, and even early games and other carts could be, well, better. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 16:43, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Atari 16kB carts were NOT bank switched, they were 16kB ROMs. The cartridge slot is just a electrical connection, it wasn't limited to 8kB. Where did you get the idea that the cart slot was limited to 8kB??? Go read Mapping the Atari. OSS had 16kB bank switched carts. Later, the 32kB and larger carts were bank switched. MS BASIC didn't have nearly enough commands that supported the Atari's features and it consumed too much memory. Memory was very EXPENSIVE in the early days. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 19:57, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>The cartridge slot is just a electrical connection, it wasn't limited to 8kB. Where did you get the idea that the cart slot was limited to 8kB???'</i></dd>
<dd>Duh, from the <a href="http://pinouts.ru/data/AtariCartridge_pinout.shtml" class="external text" title="http://pinouts.ru/data/AtariCartridge_pinout.shtml" rel="nofollow">pinout diagram</a>. Notice there are 13 address lines, A0 through A12... 2<sup><small>13</small></sup> = 8096. Yes, it is "just an electrical connection" as you put it, one with enough pins to support 8k. Each of the carts was mapped into a different 8k block, 40959-&gt;49151 for the left cart, 32767-&gt;40958 for the right. As to why you think Mapping the Atari supports your argument, I can't fathom. <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/v8n4/mappingatari.html" class="external text" title="http://www.atarimagazines.com/v8n4/mappingatari.html" rel="nofollow">This review</a> of the book has a nice ascii chart of the map, and if you look for the words "right cartridge" and "left cartridge" you will note they are mapped into separate 8k blocks, exactly what I have been saying all along.
<dl>
<dd>What Atari and everyone else found out was they could map 16kB directly from just the left cartridge slot. That made the right cart slot obsolete. Gee, on page 103 of <i>Mapping the Atari</i>, it says "It is possible to have 16K cartridges on the Atari by either combining both slots using two 8K cartridges or simply having one with large enough ROM chips and using one slot. In this case, the entire area from 32768 to 49151 ($8000 to $BFFF) would be used as cartridge ROM." And I thought this was self-explanatory. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 21:04, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As to Atari BASIC, having spoken to the author personally, I can say with no hesitation whatsoever that what you claim above is just plain wrong. The authors attempted to use MS 8k BASIC, but when MS supplied it to them it was 12k long (a side effect of the 6502s lower code density) and almost completely undocumented. After trying to get it running for some time they gave up, <i>because they couldn't get it to fit onto an 8k cartridge</i> (direct quote). It was not, as you claim, because it didn't have enough commands (which are trivial to add to BASIC, having done so personally), or because of the ROM costs. It was, very simply, because carts were 8k only.
<dl>
<dd>No your just misquoting me. What I said was MS BASIC wasn't popular because one of those reasons was it didn't have a lot of commands that supported Atari's graphics and sounds. No Player/Missile commands, no scrolling, etc. BASIC XL and other programs did. BASIC XL outsold MS BASIC. The buyers decided. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 21:04, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You go on to say "OSS had 16kB bank switched carts", as if this invalidates what I am saying. You <b>do</b> understand the meaning of the term "bank switching", right? It means that the 16k of code is switched in and out of the 8k space, making it appear as an 8k cart (which is all you can have) at any one time.
<dl>
<dd>Atari didn't used bank selection in their 16kB carts because they didn't need it. OSS used bank-selection because their programs were languages and they wanted to save memory for programming. Their carts had additional chips (74LS175, 74LS02, 74LS00) which acted like a 4-bit register to track which bank to use. What's the big deal? <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 21:04, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly I'm equally at a loss as to how you can claim <i>Atari 16kB carts were NOT bank switched</i> and then only a few lines later state <i>OSS had 16kB bank switched carts</i>, thereby invalidating your own statement. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 19:36, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I meant to say 16kB carts from Atari Corp. were not bank selected. I used OSS as an example of a company that did use bank selection in their 16kB carts. If it came across that I implied that ALL Atari 16kB carts weren't bank selected, oops for that. So Maury, why don't you just show me, with EVIDENCE, how Atari Corp bank switch their 16kB carts.

<p>CARTRIDGES A AND B</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two 8K regions reserved for plug-in cartridges. Cartridge B, that is the right-hand cartridge slot found only in the ATARI 800 Home Computer, has been allocated memory addresses 8000 through 9FFF. Cartridge A (the left-hand cartridge slot in the ATARI 800 Computer console, and the only slot in the ATARI 400 Computer console) has been allocated memory addresses A000 through BFFF and <i><b>optionally 8000 through BFFF, for 16K cartridges</b></i>. If a RAM module is plugged into the last slot such as to overlay any of these addresses, the RAM takes precedence as long as a cartridge is not inserted. However, if a cartridge is inserted, it will disable the entire conflicting RAM module in the last slot in 8K increments.</p>

<dd>You failed to quote the very next section. It reads...</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Most cartridges consist of two ROM chips on a single circuit board. Moreover, both chip sockets have identical pin assignments. In other words, the chips can be switched to opposite sockets and the cartridge will still work. The difference is in the chips themselves. On one chip, the A12 pin acts as an active-low chip select. On the other the A12 pin acts as an active-high chip select. Therefore the state of the A12 pin selects between the two chips.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>What do you call it when a pin is used to select between two banks of memory? Bank switching. Is this evidence enough to answer your question posted at the end of the last section?

<dd><i>The 6502 performs input/output operations by addressing the external support chips as memory; some chip registers are read/write while others are read-only or write-only (the Atari Home Computer Hardware Manual gives descriptions of all of the external registers).

<p>Here are some documentation about cartridge types, taken from Atari 800win Help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type 1: Standard 8 KB cartridge: Standard 8 KB cartridge, that occupies 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. Type 2: Standard 16 KB cartridge: Standard 16 KB cartridge, that occupies 16 KB of address space between $8000 and $BFFF. Type 3: OSS '034M' 16 KB cartridge: There are two types of OSS cartridges. Both are 16 KB and occupy 8 KB of address space between $A000 and $BFFF. The cartridge memory is divided into 4 banks, 4 KB each. One bank ('main') is always mapped to $B000-$BFFF. The other 3 banks are mapped to $A000-$AFFF. The current bank is selected by accessing a byte in $D500-$D5FF. Only 4 lowest bits of address are significant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know how it's achieved electronically. But from programmers' perspective, 16K cartridges between $8000-$BFFF _did_ exist. They were not "bank-switching" because both 8K parts were permanently mapped in. Usage of the address lines for this purpose is beyond my knowledge though. --Cyco130 01:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough, but I am going to re-org again. As it stands the benefits and drawbacks of the 1200 are spread across four paras, one only two sentances long.</dd>
<dd>But frankly I disagree about your comment on the price war. In the last version it took up only two paragraphs, and yet is the single overriding reason for what was going on in the market. What, you think Atari lowered the price of the 400 to $79 (a loss on every sale) because they WANTED to cut the profit margins? Without mentioning what was going on -- and note that other articles on machines of the era generally comment on it as well -- you end up with a history that reads like Atari was just introducing a bunch of new machines "just because". That is not the case. As you noted, the reason Atari did so poorly in Chrismas '83 was supply, but without mentioning the market we have no idea WHY Atari ran into these problems. It's like studying biology without evolution, just facts with no narative.
<dl>
<dd>I reverted back to the previous version by Maury. I feel the 1200XL section is too large, needs to be trimmed to the essentials. Don't speculate, just stick to facts. The 1200XL is in the same family as the other XLs, so it should not be grouped separately. Finally, details of Sweet 16 should go on a different page, since the 1000 and 1000X were never built. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 03:37, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">a paragraph on the 6502</span></h2>
<p>It states "the GTIA had just enough time to read out a line before the processor wanted access again." This is not true, all bus access by ANTIC/GTIA is done when the CPU is halted. Commodore and Apple computers fetched video data and did refresh during the unused portion of the cycle but Atari didn't. Otherwise they wouldn't have been able to get away with using 200ns DRAM. --DamageX</p>

<dd>That's right. Atari ran the CPU at 1.79Mhz and used cycle-stealing DMA. The Apple II ran the 6502 at 1Mhz and used transparent DMA. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 20:32, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original Atari 400/800 announcement</span></h2>
<p>"The machines were announced in December 1978 as the 400 and 800, "</p>
<p>Everyone everywhere states this, or Nov. 78, or Oct. '78, or Fall 1978, but where is a copy of this announcement? I'd really like to know!</p>
<p>I accept that the machines were introduced at the January 1979 CES. Anyone know the dates in January of that CES?</p>
<p>If no one can turn up a public announcemnt from 1978, it seems that the proper date of public announcement of the 400/800 may actually be January 1979, at the CES.</p>
