<dl>
<dd>I was concerned about this when <a href="../../../n/g/a/User_talk%7ENGAGAS_c40e.html" title="User talk:NGAGAS">User talk:NGAGAS</a> replaced most of the content of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodoni.html" title="Bodoni">Bodoni</a>, including swapping the infobox for a broken image uploaded without copyright status without consulting anyone or leaving any message on the article talk page. I rebuilt the article a few hours later and restored the Bodoni info box.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Examine the edit histories and you'll see I haven't replaced any of the infoboxes—all have been removed by other users. No agreement was made anywhere that the infoboxes could be deleted without consultation.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">User:GearedBull</a> objected to my restorative edit of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodoni.html" title="Bodoni">Bodoni</a>, rewrote the article again, took the infobox out again, and put the broken image back in. I've avoided trying to persuade <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> because he and his students who are replacing the infoboxes with new font samples are all a bit new to WP and perhaps a bit naive.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I also recognize that the technical and aesthetic quality of the samples from <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">User:GearedBull</a> surpass those used in the infoboxes and are almost as informative. They definitely add value to the font articles and help make a better encyclopedia. By comparison the samples used in the font infoboxes have aesthetic shortcomings and their only advantage is the <b>Show all characters</b> link to the full character sets.</dd>

<dd>The samples added by Geared Bull's students (not the same quality as his) are visually nicer but aren't as informative as the infoboxes.</dd>

<p>Hi Atanamir. Please consider allowing the illustrations to be just that: an illustration of a typeface, without the added visual noise of competing vertical lines and horizontal lines. The caption provides quick, succinct, easy to to find info about the <b>typeface designer,</b> the <b>foundry,</b> <b>when designed,</b> and when it was <b>released</b> which is an important piece of history quite different from when it was drawn/designed. Quite often they are not the same year.</p>
<p>I <b>do</b> understand the desire for continuity, for a sort of system. I have worked on the design of several type specimen books, one with three volumes and nearly 3,000 pages. I give very great thought to how he letters are seen online, and I am trying to create a small visual environment where hey can be seen, even on a smaller laptop monitor, and not be overwhelmed. Please consider that placing them in the infobox makes them smaller and surrounds them with some noisy competing information. Please also consider I have received many notes praising the new deisgn without the infobox. Links can and I have in many cases, placed them in the captions. But there too I have had notes compalining that there are too many links. I have had many notes, some on my talk page, spome on the typeface's talk page, and some by email praising the new diesgn. Two other users have copied my templateand are preparing new specimens. Please consider that it might be good, and that through well systematicly writen captions we can have nearly instant presentation of information without requring the articles to be read.</p>
<p>Those are my thoughts, please feel free to let me know why the infobox adds something better. Thanks. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 12:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Atanamir. It is hard to separate one from the other, the infobox seems to want to make a unit of them. I have some concerns that the infobox entries are not academically correct, and that they might be a bit of a straight jacket. But all that said, I wonder if something like I have posted here to the right could work? I would love it if it is was mostly light grays, and just enough tint to define the space but not a jangle of vertical and horizontal lines which make so much visual noise beside something (type) that is so subtle. Please let me know what you think. Thanks. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 20:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Atanamir. Thanks! I think your design is great. But as a type person I think the entries should probably be: Typeface Designer(s) Classification Design date Foundry Release date</p>
<p><br />
and, when the design dated and release date are the same only one would need be used. If your intuition is that the two dates are too complicated than I could just go with " Date." Could the infobox be edited in anyway with the new entires that would not require all of them to be reset? Thanks again. Best, Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 23:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi (again) Atanamir. It is close to perfect. Could you please make "Date Created" lread "Dates created" or Date designed"? I think it only needs the first word capitalized to echo wiki style in headlines. Then I think we would be ready to impliment. Thanks again. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 12:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks very much Hi Atanamir, in my, and my students,' excitement to design type specimens and, simplify page layouts I realize now I may have taken the wiki moto "be bold" very literally, maybe too literally, and I had not been mindful of all the hard work you, and others have put into these pages. Thanks very very much for going easy on this newbie, and I hope the new info box will help me edit more gently–leaving the essential information in an easy to read box. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 12:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I owe you a response on your question .svg v .jpg. I much prefer .svg in quality: chiefly in its clarity. But, strangely, some of my typefaces do not appear in Illustrator. So there, I go from Quark (where they do display), to .pdf then resave as a .jpg in Photoshop. I am grateful for advice you might offer on this. <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 13:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks very much Atanamir! i will look for the sftware, and the info box. I appreciate it. <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 19:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Atanamir, this is a very valid point and I'm glad you made it. Just letting you know I avoided criticizing Geared Bull at the time—as a diplomatic measure (don't bite the newbies, etc). I felt it was more important to gain his trust first to make him less defensive, then tackle the issue of infoboxes later, or refer it to the editors who made the infoboxes (maybe a better and more appropriate stategy).</p>
<p>I assure you I wasn't playing politics, or chickening-out, but playing it safe, and since my time at WP is limited and pre-comitted to unfinished work, it wasn't practical at the time to take on the 2nd issue. (Jim, if you're reading, this is all in good faith for the benefit of all concerned.)</p>
<p>How's progress on the revised font infobox design going? Have we reached a final model yet, and if so how close is it to implementation? Thanks!<br />

<dd>Hi,</dd>
<dd>Working with gearedbull has been a nice experience; he's open to new ideas and has provided good design ideas for the infobox. However, i'm in the middle of applying to graduate school and i'm in midterm testing / GRE season, so it's hard to find time to work on wiki stuff. However, we've come up with a nice prototype at <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_TypeBox_bb3c.html" title="User:Atanamir/TypeBox">User:Atanamir/TypeBox</a>. I've yet to clean it up and modularise it (the template is still hard-coded for bodoni). However, I think it looks a lot better than the old infobox. Do you have any design ideas for it? <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 09:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright. I had a look at the new design a few weeks ago. Looking at it again now it looks great. Beethoven said one could go on refining a creative work forever, but in practice we stop at useful level of reinement. It seems close to that now. A few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invert the background and text colors of the <b>Typeface</b> row to give that field emphasis, as the name is the most significant. This will turn the row into a line-like element, dividing the box height into unequal halves, creating an artful balance and sense of proportion, fitting and relevant to typeface design. If the text color ends up looking too dark, increase the lightness until it looks right, or darken the background color, or a combination of both.</li>
<li>Place the <b>Designer(s)</b> field second, underneath <b>Typeface</b>, and make <b>Date Created</b> third position.</li>
<li>Change the case of <b>Date Created</b> to <b>Date created</b> as per wikipedia style guide.</li>
<li>How extensible is the template? Can we make it so that additional fields can easily be added by users on a per-article basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>I love it when a plan comes together guys. This is excellent. I'm supposed to be on wikileave too, but you know how wikis are&#160;:) Don't wait for me, but do finalize the box as you see fit.<br />

<dd>I've gone ahead and cleaned up <a href="../../../t/y/p/Template%7ETypeBox_6a9f.html" title="Template:TypeBox">Template:TypeBox</a> to best meet both aesthetics and wikipedia style formatting. It now conforms to the style of most other infoboxes, but I've added more padding to the edges and that has help. It also retains its integrity when changing the font size on your web browser. The next step is to merge this with <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_font_f49d.html" title="Template:Infobox font">Template:Infobox font</a> and adjust the parameters so that the infobox can grow with additional parameters.</dd>
<dd>It's meeting a tricky middle ground between the "artful balance" of print typography and the assembly of clean, simple, flexible and managable wiki markup that makes this challanging. I hope my edits are satisfactory. —<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><b><a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDown10_2799.html" title="User:Down10">Down10</a></b>&#160;<span style="font-size:75%;margin-top:2px;"><sup><a href="../../../d/o/w/User_talk%7EDown10_7d38.html" title="User talk:Down10">TA</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Down10_2d58.html" title="Special:Contributions/Down10">CO</a></sup></span></span> 11:52, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"It also retains its integrity when changing the font size on your web browser."</i></dd>

<p>The alternative smaller text size versions have no problem with that, so it's not an issue.</p>

</dl>
<p>Can you point me to a page in the style guide that stipulates infobox text has to be black on a white (or light) background, or that the main caption/name/title has to be larger than other text in an infobox? I have not found such rules or guidelines.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"It now conforms to the style of most other infoboxes,"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That's what we're trying to avoid. The penultimate official policy is: <b><a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a></b>. We are encouraged to do it, and if it helps create a better encyclopedia, all the more so. The design of Infoboxes is flexible and evolving, eg: <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_primordial_gods.html" title="Greek primordial gods">Greek primordial gods</a>. The black &amp; white text colors of the original font infobox are rudimentary and outmoded by the variety of infoboxes in use.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">Wikipedia:Use common sense</a></b> (not policy or guideline), makes a lot of sense: <i>"The spirit of the rules is more important than the letter...Invoking the principle of "Ignore all rules" on its own will not convince anyone that you were right, so you will need to persuade the rest of the community that your actions improved the encyclopedia. A skilled application of this concept should ideally fly under the radar, and not be noticed at all."</i></p>
<p>To that end, I suggest we use this version by Down10 with its 10pt text <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TypeBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88187181" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TypeBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88187181" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> rendered with the dark grey text color of this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TypeBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84500714" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TypeBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84500714" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The font name/title does not have to be larger text (12pt) to be obvious. Keeping it at 10pt and inverting the colors of that field will do the same job—artful and subtle emphasis, a "skilled application" of ignoring the rules. That's a good compromise and will easily fly under the radar of most readers.</p>
<p>The Font (and impending Typo article) infobox(s) ought to be on the very cutting edge of wikitypography. Black text on white background is harder to read than dark grey text, which alleviates the basic legibility problem of the low resolution screen medium by reducing contrast. <b>The increased legiblity delivers increased readability.</b> Dark grey text is widely used by the professional online type community – Typophile.com, Typographi.com, Typoographer.org, et al. It has been adopted by millions of additional internet users (especially bloggers) over the past 3 years (albeit frequently overdone with lighter grey, making text harder to read).</p>
<p><i>"An infobox on Wikipedia is a consistently-formatted table which is present in articles with a common subject to provide summary information consistently between articles or improve navigation to closely related articles in that subject."</i> —<a href="../../../i/n/f/Help%7EInfobox_7bd3.html" title="Help:Infobox">Help:Infobox</a></p>
<p>"consistently formatted" means as in "articles with a common subject", but not across the whole encyclopedia. Each subject-area is encouraged to develop its own unique colors and typography. 8pt text for the main caption/label is not unknown: <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_animanga_50e5.html" title="Template:Infobox animanga">Template:Infobox animanga</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Curie_d2ae.html" title="Marie Curie">Marie Curie</a>. For detailed infoboxes 8pt is a practical solution. Some examples use 6pt, but that is too small.</p>
<p><b>10pt captions may be an emerging standard. Please refer to these examples:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_primordial_gods.html" title="Greek primordial gods">Greek primordial gods</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28mythology%29.html" title="Titan (mythology)">Titan (mythology)</a>. — progressive!</li>

<p>Hi <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDown10_2799.html" title="User:Down10">Down10</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Arboghast_a4ca.html" title="User:James Arboghast">Arbo</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a>. Looks like the typeface infobox is very close. I wonder if you could please take a look at <a href="../../../t/y/p/Template%7ETypeBox_6a9f.html" title="Template:TypeBox">Template:TypeBox</a> and see a comparison between the box, and a secondary illustration I've added from the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28typeface%29.html" title="Georgia (typeface)">Georgia</a> page. Any chance of reducing the horizontal spacing between rule and type (is this what is called "padding") a hair to match what happens with wiki images and captions? Also, might we lighten the vertical and horizontal rules to match the light gray used around images? it will still define and contain, just liberate the text a bit. Thanks for looking and your thoughts. Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 15:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The point is that there is no regulatory body for the English language - no equivalent of the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academie_Fran%C3%A7aise_c78f.html" title="Academie Française">Academie Française</a> for instance, and no country, government, city or municipality has the right to impose any particular usage on English-speakers. Wikipedia's policy is to reflect <b>common</b>, not "official" usage in the case of names which are well-known or where there is an established English spelling. This is certainly the case with Burma (which should <i>never</i> have been moved to "Myanmar", not least because of the nature of the regime requesting the change). I feel the same way about Bombay, which was renamed by the fascist <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiv_Sena_b52b.html" title="Shiv Sena">Shiv Sena</a> party to "Mumbai", but at least that name is very widely used in English now. This is not true of Calcutta or Madras, which should not have been moved to "Kolkata" and "Chennai". Almaty and Kyrgyzstan are sufficiently obscure for this to be less of an issue, and for the latter in particular there has never been a common English spelling. Which brings us to Bangalore, a city very widely known in the English-speaking world and with an established English version of its Kannada name, ("Bengaluru", "Bengalooru" - nobody even knows how it should be spelt), which has been in use for over two centuries. The narrow-minded decisions of the Karnataka State Government do not make one iota of difference to the name of the city in English - that can only be determined by what most English-speakers call it. And for many years to come this will continue to be Bangalore. If that changes, move the page, but not before. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 09:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and Cote D'Ivoire is still called "Ivory Coast" in English. The name change is widely ignored, and rightly so. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 09:56, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happens is that the old SVGs created by Atanamir are now orphan. Since there is no page that links to them, in some weeks a bot will appear and will erase them. Therefore, before it occurs, it would be better to update those tables.</p>
<p>Now, I dont have too much time to do this, since in two months I have to submit mi dissertation.</p>
<p>Maybe Anatamir could write a small script to do that, given that he is a programming expert.</p>
