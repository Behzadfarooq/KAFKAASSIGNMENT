<p>I'm a little confused how Atari Games got in Hasbro Interactives control. If Hasbro resurrected the home software portion of Atari, wasn't that the console version of Atari sold to Jack Tramiel, not the Atari Games division? According to the article, WMS Industries controlled Atari Games, then suddenly Hasbro Interactive has control. Was Hasbro Interactive part of WMS? It's all just a bit confusing, there is no explanation in the article how Hasbro Interactive got control of Atari Games from WMS Industries - <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGantry_1681.html" title="User:Gantry">Gantry</a> 23:42, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was an employee of Hasbro Interactive when they went under, so maybe I can shed some light on this. Hasbro purchased the right to the Atari name and the IP for several classic Atari games (e.g. "Combat" and others). When Hasbro killed Hasbro Interactive (HI), Infogrames came along and bought up all their IPs and code library, titles in production, etc. Infogrames then, just recently, changed their name to Atari. Apparently they bought the right to use the name however they wanted. I don't know what happened to the Atari Games division, the division that made the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade_game.html" title="Arcade game">arcade games</a>. It was spun off from Atari years ago and operated as a seperate company. AFAIK, HI had no rights to any Atari Games properties, just Atari (remember Atari Games and Atari are not the same thing).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, Hasbro bought some Atari properties, not Atari Games. They had control of the Atari brand until they went under. Then Infogrames bought the Atari brand from the dead HI. Then Infogrames changed their name to Atari. Clear?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 14:58, Dec 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Atari was split into Atari Games (the arcade manufacturer) and Atari Inc (making video games and computers) in 1984. Time Warner kept Atari Games and sold Atari Inc to Jack Tramiel. There are some more details in <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari.html" title="Atari">Atari</a>. Hasbro bought the rest of Atari Inc, but not Atari Games. I don't think that Hasbro or the Ex-<a href="../../../i/n/f/Infogrames.html" title="Infogrames">Infogrames</a> company have any relationship with Atari Games, beside having bought a company of the same name and maybe sharing IP rights of old arcade games. The remains of Atari Games are now owned by <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midway_Games_ce99.html" title="Midway Games">Midway Games</a>/WMS or whatever their name is today, but it seems like they got out of the arcade business. --<a href="../../../t/j/a/User%7ETjansen_647e.html" title="User:Tjansen">Tjansen</a> 15:09, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I googled a bit and found this: <a href="http://games.ign.com/objects/027/027391.html" class="external free" title="http://games.ign.com/objects/027/027391.html" rel="nofollow">http://games.ign.com/objects/027/027391.html</a> Midway Games West was closed because of bad sales, Hasbro has nothing to do with it. I rewrote that sentence in the article. --<a href="../../../t/j/a/User%7ETjansen_647e.html" title="User:Tjansen">Tjansen</a> 15:22, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the clarifications guys, it makes much more sense now. I couldn't see the relationship between HI and Atari Games before, that's because there wasn't one. The last paragraph is much easier to understand. Well done -- <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGantry_1681.html" title="User:Gantry">Gantry</a> 17:11, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it was a little more involved then that. Atari Corp. had regained rights to the logo with stylized name back around the time of TWI's wipe out of the Atari Games name. When WMS bought TWI and started up Atari Games under Midway Games, they had to license the logo. In 1997 Hasbro bought Atari Corp. from JTS Corp. and put it under HI as Atari Interactive. They didn't just purchase the name and the IP for several games, they got *all* the properties of the '72-'84 Atari Inc. that Atari Corp. had. This included the rights to the arcade game names/characters/etc. of the '72-'84 period (which actually fell under Atari Consumer because of the ports of arcade games to thier consoles and computers). Starting in '98 Hasbro had a series of agressive, closed door proceedings with WMS/Midway with regards to the ownership of those arcade properties. It came out with Midway not wanting to lease the logo any more and Hasbro cementing ownership of all the pre-1984 arcade titles but not the actual code itself (i.e. the game roms). That's when they changed their name to Midway Games West, but put a positive spin on it by releasing that false press release about not wanting to get confused. Consequently, a company could lease the pre-84 arcade titles/code from either company but could only use the Atari name if they got it from Hasbro. For example, when Tempest 3000 was being developed for the Nuon system, they found they could lease it from either one. The same thing happened when the 3-in-1 Atari coin-op that came out a few years ago (Missile Command, Centipede, Millipede) by Team Play. They got the roms from Midway, and when they got them the Atari name was replaced with Midway Games by all the (c) years. However it was a dual project between Infogrames and Midway, but the Infogrames part had not come through yet. So the US production has an (c) for Infogrames on the marquee and Team Play changed the copyrights to that as well on the games. The euro-release was supposed to have the full Atari credits and logo.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive (which included Atari Interactive), not just the Atari properties themselves. Likewise, there appears to be a bit of confusion on what Infogrames did with the name. In 2003 they reorganized their US subsidiary as a seperate entity entitled Atari Inc., of which they are a major shareholder. They kept their European division and renamed it simply Atari Europe (since it's a division and not a seperate corporation). Both fall under the banner "Atari Holdings" of the main French company, which has not changed its name - Infogrames Entertainment.</dd>
