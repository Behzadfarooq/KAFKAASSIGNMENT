<p>Wow, another inaccurate and misleading page regarding an Atari game console. At this rate I think I'll be submitting corrections for the whole lot of 'em. Here is the text as it currently appears:</p>
<p>"The Atari 7800 was an attempt to compete with Nintendo's NES.</p>
<p>"It was released in 1986 after negotiations with Nintendo to support the console were cut off. Instead of the console being supported by Nintendo, it was now in direct competition with Nintendo, which is not what was needed for Atari to recover from the video game crash of 1983. Even though technologically it was far superior to the NES, the game line-up was inferior. It also didn't help that Atari also had 2 other consoles for sale at the same time."</p>
<p>While the 7800 did indeed compete with the NES on store shelves, it was not designed to. The 7800 was in fact designed to replace the Atari 5200, and to once and for all re-establish Atari's market supremacy against the Intellivision and ColecoVision. The system also marks Atari's loss of faith in its own video game R&amp;D staff - it was the first game system from Atari which was designed by an outside company (GCC). (Later Atari consoles also designed outside the company were the Lynx and Jaguar.) The 7800 was launched in test market (southern California) in June of 1984, not 1986. One month later Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel, who beleived (along with most of the country) that the video game fad was over. He pulled the plug on all projects related to video games and Atari's existing computer line to concentrate all efforts on development of the new 16-bit line (Atari ST). The 7800 was RE-introduced in 1986 once Nintendo's success had convinced Jack there was still gold in them thar hills.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, it tried to compete with the NES, which is something people who grew up in that era remember. I had both machines. That it was introduced prior to the NES' introduction in the USA is a useful fact, but it's also a fact that Atari used the 7800 as a machine in an attempt to compete with the NES, as you've mentioned.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the failed Atari-Nintendo deal, this actually occurred years earlier as well. Nintendo had successfully launched the NES (Famicom) in Japan and was looking to expand it's market. But with Atari dominating the rest of the world market they were concerned about their ability to deliver product on a global scale. So they approached Atari, offering rights to the NES outside Japan. Atari was close to signing the deal, but at the CES that winter Coleco demonstrated it's upcoming Adam computer running Donkey Kong. At that time Atari held exclusive rights to home computer versions of Donkey Kong. Enraged, Atari's CEO pulled out of the Nintendo deal, a move which doomed Atari to forever play the role of also-ran with all their future consoles.</p>
<p>The 7800's technical superiority is debated still today. The architecture is essentially just an Atari 2600 with a slightly better CPU and an advanced graphics chip. While the system could handle far more moving objects on screen (up to 100) than any of it's competitors, it lacked seriously in audio capabilities. To compensate, some games (notably ports from the Atari 400/800 computer line) included a GTIA audio chip in the cartridge. The 7800 was also more difficult to program than other systems available at the time, though this was tempered by the fact that so many programmers were already well versed in the 2600.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So (help to) fix it, dear Henry! Seriously, a lot of the material on video game consoles is could use work; it tends to be written by younger video game fans who perhaps lack a bit of perspective, and it hasn't attracted as much review as other more imp...er...contentious areas.

<dd>Clarified the audio description, it was due to lack of board space and the POKEY chip could be included in the cartridge. It was designed that way. Really! <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 23:22, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, now I understand how this works. One new &amp; improved 7800 article, coming up!</p>
<p><a name="Justify_reverts_and_stop_being_overprotective" id="Justify_reverts_and_stop_being_overprotective"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Talk%7EAtari_7800_1664.html" title="Edit section: Justify reverts and stop being overprotective">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Justify reverts and stop being overprotective</span></h2>
<p>This article and the Atari 400 article seem to be vigilantly reverted whenever I add content to them, content that I feel is not only relevant, it's interesting and useful. For instance, the 7800 vs. the NES is very relevant in console history, and perfectly appropriate for the article. I haven't seen a good justification for the reverts. It seems that certain folks think these articles are their property to guard. They're not. They are supposed to be amalgams—the end result of contributions from many people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As people have pointed out, it doesn't have much to do with the 7800 history overall other than to say the 7800 competed against several consoles during its lifetime. Focusing on the NES is not relevant, and posting content in the format of personal opinion has no place here and is against Wiki policies on original research and documentation. You want to talk about the merits of the NES, do it in the NES article. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 03:00, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How the 7800 did in the market is extremely relevant to this article. The machine's tech specs and talk about the company's internal management isn't the only thing that the article should include. The 7800 was a commercial product and how people reacted to it in the market is absolutely relevant, just as how the 400/800 system's games compared to other systems is relevant. I see no logic in what seems to be a radical approach to Atari equipment articles. I've worked on a number of other articles and haven't seen this strange situation, although the Bible/Homosexuality article was in a similar mess which luckily has been sorted out.
<dl>
<dd>Once again, you're not focusing on "how it did in the market", providing resources on market performance, etc. You're simply continuously putting in personally opinioned "NES vs. 7800" material. I.e. the "fanboy" stuff you make mention, and none of it fits in NPOV or Original Research policies. Finally, the 7800's performance and causes are already covered in the "Aftermath" section in a much more neutral manner. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 03:05, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing "fanboy" about discussing how well the 7800 did as a commercial product. The NES was the console that defined the second generation. That has nothing to do with my "agenda". It's a simple fact. The fact that Atari tried to compete with the NES and failed with the 7800 is also a fact. That there are many variables responsible for the success or failure of a product is also a fact, and those variables are worth including in the article. Some of them are there, but those I've added are labeled "original research", "point of view", and "NES is great fanboy chatter". This is absurd. What I see is bad behavior on the part of people whose perspective isn't large enough to see that there are many dimensions to this article other than the ones that have occured to them—that some people can't understand that they're not omniscient and that they're point of view concerning what's relevant and what's not isn't universal. To me, how a product does in the market is important, and comparing a product to its main competition is essential. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.133.103.221_d904.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.133.103.221">69.133.103.221</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.133.103.221.html" title="User talk:69.133.103.221">talk</a>) 03:12, 31 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Seriously, I think you should take a step back from the keyboard, take a breath, and look in the mirror. Becuase what you're accusing others of is exactly how you're coming off. First, you're the one that brought up "fanboy", not anyone else - I was simply repeating the comment. What you added, once again, is clearly labeled by Wikipedia. Its not like they're labeled just for you and you're being picked on, its policies that have been followed here for quite some time. Now, as stated, the 7800's performance in the market or lack thereof is already covered. Simply doing a direct comparison against the NES and trumpeting the reasons for what you consider NES's "superiority" does not follow under the scope of a 7800 article or guidelines for Wikipedia content. You can cry "being picked on" all you want, and make sarcastic edit comments over and over again, but this is nothing personal. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 03:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
