<p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a native of <a href="../../../g/w/a/Gwalior.html" title="Gwalior">Gwalior</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhya_Pradesh_a149.html" title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> and has been active in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_politics.html" title="Indian politics">Indian politics</a> throughout his adult life (as a member of parliament, he has often resided in Delhi). He holds a masters degree in political science and was educated at the Victoria College, Gwalior (now Laxmibai College) and <a href="../../../d/a/v/DAV_College%2C_Kanpur_f5f5.html" title="DAV College, Kanpur">DAV College, Kanpur</a>. He is also a poet and writer, and has published several volumes of poetry, essays and speeches. He has been described as a follower of the guru <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Vajpayee is a bachelor and has the adopted daughters of Mr. and Mrs. B. N. Kaul, Nandita (Nanni) and Namita (Gunu). Nandita is a doctor residing in the US and is married to Ashok Nanda, a software engineer. Namita, who resides in Delhi, is married to Ranjan Bhattacharya and they have a daughter.</p>
<p>Vajpayee's niece, Karuna Shukla, is a member of parliament from Chattisgarh and a vice-president of the BJP. His nephew, Anoop Mishra, is an MLA in Madhya Pradesh, and another nephew, Deepak Vajpayee, is a party worker. In a tragic and heavily publicized turn of events, his grand-nephew Manish Mishra was thrown out of a moving train whilst trying to defend girls from eve-teasing towards the end of Atal's tenure.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee_70c0.html" title="Edit section: Early political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
<p>Vajpayee involvement in politics began as a freedom-fighter during the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quit_India_Movement_c6eb.html" title="Quit India Movement">Quit India Movement</a> of 1942-1945, initially adhering to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, but shedding that for membership in the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh_4db7.html" title="Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a>, an organization propounding <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, or Hindu Nationalism and considered Right-Wing in Indian politics.</p>
<p>He became a close follower and aide to <a href="../../../s/y/a/Syama_Prasad_Mookerjee_548b.html" title="Syama Prasad Mookerjee">Syama Prasad Mookerjee</a>, the leader of the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatiya_Jana_Sangh_71ca.html" title="Bharatiya Jana Sangh">Bharatiya Jana Sangh</a> (BJS). Vajpayee was at Mookerjee's side when he went on a fast-unto-death in <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> in 1953, to protest the identity card requirement and what he claimed was the "inferior" treatment of Indian citizens visiting Kashmir, and the special treatment accorded to Kashmir because it had a Muslim majority. Mookerjee's fast and protest ended the identity card requirement, and hastened the integration of Kashmir into the Indian Union. But Mookherjee died after weeks of weakness, illness and confinement in jail. These events were a watershed moment for the young Vajpayee. Taking the baton from Mookerjee, Vajpayee won his first election to the parliamentary in 1957. As the leader of BJS, he expanded its political appeal, organization and agenda. In spite of his youth, he soon became a respected voice in the opposition - one of reason and intelligence. His broad appeal brought respect, recognition and acceptance to a rising nationalist cultural movement.</p>

<p>While the Bharatiya Jana Sangh had strong constituencies of support, it failed to dislodge the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_National_Congress_2296.html" title="Indian National Congress">Indian National Congress</a> as the leading party in Indian parliament. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>'s vast majorities in 1969 and 1971 further diminished other political parties.</p>
<p>In 1974, when Prime Minister Gandhi imposed a <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Emergency_be7b.html" title="Indian Emergency">national state of emergency</a>, the RSS and BJS joined a wide-array of parties in opposing the suspension of elections and civil liberties. Vajpayee was briefly jailed during that period.</p>
<p>When Indira Gandhi called elections in 1977, the BJS joined the Janata coalition, a vast collage of regional groups, socialist, communist and right-wing forces. Janata swept the polls and formed the next government under Prime Minister <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morarji_Desai_270a.html" title="Morarji Desai">Morarji Desai</a>. Vajpayee took office as the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_for_External_Affairs_3d22.html" title="Minister for External Affairs">Minister for External Affairs</a>.</p>
<p>In a tenure lasting two years, Vajpayee achieved several milestones. He went on a historic visit to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> in 1979, normalizing relations with China for the first time since the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Indian_War_d7d7.html" title="Sino-Indian War">1962 Sino-Indian War</a>. He also visited <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and initiated normal dialogue and trade relations that were frozen since the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1971_cd81.html" title="Indo-Pakistani war of 1971">1971 Indo-Pak War</a> and subsequent political instability in both countries. This act was particularly surprising for a man perceived as a hard-right Hindu nationalist. Minister Vajpayee represented the nation at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_on_Disarmament_a6ea.html" title="Conference on Disarmament">Conference on Disarmament</a>, where he defended the national nuclear program, the centerpiece of national security in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> world, especially with neighboring China being a nuclear power. (India had become the sixth nuclear power in the world with an underground nuclear test at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokhran.html" title="Pokhran">Pokhran</a> in 1974) Although he resigned in 1979 when the government politically attacked the RSS, he had established his credentials as an experienced statesman and respected political leader. During this tenure, he also became the first person to deliver a speech to the United States General Assembly in Hindi (in 1977), the "most unforgettable" moment in his life by his own admission.</p>

<p>Vajpayee resigned from government with Morarji Desai's resignation as prime minister, and the Janata coalition dissolved soon after. The BJS had devoted political organization to sustain the coalition and was left exhausted by the internecine wars within Janata.</p>
<p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee, along with many BJS and RSS colleagues, particularly his long-time and close friend <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lal_Krishna_Advani_3996.html" title="Lal Krishna Advani">Lal Krishna Advani</a>, formed the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatiya_Janata_Party_8641.html" title="Bharatiya Janata Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> in 1980 as the new home of Hindutva, right-wing social and economic ideas and nationalism. Vajpayee became its founding President. The BJP was a strong critic of the Congress government, and while it strongly opposed the Sikh militancy that was rising in the state of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab.html" title="Punjab">Punjab</a>, it also blamed Indira Gandhi for divisive and corrupt politics that fostered the militancy at national expense. Leader Darasingh opines that Vajpayee thus "brought in Hindu-Sikh harmony." <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/apr162004/d10.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/apr162004/d10.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Although supporting <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bluestar_7344.html" title="Operation Bluestar">Operation Bluestar</a>, the BJP strongly protested the violence against <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhs.html" title="Sikhs">Sikhs</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> that broke out in 1984 following the assassination of Prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. Vajpayee was known and commended for protecting Sikhs, who also fall within the ideology of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, against Congress-followers seeking to avenge the death of their leader. While the BJP won only two parliamentary seats in the 1984 elections, in which the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_party.html" title="Congress party">Congress party</a> led by <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajiv_Gandhi_05c7.html" title="Rajiv Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> (son of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>) won in a historic landslide, the BJP however had established itself in the mainstream of Indian politics, and soon began expanding its organization to attract younger Indians throughout the country. During this period Vajpayee remained center-stage as party President and Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, but increasingly hard-line Hindu nationalists began to rise within the party and define its politics.</p>
<p>The BJP became the political voice of the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_Janmabhoomi_bec9.html" title="Ram Janmabhoomi">Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Movement</a>, which was led by activists of the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishwa_Hindu_Parishad_cb6f.html" title="Vishwa Hindu Parishad">Vishwa Hindu Parishad</a> and the RSS, and was seeking to build a temple dedicated to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Lord Rama</a> at the site of the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babri_mosque.html" title="Babri mosque">Babri mosque</a> in the city of <a href="../../../a/y/o/Ayodhya.html" title="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a>. Hindu activists believed the site was the birthplace of the Lord, and thus qualified as one of the most sacred sites of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p>On December 6, 1992, hundreds of VHP and BJP activists broke down an organized protest into a frenzied attack on the mosque. By the end of the day, the mosque had crumbled to pieces. Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted in various parts of the country, killing over 10,000 people. The VHP organization was banned by the government, and many BJP leaders including Lal Krishna Advani were arrested briefly for provoking the destruction. Although widely condemned by many across the country for playing politics with sensitive issues, the BJP won the loyalty and support of millions of conservative Hindus, as well as national prominence.</p>

<p>Political energy and expansion made BJP the single-largest political party in the Lok Sabha elected in 1996. Mired down by corruption scandals, the Congress was at a historic low, and a vast medley of regional parties and break-off factions dominated the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung.html" title="Hung">hung</a> Parliament. Asked to form the government, A.B. Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister, but the BJP failed to gather enough support from other parties to form a majority. Vajpayee resigned after just 13 days, when it became clear that he could not garner a majority. After a third-party coalition governed India between 1996 and 1998, the terribly divided Parliament was dissolved and fresh elections held. These elections again put the BJP at the head. This time, a cohesive bloc of political parties lined up with it to form the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Alliance_8bc7.html" title="National Democratic Alliance">National Democratic Alliance</a>, and A.B. Vajpayee was sworn in as the prime minister. The NDA proved its 286 vote majority in a narrow vote of confidence. Towards the end of 1998 however, the <a href="../../../a/i/a/AIADMK_521a.html" title="AIADMK">AIADMK</a> under <a href="../../../j/2E/j/J.Jayalalitha_708a.html" title="J.Jayalalitha">J.Jayalalitha</a> withdrew its support from the 13-month old government. The government lost the ensuing vote of confidence motion by a single vote. As the opposition was unable to come up with the numbers to form the new government, the country returned to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections.html" title="Elections">elections</a> with Vajpayee remaining the "care-taker prime minister". After the election in 1999, Vajpayee was sworn in as the Prime Minister for the third time. The coalition government that was formed lasted its full term of 5 years – the only non-Congress government to do so.</p>
<p>His premiership began at a decisive phase of national life and history: the Congress Party, dominant for over 40 years, appeared irreparably damaged, and fractious regional parties seemed to threaten the very stability of the nation by continually fracturing government work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/a/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee_70c0.html" title="Edit section: Pokhran, Lahore and Kargil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pokhran, Lahore and Kargil</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1998.html" title="May 1998">May 1998</a>, India conducted five underground nuclear weapon tests in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokhran.html" title="Pokhran">Pokhran</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>. The five tests shocked and surprised the world, especially considering that the government had been in power for only a month. Two weeks later, Pakistan responded with its own nuclear weapon tests, making it the newest nation with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>It is speculated that the tests were planned in 1995 when <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._V._Narasimha_Rao_dfe6.html" title="P. V. Narasimha Rao">P. V. Narasimha Rao</a> was the prime minister of India, but Vajpayee took credit for decisively acting on such an important issue.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Vajpayee also advanced the ballistic missiles programme and bolstered defense modernization and spending. While some nations, such as Russia and France, endorsed India's right to defensive nuclear power, others including USA, Canada, Japan, UK and the European Union imposed sanctions on the sale of military equipment and high-tech scientific information, resources and technology to India or Pakistan. In spite of the intense international criticism steady decline in foreign investment and trade, the nuclear tests were popular domestically and the Vajpayee's popularity and the BJP's prestige rose in response.</p>
<p>During his premiership, Vajpayee introduced many important economic and infrastructural reforms domestically including, encouraging the private sector and foreign investements; reducing governmental waste; encouraging research and development and privatizing of government owned corporations.</p>
<p>In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee began a push for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with Pakistan. With the historic inauguration of the Delhi-Lahore bus service in February 1999, Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the Kashmir dispute and other territorial/nuclear/strategic conflicts with Pakistan. The resultant <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore_Declaration_71d7.html" title="Lahore Declaration">Lahore Declaration</a> espoused a commitment to dialogue, expanded trade relations and the goal of denuclearized South Asia, and mutual friendship. This eased the tension created by the 1998 nuclear tests, not only within the two nations, but also in South Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The Vajpayee led government was faced with two crises in mid-1999. The AIADMK party had continually threatened to withdraw support from the coalition and national leaders repeatedly flew down from Delhi to Chennai to pacify the AIADMK chief <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Jayalalitha_fa5c.html" title="J. Jayalalitha">J. Jayalalitha</a>. Finally, in May 1999, the AIADMK did pull the plug on the NDA, and the Vajpayee administration was reduced to a caretaker status pending fresh elections scheduled for October.</p>
<p>More importantly and soon after, it was revealed that thousands of terrorists and non-uniformed Pakistani soldiers (many with official identifications and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Army_6011.html" title="Pakistan Army">Pakistan Army</a>'s custom weaponry) had infiltrated into the Kashmir Valley and captured control of border hilltops, unmanned border posts and were spreading out fast. The incursion was centered around the town of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil.html" title="Kargil">Kargil</a>, but also included the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batalik.html" title="Batalik">Batalik</a> and <a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhnoor.html" title="Akhnoor">Akhnoor</a> sectors and include artillery exchanges at the <a href="../../../s/i/a/Siachen_Glacier_470a.html" title="Siachen Glacier">Siachen Glacier</a>.</p>
<p>Indian army units were rushed into Kashmir in response. <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Vijay_%281999%29_6cc6.html" title="Operation Vijay (1999)">Operation Vijay (1999)</a>, launched in June 1999, saw the Indian military fighting thousands of terrorists and soldiers amidst heavy artillery shelling and while facing extremely cold weather, snow and treacherous terrain at the high altitude. Over 500 Indian soldiers died in the three-month long <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil_War_f86a.html" title="Kargil War">Kargil War</a>, and it is estimated around 600 Pakistani militants and soldiers died as well. Pakistan's army shot down two air force jets. The mutilation of the body of pilot <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajay_Ahuja_f2b0.html" title="Ajay Ahuja">Ajay Ahuja</a> inflamed public opinion in India. After both the United States and China refused to condone the incursion or threaten India to stop its military operations, Pakistan's Prime Minister <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawaz_Sharif_1c68.html" title="Nawaz Sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> asked the militants to stop and withdraw to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>On October 13, 1999, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">General Pervez Musharraf</a>, chief of Pakistan's army and the chief planner of the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil_conflict.html" title="Kargil conflict">Kargil conflict</a>, seized power from the civilian, democratic government of Pakistan, and established his own dictatorship. On the same day, Atal Bihari Vajpayee took oath as Prime Minister of India for the third time. The BJP-led NDA had won 303 seats in the 543 seat Lok Sabha, a comfortable, stable majority, without the AIADMK.</p>
<p>A national crisis popped up in December 1999, when an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Airlines_ba45.html" title="Indian Airlines">Indian Airlines</a> flight (<a href="../../../i/c/_/IC_814_c24a.html" title="IC 814">IC 814</a> from <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>) was hijacked by Pakistani terrorists and flown via Pakistan to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> ruled <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The media and the relatives of the hijacked passengers built up tremendous pressure on the government to give in to the hijackers' demand to release certain Kashmiri terrorists, including high-ranking <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulana_Masood_Azhar_d35a.html" title="Maulana Masood Azhar">Maulana Masood Azhar</a>, from prison. The government ultimately caved in and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jaswant_Singh_f905.html" title="Jaswant Singh">Jaswant Singh</a>, the Indian External Affairs minister, flew with the terrorists to Afghanistan and exchanged them for the passengers. No explanation was given by the Indian government for the External Affairs minister personally escorting the terrorists. The crisis also worsened the relationship between India and Pakistan, as the hijacked plane was allowed to re-fuel in Lahore, and all the hijackers, except one, were Pakistanis.</p>

<p>In March 2000 <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> made the only second-ever visit by an American President to India and thus gave a fillip to the government. Since the visit followed barely two years after the Pokhran tests, and one year after the Kargil invasion and the subsequent coup in Pakistan, it was read to reflect a major shift in the post-<a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._foreign_policy_dbd5.html" title="U.S. foreign policy">U.S. foreign policy</a>. The Indian Prime Minister and the U.S. President discussed strategic issues, but the chief achievement was a significant expansion in trade and economic ties.</p>
<p>Domestically, the BJP led government was under constant pressure from its ideological mentor, the RSS, and the hard-line VHP to enact the Hindutva agenda. But owing to its dependence on coalition support, it was impossible for the BJP to push items like building the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_Janmabhoomi_Mandir_d6a8.html" title="Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir">Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir</a> in <a href="../../../a/y/o/Ayodhya.html" title="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a>, repealing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_356.html" title="Article 356">Article 356</a> which gave a special status to the state of Kashmir, or enacting a uniform civil code applicable to adherents of all religions. The BJP was however accused of <i>saffron-ising</i> (<a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffron_%28color%29.html" title="Saffron (color)">saffron</a> is the color of the flag of the RSS, symbol of the Hindu nationalism movement) the official state education curriculum and apparatus. Home Minister <a href="../../../l/2E/k/L.K._Advani_b73a.html" title="L.K. Advani">L.K. Advani</a> and Education Minister <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murli_Manohar_Joshi_f9a9.html" title="Murli Manohar Joshi">Murli Manohar Joshi</a> were indicted in the 1992 <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babri_Mosque_64f0.html" title="Babri Mosque">Babri Mosque</a> demolition case for inciting the mob of activists. The RSS also routinely criticized the government for free-market policies which introduced foreign goods and competition at the expense of home industries and products.</p>
<p>Vajpayee's administration earned the ire of many unionized workers groups and government workers for their aggressive campaign to privatize government owned corporations. Vajpayee promoted pro-business, free market reforms to reinvigorate India's economic transformation and expansion that were started by former PM <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narasimha_Rao_3a97.html" title="Narasimha Rao">Narasimha Rao</a> but stalled after 1996 due to unstable governments and the 1997 <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_financial_crisis.html" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a>. Increased competitiveness, extra funding and support for the information technology and high-tech industries, improvements in infrastructure, deregulation of trade, investments and corporate laws - all increased foreign capital investment and set in motion an economic expansion.</p>
<p>These couple of years of reform however were accompanied by infighting in the administration and confusion regarding the direction of government. Cabinet portfolios were created and shuffled every six months apparently to pacify restless coalition partners. Vajpayee's weakening health was also a subject of public interest, and he underwent a major knee-replacement surgery at the Breach Candy Hospital in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> to relieve great pressure on his legs.</p>
<p>In 2000, the <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehelka.html" title="Tehelka">Tehelka</a> group released incriminating videos of the BJP President Bangaru Laxman, senior army officers and NDA members accepting bribes from journalists posing as agents and businessmen. While the scandals were not linked to Vajpayee's personally, the Defence Minister <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Fernandes_aa9d.html" title="George Fernandes">George Fernandes</a> was forced to resign following this <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barak_Missile_Deal_Scandal_e501.html" title="Barak Missile Deal Scandal">Barak Missile Deal Scandal</a>, another scandal involving the botched supplies of coffins for the soldiers killed in Kargil, and the finding of an inquiry commission that the Government could have prevented the Kargil invasion. These developments as well as an ambiguous response of the economy to the reforms, reduced the Vajpayee administration's popularity and undermined its future.</p>
<p>Vajpayee again broke the ice in the Indo-Pak relations by inviting Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a> for a joint summit and peace talks. His second-major attempt to move beyond the stalemate tensions involved inviting the man who had planned the Kargil invasions, but accepting him as the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Pakistan_3f63.html" title="President of Pakistan">President of Pakistan</a>, Vajpayee chose to move forward. But after three days of much fanfare, which included Musharraf visiting his birthplace in Delhi, the summit failed to achieve a breakthrough as President Musharraf declined to leave aside the issue of <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, a group of masked, armed men with fake IDs stormed the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sansad_Bhavan_69e7.html#Houses_of_Parliament" title="Sansad Bhavan">Parliament building</a> in Delhi. The terrorists managed to kill several security guards, but the building was sealed off swiftly and security forces cornered and killed the men, who were later proven to be Pakistan nationals. Coming just three months after the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_terrorist_attacks.html" title="September 11 terrorist attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> upon the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, this fresh escalation instantly enraged the nation. Although the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> officially condemned the attack, Indian intelligence reports pointed the finger at a conspiracy rooted in Pakistan. Prime Minister Vajpayee ordered a mobilization of India's military forces, and as many as 500,000 servicemen amassed along the international boundary bordering <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab%2C_India_6b2e.html" title="Punjab, India">Punjab</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. Pakistan responded with the same. Vicious terrorist attacks and an aggressive anti-terrorist campaign froze day-to-day life in Kashmir, and foreigners flocked out of both India and Pakistan, fearing a possible war and nuclear exchange. For as long as two years, both nations remained perilously close to a terrible war.</p>
<p>The Vajpayee adminsitrations passed the controversial <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevention_of_Terrorist_Act%2C_India_fb95.html" title="Prevention of Terrorist Act, India">Prevention of Terrorist Act</a> against vigorous opposition of non-NDA parties. Under the law, several radical Islamic organizations that preached the conversion of Hindus and an Islamic state in India were banned and its leaders and members arrested.</p>
<p>But the biggest political disaster hit between December 2001 and March 2002: the VHP held the Government hostage in a major standoff in Ayodhya over the Ram temple. At the 10th anniversary of the destruction of the Babri mosque, the VHP wanted to perform a <i>sheela daan</i>, or a ceremony laying the foundation stone of the cherished temple at the disputed site. Tens of thousands of VHP activists amassed and threatened to overrun the site and forcibly build the temple. A grave threat of not only communal violence, but an outright breakdown of law and order owing to the defiance of the government by a religious organization hung over the nation. India's very secular foundations were shaken and the BJP fumbled to respond to and control its hardcore ally. Agreeing to a timely compromise, the ceremony was performed but off the controversial site, the offering accepted by a local government official. The standoff eased, and it is widely speculated that the Vajpayee administration threatened the VHP with grave consequences, including a permanent ban.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Just a week following the standoff, a train carriage carrying hundreds of VHP activists returning from Ayodhya was attacked by a Muslim mob in <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhra.html" title="Godhra">Godhra</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and the bogey was set afire, killing 59 activists. The result was an episode of communal violence in which over 2,000 people were killed and displaced. Three fourths of the killed were Muslims while the rest were Hindus. Organizations such as VHP affiliated with the ruling BJP, as well as the State government led by BJP leader and Chief Minister <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narendra_Modi_d1c1.html" title="Narendra Modi">Narendra Modi</a>, were accused of fomenting the violence, though this only remained to be an allegation. Vajpayee visited the state and publicly criticized the Chief Minister for not doing his moral duty to protect the people; he also spoke at a national party convention in <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a> in June, 2002 allegedly attacking Muslims for having tolerated the Godhra attackers, and not doing enough to counter Islamic terrorism entering the country. In a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_shuffle.html" title="Cabinet shuffle">Cabinet reshuffle</a>, his long-time and close associate Lal Krishna Advani was designated <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_India_a346.html" title="Deputy Prime Minister of India">Deputy Prime Minister of India</a>, and increased power in the party and the Cabinet, and more credibility with the RSS and the conservative Hindu base. In September 2002, Narendra Modi led the BJP to a major victory, and thus vindication through the state assembly elections. His defiant victory was seen standing right against the moral criticism handed down by the Prime Minister. (<i>See also</i>:<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a>)</p>
<p>In late 2002 and 2003 the government pushed economic reforms, and the country's <a href="../../../g/d/p/GDP_35c9.html" title="GDP">GDP</a> growth accelerated at record levels, exceeding 6-7%. Increasing foreign investment, modernization of public and industrial infrastructure, the creation of jobs, a rising high-tech and IT industry and urban modernization and expansion improved the nation's national image. Good crop harvests and strong industrial expansion also helped the economy. The Government reformed the tax system, increased the pace of reforms and pro-business initiatives, major irrigation and housing schemes and so on. The political energies of the BJP shifted to the rising urban middle-class and young people, who were positive and enthusiastic about the major economic expansion and future of the country.</p>
<p>In August 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced before Parliament his "absolute last" effort to achieve peace with Pakistan. Although the diplomatic process never truly set-off immediately, visits were exchanged by high-level officials and the military stand-off ended. The Pakistani President and Pakistani politicians, civil and religious leaders hailed this initiative as did the leaders of America, Europe and much of the world.</p>
<p>In November-December 2003, the BJP won three major state elections, fought mainly on development issues, without ideological campaigns. A major public relations campaign was launched to reach out to Muslims and stop the 2002 controversies from haunting the party's future. But the attention of the media and of millions now moved from Vajpayee to his more possible successor, L.K. Advani, although the question was never directly raised or contested in any way. Vajpayee's age, failing health and diminished physical and mental vigor were obvious factors in such speculations. Advani assumed greater responsibilities in the party, and although no perceivable conflict has been known to arise between the longtime friends and political colleagues, several embarrassing statements were made. Once Vajpayee said "Advani would lead the BJP in the elections," prompting Advani to clarify that he would merely lead the election campaign, not the party. And then the BJP President Venkiah Naidu used mythological references to depict Vajpayee as a <i>Vikas Purush</i>, (Man of Progress), comparing him to<i>Bhishma Pitamah</i> of the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> epic, a man respected by all political outfits and hundreds of millions of people. Advani was called the "Loh Purush" (Iron Man), a more potent reference suggestive of future developments.</p>
<p>As the BJP prepared for general elections in 2004, either early or late, Vajpayee was still the choice of the BJP, and crucially of the wider NDA for the prime minister's job.</p>

<p>Vajpayee is criticized for his reluctance to intervene in Gujarat government’s handling of the Gujarat riots. Within the <a href="../../../r/s/s/RSS_bf19.html" title="RSS">RSS</a>, he was often criticized for being moderate, and straying from the core ideology of the RSS.

<p>A.B. Vajpayee's BJP and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Alliance_8bc7.html" title="National Democratic Alliance">National Democratic Alliance</a> were expected to pick up more seats and score a major victory in the 2004 elections. The parliament was dissolved earlier than necessary in order to capitalize on the national economic boom and improved security and cultural atmosphere.</p>
<p>A vigorous BJP campaign did its best to highlight the major progress achieved, and win the votes of the traditionally averse Muslims for the BJP candidates. Controversial and ideological issues were side-stepped in favor of bread-butter economic issues. But by the time the first three phases of voting were over, it was clear that the BJP was losing too many important seats to retain a formidable position in Parliament. The BJP and its flagship coalition, the NDA, lost almost half their seats in parliamentane several prominent cabinet ministers were defeated, and regional, socialist and Communist parties quickly grouped round the resurgent Indian National Congress led by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonia_Gandhi_2b56.html" title="Sonia Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> to form a left-of-center <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Progressive_Alliance_d129.html" title="United Progressive Alliance">United Progressive Alliance</a>, which formed the government under Prime Minister Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manmohan_Singh_8054.html" title="Manmohan Singh">Manmohan Singh</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that Vajpayee attended the swearing-in of the new government despite his party's decision to boycott it symbolized the growing acrimony to come. Many criticized Vajpayee for sacrificing core issues like Hindutva and the Ram Temple, and going overboard to woo Muslims (the BJP lost the Muslim vote by a heavy margin), and even moving too early to elections. The pro-Vajpayee activists accused Narendra Modi's controversial regime in Gujarat and the obstructiveness of the Hindu hard-right VHP and RSS for the defeat. A possible factor behind the defeat was the widespread disenchantment amongst hundreds of millions of farmers, labourers and workers who were on the bottom-rung of society, mired in poverty, illiteracy and debt, and yet to cash in any benefit from the boom. While the BJP pandered to the rising middle-class of the cities, India's villages and small towns rallied behind pro-poor, socialistic political forces like the Congress and left parties.</p>
<p>A.B. Vajpayee expressed his anger and frustration with repeated signals of resignation and retirement. But at a high-level party meeting, he decided to give up the position of the Leader of the Opposition to his long-time friend, second-in-command and successor, <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lal_Krishna_Advani_3996.html" title="Lal Krishna Advani">Lal Krishna Advani</a>, who also became BJP President. Always a figure of consensus, Vajpayee became Chairman of the National Democratic Alliance. It is a widespread feeling with critics, journalists and many people that Vajpayee's time at the pinnacle of national politics and the BJP, and his position as the obvious BJP choice for Prime Minister is steadily fading. Vajpayee himself is taking more backseat roles and responsibilities, and his health ailments limit his ability to deal with the premier position in national life.</p>
<p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee's six years at the Prime Minister's Office led to a major transformation and expansion of the national economy. In the 1999 <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil_War_f86a.html" title="Kargil War">Kargil War</a>, his leadership defended the country's integrity and security, while his broad-minded statesmanship in 1999, 2001 and 2004 kept the country's safety, peace and future on the high-course despite many discouraging events, failures and threats. During his 50 years as Member of Parliament, Vajpayee has established impeccable and virtually infallible credentials as a man of principle, integrity and commitment in the world of Indian politics, and as a leading visionary and statesman of the world.</p>
<p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee sowed the seeds and rose with the growing nationalist movement in Indian politics. For four decades he was the flag-bearer, icon and undisputed leader of the Hindu nationalist political movement, working steadily through years of defeat and desolation to foster a major national movement, broad support amongst hundreds of millions and the leadership of the world's largest democracy and most diverse nation.</p>
<p>Vajpayee's government is criticized over its ignorance of the issues and concerns of India's poor millions, over the famous corruption scandals, and the episodes of communal violence and rise of both Hindu and Muslim radicalism in politics. While praised for his leadership during the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil_War_f86a.html" title="Kargil War">Kargil War</a> and for his peace efforts with Pakistan, the Vajpayee administration is blamed for not being able to detect and prevent two serious terrorist attacks on the country, and an incursion into Indian sovereign territory.</p>
<p>In addition, his opponents in the Congress have accused Vajpayee of having turned an approver against freedom fighters during the British regime in 1942. They have circulated certain documents in support of this accusation, and solicited testimonies. Vajpayee has denied these accusations <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99sep12/head6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99sep12/head6.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/timeout0702.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/timeout0702.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2010/stories/20030523008300600.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2010/stories/20030523008300600.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Vajpayee led a diverse, fractious coalition to complete a full five-year term in office, be the guiding light over a collage of political chaos. He gave stability and unity when the country was the least united, and security when the country was most susceptible. This included not only the security of the borders from invasion, but of the security of 100 million families with the provision of jobs and education in a solid, hopeful economic future, and the strategic national future security.</p>
<p>Despite the rejection of his party in 2004, Vajpayee has retained a position of esteem and respect amongst common people seldom offered to politicians in India. He was conferred Padma Vibhushan in 1992, Lokmanya Tilak Puruskar and the Bharat Ratna Pt. Govind Ballabh Pant Award for the Best Parliamentarian, both in 1994.</p>
<p>In December of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Vajpayee announced his retirement, declaring that he would not participate in the next general election. At a rally in the western city of Mumbai, Vajpayee said "I will not participate in any electoral politics. There are many other leaders to take forward the work which I and other senior leaders have been doing. In a now famous statement at the BJP's silver Jubilee rally at Mumbai's historic Shivaji Park, Vajpayee announced that "from now onwards, Lal Krishna Advani and Pramod Mahajan (a BJP leader from Maharashtra, shot fatally by his own brother.) would be the Ram-Laxman (the two godly brothers much revered and worshipped by Hindus) of the BJP."<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4567802.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4567802.stm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
