<p>I've added the removed section and included a ref. for discussion. It would be most helpful to show sources and data to allow this section to stand without dispute. An example would be college curriculum or other training that makes use of the Atari BASIC source code. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 21:54, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You reworded parts of the introduction I wrote<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atari_BASIC&amp;diff=49796342&amp;oldid=49746587" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atari_BASIC&amp;diff=49796342&amp;oldid=49746587" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> because of supposed speculation, which is understandable. However I have strong evidence for this thesis. If I publish, together with a friend of mine (who has also done a lot of research about these things), a short essay on his web page about what we found out, would that be sufficient to include it again? Or is such practice forwned upon? --Rtc 21:33, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have sources, I have no problems with that. I was only putting in info that was verifiable and sourced. I have a lot of info that I cannot include because I can't source it.

<p>Yes, I know. But the question was, if it is okay to simply publish it on a web page and then refer to that web page as a source? Perhaps you can do so for your information, too? --Rtc 10:48, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As long as it's not original research. Best to use a referenced source (original articles and documentation, for example). --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 19:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would most certainly be original research to publish it on the web page. Any information has been original research at one point in time. For example Wikipedia is citing academic journals all the time and there is clearly original research going on in there, isn't it? I mean you could refer to the web page then as a source. Why wouldn't that be okay? How exactly do I need to publish it in order for Wikipedia to accept it as not being original research? Or is original research conducted by wikipedians forbidden to be cited in wikipedia? Scientists have to be careful then not to register at Wikipedia if they want their theories being cited here&#160;;) --Rtc 00:24, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That doesn't quite answer my question. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#The role of expert editors</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#What_counts_as_a_reputable_publication.3F" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#What counts as a reputable publication?</a> shows that I'd need to publish my original research thesis in a reputable publication, but it does not say whether a website would be considered a reputable publication. I see websites being used as sources all over the place and most of them are surely personal efforts on some topic to just state obvious views that would otherwise be considered original research. Most if not all of them have not been peer reviewed. Perhaps you know some 8 bit magazine still active today in which I could publish the stuff? Perhaps that might be more considered a reputable publication than some random web site? --Rtc 13:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please get it: There are no sources I can show, because it is original research. The question is what I can do to make the theory (that is now original research), to be a theory that is not original research in the wikipedia sense. --Rtc 15:18, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But the nor policy says "If an expert editor has published the results of his or her research elsewhere, in a reputable publication, the editor can cite that source" but the discussion page is not 'elsewhere' --Rtc 15:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not only Wikipedia does not publish original research, it also does not conduct it, according to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy you directed me to. But "putting it on the discussion page" to allow "others to look at it and give suggestions" would be conducting original research! I see you cannot really help me with the problem. --Rtc 15:41, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's asking others how to proceed with this. BTW: You still haven't shown anything (source, info) to debate about. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 15:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>There is no source.</b> The original research information consists of an object code spectral analysis, which can show at least the Frank Ostrowski BASICs (even those for the Atari ST) to use exactly the parser architecture of ATARI BASIC. Since Turbo Basic still uses the file format of ATARI BASIC, the relationship is obvious. Those people with a deep knowledge of M68K GFA BASICs (Atari, Amiga) and its file formats also know that they are basically still intentical in architecture to ATARI BASIC. I am not saying that source code has been copied, but merely the architecture. --Rtc 16:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a reference to this (webbed) book, which has a brief account of the development of Atari Basic. It conflicts somewhat with the article - for one thing, it says that Atari Basic was spec'ed for 10K, not 8K. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 01:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It could have been Atari giving them (SMI) some leeway in size since Atari themselves were having problems fitting MS Basic into 8K. (Atari originally designed their system with 8K allocated to BASIC, before BASIC was developed). And they needed it fast. All moot of course. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 17:05, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there's a line saying that AB's <i>strings</i> were similar to those DGB, which is an obvious truism. They are also similar to C, for example. This whole article needs a massive re-write. Battling editors have managed to take what was essentially a pared-down version of my AB:GBU article and mangled it into an almost unreadable mess, while misleading the reader that the article is actually taken from other sources. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 20:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are some wrong informations in the article. I don't edit myself because my English is not very good:<br />
In Atari BASIC, "P." does not expand to "PRINT" as the article claims. It expands to "POINT". Probably because "PRINT" has already "?" as abbreviation. "PR." is not much longer anyway.<br />
The strings does not start at "location zero" as the article claims, but at location 1. So no compatibility problems are present because of that.<br />
Two dimensional arrays do exist in Atari BASIC. Although not for strings.<br />
Finally, "INPUT D:" will not input from disk, "INPUT #1" will, if I/O channel 1 is open for disk input.Cyco130 07:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to fix - I was going on many-years old memory there. Or would you like me to do these fixes? The string one is just wrong, the problem is at the "other end" when you're specifying lengths, like in MID$. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 13:14, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<i>Six months and many man-hours later, they were almost ready. But Atari had a deadline with the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) approaching and decided to ask for help.</i>"</p>
<p>Is this accurate? I'm curious, because I have a direct statement (in e-mail) from Bill that their stuff was 12 k and showed no signs of getting any smaller when OSS was called in. The statement is part of a larger history so I can't be sure he's talking about the same point in time that the article is, but I don't believe it is inaccurate. Another point to consider is that although the machines were announced at the CES, they didn't ship for another year (almost). If the MS version was <i>that</i> close, I simply can't see them going to OSS just for the CES, when they would already know they had lots of time. And finally, I seem to recall the MS version in the PET being about the same size too.</p>
<ul>
<li>sigh* If only they connected the whole 16 k to the "left" cart, all of this would be moot.</li>

<dd>It was from Bill Wilkinson, Atari cut out a lot from MS Basic to get it to fit in 8K. They were better off going with Atari BASIC from Shepardson. 8KB is very limiting for any BASIC. Can't do much with 8KB.—<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelladon_03d5.html" title="User:Pelladon">Pelladon</a> 08:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm referring to the timing. Bill was the one that told me it was still 12k when OSS got the contract. And seeing that the MS basic they did release was later (12k?) I'm somewhat skeptical about the history. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 13:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
