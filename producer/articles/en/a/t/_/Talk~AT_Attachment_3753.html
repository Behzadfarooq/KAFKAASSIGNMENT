<p>I thought ATA is a type of IDE drive/cable, not that they are the same thing, like this article says. the article on SATA says all ATA drives are IDE drives, not that they are the same thing <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_snare_e22d.html" title="User:The snare">The snare</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_snare_42d8.html" title="User talk:The snare">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_snare_fa2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/The snare">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I think the confusion comes from the fact that the abbreviation IDE has taken on a different meaning from the words that make it up. IDE at least in common use refers not to "integrated drive electronics" but to one particular system of connecting to integrated drive electronics. The same goes for HTML (one particular hypertext markup language, not hypertext markup languages in general) CSS (one particular system for cascading style sheets) etc. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 12:26, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The confusion comes from the fact that IDE was never properly spec'ed out.

<p>Here and elsewhere I see</p>
<p>"The 80-wire cable provides one ground wire to each signal wire.... Though the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins remains the same as on 40-conductor cables. The physical connectors are identical between the two cable types."</p>
<p>But nowhere does anyone explain how that works. Isn't anyone besides me curious? I've spent about an hour googling for a description of the 40-pin connector that magically connects very other wire in an 80-wire cable to ground. I *have* one of thesein my hand, and I may go crazy and just take it apart, thus wasting $2.50....</p>

<dd>The purpose of an 80 wire cable is to reduce capacitive coupling, a phenomenon that occurs between wires that carry signals at high frequencies. Putting a ground wire between data wires couples the data wires to ground instead of to another data wire, reducing interference in the data carrying wires.</dd>
<dd>It would seem necessary to have an 80 pin connector for 80 wires, however, there only needs to be one ground connector pin at most, although there are several shown in the diagram, and all of the ground wires share the ground connection, (they are connected in some way inside of the connector).

<dd>afaict its a special connector made specifically to do this extra grounding, not any kind of standard part from the electronics industry.

<p>In a comment imbedded in the article page, Plugwash asked:</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that the idea of master/slave probablly originated from the way the master is generally the boot drive and the slave is then acting as a slave to whatever the code loaded from the master decides to do&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>My response (I'm the guy who put in the "they aren't really called 'master' and 'slave'" paragraph):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That seems like quite a stretch to me. There is another hint of an origin back in the ATA-1 spec in the description of the SPSYNC (Spindle sync) interface signal (section 6.3.16). But even there, both devices could be "slaves" to a sync signal from the host controller! SPSYNC was relegated to simply "defined by the vendor" status in ATA-2 and dropped completely in ATA-3. It shared the same pin on the 40-pin connector with CSEL (cable select) and so when CSEL became more strongly recommended, SPSYNC had to go. And... shouldn't this sort of thing be in the talk page? <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 06:44, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Master and slave have less to do with the OS's conception of logical devices as they do with the AT BIOS and the origins of ATA itself. ATA's register set is based directly on the old Western Digital 1003 ST-506 controller board used in the AT (and cloned by just about everyone back in the pre-ATA days), and the 1003 could either have one drive as Drive 0, or two drives as Drive 0 and Drive 1 -- you couldn't have a single drive as Drive 1, because the BIOS wouldn't boot from it (and I think IBM's own BIOS would complain about it, actually). On ATA, this setup is emulated by the drives listening to the bus (all commands are available to both drives) and seeing what the DEV bit in the Device/Head register is set to, then only interpreting commands that it expects to see based on its jumper settings. This used to be undefined behavior in a single-drive-set-to-Slave system, but later versions of ATA let you run a drive jumpered as Slave or Drive 1 by itself, with some restrictions. Also, if the drives can't agree on who has control of the bus, you've got problems, and this was a big issue back in the early days (when there were various methods of deciding if there was a slave present).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, SPSYNC was an artifact of the days when drives didn't have a lot of on-board cache, and synchronising the spindles actually made a difference with access times; when drives started having caches capable of holding hundreds of sectors at a time (even a 512k cache, common in the late 1990s but puny by 2005 standards, can hold 1024 512-byte sectors...), this became a lot less important, and people stopped using it. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Cremeans_dd31.html" title="User:Lee Cremeans">-lee</a> 16:08, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article should mention what is the meaning of "Ultra DMA/100", "Ultra DMA/133", etc. I have always assumed the number was the maximum burst throughput in megabytes per second, but I've had a surprisingly difficult time looking for the answer to this.</p>
<p>While discussing the throughput rate, it would also be good to mention whether the /100 or /133 (etc) burst rate makes any real-world difference, typically, with a reference to typical sustained throughput rates of today's ATA hard disks. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 19:39, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. "Ultra DMA/100", etc., are unofficial names. Yes, the number is the max transfer rate on the bus in MB/sec. They're commonly used on drive boxes because it's far easier to remember that "Ultra DMA/100 means 100 MB/sec" than it is to remember that for the official name of "Ultra DMA 4." And yes, these make little difference for today's (or even tomorrow's) hard drives.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The short paragraph immediately above the "modes" table mentions this a bit. I've been thinking that that should go UNDER the "Modes" table, or at least under the heading where the table is, and that is a good place to amplify these points too. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 23:45, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The page says</p>
<p>One occasionally finds cables that allow for the connection of three ATA devices onto one IDE channel, but in this case one drive remains read-only (this type of configuration virtually never occurs).</p>
<p>and then someone added this comment: how is that done then?</p>
<p>I'd like to know that too. It seems to me that I may have seen (how's that for indefinite?) configurations like this involving some of those cheap ratty little tape drives sold for PCs. But I don't really believe it; I think I'm thinking of similar kluges on floppy cables, which I know did exist.</p>
<p>Whatever, such a configuration is absolutely not supported or allowed by the ATA specs.</p>
<p>My first impulse is to delete this reference completely, as in "no, it didn't ever happen." But I certainly haven't seen even a tiny fraction of all the nonstandard (or even all the standard) things that have been attached to PCs over the years. So... does anyone have anything more definite than a vague memory of how this worked? Since there's only one bit for "device address" in the ATA command structure I am not at all certain how this could have worked, but of course if someone has seen it working, that blows all theoretical arm-waving out of the water... <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 23:33, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It <i>could</i> work, theoretically, by commandeering one of the unused bits in the Device/Head register, but the other drives would have to know about what you did for it to work right. This works better on floppy setups because the floppy bus has 4 device select lines. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Cremeans_dd31.html" title="User:Lee Cremeans">-lee</a> 16:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>An ATA controller works by writing binary-coded commands into registers implemented on each device. One of these is called the Device register; each device has one (and several others). Unlike in older interfaces like ST-506, there are no "device select" lines in the cable. There are bits (the CS, chip select, and DA, device address) in the wires that indicate which register is being addressed, but whatever is sent is actually written into the selected registers of both devices on the cable. The devices figure out which commands to pay attention to and which to ignore by looking at the DEV bit in the Device register. When reading from device registers, only the device whose logical address ("device 0" or "device 1") matches this bit responds. Since there is only one bit there is no obvious way to support more than two devices! <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 03:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For all I know, the total number of addressable sectors was 2**28 (28 bit) from ATA-1 onwards, in both CHS and LBA mode. Which means 2**28 * 512 Byte = 128 GiB maximum disk size for all ATA specs prior to the introduction of the 48-bit extensions in ATA-6.</p>

7.2.3 Cylinder high register
This register contains the high order bits of the starting cylinder address
for any disk access. [...]
In LBA Mode this register contains Bits 16-23. At the end of the command,
this register is updated to reflect the current LBA Bits 16-23.
NOTE 4 - Prior to the introduction of this standard, only the lower 2 bits of
this register were valid, limiting cylinder address to 10 bits i.e., 1024
cylinders.
7.2.4 Cylinder low register
This register contains the low order 8 bits of the starting cylinder address
for any disk access. At the end of the command, this register is updated to
reflect the current cylinder number.
In LBA Mode this register contains Bits 8-15. At the end of the command, this
register is updated to reflect the current LBA Bits 8-15.
[...]
7.2.8 Drive/head register
[...]
- If L=0, HS3 through HS0 contain the binary coded address of the head to
be selected e.g., if HS3 through HS0 are 0011b, respectively, head 3
will be selected. HS3 is the most significant bit. At command
completion, these bits are updated to reflect the currently selected
head.
- If L=1, HS3 through HS0 contain bits 24-27 of the LBA. At command
completion, these bits are updated to reflect the current LBA bits
24-27.
[...]
7.2.12 Sector number register
This register contains the starting sector number for any disk data access for
the subsequent command. The sector number may be from 1 to the maximum number
of sectors per track.
In LBA Mode this register contains Bits 0-7.
</pre>
<p>There you have it. 16+4+8=28 bits for the sector addressing, meaning 128 GiB addressable space, in both CHS and LBA mode, from ATA-1 onwards. *prior to ATA-1*, there were only 10 bits for the cylinder number, giving 10+4+8=22 bits for the sector addressing and 2 GiB addressable space.</p>
<p>The "maximum disk size" values in the article appear to be limitations mandated by various MS-DOS and/or BIOS routines (or weird combinations of both) that were in use at one time or another. There were no such limits in the underlying ATA controllers.</p>

<dd>ATA devices have suffered from a number of "barriers" in terms of how much data they can handle. However, new addressing systems and programming techniques have broken most of these barriers.

<dd>The drive works so far because its internals automatically reset themselves at power-up. The product manual of Seagate CP2064 (20 MB, mfd. 1990) states that #1 is only active at power-up as well -- perhaps a "just to be sure" from the host adapter. Because power-on-reset circuitries are similar and reliable unless in case of a slow voltage rise, the drive might remain uninitialized after a short brownout which nonetheless manages to reset the motherboard. As long as the power is consistent and the PSU does its job, you won't notice anything. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaimhe_591e.html" title="User:Saimhe">saimhe</a> 15:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article frequently suggests that IDE was an early name given to ATA, but if ATA really does stand for "AT attachment", then this can't be the case.

<dd>I also agree that the PIO page should remain separate.

<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_select.html" title="Cable select">Cable select</a> article amounts to three paragraphs and mostly repeats information already available here. The wikipedia "how to" page on merging suggests four good reasons for merging a page. This qualifies under three of the four. If the "cable select" concept applied to anything but ATA that would be a different story, but it does not. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 20:16, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Merge. Here's a picture from that page, just in case anyone wants it again. Please note though that the text is inconsistent with the usual implementation of CS on 40-conductor cables, wherein "slave" goes at the end.</dd>

<p>UDMA is a group of ATA transfer modes and thus <b>not</b> a synonym for ATA as claimed in the second paragraph. (130.234.5.136)</p>
