Dictionary definition at the moment. Does it stand a chance of being expanded.. the current content could be in-lined into homemaker which is the only place that links to it? Or is the term more general than a homemaking role? I ask partly because this term doesn't not exist in the UK? <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 14:24, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it has anything to do with homemaking. An 'at-will' employee just doesn't have the right to any sort of 'due-process' before they can be fired (or sacked for you Brits). Once the boss says 'you're fired', that's it, time to clean out your desk.</dd>

<dd>We have such jobs in Britain... but much more likely to be manual work than a desk job.

<dd>"An 'at-will' employee just doesn't have the right to any sort of 'due-process' before they can be fired" - and likewise for the employee - the employee can quit at any time, for any reason (though like the article says, this is overwhelmingly to the benefit of the employer). Let's face it - our labor is a commodity just like everything else businesses purchase to produce their products.&#160;:) If they want to stop purchasing from a particular supplier, that's their prerogative. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheese_Sandwich_fb5d.html" title="User:Cheese Sandwich">Cheese Sandwich</a> 19:58, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Labor is not a commodity. First of all, it's not tangible, it's a service, which by many definitions would exclude it. Anyway, in the USA at least it's legally not a commodity. It's a little disheartening every time someone calls it a commodity. There is a significant difference between money in compensation and money derived through commerce. The most obvious being that workers do not incorporate themselves as businesses&#160;:-|</p>

<p>Labor is indeed considered an <i>expendable</i> commodity in much of the United States. The majority of states follow at-will employment, and even if discrimination has taken place, it is very difficult to prove, as lawyers in hardline at-will states are often reluctant to take on these cases. This is not likely to change anytime soon, with the decline of organized labor and the ascendancy of pro-management Republican policies since the 1980s.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 05:18, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the heading on the common law exceptions to eliminate the phrase about "swallowing the rule." I would argue that the common law exceptions are nowhere near the point of "swallowing the rule" in the United States. The vast majority of employment situations may be described by the general rule of employment at will (employer may discharge the employee "for good cause, for no cause, or even for bad cause"), subject to the very limited case law exceptions and of course the statutory exceptions as explained in the article. <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 19:44, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. I have no idea which state that contributor must have been from, but it must be a small, weird outlier state (like Alabama or Maine). At-will is still the overwhelmingly dominant rule in most states. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 23:44, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At will employment.....all employment is at will. There are ways to fire anyone regardless of any law that could be created. Any job worth the cost of fighting for already has a legal team who could keep litagation going much longer than any common person has money to contest it in court. Less taxpayer money should be spent, in this country, for issues like this. As far as screaming minority..... good luck ..... First you would have to cure all the components associated with fraud, lies, and dirty dealing. Any headway made to "right the wrongs" would be constantly knocked back to "beginning steps" by any number of people along the way. Besides who would be running the government then? Considering all the steps necessary to change any misjustice, we will still be screaming minority and misjustice in another 100 years. In answer to merging the topics....it would make the information easier to find for people on both sides of the equation. Cracks like the one about Alabama would help keep responces shorter. My SOAP BOX answer was necessitated by that glib comment. Radiologyinstructor 00:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)Drenda Benn</p>

<p>I removed the following statement:</p>
<p>"All U.S. states recognize retaliatory discharge as an exception to the at-will rule."</p>
<p>Since I could find no basis for it. IANAL, but the reference that I found specifically refuted retaliation as a cause of action unless it violated public policy or some statute.
