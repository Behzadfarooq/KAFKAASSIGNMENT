<p>Following article copied from www.LinkersConnections.com/Articles.htm.</p>
<p><br />
- * Where * appears: To see map, photo, picture or sketch go to www.LinkersConnections.com/Article.htm.</p>
<p>James Churchward presents a map of Atlantis as part of a world map etched into a clay tablet and star dated beyond 25,000 years ago. He shows pottery found by Dr. Henry Schliemann of Troy fame proclaiming they are gifts from Atlantis. Phoenician hieroglyphics read: “From the King of Chronos of Atlantis.” + IIRC, Thera was featured in a PBS special in the late 1980's and mentioned as a possible Atlantis. It seems like many members of the general public would be familiar with this theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient map of Atlantis</li>
</ul>
<p>A matching pottery vessel to a vase found by Schliemann was identical to another vase in a collection in the Paris Louvre that came from Tiahuanaco, Bolivia. It bears the same markings, size and shape, as if made in the same factory and is marked with the same symbol for Atlantis. Two identical vases found worlds apart. Tiahuanaco is 12,500 feet up in the Andes and Troy is on the Mediterranean Coast. + This article in general seems to be sloppy, rambling and lacking in NPOV. It reflects more the wishes of woo-woo's than the historical facts and the opinions of scholars.</p>
<p>Churchward presents several books including photos and sketches of multiple references to Atlantis and Mu throughout archeological history. He presents the most all-encompassing information promoting the existence of both Atlantis and Mu of any person ever. Yet he is barely noted by today’s “scientists.” Even the credible scientists daring to go out on a limb advancing their own theories that Atlantis was in the Mediterranean, North America or Artic do not get the big picture portrayed by Churchward. + --HK, 9 Aug 2005</p>
<pre>
* Collapsed Gas Belts and Chambers Sunk Atlantis
</pre>
<p>Churchward's theory is that gas belts and chambers, created like trapped bubbles in bread, left over from the cooling earth, eventually collapsed underneath Atlantis sinking it below the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The ancient world map clearly shows a giant inland sea where the Amazon basin is now. When Atlantis sunk this inland Sea drained and became swamp. The crucial point is the Andes were not mountains yet. From the inland-most western edge of the Amazon Sea where the great port of Tiahuanaco is located, it is only a hundred miles or so to the Pacific Ocean and from there a short sea voyage of a thousand miles or so to the great continent of MU, the motherland of all earth's continents.</p>
<p>Today, Tiahuanaco is a giant ruin of tumbled cut stone blocks weighing 350 tons or more. Located 12 miles off the shore of Lake Titicaca, Peru, at 12,500 feet, it is surrounded by examples of marine life and salt crystals. Either Tiahuanaco was down or the sea was up. Churchward’s interpretation of these blocks being part of stone canals for inland sea travel makes perfect sense if you accept that Tiahuanaco was at sea level in past history. Accept that as fact, eliminate the Andes as a physical impediment and Tiahuanaco becomes a major center of commerce linking South America with Mu to the west and east across the Amazonian Sea, to Atlantis and Africa/Asia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines of Colonization: Mu to Atlantis</li>
</ul>
<p>It was only a thousand miles or so by sea from Mu to South America. A short portage of a hundred miles or so from western South America to Tiahuanaco, exchange goods and continue easterly across the Amazon Sea and up the east coast of South America till you run into Atlantis. Keep going north to the Canary Islands, at that time an Atlantian mountain chain, and from there only 70 miles or so of open water to Africa. Bring on the trade. Bring on the cocaine from South America that was traded to the Egyptians and can still be found traces of cocaine in 3,500 year old mummies.</p>
<p>If Atlantis was a fact, then it was much like America is today: totally dominate in economics, commerce, finance, military and politics. In short, Atlantis ruled the world. Its influence was felt everywhere. Look at the map with Atlantis as a continent occupying most of today’s Atlantic Ocean and it is easy to see a water-to-land world much easier to navigate than our oceans today. Atlantis ruled the world and left its imprint in many places. Yet Mu was the motherland and little to no attention is given to Mu by even alternative “scientists” today.</p>
<p>Mu must be included whenever consideration is given to Atlantis because they were The World, then. Accept Mu, and you can accept the giant carved stone head that sits outside the Mexico City Museum entrance, a head so large and out of place they did not even include it inside the Museum. A 12 foot high stone head of a Negro from pre-Columbian history found in Mexico is one hell of an anomaly to ignore, but scientists have done a most excellent job of doing just that. The curly hair, ridged eyebrows, big lips and multiple “African” features leave no doubt that this is the head of a Negro-not a Mayan, Aztec nor native American of any kind.</p>
<p>Simple question for you, the reader: Where else do you find giant heads and statues? Think of Easter Island and throughout the Pacific Islands. Giant heads and statues were common to Mu. The Pacific islands are mountain tops left over from Mu, just as the Canary Islands and Azores are mountain tops left over from Atlantis.</p>
<p>Africans in Maya Land or Were They from Mu?</p>
<p>Inside the Mexico Museum are several thousand statues unearthed from Mayan and Aztec ruins throughout Mexico. The majority look Aztec or Mayan. But a few look distinctly African (Negro), Asian (Chinese) and Asian (Aryan/Indian). I took individual photos of hundreds of these statues and plan to put them up on the internet for all to see. Not much for me to speak about. The statues speak for themselves. Non-native races from around the world were known to the locals in what is now Mexico and Central America, meaning there was a lot of world-wide commerce and travel taking place in an era of human history that conflicts with current “scientific” assumptions. So of course the giant head has been relegated to the anomaly dust bin. +</p>
<p>Thor Heyerdahl's Contiki reed boat expedition proved two things: + 1. Reed boats could never support commerce across today’s oceans. + 2. There was no other type of boat possible to sail the seas going back to commonly accepted points in ancient history beginning with our current era.</p>
<p>So how did pre-Columbians know what other races looked like? Accept Atlantis and Mu and the whole world makes much more sense. World wide travel was common enough that statues were made of travelers from other parts of the world just as we take photos today of guests from other countries noting their differences in dress and appearance. On a larger scale, civilization leaves giant relics carved in stone, built to last forever, as reminders of our past to consider today and not to throw into the obscurity of anomalous fact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Semitic Head</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring back one microbe from Mars and the scientists will blow that up into the big picture explaining how life developed, components of mineral building blocks, amino acids, environmental factors contributing to evolution and dispersion, etc, on and on. All we need is a simple microbe from Mars and the whole Universe opens up to new “facts” of life throughout the universes. We will not be alone any longer if we can just find one microbe from Mars.</p>
<p>Yet our ancestors left us literal tons of evidence everywhere on earth of a previous superior Era of human development. “Scientists” continue to ignore and obscure because they can not explain, nor speculate for, anything contrary to commonly accepted theories of human evolution. Can’t even speculate and dare they do so, they will be ridiculed and fired. That is some heavy shit to hold over anyone. Not many a man will subject himself to ridicule and complete loss of income for any reason let alone speculate about a GIANT STONE HEAD in Mexico that defies commonly accepted scientific thinking.</p>
<p>So let’s start connecting the dots. We have Churchward’s volumes written in the 1930’s and pretty much ignored. We have hundreds of facts to support Atlantis and anyone can do a search on the internet under Atlantis or any reference to it and find days worth of reading by scientists who have put up scientific evidence supporting the possibility of Atlantis being in the Atlantic Ocean. Stories about Atlantis can be found in almost every issue of Atlantis Rising or Nexus, two most outstanding examples of alternative media. Even TV has been showing numerous Atlantis stories.</p>
<p>I will include my own “facts” later. We now need to connect more dots. Maybe we should start with the forest instead of the trees; the trees being all the independent facts lying about the world in museums, repositories, sites, and collections everywhere, and the forest, or bigger picture, we are trying to identify. Everyone is focused on finding the clues, the scientific facts to support their conclusions regarding the location of Atlantis. Until actual ruins are found that say here is the capitol of Atlantis, we are stuck in one point of history unable to see a much grander picture. The very scientific process we so depend on to give us the facts to increase our knowledge actually inhibits our consciousness and ability to put a bigger picture together. Add Religious doctrine to current civilization and science stalls because everything now has limits. Can’t do this, don’t go there. Speculation is fine but don’t publish it and never promote it. Nothing can disturb the status quo; or risk career limbo, poverty and ridicule.</p>
<p>America and the scientific community are most expert at killing messengers who disturb the status quo. We all suffer for this lack of discussion regarding our ancestors. So what, you say? I love to answer a question with a question.</p>
<p>Does History Repeat Itself? If so, who cares? What the hell does ancient history have to do with today? Great, great, great, …, grand-pappy Urgh from 10,000 BC is always shown as a Neanderthal clothed in Woolly Mammoth hair skin carrying a club. A bit too primitive for us to even consider as it relates to today, you say. Time to connect the dots again…</p>
<p>Why was the guy such a primitive in the first place? Could he be a survivor from cataclysmic earth destruction? Could his relatives have been Kings and Queens, Rich and Famous people from a previous era? And here, he is nothing but a survivalist clubbing small game for dinner while he remembers his parents lavish feasts in opulent quarters as nothing more than distant past.</p>
<p>Picture going back from such an image to another era that preceded our current era, a time when Atlantis ruled and Mu was the Motherland. All is gone. So what? Well, what if what happened to Atlantis and Mu is a naturally occurring event that is predictable, or should I say “prophetic”? Christ was a Prophet. The Bible proclaims the end of the world and salvation in a new location called heaven. How much prophecy is based upon predictions which are based upon facts? We can predict all kinds of astronomical events from meteor showers, comets, eclipses etc. that would seem prophetic to the ignorant.</p>
<p>Now picture that same transition from a Golden Era to a Stone Age Era repeating itself again, because of a naturally occurring event that is predictable and due to repeat itself in our lifetime. Call it the Tribulation and Armageddon, or the Tilt, or just plain The End of the World as we know it, and it is due in our life time. Just how much of a survivalist are you? Thinking in the Big Picture, the End of the World picture, our concepts of survival are too limited. We think of short term disasters holding out until help arrives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Survival Without Help Coming</li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting the Dots means time to speculate on survival without help coming. Now what are you going to take with you? A few months of packaged food is worth about the same as your medical kit, nothing but a band-aid for the real Deal. Think bigger. We are talking rebuilding Civilization. We need to survive the means to produce a can of food rather than take as many cans of food we estimate we need to survive. It is time to turn around our thinking.</p>
<p>The End of the World is a classic example of making lemonade out of lemons. We are about to be handed the biggest lemon ever, the end of civilization as we know it, and now we have to plan to make lemonade. It is a great opportunity to recast our civilization in whole new concepts from what we have today that so exploits the earth for so few. For all those who have given up, don’t vote, stay to themselves, shake their head at society today and wish things could be better: Wise up! This is as good as it gets and it is all downhill now, all the way to the end as we know it. If you survive you get to be the seed-stock for a whole new Era. You can make it a Golden Era, or you can simply kiss your ass goodbye and hope for the best in a place called Heaven. In either case it is time to get your shit together. Think BIG PICTURE. ...CONNECT…the…DOTS…</p>
<p>Do you really want to rub sticks together again just to start a fire? We are getting another chance to rebuild, starting at a higher level than the last time, if we can only see the BIG PICTURE.</p>
<p>Additional notes: 1. Recent DNA and RNA blood testing of populations in Portugal, the Basque Region, Morocco, The Canary Islands and Azores have shown a unique blood link that is also rare among the rest of the world population. 2. Recent explorations have found what appears to be a huge sunken city 2,200 feet down off the coast of Cuba. The find has been shown on cable TV and is located on a giant flat plane of sea bottom. A husband/wife team is returning in the Fall of 2005 with high intensity lights and better equipment to explore the find.</p>

<p>Why is <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thera.html" title="Thera">Thera</a> mentioned twice in the timeline but not once in the "Locations" section? Isn't it a credible Mediterranean location? I know the Atlantis fans don't consider it as sexy as some of the other sites (which is obvious by the hardly-NPOV comments appended to the Thera mentions) but given that continents far from Greece get mentions, why doesn't Thera even get a paragraph?</p>
<p>IIRC, Thera was featured in a PBS special in the late 1980's and mentioned as a possible Atlantis. It seems like many members of the general public would be familiar with this theory.</p>

<p>If Atlantis is suppose to have existed somewhere in the Atlantic between Europe and the Americas, had contact with the peoples of Europe, would it also seem possible they had contact with the peoples of the Americas? Is there any thing in either the oral or written histories of the native American inhabitants that mentions contacts with people from Atlantis or something that could point to Atlantis?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks for the altiplano info!! Can you please clarify why cocaine is considered to support this theory?? (Found in Egyptian mummies, right?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Out only ancient source for the existance of Atlantis is Plato, who claims that his father got the story from some Egyptian. The cocaine in the mummy shows that there had to be cross Atlantic contact of some sort or another (perhaps even just sporadic) in ancient times. Proving that there was contact is a necessary step to link a South American Atlantis to Plato. --BlackGriffen</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree!! Finding cocaine in Egyptian mummies is very interesting!! But our Wikipedia Atlantis entry doesn't mention that cocaine WAS found in Egyptian mummies. It just says that cocaine is evidence of contact with Egypt. I think we need to clarify this. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The notion that the cocaine finds in the mummies are legitimate is vulerantly rejected by most archaeologists. Most do not like anything that upsets established notions, such as that nobody crossed the Atlantic before Colombus. By the way, some archaeologists have said in recent years that they believe Europeans may have crossed the atlantic in ice-age times due to the similarity of tools found on both sides of the atlantic.</dd>

<p>"Atlantis in Gibraltar, between Iberia and Africa"</p>
<p>Comparisons between the theory of the Hispano-american investigator Georgeos Diaz-Montexano and French geologist Jacques Collina-Girard. Simple Coincidences or Plagiarism?</p>
<p>By María Fdez-Valmayor</p>
<p>Dear Sirs:</p>
<p>The French geologist Jacques Collina-Girard claims no one before him (Sept, 2001, publication date of his article) had realized Atlantis Island could be located in one of the sunken islands or shoals at the Strait of Gibraltar, which was exactly where hispano-american investigator Georgeos Díaz-Montexano has been upholding for the last years: he could prove the first publication of his theory was in April, 2000 (see: <a href="http://civilizaciones.webcindario.com/news31.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://civilizaciones.webcindario.com/news31.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Proofs 1 and <a href="http://civilizaciones.webcindario.com/release_news.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://civilizaciones.webcindario.com/release_news.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Proofs 2)</p>
<p>Georgeos Díaz-Montexano ----- Theory in April, 2000 Jacques Collina-Girard -- Theory in September, 2001</p>
<p>Collina-Girand has successfully confused the National Geographic Society, as well as everyone else, with his "influence", "degrees", and "academic references". He has "more credibility" than Georgeos Díaz, as he is part of the "oficial" and "academic world". However, he is neither entitled to nor has the right to take advantage of someone's effort and intellectual property, even from an "amateur".</p>
<p>Anyway, this point is, in fact, easy to solve (both in front of public opinion and court, if there was no other way but turn to Law): In order to prove Collina-Girard has formulated a theory almost identical if not really similar to Georgeos Diaz-Montexano's one, at least in the most fundamental points and the theoretical statement, he just needs to settle two obstacle, from my on point of view, easy to overcome.</p>
<p>1. He has to prove that those who read the basic statements of Collina-Girard's theory, which was same as Georgeos Diaz's, would find both theories similiar or almost identical to each other, close enough for them to be easy confused, regardless of who was the first person to write it. So, first of all, it would be necessary to lay down how close the two basic statements are: the major defence of Collina-Girard's is still that both theories are "totally different". Of course, what else would he say!</p>
<p>If there is a high similitude between both basic statements of this two theories, then, we have a problem, as both autors cannot claim in their writtings, and in front of mass media, they are the original creators of it. It can only be one, and this point could be solve if one of them says so, in public, that is, his theory is later, just a "simple" and "curious casuality". If the secondary or later author keeps saying everywhere in mass media that he was the first to announce that theory, then, of course, he would be damaging the original and previous author, who won't be able to get neither financing nor any support to develop his theory, as everybody would argue there's a previous investigator claiming to have been developing the same statement before.</p>
<p>2. So after laying down how close to eah other the basic statements are, it would be necessary to show who was the first publishing it. There're magazines and news to demostrate this point.</p>
<p>To make it easy, I've arranged a short article and clear comparative table, with the basic statements of both theories, showing the most relevant points people can see when reading them. Accurately, these comparisions should be done with investigators' first publicacions, instead of their later developing of themselves. And so it is. We have compared the main statements of both theories in Georgeos' first publication (the mass media magazine "Más Allá de la Ciencia" -Beyong Science-, April, 2000), and Jacques Collina-Girard's, in Science Academy, September, 2001. The French geologist submitted a report, with date March 15th, 2001, to French Science Academy. Collina-Girard states this theory came up to his mind just by chance in January, 2001, but the report was not accepted until June, 2001, and published in September, 2001. So, before September, 2001, no one could neither know nor even think Collina-Girard's theory did exist. Up until that date, the only theory about "Atlantis in Gibraltar, between Iberia and Morocco" was Georgeos Diaz's statement. Also, as the bulletin where Collina-Girard published his "pseudo-theory" would only circulate in academic media, it hadn't reached outside if it wasn't for the big divulgation campaign at the end of September, 2001, using all international mass media.</p>
<p>Why did they do so?</p>
<p>How many relevant and even more original reports are submitted every year to Science Academy, no announced at any international mass media?</p>
<p>Why even, being Atlantis a "taboo" topic, with a really bad image for scientific society, all institutions and media regarding them hastened to support this "pseudo-theory" divulgation campaign, Collina-Girard's (the Georgeos's theory) "Atlantis in Gibraltar, between Iberia and Africa"?</p>
<p>The French scientist (Jacques Collina-Girard and his team) did know perfectly Georgeos Diaz's investigations, and, convinced of his higher scientific possiblities, they planned to steal Georgeos Diaz's theory as soon as they realized he was not part of any University, with neither possible credibility nor institutional support with him. Looks like, as we have seen, these French "scientists" did think it is the "oficial science", not again "amateurs", the ones to represent and take the glory for (maybe, who knows) the scientific discovery of Atlantis. This is not the first time in History, "so-called" academic "scientist"had tried the same, not only against Spanish investigators.</p>
<p>In any case, we need your most sincere opinion and votes, after reading this article and analyzing the comparative table between both theories:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atlantis in the Sea of Azov</span></h2>
<p>Atlantis Motherland book, by authors Flying Eagle and Whispering Wind, published in 2003, locates the Island of Atlantis beneath the Sea of Azov and on the adjacent fertile plains to the west in Ukraine and to the east in Krasnodar Kray, Russia. Their research is based on tectonic evidence of a massive earthquake centered at Kerch, at the end of the Pleistocene and evidence of a great flood at the end of the Younger Dryas ice age, in 11,600 BP. This date corresponds exactly with the date set by an aged Egyptian priest for the destruction of Atlantis, as recorded in the dialogues of Plato.</p>
<p>Plato’s writings report that the Island of Atlantis was not an island in the open sea; it was created by the ancient Atlanteans by excavating an incredible ditch around a fertile plain, located north of a great sea, and surrounded by a boundless continent. A massive earthquake caused the island to sink, creating a new sea, which according to Eagle/Wind is the Sea of Azov. The violent earthquakes and floods left the new sea “impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way.” The aged priest refers to the shoals of mud as still existing at that time. The Sea of Azov was blocked by shoals of mud at that time, and would still be today without regular dredging.</p>
<p>Numerous other similarities with Plato's description of Atlantis are presented by Eagle/Wind. Plato’s writings reveal that red, white and black rock was quarried from beneath the City of Atlantis. There are miles of tunnels beneath the city of Kerch; where red, white and black rock is still being quarried.</p>
<p>Plato's writings describe a hill, where the Citadel of Atlantis once stood, located on the northern shore of a great sea. Mithridat Hill rises up in the middle of Kerch, on the northern shore of the Black Sea. In ancient times the Black Sea was known as the Pontus. Pontus is also the name of a pre-Olympian god of the sea, who later became known as Poseidon, the legendary founder of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Other similarities listed by Eagle/Wind are; settlements of primal man, an abundance of hydrothermal energy, to create the hot water fountains of Atlantis, and mineral springs to create the cold water fountains of Atlantis. There were mountain villages, whimsical precipitous cliffs on the side of the sea, very fertile land, vast canal systems, two harvests per year, all the metals required for coating the walls and creating the temples, palaces and statues described as having existed in the Citadel of Atlantis. There was an abundant variety of flora and fauna, including bulls, horses, mammoths and even orchards of chestnut trees.</p>
<p>Flying Eagle and Whispering Wind have published a theory regarding the devastating flood that destroyed Atlantis, which they call THE GREAT ATLANTIS FLOOD, One Terrible Day and Night of Misfortune; the extraordinary inundation of Atlantis and Attica. Their theory proposes that, with over one third of Europe draining into the land-locked Black Sea, at the end of the Younger Dryas, the level of the Black Sea rose to within 20 meters of its current level. A devastating earthquake and resulting tsunami increased the hydraulic pressure on a proposed subterranean outflow channel, flowing beneath the Bosporus land bridge and the present day Sea of Marmara and northern Aegean Sea, causing this subterranean channel to catastrophically rupture, generating the “extraordinary inundation” of Attica. The Island of Atlantis, Attica and lands of the Hellenes were all destroyed by the catastrophe and resulting widespread disease. This event created the necessity to re-locate ancient Athens from where it was located before the war with Atlantis. The Egyptian priest described the re-founding of Athens as occurring at the same time as the destruction of Atlantis.</p>
