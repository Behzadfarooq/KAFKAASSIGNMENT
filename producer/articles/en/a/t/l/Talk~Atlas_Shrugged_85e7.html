<p>I have eliminated the Huffington's criticism; it is a passing comment on a relatively minor aspect of the novel. CEO's don't act like the characters in Atlas Shrugged? Peers of England don't act like Gwynplaine in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Laughs_4214.html" title="The Man Who Laughs">The Man Who Laughs</a> either. The elimination of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Bloom_486b.html" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> comment seems to be a concerted effort to eliminate anything at all flattering to Atlas Shrugged. Bloom is probably the most respected literary critic today, so this seems strange. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 11:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This line is not correct: "Rand herself wrote that the separation of fiction and serious philosophical ideas is absurd, because art is the representation of philosophical judgments." This was simply not Rand's position. Art according to Rand, did have SOME philosophical conetent, but not necessarily "serious philosophical ideas." <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 03:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The last time I added the fact she was Jewish to this article, a user reverted with this statement, "{she didn't identify as Jewish and even swiched to a non-"Jewish-sounding" name)"</p>
<p>I changed it back, indicating that she was, in fact, a Jew. The way the article read before (Russian-born writer) one might be under the impression that she was of Russian blood. But clearly, any researcher on this subject knows that she was Jewish and many of her friends were Jewish as well. I added the 'jew factor' in because I did not want any misunderstandings in the article, and I think we should celebrate her diversity.</p>

actually, she may have been jewish born (she was) but she was an athiest. And to this comment: "and I think we should celebrate her diversity." would have offended her. I think anyone that has read any of her work, like her or not would agree with that.</p>

In various articles throughout wiki, there are insertions of who is a jew, as though it's of some note-worthy importance. Perhaps we should be outlining some other imprtant factors, like who is a white person of french ancestry and agnostic in beliefs. we should also note his/her shoe sizes and bady fat percentages.

<p>I'm not entirely against the changes made to the Modern Library section, but one line didn't need to be removed. The line in which Ray Jenkins claims that "Rand's unwillingness to cut the size of the book was a sign of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomania</a>" was sourced, yet it deleted without explaination. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 23:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That quote is more about Ayn Rand than about <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. The poll is directly relevant and Jenkins gives one possible explanation of it ("great American cult")—though even that is a little attenuated—and the other commentary about her works being deplored by critics and the length of the speech is directly related to the book. Directly relevant information would be that the book is long and that she refused to cut it down, with critics saying it is loose and could have been refined. The criticism is already too loosely connected as it is; it is turning into a list of every newspaper article, etc. that has ever been published about the book. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the above discussion about Huffington's criticism, and I'm having a hard time understanding why it's the <i>anti</i>-Rand people who want to keep it in. The Huffington quote basically reveals she didn't actually read past about chapter two. Therefore, even with the caveat that she's wrong in that statement, it basically gives the impression that critics of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> have to resort to uninformed, and erroneous statements in order to find something wrong with it. When that is listed as a prominent criticism, it makes the reader wonder if there even is a non-clueless criticism of the book. If I were trying to put Rand in the best light possible, I would probably want to include only the most ridiculous criticisms, and this one qualifies. So, if your goal is perhaps to make sure the anti-Rand views are best expressed, I really have to question if that goal is achieved by inclusion of Huffington's criticism. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 14:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why is it that every time a Randist criticizes their critics they always claim that the critic is stupid or didn't read the book? Can't you actually refute the argument instead of resorting to illogical ad hominem attacks?

<dd>Assuming you're being serious, the rebuttal is given in the article: <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> has numerous CEO's who demanded government intervention in their favor, so it makes no sense to claim that AS portrays CEO's in general as anti-government intervention. It portrays anti-intervention CEO's as good, and pro-intervention CEO's as bad. Again, if I were trying to promote Rand, I would *love* to include the Huffington to quote in order or portray all criticism as stemming merely from being misinformed. What I don't understand is why <i>you</i> want critics to look stupid. If you're okay with that, so am I. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 16:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Huffington is speaking about CEOs in general and the Enron executives in particular and comparing them to Rand's ideal businessman; that's not to say Huffington is unaware that not every businessman in <i>AS</i> meets Rand's ideal. What sounds ignorant in that paragraph is the attempted refutation, "However, Rand does show examples of businessmen who act in such a manner i.e. Orren Boyle, Jim Taggart", since Huffington never claimed Rand didn't show such examples. It's clear Boyle and Taggart aren't Rand's ideal businessman, so they're irrelevant to Huffington's comments. That said, however, I don't know how appropriate a discussion of Huffington's article is in the "Critical reception" section, since she isn't actually criticizing <i>AS</i> in it, she's criticizing American businessmen for not living up to the Randian ideal. At worst, she's indirectly criticizing the Randian ideal for being unrealistic, but she doesn't come out and say that. I'm also not convinced the South Park reference belongs in "Critical reception", since it's really just a throw-away joke that is almost certainly more about the length and "heavy slogging" of the book than its philosophical content: <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_Republican_1c49.html" title="South Park Republican">South Park Republicanism</a> is, after all, very close to Randian Objectivism, with perhaps a little less misanthropy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 17:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then shouldn't we remove the Huffington bit? I don't see how it's notable as criticism of the AS. I read the whole piece and I still don't see it. It's not that I want to suppress criticism. I'm worried about the soft bias of putting in only the weakest or most tangential criticisms so as to make it appear no one has serious arguments against it. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 20:07, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You do know that you could add more criticisms to the section yourself.

<p>I've removed some of the content in the criticism section. Having contextless opinions like "people read the novel for the fornicating bits" or the novel reads like "a novelization of Mein Kampf by Barbara Cartland" is pointless. It is akin to saying "in the opinion of {some reviewer} Atlas Shrugged sucks." I have left the more substansive reviews, positive or negative, that actually say something about the novel (right or wrong).

<dd>LGagnon, I'm not sure you understand how the criticism section looks to an outsider. Let's say I'm neutral. Let's say I just read the book. Then I come to Wikipedia to look for the criticisms. Then I see:
<dl>
<dd>Reviewer X said it's like Mein Kampf.</dd>
<dd>Reviewer Y said people like to read the dirty parts.</dd>
<dd>Reviewer Z said a South Park episode joked about the length.</dd>
<dd>Reviewer Z1 said that a lot of people are like the jerks in the book.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What conclusion would I draw? Most people, seeing those criticisms dominate the criticism section, would think, "Hey, no one can offer a really substantial criticism. Maybe no one has any substantive objection to the book's theme. Maybe Rand is on to something." That's why I have a hard time understanding why people who don't like AS want those criticisms in. It's like they <i>want</i> to prod people into having a high opinion of it.

Sorry, but I don't understand where you're coming from, because you aren't using logic to explain your opinion.</dd>
<dd>If you have a problem with the criticisms, that's tough. We're supposed to represent all major opinions, not just those that are Randist-approved. I'll admit we don't have enough reviews, but then again even the person who complains loudest about this (you) hasn't added more.

Alright, you win. I'll play your game. In response to what you said (your statements in italics):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Rand might be on to something if you don't agree with the critics?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>No. Had you read what I posted, you would have noticed that the claim was that the article induces the reader to think "if the best criticisms of the book only cover superficial issues, maybe no one has a substantive objection, and thus, Rand's at least right about something".</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you have a problem with the criticisms, that's tough. We're supposed to represent all major opinions, not just those that are Randist-approved.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Had you read what I posted, you would have noticed that a criticism not being "Randist-approved" was not the basis for my questioning its presence in the article. You would have instead noticed that my point was that, far from showing reasons to doubt the arguments advanced by the book, it would reinforce people's support of it -- <b>make them more supportive of Rand's beliefs</b> -- by making it look like critics are only capable of superficial responses that dodge the main point. You would have noticed my warning you that Rand would have gladly approved of these "criticisms" dominating article, and you would have realized how foolish it would sound to act like I was trying to get only Rand-approved criticisms.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I'll admit we don't have enough reviews, but then again even the person who complains loudest about this (you) hasn't added more.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, because I admit that the scholarly debates over the merit of AS is not my area of expertise and my time would be better spent working on articles on topics I'm already familiar with.</p>

<dd><i>I'm sorry but you are not going to change the article around just by throwing around weak illogical rhetoric for the sake of deleting criticisms of Rand's work.</i></dd>

<p>See above on the "illogical rhetoric" bit. I would also like to introduce you to the fact that a problem can only be solved by first identifying that it exists, and that my input was indeed a vital step in remedying a deficiency in this article.<br />
Now that I have carefully explained my position for a third time, I'm sure that you won't accidentally misinterpret it in the future in a way that appears to be trolling but I can't assume is trolling because I am assuming good faith in all Wikipedians, against all evidence ot the contrary. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 05:16, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't debate that literature isn't your area of expertise, but that shouldn't hold you off from simple research. Even if all you did was post a few links to reviews on this talk page, you'd still have put more effort into improving the criticism section than you have done with simply complaining about it. It doesn't take a college degree to look up reviews.</dd>
<dd>And again, you are simply giving your opinion that these reviews are superficial. There are some very well detailed ones (Huffington, for instance, gave an analysis quite similar to academic papers I've read) which you are calling superficial without giving any real analysis of their work to prove your point. Instead, you set up a strawman by minimizing their claims to something poorly thought out (i.e. reducing Huffington's analysis to "a lot of people are like the jerks in the book" rather than taking on her actual analysis). Your claims have simply come off as fallicious opinion, not logical fact, and thus I still don't see a need to remove these criticisms. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 16:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

Every time you have responded to me, you have misquoted my argument, like when I said the criticisms make AS look good, and then you took that as a claim that they weren't randist-approved. Ironic you should complain about strawmen. Also, you claimed I trivialized Huffington's piece without saying what relevant point I left out. (Oops.)

<p>I expect I'll be stepping on some toes by jumping in on this issue but hopefully I can offer a fresh perspective on a couple of issues. I'm going to leave the more difficult parts for you guys to continue to fight over, but two of the disputed pieces seem very simple to me. First, the quote by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Kirk_004b.html" title="Russell Kirk">Russell Kirk</a> is a complaint about the readers of atlas shrugged and not the book itself. It seems to me that even if we assume it's true, Ayn Rand herself might notice it and make the same complaint, that doesn't mean she'd be complaining about her own novel. Secondly about the southpark reference; I have no qualms with it being in the article, but to consider it a critical commentary seems strange. Southpark is rife with nonsequitors, sarcasm and absurdities. Even if it weren't the writers of southpark are hardly a reliable source of literary insight. And as mentioned above, it's not even clear that the writers were trying to comment on it's content; it seems possible if not likely that a person just overcoming illiteracy would simply be afraid to reread a book with large words and small text.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 06:02, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>At the risk of muddying the waters, I would think that those friendly to Objectivism would want to have all these silly quotes in, because they are almost all by people with a political agenda and come off as ideological. It would be far more damaging if someone could find a reputable literary critic who has something negative to say about the work as literature. Of course you can't, because you can barely find a reputable literary critic who has anything to say about it at all. In fact, the only literary analysis I've been able to find at all in a normal venue without a political agenda classifies Rand's fiction as adolescent-interest cult fiction, and puts it in the not too shabby company of such writers as Hermann Hesse. BTW, I think that there should be a category tag "Cult Fiction" but I'm too newbie to know how to do it. Lastly, I think I speak for all sane people everywhere in asking that the edit warring just stop. Where does it get anyone? Will it degenerate into a discussion of who started it?

<dd>OK, then what if an influential conservative intellectual's opinion was that the book lacked literary merit, its philosophical ideas were poorly developed, and that the "romantic" portions of the book were the only parts worth reading? And what if he used a one-liner to summarize that opinion? The goal of quoting this opinion in a section clearly labelled "Critical reception" is the exposition of notable critiques. The goal of removing it is the repression of ideas found offensive. If one believes the section weighs against the book, he or she should spend some energy finding positive reviews and opinions of the book to counter, rather than censoring sourced quotes by notable experts.--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESon_of_Somebody_9531.html" title="User:Son of Somebody">Son of Somebody</a> 22:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would certainly agree that the criticism section seems tilted towards Rand, but for a critic to say 'I just read it for the naughty bits' would be rather childish and unhelpful, and not the kind of comment I'd expect to see in an encyclopedia. Saying 'the book lacked literary merit, its philosophical ideas were poorly developed, and that the "romantic" portions of the book were the only parts worth reading', on the other hand, at least provides some reasoning for their criticism and could be perfectly legitimate. One of the problems as I see it is that many of the people who strongly criticise the book are actually responding to Rand's politics, and not to the book as a book: though obviously with such a politicised book it's somewhat hard to seperate the two. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 23:19, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but to me it seems unencyclopedic and, frankly, quite childish. As far as I can see the quote does nothing to further a critical discussion of the book and, in my experience, is also plainly wrong: I've never met anyone who read Rand's books for the 'naughty bits'. I would agree, though, that the article should be primarily about 'Atlas Shrugged' as a book, not as a political philosophy: the problem, as I mentioned below, is that it's a lousy book once you take out the philosophy. I also noticed that someone renamed 'Critical reception' to 'Reception' apparently to justify including that quote, which seems equally childish to me. I'm sure there are much better ways to improve the article than with silly quotes and word games. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 02:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>LGagnon may disagree strongly with Objectivism, but for him to make ridiculous POV edits that eliminate any mention of Ayn Rand as a philosopher is simply outrageous. Perhaps he should check sources such as Britannica that explicitly refer to her as a philosopher.

<dd>I don't know how long you've been at Wikipedia, but it's been proven that Britannica is not a completely reliable source, even failing to be as reliable as Wikipedia itself. Likewise, Britannica is not a more reliable source than academia (especially given the fact that Wikipedia can outdo them), and few sources are more reliable than academia. Thus, I don't see how Britannica's opinion beats out the collective opinion of the most important source of knowledge in the world. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 19:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't much like any of this discussion on either side. One can characterize any novel that has ideas in it as "philosophical" or "ideological" depending upon one's biases, and certain perfectly respectable literary figures will inspire these kinds of reactions (Dostoevski, for example, whose ideas strike an awful lot of people as both nasty in content and poorly argued but beautifully presented). This should not be a pro-Objectivist/anti-Objectivist issue. I would urge you all to regard whatever authority "academia" has in <i>this</i> context, in <i>this</i> article, to be regarding how to approach AS as literature, not as philosophy. I've already suggested that there is so little discussion of that sort that there's not much one can say; one literary critic (as opposed to political columnist/activist) characterized it as "adolescent reader cult fiction" which seems much more apt to me than "dangerous right-wing ideologue" or "profound philosophical thinker" if we're talking about the <i>fiction</i>. If a Comp Lit department had a class on Dostoevski, no one would get terribly agitated if <i>Bros K</i> was referred to as "a philosophical novel" and I really doubt that Saul Kripke would pick up the phone and complain about trademark infringment. This is just the wrong way to think about this whole issue.

<dd>The problem is that Rand is a horribly bad writer: I don't think anyone would sit through a thousand-page Rand novel were it not for the philosophy. Personally I'd say 'Atlas Shrugged' deserves a place in the hundred most important novels of the 20th century, but as a novel, rather than fictionalised philosophy, it's just awful... and I think that discrepancy is where a large part of the problem with the article stems from. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 00:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm getting testy...</p>
<p>"<i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is a novel by Russian-born writer and philosopher Ayn Rand,"</p>
<p>This is fine. She called herself a philosopher for twenty years, and there have been 2-3 books by academic philosophers about her as a philosopher (Chris Sciabarra, Tara Smith and the collection of essays for Univ. Illinois Press). <i>Introduction to the Objectivist Epistemology</i> may be wrong, it may even be crap, but if so, it is philosophical crap. Philosopher is not necessarily a term of endearment.</p>
<p>"It was Rand's last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy."</p>
<p>I think this should read "exclusively on philosophy, politics and cultural criticism." Essays on patent and copyright law would ordinarily be characterized as politics. Essays on Apollo 11 and Marilyn Monroe would ordinarily be classified as cultural criticism.</p>
<p>"It is a highly philosophical"</p>
<p>as opposed to lowly philosophical? This is just junk writing. It's so-o-o-o-o philosophical. Let it go.</p>
<p>"and allegorical story"</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, no, it’s not really allegory at all. An allegory is where the lion stands for courage, the scarecrow stands for intelligence, etc. It is not an allegory when the corrupt business man stands for corrupt businessmen. It's about what it's about, not something else. That not only tallies with Rand's self-understanding, but standard literary nomenclature. So we can let the whole sentence go, since it says nothing, and says it badly.</p>
<p>"that deals with themes of Rand's own Objectivism"</p>
<p>This is anachronistic. Rand did not announce herself as a philosopher nor use the expression "Objectivism" until after the novel was published. One could more accurately describe "Objectivism" as the distillation and extension of ideas explored in <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. According to her journals, this began as a literary scenario. Her one attempt at a philosophical essay ("Moral Basis of Individualism") that predates it went unpublished.</p>
<p>"though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was written."</p>
<p>Nor did she refer to herself in those terms publicly at that time or previously. The whole sentence has to be revised. See above.</p>
<p>"<i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is an extremely political book."</p>
<p>Extremely? This is junk writing. It's like totally not cool to like totally refer to her like politics as like extremely political. Apart from being just awful writing, it also has unconscious connotations, by causing the mind to glide the term "extremism." Something like "laden with political content" or even "heavily politicized" is better, though the latter is probably POV-problematic.</p>
<p>"In rejecting the traditional Christian altruistic moral code, Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a logical implication of altruism."</p>
<p>Doesn’t she deliberately characterize this as broader than Christianity, and deliberately avoid naming Christianity explicitly? In fact, my recollection is that the only characters who are meant to be associated with anything specifically religious are linked to unnamed generic Asian thought. And isn't it merely Rand's opinion that real-world Christianity is as she characterizes this unlabeled code (in a spirit of 'if the shoe fits')? If you think it through, this is subtle POV. Norman O. Brown said that Christianity is all about ecstatic body affirmation. He was a loon of course, but are we supposed to take sides here?</p>

<p>[For those who are under 50, that's an allusion to Johnny Carson]. Well, I see that others started the process and I dived in too. It looks better. I was wondering what people thought about the "longest book" thing. First of all, I think the long books page is a really silly idea; books that run tens of thousands of pages are noteworthy, but I really don't think that novels in the thousand page range are that unusual--if we could drum them all up and it turned out there were hundreds of them, would that mean that there were hundreds of "among the longest book ever written"? There is a factual dimension to this: most people who read or try to read the book are struck by its length, and some find it just too long. But I'm not sure what the point of this comment is. I think that it is meaningful to mention its page count (1168 in the hardcover first edition) so that people can respond to that, but this sentence almost makes it sound like it's an achievement or a crime, and it's really neither here nor there (without more--it is a very common private reponse that it is way too long, but there's no way to articulate that here). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Cooper_70dd.html" title="User:Agent Cooper">Agent Cooper</a> 13:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's both useful and arbitrary. It's arbitrary in that it doesn't really have a unique size; my copy of Don DeLillo's "Underworld" is just as big, and plenty of books by Neal Stephenson and Stephen King fit in that size range as well. On the other hand, AS's size is something that it is often criticized for, as even diehard fans find it to be bloated. I think the "longest books" statement should go, as it's both poorly researched and potently a peacock statement. However, the article should mention something about the problem people have with its size (which I think it does already). -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 16:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For an article on a piece of fiction, there's a near complete absence of any discussion of imagery, symbolism or style. Is this because any material, since it wouldn't be sourceable beyond AS itself, would constitute "original research"? Or is it because no one has the odd combination of knowledge and skill to pull it off? I was thinking about this in connection with the recurring "Atlantis" trope (which was inspired by Isabel Paterson's characterization of America as Atlantis in <i>God of the Machine</i>--about 95% of Rand's thought is the natural outgrowth of a three-way collision between Nietzsche, Dostoevski and Isabel Paterson--though <i>Anthem</i> also owes a huge debt to Zamyatin). Can anything be done about this, or is it off-limits? It wouldn't seem to be, since discussion of plot and character seems to be in a sense original research as well. Also, Rand wrote quite a bit about her artistic intentions (in <i>Romantic Manifesto</i>), which is relevant here as well (she talks about her attempt to recreate certain elements of Dostoevski's technique, for example, which would seem very relevant to discussing the novel as novel, why it has the peculiar qualities it does, given her Russian background and conscious intentions--in a sense, AS is meant to be a sort of American <i>The Possessed</i>, and would seem a lot less odd if it had a Russian <i>sounding</i> author's name and a Russian setting). Since I am pushing the line that AS is just another book with recognizable features if one classifies it as adolescent-interest cult fiction, written by a Russian-American author influenced by the 19th century Russian novel, it would be nice if there was some trace of understanding of how this peculiar confection works, rather than just paean and denunciation. A big part of the problematic reception of this work is that there was no reception community in place for any sort of <i>19th century Russian novel</i> about <i>what's wrong with the New Deal</i>! How could there be? The very idea is bizarre. [Note: before anyone jumps all over me about the tag "cult fiction" I should stress that this term has no relationship to the "cult accusation" issue--it means a literary work that plays a disproportionate role in its reader's literary experience, a "beloved" book, like <i>Dune</i> or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. That characterization seems to me exactly right.] <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Cooper_70dd.html" title="User:Agent Cooper">Agent Cooper</a> 17:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a pretty hard thing to get done. While the article should contain literary analysis, academia doesn't really care enough about Rand to analyze her work. Thus, we don't really have anything to work with. I'd assume it'd be the same way with L Ron Hubbard or any other author who scared away academia with cult psychobabble and lawsuit threats.</dd>
<dd>As someone who does a lot of work with an academic literary department, I don't really see any chance that Rand would get serious coverage by academia in the future. Honestly, her work reads like pulp romance novels and leans very heavily into Mein Kampf/The Turner Diaries territory. Stuff like that will at the very least slow academia's acceptance of her down, if not stop it from ever happening.</dd>
<dd>Still, we could use info from reviews and whatever Rand had to say about her work. I'm reluctant to let her have the final say on it, though. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 00:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I'm not contributing to the article I have no room to criticize, so consider the following mere observation:</p>
<hr />
<p>I've been intently following this article now for a year or so, trying to make out just exactly what forces are at work. There's obviously two opposing camps. Every so often, one camp or the other will come in and shift things around so that the article slants more this way or that. Then there's wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then someone else comes in and the whole process starts over again. I guess this is how it's all designed to work—Wikipedia, I mean—but it's really not...working, that is. The article on <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> has become for me the test case for Wikipedia. I'm waiting to see happen what I can only assume is supposed to happen: the appearance of an insightful, unbiased and <i>coherent</i> article. Brevity would a plus too.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think that Wikipedia is not for the self-gratification of those writing the articles. These articles are—again I'm assuming—for a person seeking out information. (Let's imagine a young person just becoming interested in literature, curious about a book that their friend recommended.) If I were that young person, which I was, I would want to know a few key pieces of information and I would want this information presented in as organized and proficient a manner as possible. They would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) What it is. (A novel.) When it was written and by whom. <sub>(Who? I never get that right.)</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) What those who like it like about it, preferably in a short paragraph or two.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) What those who don't like it don't like about it...again, keeping it short.</li>
</ul>
<p>...and...</p>
<ul>
<li>4) Where, if I'm interested, I could seek out further (still insightful, unbiased and coherent) information.</li>
</ul>
<p>This for me would be the bare minimum I would expect to see in an authoritative source. Lacking these few items, I just wouldn't trust it.</p>

<p>My two cents here would be that the attempt to label Rand as a pseudophilosopher for purposes of NPOV should win the Contrivance of the Year award. Since when is "philosopher" the only calling which excludes autodidacts? While it's obvious that mere self-proclamation doesn't make you one according to general consensus, merely lacking a formal degree in philosophy and/or being a "bad" philosopher doesn't make one a pseudo-anything. The word "philosopher" isn't limited to academic philosophers, anymore than the word "pianist" demands attendance of a conservatory. While every academic philosopher I've met considers Rand's philosophical work deeply flawed, the body of her work in the field is expansive and well-known enough. Heck, if I decided to become a brain surgeon with no formal education in the field, and actually managed to perform brain surgery on a reasonable amount of people without being thrown in jail or killing every one of them, I think I'd warrant being called a brain surgeon. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnigolyn_1fd8.html" title="User:Unigolyn">Unigolyn</a> 09:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. You don't get to disqualify someone from being a "philosopher" because they're not academia endorsed. <i>ESPECIALLY</i> if that non-endorsement is self-serving.

<dd>Unigolyn, you miss my point. It's not just the fact that she's outside of academia; it's also that she simply never developed the talent to be acceptable by anyone with a decent education. Honestly, look at her citations for her anti-Kant argument; in most cases, she uses strawmen against some guy who she trhinks is pro-Kant, and in the one case where she tries to cite Kant it's "see the works of Hegel and Kant". You can't honestly tell me someone with an education worthy of note wrote that utterly stupid line. It's not even a real citation, and if you don't believe me, I'm citing the location of that line as "see the works of Ayn Rand". She doesn't do philosophy; see does weasely arguments for what she thinks is right without real research into the topic (something she apparently didn't believe in). -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 19:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone being "stupid" in your eyes is not a disqualification for being a philospher. Neither is being wrong. Neither is being sloppy. People say these things about all kinds of "true" philosophers. Just give it up dude. No one's going to "convert" to objectivism because Wikipedia follows the encyclopedic practice of calling her a philosopher. I just don't see what your problem is. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 20:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, part of her appeal is that she is supposedly smart and superior to other philosophers because she is a great-and-talented ubermensch. One of the reasons why so many people grow out of the Rand phase is that they learn what logical fallacies and proper citations are when they get to college, and thus are able to identify them in her arguments. She needs the term "philosopher" to trick undereducated young minds, otherwise she's just another untalented pulp romance novelist. By pushing this, we are feeding the cult like we would if we called dianetics an alternative to psychiatry, or intelligent design as science. Wikipedia, as usual, is being dishonest with this article and only further justifying the accusation of "obsessed Ayn Rand fan" that the media has given to Jimbo.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, philosophy should use logic. Randism is built on strawmen, one of the most basic of logical fallacies. You can say greed is good because some guy that some guy probably likes is wrong about something he probably said, but there's nothing there that makes enough sense to call it philosophy. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to point out that the first sentence of the post above is a straw-man argument, and that much of the rest amounts to a giant ad hominem. Neither me, nor most Rand fans I know, believe she's some kind of ubermensch or special breed of human being, and we certainly aren't undereducated.<a href="../../../k/d/o/User%7EKdogg36_61db.html" title="User:Kdogg36">kdogg36</a> 22:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So, because you deem a philosopher's arguments to be "bad", they're not a philosopher anymore? But wait -- Rand thought that about mainstream philosophers! What to do!</dd>
<dd>Btw, most of the "good" philosophers, if you didn't know this already, made at one point or another truly apalling arguments. Nevertheless, they tend to be judged by their best works, not their worst. Something to consider.</dd>
<dd>Rand is referenced as a philosopher because that characterization is <i>true</i>. If that fails to optimally quash her ideas, that's just too bad. Even <i>having</i> Rand on Wikipedia expands her audience and makes people likely to believe her "deception". That's not a reason to leave her out. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 05:54, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said "logical fallacies", not "appalling mistakes". Big difference. And I have yet to hear of a philosopher who's whole philosophy was built on a strawman and contained such a bad citation; even if they only made the former mistake, they'd be rejected by anyone with a decent education.</dd>
<dd>Please argue against my statements, not what you'd prefer to argue against. A strawman from you will not make Rand's strawman any more philosophic. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 19:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A decent education should include basic logic. I know high school doesn't teach it, but a good college (the place where philosophy is usually taught) should include it in one of its required writing courses.</dd>
<dd>And I didn't mean to insult anyone here; those comments were directed at Rand herself. It's not an insult that she's poorly educated for a supposed philosopher, it's a fact; she really didn't come off as someone who knew what she was talking about (where's the direct arguments against Kant?), and she really didn't understand a simple concept of logic. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 13:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think my problem with this line of thought is that you could say the same things about almost all "Continental" philosophers; the only real difference is that they have canon status and she doesn't. I don't think you appreciate just how bad a lot of "respectable" figures are. So what do we do with that? Does the label simply come with canonization? I still feel like you're using a descriptive label as a value judgment, as when a traditionalist says "Andy Warhol isn't really art." I don't have a problem with "most academics do not regard her as a real philosopher" properly cited, but something else is going on in this discussion, methinks. Why can't we just say (in the spirit of eschewing original research) that some say she is and some say she isn't? I mean, doesn't your appealing to your own classification intuitions also involve "original research"? <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Cooper_70dd.html" title="User:Agent Cooper">Agent Cooper</a> 02:12, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I keep on hearing this Orwellian argument that no source has been presented because none are still here, yet in truth nobody remembers them and someone is removing them.

<p>Having just read <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, I believe this section on "Fictional technology" about Galt's Motor (<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_shrugged.html#Galt.27s_Motor" title="Atlas shrugged">Atlas_shrugged#Galt.27s_Motor</a>) is incorrect:</p>
<p>"This motor generates energy from static electricity; since it is designed to provide its own power as long as it is activated, it is a type of perpetual motion machine."</p>
<p>I disagree. The notion was that the motor took static electricity out of the air. This makes Galt's motor as much a perpetual motion machine as one driven by a solar panel, or, perhaps more clearly, a motor that ran using lightning as a source of energy. Although I doubt the principle described has any physical reality, the notion was not that it created power out of nothing the way a perpetual motion machine would.</p>
<p>Before I remove the part about the perpetual motion, does anybody see something I'm missing?</p>
<p>Whoops... I forgot to sign this. The above was at around 22:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC). I have not made myself an account yet, but I will.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I actually was thinking about this earlier today (for some reason), and I agree: While there is no scientific basis in the real world for the possibility of drawing energy that way, the Galt Motor does not provide its own energy, and so can't count as a PPM. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 20:53, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While we are editing this subsection, I think the following sentence is also incorrect:</p>
<pre>
 "Galt shows Dagny the motor and describes it in Part 3, Chapter 1."
</pre>
<p>I assume that this is referring to the part that starts at the bottom of page 669. Galt never actually shows Dagny the motor here. Galt shows her the building where it is housed, but he does not allow Dagny in because she is still a scab. There is the whole discussion about how the door will only let somebody who speaks Galt's oath pass, and Dagny does not speak the oath. Galt never describes the motor. In Part 3, Chapter 2, we find out Galt is giving lectures on physics (starting on page 709), and it seems clear that the physics of the motor is one of the topics, but neither Dagny nor the reader get to hear any of these lectures. This is too much detail for an encyclopedia article, though. The motor is mentioned; we explain what it is and where Dagny first finds it. I think it makes sense to get in the fact that a working version eventually shows up. I could change this part to read something like:</p>
<pre>
 "In Part 3, Chapter 1, Dagny learns that Galt is using a working version of the motor to generate electricity for Atlantis."
</pre>
<p>Perhaps somebody else has a better way to phrase it? It is a bit awkward to just throw Atlantis in at the end like that, but it is not so bad. After all, the section referred to is called "Atlantis." 207.171.180.101 22:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't some mention be made of the emphasis she still does put on physical beauty? The section currently makes it sound like the only thing that makes a person sexual are the values one may share with another. Rand very clearly sees sexual attraction and the sexual act as more that just a response to shared values. She spends much detail describing the attractiveness of her main characters. They're always beautiful people (this is the case also in Anthem and in the Fountainhead) and her ideal sexual ethic celebrates that beauty in <i>conjunction</i> with the beauty of what she considers to be pure beliefs. The immaterial and material are thus unseparated. TyDeaton 04:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure I agree, but I have read only <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, so my larger context on Ayn Rand is going to be weak. It seems to me that while the characters are described as physically attractive in both books, the description tends to center on either what the person was feeling or what they were doing. For example, my impression was that Dagny was probably not particularly beautiful by purely physical standards (though I did not feel she was supposed to be ugly either.) She is certainly not thought by Rearden's wife to be particularly attractive. We usually see Dagny through the eyes of people who admire her, and she often appears beautiful in situations that one would not be. For example, the chain of Rearden metal is flattering on her wrist. She looks beautiful when she is disheveled and passed out from working all night. Alternatively, we are shown how beautiful she is in her happiness at the completion of the John Galt line, a place where we would expect her to look her best, but the ephasis is on her joy. Thinking of Galt, Galt's face is "a face without guilt," which does not seem to imply he would necessarily be handsome otherwise. On the flip side, Rearden's wife is downright ugly when she hooks up with Jim Taggart, even though it seems clear to me that she is a physically beautiful woman.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rand focuses a lot on the emotions that are revealed by appearance. The bad guys all have faces that project fear and guilt. I see beauty as more metaphorical than literal in the same way that characters with bad teeth are often corrupt. There is usually no real connect implied between corruption and bad teeth; it's just a literary device. That's my feeling anyway. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatistical_Mechanic_56b0.html" title="User:Statistical Mechanic">Statistical Mechanic</a> 16:00, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Shrugged_7452.html#Fictional_technology" title="Atlas Shrugged">technology section</a> refers to "a nerve-induction torture machine." The device described in the book does not use nerve induction; it uses plain old electricity. When I think of <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerve_induction.html" title="Nerve induction">Nerve_induction</a>, I think of the pain box used in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28film%29.html" title="Dune (film)">Dune (film)</a>. (See also <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gom_Jabbar_5329.html" title="Gom Jabbar">Gom_Jabbar</a>.) Nerve induction implies that the device stimulates the nerves without actually injuring the person. It is made very clear in <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> that one of the technical innovations of the Ferris persuader is that it carefully applied enough voltage to hurt you, but dials it back before it injures you. This makes it a fairly standard electric shock torture device much like we have today with some automated features. I have never heard of contemporary electric shock torture being referred to as nerve induction before. I think it is good to mention the device as I think that it is important to the theme of the book. I am not sure of the best phrasing. Perhaps "a sophisticated electrical torture device" would be better.

<dd>Okay, after offline discussion with LaszloWalrus, this was a misunderstanding. (The comment was not directed at me.) No harm done. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatistical_Mechanic_56b0.html" title="User:Statistical Mechanic">Statistical Mechanic</a> 19:19, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A friend of mine actually has those, so they're not fictional. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.252.12.159_2925.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.252.12.159">83.252.12.159</a> (talk) 13:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>He developes it as an employee of a motor company that is turning into a cooperative. He abandons the prototype, saying that it is not his property. But what about the idea itself??</p>
<p>I've a strong feeling that anything you invent on company time and with company materials belongs to the company rather than the inventor. Can anyone confirm this? Is US law different from British law?</p>

<dd>The eminent 20th-century Russian-American philosopher Ayn Rand held that the <i>rightful</i> ownership of property was independent of and metaphysically prior to criminal law. Because of this, the jurisdiction would have been irrelevant to a discussion of who was the rightful owner of the idea and object; it would simply be dependent on the particular individual agreement between employee and employer. 216.135.28.40 21:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually a major company, or a company of whom it might be a concern, will have a stipulation of copyright etc ownership transferring to said company. I have seen it in contract that an employee retains ownership of their inventions etc but that's probably pretty rare. As to ownership if there is no stipulation, It's my feeling that'd probably depend on who has the better lawyer... <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrye_3ca8.html" title="User:Grye">Grye</a> 05:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
