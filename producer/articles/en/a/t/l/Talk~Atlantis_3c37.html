<p>In the article under <i>Recent times</i>, Dr. Julia Annas may be right about Plato's imaginative leaps into myth, but the 'more plausible' and 'highly respected' conclusion that Plato wrote historical fiction is in in itself a presumption. This theory implies that the writing of history is fallible, which I wholly support, in light of the work of postmodern theorists in knowledge systems (Foucault, Derrida) and cultural studies (Said) (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalism.html" title="Orientalism">Orientalism</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurocentrism.html" title="Eurocentrism">Eurocentrism</a>). These postmodern theories can be applied to the interpretation of Plato's work, or Aristotle, or Lao Tzu, or Herodotus, or any writer speaking about a place and time and a cultural way of life. Julia Annas's important idea that trying to verify Atlantis through the work of Plato is unhelpful for scholars and armchair traveller's, and her invention hypothesis has a very postmodern approach to historical research; very important when considering the verity of Plato's sources of knowledge.</p>
<p>However; Where in Plato's work does he state that he is speculating, or creating an imaginative place (Atlantis), using a well documented person (Solon)(is he well documented? does Luce think so?), to assist in a philosophical study of morality (Atlantis as a cautionary tale: power currupts)? Forgive me, I haven't read enough of Plato in the Benjamin Dowett editions to know about his use of historical fiction for his narratives. And what reason would Plato have to fabricate a place, when he could have easily cited "contemporary events (Helike, Sicily expedition, Graeco-Persian wars, ...)"; and overtly indicated that "(Sparta, Syrakus, Persia, Carthage, ...)" inspired him (more or less)? And why is Plato implied to be myopic by the scholar John V. Luce "who argues that Plato himself saw an Egyptian account of the Thera eruption and took it for Atlantis"? Like <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions_bd9e.html" title="Structure of Scientific Revolutions">Thomas Kuhn</a> has suggested; reading Aristotle's concepts in <i>Physics</i> is not 'bad Newton', just a different worldview. Similarly reading Plato's or Herodotus's accounts of life experience is not like reading high school grade philosophy. Believing Plato to be an inventor of history for the convenience of telling a good story, creates a distrust of Plato accounts. I suppose one answer would be to locate the Pillars of Hercules, take some diving equipment, and take a look around. Take photos. Look for archaeological and geographical evidence. Plenty of people have tried. Apparently the ocean currents in that location are strong and the water is perpetually murky, so Plato's claims about 'the Pillars' will remain a mystery for a while yet.</p>
<p>In general, current geographical and oceanographic explorations for lost civilisations worldwide, I believe, are important to note in this article about a location hypothesis. Dr. Greg Little is one investigator actively doing this kind of search in <a href="../../../b/i/m/Bimini.html" title="Bimini">Bimini Road</a>. Would be nice to find an 'archeological digging group' independent of A.R.E. (who some deem to be fruitcakes), to show how this interest in 'locating' may start with Atlantis or Lemuria, and begin to find lost worlds of meaning. Maybe the moniker 'lost civilisations' is more appropriate than 'lost Atlantis'. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakonicon_19eb.html" title="User:Drakonicon">Drakonicon</a> 06:04, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>And what reason would Plato have to fabricate a place, when he could have easily cited "contemporary events (Helike, Sicily expedition, Graeco-Persian wars, ...)";</i></dd>
<dd>The answer is simple. Plato wanted to prove the supremacy of the <i>his</i> ideal state as detailed in <i>Politeia</i>. Since there has never been a state shaped like his perfect society, he had to create one (his ancient Athens). And for this "hero", he needed a "villain" as well (Atlantis). That's it. Athens beat Atlantis, which means: perfect society beats an overpowering opponent. Plato could have cited contemporary events like the Sicily invasion directly, but the Athens of his lifetime was the complete opposite of his perfect society and, further, didn't win the Peloponessian war, but lost it. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBender235_8c9b.html" title="User:Bender235">Bender235</a> 20:34, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The WikiProject Classical Greece and Rome rating is for the article's importance "within classical antiquity". I don't think Atlantis is very important in classical antiquity; its popularity starts in the modern era, especially after figures like Kirscher and Donelly get a hold of it. But I really can't agree that within classical antiquity it's as important as articles like the Parthenon, the Persian Wars, etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Akhilleus_16d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Akhilleus">contribs</a>) --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBender235_8c9b.html" title="User:Bender235">Bender235</a> 20:19, 13 August 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>That's a somewhat strange kind of way to measure importance; we are rating the importance like we assume that the people of ancient Greece would have done it for topics of their time. Wouldn't that mean that we should rate topics like "Athenian democracy" as of "low importance", because democracy itself wasn't about to become an important topic until modern times? --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBender235_8c9b.html" title="User:Bender235">Bender235</a> 20:19, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Athenian democracy was pretty important in classical Athens, and plenty of Greek literature was linked directly to the democracy. The oratory of Demosthenes, Lysias, etc. is the most obvious example, but Athenian tragedy and comedy was shaped by the democracy, the political thought of Plato and Aristotle is deeply influenced by the democracy, etc. Roman-era writers like Cicero and Plutarch return again and again to 5th and 4th century Athens in writing about politics, philosophy, and history. If the Greeks or the Romans were giving ratings to Wikipedia articles, I'm pretty sure they would have put Athenian democracy up pretty high.</p>
<p>In contrast, Atlantis is not very important within Greek and Roman culture. Even within Plato's own philosophy, the myth of Atlantis is not as significant as the myth of the cave, or the myth of Er. As an example of an idealized society, Atlantis takes a distant third place to the cities of the <i>Republic</i> and the <i>Laws</i>. Even if we just consider the dialogues which mention Atlantis (<i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i>), the cosmology of the <i>Timaeus</i> had far more impact on subsequent philosophy than Atlantis--Cicero translated the <i>Timaeus</i> (but not the <i>Critias</i>) into Latin, and the cosmology of the <i>Timaeus</i> had a deep impact on neoplatonic and medieval philosophy. Obviously, our article here tells us that Plato's Atlantis inspired later writers, but the impact of Atlantis is not as profound as that of the <i>Timaeus</i>, of the <i>Republic</i>, of Athenian democracy, or any number of topics one would care to name in classical antiquity.</p>
<p>Within classics as an academic discipline, Atlantis is also not a very significant topic; while you can find some very good articles on the Atlantis myth (and many are cited in this article), it is not a very prominent topic of research. The <i>Timaeus</i> attracts more attention, not to mention Athenian democracy, the Parthenon, Homer, and so on. Atlantis of course draws a huge amount of popular interest, but the popular interest has almost nothing to do with Plato's account or classical antiquity; the "Atlantis" that people are interested in is almost entirely a modern creation, based on fiction, the "research" of esoteric figures like Cayce, and TV shows. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 21:07, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, actually not, since basically all utopias by Renaissance writers, from Morus and Campanella to Bacon and Butler, are based on or inspired by Plato's Atlantis. Atlantis is not only important because of Donnelly. It's way more. But you're right, it was not that important in classical antiquity, and if we judge on that - what I would not, but I am not the one to decide - it is of "mid importance". --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBender235_8c9b.html" title="User:Bender235">Bender235</a> 22:04, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article "Atlantis"</p>
<ul>
<li>a summarization of Plato's description given in <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i>.

<li>a comprehensive comment on the reception of Atlantis from antiquity to modern times, including the philosophical interpretation of the Atlantis myth (which does not exist yet)</li>

<p>It is itself at odds with other things on Wikipedia about Atlantis. The idea that Atlantis was in charge of the E. Medit and met with enemies outside (from the West) seems crucial and central (and I certainly agree with it - it's the entirely rational way to look at the material, although there are sources within Plato - in The Laws, I think - that aren't used, they are rarely used - but still are consistent witih this article).</p>
<p>It's the other article on the location of Atlantis (hypothetical locations) that fails to open with the data presented here.Kaimiikekamaila 22:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)kaimiikekamaila</p>

<p>Lost Worlds: Atlantis aired on the History Channel and suggested that Santorini once was the home of an advanced civilization that fit Plato's description of Atlantis.

The inhabitants had unknowingly buildt their main capital eithin in the center a volcanic calderra (term?) or on land previously created as the result of an eruption. Furthermore, it is suggested that they had multiple cities around the Mediteranean(sp?) which were wiped out as the result of tsunami caused by the eruption - hence it fell in a single day and night.

<p>it is a great disservice to those doing research to not have content available for reading, regardless of whether the content is relevant, or at least of some value as a differing view of the total subject matter. removing, rather than pointing out the possibilities which may bring insight into the subject matter, content denies to other readers the different viewpoints and exacerbates the errors which may have been avoided had the removed content been available.-----snowpapa.</p>

We must understand that primary (original) research such as proposing theories and solutions such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100379213&amp;oldid=100294832" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100379213&amp;oldid=100294832" rel="nofollow"><i>Time discrepancies</i> section</a> is not acceptable in Wikipedia. It can only be added if a notable researcher is the source. The section removed by Akhilleus was unsourced and considered as original research as a consequence. So no big deals here. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 12:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coming here from the RfC - no previous involvement in the article. I'm afraid I have to agree with <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> - these deletions were of unsourced material, with an invitation to discuss further on the talk page.

<p>Also coming here from the RfC, I have to agree with the above. The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy says <i>Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i> Akhilleus was well within his grounds to remove the information and demand sourcing; the burden is on you to provide them. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I agree that the text of Critias is not a reliable reference for what the text of Critias states (the burden is on users to prove that the text of Critias is the text of Critias), and that basic well-known facts that can be found in the wikipedia articles on their particular subjects and in common textbooks DO require redundant references, and therefore to delete information under the statement that it is unsourced is not a false pretense.

</dl>
<p>Although most of this has been said, it does bare repeating. Akhilleus is a well respected editor, especially among those working on articles concerning Classical Greece and Rome. Reviewing the content shows that it was neither informative, nor sourced, and he made a good move deleting it. I do not see the 'false pretense' that the plaintiff is talking about, and also, said editor's comments on <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html#User:Akhilleus_gutting_the_article_Atlantis" title="User talk:Dbachmann">Dbachmann's talk page</a> call into question not only his motives, but his stability as an editor.

<p>I must agree with the above comments. Unsourced edits have no place in the article.

<p>Inside the last paragraph under "Plato's Account", the difference between the Greek and Egyptian calendars is mentioned starting with "On a side note," and ending on "Returning to the story," .. this is written more like a first-hand account rather than an encyclopedia entry. this information should probably be closer in the article to where Atlantis is mentioned at being from 9400BC, up at the top of the article, so it can be in-context. This hypothesis is also (apparently) uncredited/uncited. -Nago (Anon) 15:28, 23 Feb 2007</p>

<p>This comment "Proclus, reports that Crantor traveled to Egypt and actually found columns with the history of Atlantis written in hieroglyphic characters.[4] However, Plato did not write that Solon saw the Atlantis story on a column but on a source that can be "taken to hand".[5] Proclus' proof appears implausible." I don't think that the comment "Proclus' proof appears implausible" should be in the article. Ancient Egyptians often carved histories into stone for durability, as seen in their temples and so on. The fact Plato's account details that there was a version of the history written on a scroll doesn't negate the account that a version existed on a column. The stone carving being done for durability purposes and the scroll version for portability purposes. Many Egyptian scrolls are also carved into stone in certain locations, so calling the proof implausible is not a very good deduction, and has no place except maybe on the talk pages, but not the main article. 76.19.67.186 18:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)eslives</p>

<dd>As written, that does seem to be an original synthesis of the cited sources; but I don't think it would be that hard to find a secondary source that says Proclus' proof was silly, since very few classical scholars think that Plato actually relied on an Egyptian source. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to see this article go from the "good" category to "featured article" status, and I understand that such was done in the past...which means it was downgraded?</p>
<p>Perhaps one should think of this particular article as being divided in three: the Atlantis tale as told by Plato; the Atlantis stories as told by Donnelly and others since; and Atlantis as told by documented fact. So I propose the following layout change:</p>
<ul>
<li>A little more in-depth with Plato, to include quotes by him about Atlantis.</li>
<li>The same thing should apply to Donnelly.</li>
<li>The archaeological record as applied to both Plato's and Donnelly's versions.</li>
<li>a brief history of searches for Atlantis, both serious and crank.</li>

<dd>FA is a great goal--the article has been a candidate twice, but has never been featured. I'm not sure the article needs more detail about Plato--I think the current size of the Plato section is about right, but it needs revision.</dd>
<dd>The article is missing detail on the medieval and early modern periods, which is pretty important--Francis Bacon's <i>The New Atlantis</i>, for example.</dd>
<dd>There is almost no professional archaeology that's relevant to this topic. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorini.html" title="Santorini">Santorini</a> is thought by a number of people to have inspired Plato in some fashion, but the material at the site has very little to do with what Plato says. Obviously many people have claimed that they're found Atlantis, but these claims never pan out. This article needs *less* on the modern "discoveries" of Atlantis, since we have <a href="../../../l/o/c/Location_hypotheses_of_Atlantis_33a0.html" title="Location hypotheses of Atlantis">Location hypotheses of Atlantis</a> to handle them. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 17:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do believe in the Santorini-is-Atlantis line, and that based on evidence which matches the Atlantis tale better than any other explanation, but that is the subject of a separate article.

<p>I did add the first few sentences about Atlantis from Plato's <i>Timaeus</i>.
