<p>Looking back at a March 2006 version, much of the 'good' has been thrown out with the bad. Some have ghettoized Atlanta's nicknames while forgetting its history. What happened to the mention and explanation of the "Phoenix City," "New York of the South," etc. Even the early name 'Thrashersville' has disappeared! Also, the discussion of the city and urban sprawl issues, exurbs, and economic influence has been mostly removed. Much of this material needs to be re-incorporated into the article. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 05:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>EDT (UTC-4) Website: <a href="http://www.atlantaga.gov/" class="external free" title="http://www.atlantaga.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantaga.gov/</a> Atlanta (IPA: /ˌætˈlɛ̃n.nə/ or /ˌɛtˈlɛ̃n.nə/) is the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is the county seat of Fulton County, although a portion of the city (the 1909 annex) is located in DeKalb County. According to the latest census estimates (as of December, 2004), the city has a population of approximately 425,000 and the Atlanta metropolitan area totaled 4,708,297, making it the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the United States and the 41st-largest city proper. Atlanta is arguably a poster-child for cities worldwide experiencing rapid urban sprawl, population growth, and commercial development. As a result, Atlanta is a common case study for college students who study Urban Geography around the globe.</p>
<p>The Atlanta area was originally inhabited by Cherokee and Creek Indians, and was named Standing Peachtree. In 1823, the area was opened to white settlement. It remained mostly woods until 1836, when the area was chosen as the southern "Terminus" of a railroad from Chattanooga. A local settlement called "Thrasherville" (near present-day Philips arena, home of the Atlanta Thrashers) was renamed "Terminus," and in 1843 the town was officially named "Marthasville," after the daughter of the governor of Georgia. The business community, however, was concerned that such a name wouldn't sell, and a new name, "Atlanta," was chosen in 1845 as much more marketable. Hence, from the start "Atlanta" began as a transportation hub and marketing center. The town was incorporated as the city of Atlanta in 1847, and by 1860 the population was 9,554.</p>
<p>Atlanta was largely destroyed by Union forces during the Civil War, but was chosen as the state capital in 1868, having been established as the site of command for Union soldiers and the Reconstruction administration. In the 1880's, a revival was led by newspaperman Henry Grady, who advocated Atlanta as the "capital of the New South." By 1890 Atlanta had 65,000 residents and was one of the 50 largest cities in America, a distinction Atlanta has held for over 110 years. In 1892, Atlanta's first skyscraper, the 8-story Equitable Building, began Atlanta's rise to the skies. The city expanded rapidly from 1900 (89,000) to 1930 (302,000) before growth slowed during the Depression. In the 1960's Atlanta was a center for the American Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, the city's population topped out at 497,000 before "white flight" to the suburbs dropped the city to 394,000 in 1990. However, in 1996 Atlanta served as the host city for the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics, and the city has rallied to 425,000 by 2004, fueled in part by a new desire for shorter commutes and intown living.</p>
<p>One of the city's nicknames, "The Phoenix City", relates to its rise after the Civil War. The phoenix appears in many of Atlanta's symbols, including its seal and flag. In the 1940s and 1950s, former Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield called Atlanta "The City Too Busy to Hate". In addition, it has also been called the "New York of the South" in response to one of Georgia's own nicknames, "The Empire State of the South." Atlanta may also be known as ATL, a colloquialism for the city derived from the IATA airport code for the airport.</p>
<p>Atlanta is circled by Interstate 285, called the "Perimeter" by locals, which has come to delineate the interior of the city from the surrounding suburbs. This has given rise to the terms ITP (inside the Perimeter) and OTP (outside the Perimeter) to describe area neighborhoods, residents, and businesses. In this respect, the Perimeter plays a social and geographical role similar to that of the Capital Beltway around Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Atlanta has such a great economic impact on the state and the surrounding region that cities and towns up to 45 miles away are considered 'exurbs', defined by the fact that people depend on their livelihoods by commuting to work in the city, rapidly growing what is called Metro Atlanta. Atlanta is one of the most prosperous cities in the United States and is often referred to as the unofficial "capital of the South." The city is also an especially important cultural and economic center for African-Americans; Atlanta has not had a non-black mayor since 1974, and in recent decades nearly all Fire Chiefs, Police Chiefs, and other government officials have been African-American.</p>

<p>The city of Atlanta may be majority-black now, but for the first 130+ years, it was majority white. Also, Atlanta is becoming increasingly diverse.

<p>Atlanta is not the largest state capitol in the nation, Atlanta population is only 470,000. While Phoenix (capitol of Arizona and largest state capitol) has a population of 1,460,000. Nearly 1 million more citizens in the city of Atlanta. Even Indianapolis (capitol of Indiana, 791,000) Boston, (Capitol of Massachusetts, 570,000) are larger than Atlanta. Atlanta has a larger metro area ( 5 million to Phoenix 3 million) but it is not a larger city by any change. Even Boston's metro area is larger than Atlanta's (5.8 million to 5.2) This can confuse some people when they think that metro Atlanta and the city of Atlanta proper, is the same thing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Atlanta is the capital. Metro Atlanta is not the capital. If someone wants to wordsmith it (which seems difficult), I'm fine with that. For now I'll just delete it, as I think it is misleading, not particularly notable, and mangles the rest of the sentence. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 16:16, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Garyaaliya, Please come off your high horse and quit assuming foul play. The number 5,249,121 was defined as from the 'CSA'or 'Combined Statistical Area' which is, in effect, a resurrection of the CMSA system in the 1990's. After the 2000 census, the Census Bureau decided to go with a 'strict' definition of 'metropolitan area.' The 'lose' definition, which (if you'll note) counts higher totals for places like NYC, etc, has a higher total for Atlanta (already 5 million in 2004).</p>

<p>So, it seems you are not completely knowledgeable of the subject, instead assuming 'foul play'. Try to do a little reading first, and make your edits with less degree of finality.

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>The city of Atlanta experiences minimum temperatures in winter of about 13-18 degrees F, on average. In the winter of 2005-2006, the lowest recoded temperature was 24F (breaking the record for the warmest winter ever--previous was 20 degrees, 1990-1991). Global warming or no, the temp in Atlanta hasn't reached 10 degrees since Jan 1994. Thus, claims that the temp reaches 10 degrees 'several times a winter' are over-stated. Maybe 15 degrees about once a year. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 19:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I certainly know that the temp in Atlanta rarely gets to 10 degrees F, it hasn't happened in a long time. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Huh? How are my "charges" just "plain silly"? You seemed to have referred to some website (weather.gov, as you have since pointed out) to make changes to the weather section. But without appropriate references to the changes (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>), it gives the impression that this was just an arbitrary change based on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As you say, this article is edited too frequently and by too many editors, and without appropriate citations and references, it is hard to distinguish between prank edits and well intentioned ones. That's all I've been saying all along, but apparently the point is not getting across. I have no issues with edits as long as they are appropriately cited. Also, my edits are always in good faith and there's not need to get personal. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 22:47, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify, I get my weather information from the US government:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/" class="external free" title="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/</a></p>
<p>This information is used to supply the information you see on TV every day on the news. This is the 'unofficial official' website for the city of Atlanta. The 'official' data is stored at the National Archives and Records Administration. However, for all practical purposes, the above website is in fact the government outlet for Atlanta weather, and all the data is 'preliminary official' if not certified official.</p>
<p>Also, I am a weather records expert and I have the record high and low for every day of the year for the city of Atlanta. Thus, you can take it to the bank that I know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>In fact, I've actually corrected the Peachtree City guys once or twice (for example, the record high for Aug 19 in Atlanta). → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The other issues were the race issue and the 'churches'/places of worship issue. First, let's face it, we need to balance majority rule and minority rights. For example, the majority of people in Atlanta are 'Christian'...to get rid of the word 'majority' is disengenuous.</p>
<p>But with three/four issues/edits that I'm concerned with and several more that you and others are concerned with ('largest capital, Gamma world city, etc), a revert may not necessarily be for the same reason. So, part of discussion if what each side can give up in order to reach a compromise...and not to make one side seem 'righteous' and 'holier than thou.' → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

AreJay,</p>
<p>You should make one edit at a time, rather than trying a 'Congressional omnibus bill'. I don't think your 'edits' add value or make the article better. Also, the designation 'gamma world city' is from a biased study done by a single university in Britain, without input from experts elsewhere. I don't think this is really worth as much as you think it is.</p>
<p>Also, again I said 'more than one issue'. Part of the problem is stuffing lots of changes in at once...who am I? Other than the Guinness World Records gerontology consultant, Atlanta, editor for www.emporis.com (#1 high-rise website in the world), and featured in the Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and National Public Radio, I guess I'm not that important.

<dd>Ryoung122, you seem to be turning this into a personal battle and it is no wonder that this article is suffering because of obstinate editors such as yourself who are simply unwilling to listen to reason. It doesn't matter who you are or who I am, Ryoung122 — your credentials are about as equally unimportant as mine here. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, it is not a consortium of subject matter experts. So while I'm sure you're very qualified in your area(s) of expertise, it matters little here.</dd>
<dd>Please afford me the basic courtesy of reviewing my edits before reverting them. I was not <i>adding</i> content; I was merely formatting it to make it in line with Wikipedia's best practices, which include Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">Lead formatting</a> policies.</dd>
<dd>Further, your comments stating "I don't think your 'edits' add value or make the article better" are utterly vague and ambigious for me or any other editor to turn around and incorporate into our edits. Your suggestion of "make one edit at a time" is unacceptable to me. Sorry, but this is a free encyclopedia and I can and will make as many edits to as many sections as I want as long as my edits are in line with Wikipedia's policies and as long as I have valid reasons for my edits. If you have issues with my edits, discuss them here. Don't blanket revert them. And come to me with a little more than "I don't think your edits add value". I don't want it to come down to this, but if you continue your blanket reverts of my edits for no reason other than the fact that you simply don't like me, I <i>will</i> seek out mediation and you <i>will</i> be blocked from editing. Remember, repeatedly removing content for no rhyme or reason is at best, <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolling</a> and at worst <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">vandalism</a>.</dd>

<p>No, this is not a 'little revert game.' Such a comment was supremely disrepectful because it insinuated that:</p>
<p>A. the changes that I made were not important; B. that the changes I made were a 'game' and not an edit.</p>

<p>makes you right?</p>
<p>Is at best displaying a 'God complex' and emotional immaturity. You fail to recognize that all the changes I made had a solid basis to it. For example, the claim that the temperature in Atlanta regularly falls below 10F in winter. I have tracked this for some 17 years and I surely know quite more about Atlanta weather than you. Here you can get the daily highs and lows for every day in Atlanta from 1878 to 2006. Would you like to scan this?</p>

<p>The suggestion to 'make one edit at a time' was to counter the problem of multiple reverts. Each time you or I or someone reverts, recent changes made by third parties may be lost. Hence, it would be better to actually make a few, smaller changes at a time rather than 'all or nothing.' What you're doing is like the Congress saying they can't pass a minimum wage increase without attaching it abolish the Death Tax. Or as the joke goes: "Girl Scout cookies come bundled with the Microsoft browser." You DO need to re-think your 'master of the universe' attitude and start working towards compromise. Your empty threats of 'mediation' do not worry me, as I can easily point out mistakes you have made and inaccuracies in your position.</p>
<p>However, if you want to 'compromise,' the best thing to do is to make multiple small edits, rather than make big changes and claim 'I don't have time for others.' Again, is your time more valuable than mine? Are you placing yourself as of 'supreme importance'? My response was simply to show that I could easily do the same thing, but both are irrelevant to the real issue, 'Does the edit add value or improve the current article?' I find it laughable that you think such a standard should not be applied.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 05:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How many times do I have to keep saying this?? Are you <i>ever</i> going to understand what I'm trying say? I will say this again, very slowly, one last time. You are free to add and / or edit what you want, <u>as long as you cite your sources in the article</u>. You say you've "tracked" the weather in Atlanta. Well, friend, that is original research and Wikipedia has a policy against that. As someone that very actively contributes to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured Article Candidates</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">Peer Review</a> processes, I know that these are some of the things that get hauled up. You've made changes to the temperature section, I <i>know</i> you've referred to some sources because you had added them to the Talk page earlier, so what can't you just cite your source to the things that you've changed and call it a day (please see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> for more information on how to add in-line citations for articles in Wikipedia.)? Is that too much to ask??</dd>
<dd>Now for your other issues with my edit summary. It <i>was</i> a little revert game. How else are you going to explain your blanket revert of my edits to the lead, not once, but twice? What other technical issue(s) did you base your reverts on? My edits were nothing more than a cleanup of the text — as I've said twice before, they were meant to bring the text in the lead in line with Wikipedia's Manual of Style and WP:LEAD policies. And you blanket reverted those edits twice. So what are you trying to tell me...that you have issues with Wikipedia's text formatting and style policies and guidelines? I never said, as you claim, that a standard of "Does the edit add value or improve the current article?" should not be applied to make changes. I said that you need to be <i>specific</i> as to what you felt wasn't "adding value" or "improving the current article"...and the fact is that in the 2-3 conversations that we've had here, you haven't once been able to specifically point out what your issues were with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta%2C_Georgia&amp;oldid=68119491" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta%2C_Georgia&amp;oldid=68119491" rel="nofollow">these edits</a>. Remember, Ryoung122, I was not the one that started blanket reverting edits for no rhyme or reason — you were. That, in itself, was pretty darn disrespectful. I did not intend the edit summary to sound disrespectful and I'm not sure why you're having such issues with it when I was just calling it like it is. And besides your own edit summary of "no reason given for YOUR revert" wasn't exactly glowing with etiquette.</dd>
<dd>Which brings me to my next point. Let me highlight the irony in the fact that you are preeching to the other editors here to "make one edit at a time", while you very conveniently seem to prefer blanket reverting multiple edits. If you have issues with peoples' edits, why can't <i>you</i> make one change at a time?? And trust me, I <i>would</i> have sought out mediation had this edit war continued on; these were not empty threats. I'm sorry, but your reverts of the lead did't have a leg to stand on, and you can't randomly revert peoples' edits because you have issues with them or with what you perceive to be their attitudes of superiority.</dd>
<dd>However, we have beaten this issue to death here. I am happy with the way the article stands as of now, although I think a lot can be done to improve the quality of the article. This is not going to be easy and cannot be accomplished overnight. I will continue to work on this article as time permits and I hope that it will make WP:FA sooner than later. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 14:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once again, it seems a favorite passtime of Atlanta amateur 'editors' is misstating the weather. An official reading of below zero F is extremely rare and never happened once during the 1990's. In fact, there have only been six years where it's happened, and all of them were associated with major polar air masses and freak occurrences. Consider:</p>
<p>1. 1884--Atlanta hit -1F the winter after the Krakatau eruption blocked out the sun, cooling the planet</p>
<p>2. 1899--the time Atlanta hit -9F, also saw such extremes as -15 (Washington, D.C. all-time record low), -16 in Louisiana (state record) and -2 in Florida (state record), -39F in Ohio (state record), -47F in Nebraska</p>
<p>3. 1963--Atlanta hit -3F; the state of Kentucky set a record of -34F</p>
<p>4. 1966--Atlanta hit -3F; Alabama set a state record of -27F</p>
<p>5. 1982--Atlanta reached -5F</p>
<p>6. 1985--Atlanta reached -8F. The coldest air mass of the century also saw records such as -73F (province of Ontario), -69F (state record, Utah); -61F (state record, Colorado); -34F (state record, North Carolina), -19F (state record, South Carolina).</p>

<p>I asked this question prior to it getting archived and unanswered, so I'll ask it again. Why is my virtual tour of Atlanta link being removed every time I post it? Please let me know. Thanks! --TourPath 03:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's start with...this is NOT a place for commercial self-promotion! If your tour is so good, it should only be recommended by someone that doesn't know you and not you. And even then, it should only be kept if the majority of Wikipedians agreed that it should. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 06:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>TourPath tours aren't being created for "commercial self-promotion".</p>
<p>It's a dot.com entity, thus it is for profit-making.</p>
<p>(So what? What does that have to do with the fact that it is useful? Once again, have you clicked on ANY external links lately? A ton of them link to Yahoo! and other 'profit-making' sites. That is truly a sophmoric answer. --TourPath 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>To deny this is to not understand what a .com is. Wikipedia is a .org site funded by charitable donations. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(One again, what does THAT have to do with the issue at hand? Wikipedia's business model concerns Wikipedia and has little to do with the content posted to this platform. At no time did they ever tell me that an external link can't lead to a commercially-operated entity. --TourPath 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
 People who create these tours are photographers, real estate agents, multimedia people - all who are trying to add a little more multimedia and interactivity to the Web.  Like any "works", putting a signature to something your create is common.  I suppose the links to your profile are not some form of self-promotion, eh?  If not, why do you need a profile that explains who you are, what you like, where you've worked, where your alumni is, what state you live in, your business experience.  That's NOT self promotion?  It is also rediculous 
</pre>
<p>Your misspelling of 'ridiculous' really lowers your credibility. Also, if my user page is about me, then it should be about me. That's not the same as an 'encyclopedia' article.</p>
<p>(A cut-n-paste from the above discussion: YOU SAID, 'As for the threats...you really think that threating me with I will seek out mediation and you will be blocked from editing." That is an incomplete question whose sentence is ended by a period, RYoung...but I'll let you have that one.)</p>
<p>Also, I wasn't the one to remove the 'Virtual tour' in the first place. I was simply answering the question of why someone would want to remove the link.</p>
<p>(Then the 'stud' who likes to touch my stuff needs to speak up, not you. I love your bravery but not your desire to be heard all of the time. --TourPath 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>And while you're crying out loud, others have deleted relevant photos in the past, so you're not the only one to have things changed around. As it says, if you don't expect your changes to be 'edited mercilessly,' you shouldn't be here.</p>

<p>("Crying out loud"? RYoung, based on the posts I've read between you and other, it seems you are the one crying all of the time. You must have an enormous inferiority complex as you are usually the first to insult others. Your insults are obvious through the manner by which you critique people and assume their works and contributions are less valuable than your own. Just because Wikipedia's managers offer an open 'badge' to edit content doesn't mean they appointed you the editing police. Edits should be employed to CORRECT INACCURACIES, not to determine who is 'worthy' or not of being seen in an article. I don't care if my contribution are edited mercilessly, but you should edit what is wrong - not what isn't. Once again, my contribution was as external link. I don't touch other people's work within Wikipedia without discussion. And if you want to consider the removal of my external link a 'discussion', then consider your personal views about why my link was removed to be bloated and inconsistent. --TourPath 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>(Let's keep in mind, people, that Wikipedia was created to help people learn, not as a cyber platform for those suffering from maladies of inferiority. I've been insulted more than I care to have been, and yet, the person who insulted me still has not presented a valid arguement as to why my external link is being removed. I feel like I'm dealing with a 15-year old who is trying to prove he can play with the 'big kids'. "While you're crying out load," and "Your misspelling of 'ridiculous' really lowers your credibility," really don't address the issue about which I inquired. --TourPath 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p><br />
to claim that validity of our tours should be expressed by other people. Should the validity of any information posted to Wikipedia be justified if someone other than originator posts it? Kind of goes against the idealism behind Wikipedia. As for the "majority of Wikipedians" deciding to keep an external link posting online, it doesn't take a "majority" to delete a link. It just takes one person to delete it a few hours after it is posted. That being the case, I doubt if the "majority" ever get to see it once it is deleted. The bottom line is this: Wikipedia is about learning. So what if something has to be ad-supported (I suppose you work for free?). The people who create our virtual tours are volunteers. We give them the change to make some money by allowing them to solicit sponsors for each tour they decide to create. And, please, don't tell me that it's wrong to have ads appear in our tours - have you clicked on many external links lately? By the way, every tour we create links back over to YOUR information here on Wikipedia via the TourPath.com Web site. If anything, we're promoting YOU...or is that wrong, too? See for yourself. <a href="http://www.tourpath.com/tour_state_georgia.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.tourpath.com/tour_state_georgia.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourpath.com/tour_state_georgia.shtml</a></p>
<p>I love how it's ok for us to help increase views on Wikipedia, but you don't think it's ok for us to post subject-relevant information on Wikipedia - via the EXTERNAL LINKS, too, for crying out loud! --TourPath 04:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Tourpath — this might help you a little bit. Here's Wikipedia's external links policy - <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. You might want to read through that to see if the external links you're attempting to add to the article are permissible or not.

<p>Thanks AreJay. The only point I noticed that may be of any concern is, "[Avoid linking to] A website that you own or maintain, even if the guidelines above imply that it should be linked to. This is because of neutrality and point-of-view concerns; neutrality is an important objective at Wikipedia, and a difficult one. If it is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let other — neutral — Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link."</p>
<p>I think our tours can actually overcome this since each tour is created by a unique individual and not one person. We don't express "point of view", but rather, each tour is a profile of communities around the country from a local perspective. What goes into a tour is factual information gathered through research. I work for the company that owns the virtual tour technology - NOT the actual tours. The actual tours are produced by people who licensed our technology. In no way, shape or form do we want to, or intend to, market our technology platform, but it makes total sense to link to virtual tours if they are contributive in nature. Your opinion on this matter is greatly appreciated. Best - --TourPath 18:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TourPath, I think the first step then would be to build some consensus here on the talk page as to whether or not users think the external link is appropriate. I personally don't have any problems with the fact that it is a dotcom as opposed to a .net or .org. Contrary to what was said in one of the earlier discussions, .com domains don't always have to relate to commercial entities, and certainly from a Wikipedia policy standpoint, there isn't any rule against .com websites (One of Wikipedia's mirrors is actually wikipedia.com — doesn't make it a commercial entity). So let's start off by building some consesus on this page — you may want to either create a separate discussion for that or just use this thread. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 01:13, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Idiot, How many times do people have to bicker with you until you get the point that you put your own opinion and biases in that section. First off the 1899 record of -9 is unofficial and weather instruments used then were inaccurate. Stop making climatical comparisons to international cities which lie on the same latitude. The comparison you made to Atlanta and Dallas was ludacris; Yes we all know Dallas is extremely hotter than Atlanta in the warm weathered months, But winter is a highly variable season depending from year to year the cities tend to be in mild winter "slugfest" if i may say so. Then you claimed july temps peak at 89, wrong once again. In truth they peak at 89 for the first week and a few extra days, the majority of the month reaches temps over 90. I doubt your a native and i doubt your knowledge in meteorology, You make it seem like the climate facts of an east coast city. I think the majority agrees we should delete the climatical section until a more accurate and precise one is made same with the Metro Atlanta page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.99.142.106 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.99.142.106.html" title="User talk:24.99.142.106">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.99.142.106_8388.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.99.142.106">contribs</a>) 22:27, 28 August 2006.</small></p>

<p>There is a need to clarify the deaths from the bombing during the olympics. Only one person died from the actual blast. The second was simply a heart attack and should not be included in the information as it may be misleading. If the second is included, then there should be an addition to deaths for those who died in a car accident that day. However this death may be notable information, but must be clarified.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the pronunciation of these /ˌætˈlɛ̃n.nə/ or /ˌɛtˈlɛ̃n.nə/ are. Do these are for local people or typical American people call?

<dd>The pronunciation guide should probably include examples with the "t" sound in the third syllable. Some people do pronounce that "t" and some do not. "Properly," it should probably have the "t," but in some dialects it does fall silent. Thanks for pointing it out!

<p>I restored the table to data from The Weather Channel website. Usually, averages are given for the past 30-year record, that is, the averages from 1971-2000. This is standard and the NWS usually does this. Giving averages for the entire climate record is not the typical practice. On the other hand, TWC gives record highs and lows all the way back to at least 1881. While the location of the measuring station in most cases has moved since then (typically from a city center to an airport), it still gives and indication of the temperatures that are possible in the area. In this respect, TWC has longer records. I think the Weatherbase website should only be cited in this case if some other fact needs to be supported (like number of days with rains, percent sunshine, # of clear days, etc.).</p>
<p>All of this might be moot, though, as it seems many people who edit the climate section insert numbers to their liking that are not supported by either source. Thanks. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 15:15, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we <i>please</i> settle on a lead image without randomly swapping in photos, without comment or discussion on the talk page, of arguably low quality and/or that don't represent the full skyline? As I said yesterday, in an edit summary -- a tool we should all use, by the way (ahem!) -- the current pic, certainly put there in good faith, <i>doesn't work</i>. It leaves the skyline too blurry to make out, and the thick orange-ish smog makes matters worse.</p>
