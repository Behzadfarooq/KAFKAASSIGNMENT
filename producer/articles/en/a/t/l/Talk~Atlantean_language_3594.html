	    <p>In the Unmentioned Verb Tense of Atlantean section, Noclevername marked as "needs citation" a passage that references original research and new ideas from yours truely. How can I site myself? I've tried to provide a brief remedy to the situation.</p>
<p>I plan to come back to this article to polish it up, at least in terms of my ideas that I put down here.</p>

<dd>I hate to do this to you, since you've obviously put a lot of work into this article, but parts of it are in direct contradiction to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy. Although I'm sure that your speculation is plausible, the rules say cited sources only. Sorry. <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclevername_7a7f.html" title="User:Noclevername">Noclevername</a> 21:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, no. That's cool. I understand. Rules and regulations are important. Please do make sure that this article conforms to the standards of this fine website. Besides, I can always find a more appropriate place to present the findings of myself and all my fellow workers in the decipherment of Atlantean.</p>

What is it, exactly, is it that you are doing?</p>

<p>There was actually quite a bit of original research here when I first visited this article. For example, I've found no evidence online that anyone officially stated the sentence order is SOV. Okrand only says in the Unofficial Disney Animation Archives' press release that the verb goes last. Everything else, like post-positions, noun-adjective, adverb-verb, and even the pronoun names, stuff that I had to work with when I began, was all here and here alone. The bibliography to this dictionary and grammar I've made is something like 15 pages. I've combed multiple Google searches with a fine-toothed comb. There's a lot out there on this language from interviews and newspaper articles presumably based on press releases.</p>
<p>If there's anything I can do to help, shoot me a line: ljrogers@mtu.edu.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's alright by me if you delete what you find to be unsupported. You'd be a regular Bishop Diego de Landa, but I always liked that guy. He's sort of a hero of mine in a paradoxical sort of way.</p>

You're welcome!&#160;:D It must be a grace from Almighty God, Deus Omnipotensus! Yes, the policy and everything makes perfect sense. Thank-you for your efforts toward directing the Atlantean language fan commnunity. We tred where angels dare not by researching a copyrighted language. Indeed, there are many other places where Atlantean language fans can go to exchange insights and theories on it. I hope to come back to this page and subtract from it further anything I find to be both undocumented and novel. I will include your contribution in a favorable light in my book. MOAKH NEE-sh-tem KAH-gihn net PAH-gesh-leh-nen! "I thank you now from the bottom of my heart." If you ever want any theories on Atlantean, drop me a line! That goes for anyone.</p>

<p>I would suggest using <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetics_Alphabet_4c2a.html" title="International Phonetics Alphabet">IPA symbols</a> for this article, perhaps in place of, or alongside the pre-existing pronunciations. Only because they are more specific and more easily understood by speakers of different languages. It would be great if someone with extensive knowledge of the IPA could provide the pronunciations, granting they first look at the ones already in place, and draw some sort of educated guess from there. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwow_2fb1.html" title="User:Wikiwow"><font color="darkgold"><b>...Wiki</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwow_005f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwow"><font color="darkred"><b>w√∏w</b></font></a> 22:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Howdy, tokh, I'm one of the people who might answer for your request. There's probably others out there, but I've done a lot of work in the recent months with Atlantean.</p>
<p>If anyone new wants to join the community of Atlantean language discipherers in response to this request by Wikiwow, I can help. Contact me at ljrogers(at)mtu.edu. I have contacts, old notes, publications, and other resources.</p>
<p>I have very little phonetic training. However, my fellow Atlantean discipherer Cynthia Morris seems to have had some. I plan to contact her and review her December 12th publication. She is not the only one who has done work on the phonetics of Atlantean. Paul Sherrill and his Atlantean Language Group had sealed a case for one phonetic system long before I stopped using the Atlantean alphabet as a cipher. (Message string "Spelling")</p>
<p>I am familiar with IPA from a college course I took on the English language. Through it I have connections with a Harvard-trained linguist, one Victoria Bergvall, Ph.D. I have met with her about this language and plan to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a serious obstacle is in the way for me to post the fruit of such research on the Wikipedia ("yutenosag dungun kwahm", "conversation without speech"). As hinted at above, Marc Okrand, the language's creator, has published very little of the Atlantean language through Disney. Hence, among many other elements of a complete language, there is no published pronunciation system for Atlantean. All work thus far (that I know of) is fan-researched.</p>
<p>The Esteemed NoCleverName did us Ugnaughts of Atlantean a great favor in making us aware of Wikipedia's "No Research Policy". Is your understanding of this policy the same as his? Should we put on Wikipedia a pronunciation scheme? Please write back. I earnestly look forward to your reply regarding these matters.</p>

<dd>Yes, I am aware of the "No Original Research Policy", and that it discourages statements based on one's own interpretation of the subject, including fan research. However, I'm a firm believer in the "there are always exceptions" concept, and in the case of television, film, literature, et cetera, fans are really the first source of information regarding plot and technical details. And as you said, there is very little published material regarding the Atlantean language. If you can get someone with advanced training in the field of phonetics, it would be of great use to this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know nothing of Atlantean, and very little of the International Phonetics System, so I don't know how I could really help, but I think this article could really use some standardized phonetics, seeing as they are in place in all the natural language and a number of well-known artificial language articles, for the purpose I have stated in the first post. Any published work concerning Atlantean phonetics would comply with Wikipedia's verifiablity policy, I imagine. However, the pronunciations are already in place, and as I have stated, fan research to some degree is acceptable in this case. And the only work to be done is applying the IPA symbols (which shouldn't be too difficult, I imagine). I hope I answered your questions. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwow_2fb1.html" title="User:Wikiwow"><font color="darkgold"><b>...Wiki</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwow_005f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwow"><font color="darkred"><b>w√∏w</b></font></a> 02:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good job, Robors, getting the Atlantean alphabet in there!</p>
<p>Here are the letters that I've found Atlantean actually uses:</p>
<p>A B G D E W H I Y K L U M N O P R S SH T</p>
<p>I gave it an abecedary based mostly on the earliest one out of Ugarit. The only curveball is that the H or "Heth" character is used for the "kh" sound of the Illustrated Script. That's the German gutteral consonant of "ach" und "doch", usw. I think Okrand put it in there because it's a common world language sound and it slightly connects Atlantean to Ancient Hebrew. All the other letters are rough equivalents to English'. Vowels are basically Latin.</p>
<p>Wikiwowtop: Give me a month or so to think about all this and return to the article.</p>
