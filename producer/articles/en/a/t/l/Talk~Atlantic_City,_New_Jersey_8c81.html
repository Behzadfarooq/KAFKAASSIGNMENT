<dd>A fair question, Rick. I am always reluctant to take information that may be useful out, but perhaps there could simply be a link to apage called ... er ...

<dd>I don't think it should be a separate Wikipage such as Atlantic City casino resorts because standing alone it does look like something that could be construde as commercial, Whereas if it is included as part of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_City%2C_New_Jersey_009e.html" title="Atlantic City, New Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a> it does give more of a informational appearance. Of course this is just my opinion.

<dd>Hmm .. a fair point. On the other hand, it isn't really a good thing to have so much semi-commercial stuff in such a short article. Neither one seems ideal. I'm not too fussed either way, so by all means revert if you think it best. Oh, BTW, I see that two different sysops banned Mr Obscenity who was editing this entry earlier on. I fully support that, and would have blocked him myself except that the others beat me to it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 07:49, 23 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we should have either phone numbers or addresses, but a list of the hotels/resorts themselves seems entirely appropriate (it is, after all, the major business of the city). The exlinks are appropriate and sufficient, I think. I agree with Misterrick that a separate page wouldn't be a good idea. The commercial bias of the article is clear, but the way to properly fix it is to add more (encyclopedic) information. Perhaps the page should be listed on "Pages Needing Attention", as there's probably quite a lot to say. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> 13:46, 23 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I'll say this: in it's present form, the page <i>sucks</i>. Don't just let it sit there festering, MR. If you don't like what I did to fix it, then do something to fix it yourself. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>My personal opinion, Alot of Wikipedia pages go untouched for longer periods of time so I wouldn't say that they suck or are festering. Judge not lest ye be judged. Anyway, Do what you want at this point I am just getting a bit tired of arguing about this because in the end it's just going to get vandalized again by anonymous users or argued by registered users if it should contain information about the casinos or not. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterrick_032d.html" title="User:Misterrick">Misterrick</a> 26 January, 2004, 11:00 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not believe that Atlantic City is part of the Delaware Valley which is really only Southeastern Pennsylvania including Philadelphia, Wilmington, Delaware and Camden, Cherry Hill and Trenton in Southern New Jersey. I would think that because Atlantic City is further South that it would be considered more part of the Atlantic region of the state which would extend down to Cape May.

<li>I'm not sure if it matters but the picture does not show the Steel Pier but someone insists on putting Steel Pier down as one of the sites shown. I live in Atlantic City, I'm 110% sure that it is not the Steel Pier. It was once called Ocean One Mall and has been redone into The Pier. Steel Pier is farther down and has rides. - AC Resident 1:35 EST, 06 July 2006</li>

<p>I see there appears to be a minor edit conflict regarding whether Philadelphia media outlets should be included in the Atlantic City article. Instead of re-listing the Philadelphia stations here, I think it would make sense to indicate that media coverage of Atlantic City is generally included in the Philadelphia market, and to see the Philadelphia article for Philadelphia stations. In my experience, most Philadelphia broadcast stations cannot be received well in Atlantic City, if at all, without cable or satellite television. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 16:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I seem to be in an edit war with an IP address user who has added every single media outlet that can possibly be received in AC. I have tried to trim down the list, particularly regarding non-local TV stations that can only be received via cable or satellite. But the IP address user has charged me with Vandalism, despite the fact that I clearly explained my edits. I guess there's always a first. We need to come to some policy as to what should be listed. I have no problem with the casino list; this is where they belong, and they're in AC. Non-local TV and rasio stations should be eliminated and listed where they are based. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the Popular Culture section, it says the city is "often mentioned on <i>Friends</i>. I was a huge fan of <i>Friends</i>, and for some time, even the moderator of a <i>Friends</i> message board, and offhand, I can't recall even one episode in which the city was mentioned. The closest I can come up with is in the last three episodes of the fifth season, when Joey went to film a movie in the desert, and ended up having to get a job at Caesar's in <b>Las Vegas</b>.

<p>I have reverted the edits of these two users because there are some serious errors made.</p>
<p>1) The Borgata is technically owned by the Marina District Development Corporation. Not jointly with MGM Mirage because MDDC is 50% owned by <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_Mirage_eaac.html" title="MGM Mirage">MGM Mirage</a> and 50% <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyd_Gaming_Corporation_d007.html" title="Boyd Gaming Corporation">Boyd Gaming Corporation</a> as a joint venture. This is per the New Jersey Casino Control Commission license.</p>
<p>2) I removed the Claridge name from the Bally's listing because it is part of Bally's not a separate entity. They use Bally's Atlantic City casino chips, tokens and TITOs on the tables and in the slot machines. I reinserted the footnote about Claridge now being part of Bally's.</p>
<p>3) I reinserted the (new) under the Hilton Hotel property to distinguish it from the former Hilton Atlantic City property which never opened due to their license application being denied by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. I should point out that even though the casino never opened there were chips made for the old Hilton property before it was sold to Trump Casino Resorts who briefly used the chips on the table.</p>
<p>4) Please learn to frockin' spell! You didn't even get the Claridge name right.</p>
