<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Youth_Wind_Symphony_%28AYWS%29_2abc.html" title="Edit section: Membership and Auditions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Membership and Auditions</span></h2>
<p>The AYWS is composed of approximately 80 students in these areas: flute/piccolo, oboe, bassoon, clarinet, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, alto/tenor/baritone saxophone, trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba, percussion, piano, harp, and string bass.</p>
<p><br />
Membership since 1988 has been drawn from approximately sixty different high schools in Cobb, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Fulton, Cherokee, Coweta, Henry, Clayton, Rockdale, Morgan, and Forsyth counties. In addition, students have recently traveled as far as Augusta and Rome to participate. Membership is competitive by auditions, and students are required to be enrolled in their own school music programs.</p>
<p><br />
For the audition, students are required to prepare 3-5 minutes of music, including a technical/fast excerpt and a lyrical/slow excerpt. 1-2 major or chromatic scales may be asked, and sightreading is provided.</p>
<p><br />
Percussionists are advised to prepare excerpts for at least two of the following three: timpani, mallets, and/or snare drum.</p>
<p><br />
In addition to standard wind and pecussion instruments, instruments such as bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, tenor and baritone saxophones, string bass, harp, and piano are needed.</p>

<p>The Atlanta Youth Wind Symphony (AYWS) performs four concerts annually on the Emory University campus. The AYWS has participated in commissioned compositions, premieres, and tours. Guest composers, conductors, and soloists of national renown are regularly invited to perform with the students. The group releases a compact disc compilation annually, and has plans for a studio recording in the near future.</p>
<p><br />
The AYWS has recently made several high-profile appearances, including concerts at the Georgia Music Educators Association State In-Conference, the College Band Directors National Association Southern Division conference, Carnegie Hall in New York City, and the Midwest Clinic in Chicago.</p>
<p><br />
The AYWS also engages in partnerships with other musical programs. The AYWS hosted the Columbus State University Wind Ensemble in December 2004 and was in turn hosted at Columbus State in March 2006. The group hosted the Dallas Symphony Youth Orchestra Wind Ensemble in March 2006 and will travel to Dallas in 2007. A joint performace with the Georgia State University Wind Ensemble is also planned.</p>
<p><br />
The group rehearses Monday evenings during the school year 7:30-9:30 pm, preparing each of four concerts in approximately six rehearsal periods.</p>
