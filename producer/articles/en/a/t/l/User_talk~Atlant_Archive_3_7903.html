<p>Anonymous coward? That's the voice of most of America speaking to you right now. You'd have to be completely deaf, dumb, and blind not to realize that. But you don't care in the least bit. You have your own insidious agenda to fulfill. Let me ask you something, comrade Atlant, while you are so prideful of your own insanity: what is it about America that you hate so much? Why do you insist on perverting the true meaning of freedom - the freedom that so many men have died to preserve? You have spat on their graves and pissed on their crosses, yet you are proud of that. Your organization has ruined the lives and traditions of countless numbers of hard-working, Christian Americans, and defended homeless drugatics and child molesters. Shame on you! You believe that you uphold the Constitution, but instead distort its words and turn everything it stands for on its head. Is that not a good example of cowardice? I am being rigid with you because its what you deserve. If I had said that under my username, I would come under fire for being politically incorrect. Who created political correctness? I know that the ACLU thrives on what it deems to be "politically correct." It seems that Wikipedia also shares that curse. So why should I tell you who I am? I speak for the America that you live to bring to its knees. How's that for anonymity? You'd better think real hard about a lot of things, pal, because one day, you will be dust just like everyone else. 65.69.71.169 02:51, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Ahh, so you admit you're an anonymous coward. Well, at least you can see some of your own limitations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, are you familiar with the fact that the ACLU occasionally defends Christians in freedom-of-religion cases?</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../a/t/l/User%7EAtlant_5157.html" title="User:Atlant">Atlant</a> 13:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is only occasionally, and it works harder to dislodge the religion Chrisianity from even being mentioned than it does protecting it. The ACLU is definitely more left-winged than right and you are unwilling to see this.</p>
<p>In extremely rare cases, the ACLU litigates in favor of Christians, but this is no more than a scapegoat to temporarily silence the latter so that your low-degree attourneys can continue their ruthless backstabbing.</p>
<p>Don't try and rationalize with me. If the ACLU had it their way, every Christian symbol in the country would be stricken down. You know this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Silent_Majority_5ae2.html" title="User:The Silent Majority">The Silent Majority</a> 15:11, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assure you that the ACLU has <b>no position</b> on the display of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_cross.html" title="Christian cross">crosses</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a> (or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_and_crescent.html" title="Star and crescent">stars and crescents</a> on <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosques</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_David_a785.html" title="Star of David">Stars of David</a> on <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogues</a>, or any combination of those things on your private property). We <b>do</b> have a position on crosses displayed on public property (that is, property owned by all of us including <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moslem.html" title="Moslem">Moslems</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindus</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">Atheists</a>, and <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Pastafarians</a>) and that is that <b>you can't do it</b>. It's in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a>; tough break. (Note that I've Wikilinked to it in case you've never read it; the specific part you'll be looking for is called Amendment One in the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.) But if you don't want to deal in rationalism, you're right, we should stop talking and you can go back to trying to force a Christian faith-based theocracy down the throats of us all. Perhaps rather than the Constitution, you'd prefer to read about <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Exodus_6943.html" title="Christian Exodus">Christian Exodus</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, you don't seem to be silent and I assure you that theocrats like you are not the American majority, even if you do steal an election now and again. And given that you seem to have created your self-admitted sockpuppet identity just to post here in my talk page, I still think you're an anonymous coward. Why aren't you enlisting instead of editing?</dd>

<p>I think posting this is bringing about a lot of unwanted attention and isn't really what Wikipedia is to be used for. Hopefully this action will reduce the number of attacks regarding your sexual preference, and politics. I don't really understand what the message says but it contains a lot of key words that attract hate mongers (Jew-hating for example).</p>

<dd>I've reverted your change. Wikipedia, just like the rest of America (and the world?) is full of right-wing nutcases and there's nothing to be gained by hiding the hateful, ignorant views of these people and the sorts of hit-and-run bullying attacks that they find so tasty. The only cure for these sorts of views is to bring them into the light.</dd>

<dd>But is an encyclopedia an appropriate place for airing your grievances toward the idiot members of one political side or another? I mean, it would be nearly too easy for anyone to provoke a teenaged twit from the left or the right to make a drive-by rambling. What good does it REALLY do to "bring them into the light?" It cures nothing. It only contributes further to the sort of hyper-partisanism that makes so many think that Pat Robertson is emblematic of the Right.</dd>

<p>I was wondering - seeing that you are a member of the ACLU, you may or may not be familiar with a dilemma which occurred fairly recently in San Francisco regarding a play entitled "Cootie Shots." An ACLU staff attourney by the name of Julia Harumi (probably from your district) served in the defense of the school district that was being sued by the parents of many of the children who had attended the play.</p>
<p>OK, since you are a member, I am going to assume that you know exactly what I am talking about. My question, therefore, is this: if the ACLU supposedly represents the will of the people, then what was the purpose of their involvement in this case? Of course, the parents, being insufficiently funded and short of manpower, were defeated. Nonetheless, it was perfectly clear that many of them felt that their religious beliefs as well as their constitutionally defined parental rights had been infringed upon, and rightly so! I mean, their kids had been forced through a mandatory indoc session without any prior notice whatsoever. Is it just me, or is something slightly wrong with this picture?</p>
<p>It's difficult for me to understand the precise logic and true motive(s) of your organization. Whenever I hear about the ACLU, they are always running to the defense of abortions, pornography, the gay agenda, and even matters as gruesome as partial-birth abortion, euthanasia, and pedophilia. You say that you speak for the freedoms of all, but it is quite clear that you are bent on advancing the "freedoms" of a select few, while contrarily trampling on the freedoms of most Americans.</p>
<p>Guys like <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Silent_Majority_5ae2.html" title="User:The Silent Majority">The Silent Majority</a> are just fed up, that's all. They're defending what they hold closest to their hearts, perhaps in a way that you see as ruthless or radical. I suppose that that simple analysis may be slightly irrelevant from a philosophical perspective, since wars have often been fought based upon ideals, albeit what the two opposing sides hold dear to their own hearts. I myself try to be more objective - after all, there are two sides to every argument.</p>
<p>In these difficult times, it's disheartening to see Americans at each other's throats like this. Please, humor me by engaging yourself. I have many questions about much of the recent legal history of the ACLU, and would be very much obliged to have them answered by an official member of the organization itself. If this is not the appropriate place for my questions, or if you are not interested, I will understand. Thank you for your patience. <a href="../../../c/u/s/User%7ECustosMorum_5377.html" title="User:CustosMorum">CustosMorum</a> 03:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>It's difficult for me to understand the precise logic and true motive(s) of your organization.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The ACLU's motive is always pretty simple: Defend the principles enunciated within the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This, unfortunately, is often painful. For examples, lets take several points in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Free Speech. Free Speech means just that; anyone pretty much has a right to speak publicly whatever comes to their minds, no matter how distasteful that speech may be to others. So when <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_4549.html" title="National Socialist Party of America">Nazis</a> want to march through <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skokie%2C_Illinois_a2d9.html#Controversies_and_Tragedy" title="Skokie, Illinois">Skokie, Illinois</a>, a true reading of the First Amendment's free speech provision means that the government should let them do it, because they have just as much right to their speech as you have to yours.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Freedom from government endorsing a religion. The government can not endorese a religion. It's for this reason that the ACLU occasionally joins a lawsuit protesting some sort of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>-only memorialization of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> <b>when that memorialization is supported by the government</b> (such as being located on the grounds of a city hall or statehouse or involving a bunch of public school kids singing a holiday concert that somehow ends up containing only Christian <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymns</a>). But we'd be just as sure to join a suit that sought to block, say, a <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a>-only memorialization of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannukah.html" title="Hannukah">Hannukah</a> or any other such activity; we just never get the chance because those religions typically aren't busy trying to use public venues to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytism.html" title="Proselytism">proselytise</a> the way that <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist_Christianity_a8e1.html" title="Fundamentalist Christianity">fundamentalist Christians</a> are these days.</li>

<dd>Here in the NHCLU (where I am a board member), we spend a fair amount of time on prisoner issues, trying to assure that the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">State of New Hampshire</a> provides adequate medical care for prisoners, doesn't try to warehouse them in wildly-inappropriate settings (mixing the truly violent with the merely <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">dope-smoking</a>, etc.), and the like. We also defend the usual free-speech issues such as making sure that people trying to legitimately exercise their right to protest <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> aren't forced to be a half-mile from his venue while Bush's supporters are allowed to line up for the TV cameras right outside the venue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>None of this stuff is predicated on what the majority, silent or otherwise wants. Under our system of government, that simply isn't supposed to be a factor in determining who gets rights. If anything, the enumeration of rights is precisely to avoid the <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Liberty_7773.html" title="On Liberty">Tyranny of the Majority</a>. The majority <b>should not be able</b> to decide, for example, that you, <a href="../../../c/u/s/User%7ECustosMorum_5377.html" title="User:CustosMorum">CustosMorum</a>, or anyone else, have no right to speak out, or no right to be able to question witnesses called against you in a legal procedding, or that you may be tortured to obtain a "confession" of some made-up crimes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, if you ignore your rights, they'll go away. And just because <b>you</b> aren't using a right right now doesn't mean you'll never need it.</dd>

<dd>Again, thanks for writing, and if you really do care about your rights, perhaps you'll make a contribution to your local ACLU affiliate?</dd>

<p>Well you're quite welcome, and I appreciate you taking the time to respond! I agree with you that interpretation can indeed be a painful process, and I think that we can also agree that it is unquestionably a subjective endeavor.</p>
<p><i>Free Speech means just that; anyone pretty much has a right to speak publicly whatever comes to their minds, no matter how distasteful that speech may be to others.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no derivitave analysis more vague than this of the meaning of freedom of speech. I wonder what would happen if all Christians interpreted the Bible as literally as the ACLU interprets freedom of speech. Our government would be overthrown and replaced with a theocracy, and all the homosexuals, adulterers, prostitutes, etc., etc. would be stoned. It's a damn shame that our forefathers weren't more specific while writing our Bill of Rights. Leaves a lot of room for misinterpretation, don't you think?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, wouldn't that, in some cases, compromise the security and/or well-being of the people? What if many Americans want their kids to be able to turn on a computer without being exposed to vivid pornographic images? How do you expect a child's mind to react to extremely violent movies? Their subconscious absorbs anything and everything like a sponge and their very lives can be molded through the retention of those influences. That is a proven scientific fact.</p>
<p>There are so many instances where such a dubious interpretation can be the cause of absolute disorder and chaos. I would hate to be a teacher in a world where anyone could say anything they wanted at mere impulse. Sedition would also be another big problem (already is) because blatant, internal subversion would endanger our fighting forces by encouraging our enemies.</p>
<p><i>Freedom from government endorsing a religion. The government can not endorese a religion.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>"That all men...are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well, they endorsed it there.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"It would be unbecoming of the representatives of theis nation to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and imploring his blessing...Here, and throughout our country, may simple manners, pure morals, and true religion flourish forever."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There's one of the 'Founding Fathers' (Adams) making it pretty clear that he is not only endorsing some form of a monotheistic religion, but leading his colleagues to join in his reverence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Need I say more? Hundreds of references to God can be found in our Constitution alone. This is so strange, and I am not being sarcastic - but, I truly do not understand this logic that you have shown me.</p>
<ul>
<li>In regard to Rush Limbaugh - I am not a fan of his, but that sounds like the ACLU was pulling a little political stunt. I could be wrong, of course.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bush has many MANY enemies right now. If I were the president, I wouldn't let an angry mob anywhere near me either. That is a matter of presidential security if I am not mistaken.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The role that you have just told me your New Hampshire division plays for convicts is something that I do support. On the other hand, you have to be sure that the prisoners aren't too comfortable in prison! It is prison, after all.

<p>My apologies - you are right on that one. No, to be honest with you, I have not read the entire Constitution word for word since high school. However, I do know that there are references to 'Almighty God' in the preambles of a number of State Constitutions.</p>

<dd>Firstly, I'd strongly suggest rereading the United States Constitution. It's not very long, and it's very interesting reading, especially in these times. The Amendments, of course, are where a lot of the action is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a handy link to it:
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html" class="external free" title="http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, on to your points:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is no derivitave analysis more vague than this of the meaning of freedom of speech. I wonder what would happen if all Christians interpreted the Bible as literally as the ACLU interprets freedom of speech. Our government would be overthrown and replaced with a theocracy, and all the homosexuals, adulterers, prostitutes, etc., etc. would be stoned.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Gee, I kinda thought this was the <b>intent</b> of a lot of the folks on the Religious Right. Certainly when one listens to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Falwell_c0ca.html" title="Jerry Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a> or hears the statements by (for example) <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_on_the_Family_c475.html" title="Focus on the Family">Focus on the Family</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned_Women_for_America_4884.html" title="Concerned Women for America">Concerned Women for America</a> one gets the impression that <b>they</b> are trying to impose what is essentially a Christian Theocracy here in the United States.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But your argument doesn't really speak to my point about free speech. Either you are willing to tolerate speech you find distasteful or you run the risk of someone else shutting <b>you</b> up because they find <b>you</b> distasteful.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Also, wouldn't that, in some cases, compromise the security and/or well-being of the people?</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps. Or maybe it would just expose powerful idiots to public embarrassment. Ben Franklin either coined or quoted the phrase "Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety" and it's just as true today as it was in his day. Somehow, our government managed to survive 225 years without all the rampant trampling on the Constitution that the Bush administration has done in just five years.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>What if many Americans want their kids to be able to turn on a computer without being exposed to vivid pornographic images?</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about you, but I manage to spend a lot of time on the Internet without <b>accidentally</b> stumbling across "vivid pornographic images". Perhaps such parents need to better-supervise their kids' activities (or stop watching that pornography themselves so it's not in their browser's cache/history lists?).</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>How do you expect a child's mind to react to extremely violent movies?</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know; why don't you ask all those parents who dragged their kids to see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Passion_of_the_Christ_5e42.html" title="The Passion of the Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>? That was a prime example of simulated <a href="../../../s/n/u/Snuff_film.html" title="Snuff film">snuff porn</a>, exactly the sort of thing I think you're worried about.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bush has many MANY enemies right now. If I were the president, I wouldn't let an angry mob anywhere near me either.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of his enemies, of course, he created for himself. (He's also created many new enemies for <b>our entire country</b>, but that's another debate.) Curiously, though, even though <b>lots</b> of people hated <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> (to the point of issuing frequent death threats!), he never needed to set up so-called <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech_zone.html" title="Free speech zone">free speech zones</a> to ensure that he never saw any protestors. (Yes, I know what the Wiki lede says, but I <b>never</b> observed a free-speech zone around Clinton, but have personally been the victim of several of them around Bush.) And that's who we're talking about: not violent people who might harm the President but simply loud, expressive people who disagree strongly with his opinions -- <b>THOSE</b> are the folks who are being kept far, far away from him.</dd>

<p>Labeling <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> as a snuff porn film is highly inappropriate. The film itself is an accurate historical representation, and depicts a highly sacred event that forged one of the oldest, enduring religions of today. Had it been created as mere entertainment, then more Christians would have been offended, and the simple truth is that most Christians accepted and realized its well-intended purpose. I find it highly ironic that someone who "frequently sides with Christians" and stands for a somewhat altered view of <i>freedom of religion</i> is so opposed to a depiction of a historical figure who was brutally murdered <i>for His religious views</i>. That would be an understatement to most Christians. Perhaps it offended you because of a deeper, more obscure reason? I don't know. Anyway, I've recently completed some research on the ACLU, deriving therein the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm still unclear as to the source of a large portion of your funding. This is a very questionable area, especially since the ACLU claims to be a non-profit organ. Such an ambiguity could, in the future, render the ACLU prosecutable under the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act_1837.html" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the ACLU's members claim to be atheist or agnostic. Thus, it is not only understandable that many Christians and Jews feel threatened, (including many who are entirely unrelated to a fundamentalist sect or attitude,) but may also in truth be reasonable. Keep in mind, sir, that political fundamentalism is just as identifiable and dangerous as is religious fundamentalism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the past thirty or so years, the ACLU has executed a radical departure from the general, pre-established interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Their chosen battles are a prime testimony to their role as an activist organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn't give a cent to the ACLU. They remind me too much of the Nazi brown shirts. What really worries me is that I was just about to do that. I thought "wow, an organization devoted to civil rights!" How misleading of you!!!!!!!!!!!!<a href="../../../c/u/s/User%7ECustosMorum_5377.html" title="User:CustosMorum">CustosMorum</a> 00:00, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, the ever-popular "Judeo-Christian" rap that Christians like to invoke any time they're feeling lonely. But <b>in reality</b>, I think you'll find that many Jews are just as threatened as your average ACLU member by the growing rise of Christian Fundamentalism in this country. In fact, many Jews <b>are</b> your average ACLU member as are many Christians, Moslems, Bahai, etc. etc., so your claims about us being majority atheist or agnostic may not be supportable in fact; got any citations? Or are you just making shit up? I know that if I look at my own board, it doesn't support your contention.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, thanks for proving that I'm making the right decision in keeping all these attacks around on my talk page. If there are any brown shirts being worn, I'm pretty sure it's not by me. (I look better in black, BTW.)</dd>

<p>Dude, honestly, I don't care what color you look good in. You're out of your twisted little mind. I'm not going to fight with you anymore because it's a waste of time. The ACLU has ushered in a radical transformation from our national origins, ignorant of who and what our country was built from. Don't give me this crap about there's growing Christian fundamentalism. I'm a Christian, and I respect it and all other religions as long as they don't breed hate. Not even the Christian fundamentalists are breeding hate (except maybe from you). It's the mad, screaming lesbians in San Francisco, the burning churches in the South, the disparaging and ridicule for Christians that oozes out of CNN that gets me up and moving in the morning. That's where the hate comes from pal.</p>

Man, a lot of innocent people are going to lose their lives because of some stupid cartoons that got the Muslims pretty worked up. I sure as hell don't want <i>that</i> happening in my country. Why don't you just move to Denmark? At least you won't have to worry about fundamentalist Christians - they're not the ones that want to chop your head off and scream 'Allah Akbar,' or blow you to smitherines anyway. Or perhaps you would rather join them in their perpetual war with Christians and Jews? You're such an idiot. I'm laughing so hard right now I think I'm going to puke! Whatever - go do what you do.

<p>I firmly believe that the silent majority is a ligitimate majority. It goes on the principle that its bark is worse than its bite (<i>Curtius Rufus</i>). If the majority of Americans were to express their views, I believe it would show that the ACLU is clearly in the minority. What is unfortunate is that most Americans listen to this left-wing bull from CNN and ABC and take it for the majority and do not act on their beliefs. So the media is an instrumental weapon in the liberals back pocket to silence the majority voice in the United States. It is all about Operation Smokescreen. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordRevan_dac9.html" title="User:LordRevan">LordRevan</a></p>

Rather than sign this with your IP address (164.116.107.39), you didn't sign your posting at all! I would think that would have to be an action anyone would associate with an anonymous coward, wouldn't you? It was only after I traced your post back to the Washington State public school internet consortium that you thought better of it, created a username, and edited your post ex post facto to hide your original anonymity. (After you admitted you were from Washington and then rapidly edited <b>that</b> back out again.)</dd>

<dd>Even so, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt and woul no longer refer to you as an <i>anonymous coward</i>. But you on the other hand (along with the rest of the "conservative" folks who seem to gravitate to my talk page), continue to use offensive language in every post ("crybaby", "ranting", "mental disorder", etc.). At this point, I have to assume you do this because of the content of your character.</dd>

<p>HOw about it A, since I see from you home page that you are a Boston area resident and an ACLU member, you surely must be more aware than you indicate of the controversy over the public giveaway of Boston public land to a Mosque; if you aren't aware of this, why not spend an hour or so today and find out WHY the ACLU refused to intervene in the lawsuit - and then why don't YOU edit the ACLU article to reflect on this matter?Incorrect 13:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's worse than that; a close reading of my user page would show you that I'm not just an card-carrying ACLU member, I'm also a member of the <b>Board of Directors</b> of the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union. This doesn't mean, of course, that I follow closely the actions of the Mass CLU, but sure, I'm aware of the mosque debate. I'm also aware of the second question I asked you (which you chose not to answer): <i>2) Must the ACLU take up every cause that strikes the fancy of its opponents?</i> Surely you realize that the answer is "No". And I suspect that if you looked back in history, you'd find that plenty of Christian churches and probably even a few synagogues have also benefited from underpriced land, so it seems odd that you'd be concerned about a mosque now benefitting. Why would the ACLU take up the question of the mosque benefitting when we apparently have never taken up the question of churches benefitting or synagogues benefitting? Given the state of America today, surely the opponents of the mosque can find some anti-Islamist organization to help in their activities? Surely they don't need the ACLU for this one?</dd>

<p>A (and I don't intend to be uncivil, sometimes I find sarcasm too irresistable but that's probably a character flaw), you are correct that the ACLU can't take up every case; but the Boston matter isn't just about a creche during Christmas at a local city hall - it's about the granting of land worth a lot (depending on the source) either several hundred thousand or several million) at way below market value to help construct a Mosque. Surely the ACLU should marshall its forces for the big matters, yet it appears to have ignored the macro in favor of the trivial - that indicates the ACLU either lacks a sense of proportianality, or that is operates with bias [we present the facts, you decide.] And have churches and temples ever benefited from below land value deals? I'm sure they have, and I'm sure the ACLU would violently object if they were aware of the giveaways (as would I). So I'm the one who is consistent here, objecting to any giveaway of public land to any religious organization - it's the ACLU that seems to have different objectives depending on the religion involved. Isn't this the very definition of hyprocrisy?Incorrect 14:36, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, I have no direct insight into what causes the Boards of the Mass CLU or ACLU National to decide to take up or not take up a given case, but there are several factors you might weigh here:
<ol>
<li>I don't know from whom the request to take up this case comes, but that would have impact on the decision. If the request appears to be coming from someone or some group that simply doesn't want a mosque or Muslims in their neighborhood, I doubt the CLU would take it up.</li>
<li>The question of "they fight creches, shouldn't they fight mosques?" isn't quite so clear-cut as you present it. Every year, the nation, the states, and cities and towns across the country give literally billions of dollars in subsides to various mainstream religions. They do this in the form of relief from taxes. It's not really so clear that anyone is extending all that much of a handout to the folks building the mosque. And the construction of the mosque might address positively other social problems in the area. By comparison, a crech instaled in front of a city hall is pretty blatantly allowing the proselytization of a single faith which also happens to be the overwhelming majority faith in this country.</li>
<li>Who knows what else is "on the plate" of the Mass CLU attorneys? As you know, if you folow the news, they've also just taken up the massive question of what to do about the (clearly-illegal under Mass state law) turning over of phone records to the NSA. And that's just the latest in a whole series of insults attributable to the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>.</li>
<li>Attorneys who do CLU work are often un-affiliated with the CLU and often work <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_bono.html" title="Pro bono">pro bono</a>; perhaps there's no attorney who wants to take up this case?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Really, you're trying to use this case to beat up on the (A)CLU but you're not standing on firm ground. I might also point out that I left your other edit (about the gag rule being imposed on National board members) standing; I think you're much safer accusing us of hypocrisy on <b>those</b> grounds than on the grounds that we appear to not be willing to sue the Muslims over their mosque.</dd>
