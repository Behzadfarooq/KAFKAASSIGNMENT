<p>The <b>Atlantic Yards</b> is a mixed-use commercial and residential development project of 16 buildings, currently proposed in the neighborhoods of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prospect_Heights%2C_Brooklyn_f720.html" title="Prospect Heights, Brooklyn">Prospect Heights</a>, and Park Slope, adjacent to Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. The centerpiece of the development, according to the developers, would be the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Nets_Arena_2b54.html" title="Brooklyn Nets Arena">Barclays Center</a>, which would serve as the new home of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Nets_dd51.html" title="New Jersey Nets">New Jersey Nets</a>. 8.4 acres of the 22 acre project would be built over a train yard that is utilized by the Long Island Rail Road, and a portion of the site was a part of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Terminal_Urban_Renewal_Area_3b9e.html" title="Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area">Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area</a>. The Atlantic Yards project is being developed and overseen by <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_City_Ratner_5983.html" title="Forest City Ratner">Forest City Ratner</a> and designed by architect <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Gehry_f386.html" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>.</p>
<p>Its derives its name from being the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_yard.html" title="Rail yard">rail yard</a> located on <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Avenue_%28New_York_City%29_2846.html" title="Atlantic Avenue (New York City)">Atlantic Avenue</a>. Officially the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_Rail_Road_1c69.html" title="Long Island Rail Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> yard is called the "Vanderbilt Yards" (named for a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_Avenue_%28Brooklyn%29_fd98.html" title="Vanderbilt Avenue (Brooklyn)">Vanderbilt Avenue</a> that goes to the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Naval_Yards_2ee4.html" title="Brooklyn Naval Yards">Brooklyn Naval Yards</a> but there are other Vanderbilt rail place names in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> so the Atlantic Yards name has stuck. The specific stop for the LIRR is the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatbush_Avenue_%28LIRR_station%29_5ba5.html" title="Flatbush Avenue (LIRR station)">Atlantic Terminal</a> is the westernmost stop of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Branch_fbb2.html" title="Atlantic Branch">Atlantic Branch</a> of the LIRR. Its rail and subway hub status along with the fact that no structures were above the yard made it a target for development.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing litigation, preparatory sitework in anticipation of construction has started as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>.<a href="http://www.fortgreenecourier.com/site/tab10.cfm?newsid=17894575&amp;BRD=2384&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=552856&amp;rfi=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fortgreenecourier.com/site/tab10.cfm?newsid=17894575&amp;BRD=2384&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=552856&amp;rfi=6" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Nets_Arena_2b54.html" title="Brooklyn Nets Arena">Barclays Center</a>, would serve as the new home of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a>’s <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Nets_dd51.html" title="New Jersey Nets">New Jersey Nets</a>, which was purchased by a group lead by principal developer <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Ratner_5616.html" title="Bruce Ratner">Bruce Ratner</a> with the intention of making it and the arena the centerpiece of whole project. This would bring major league professional sports to Brooklyn for the first time since the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Dodgers_1ffe.html" title="Brooklyn Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> after the 1957 season. The arena’s design includes an ice skating rink and private park space on its roof. The arena represents about 10% of the Ratner proposal.</p>
<p>The naming rights to the arena were purchased by Barclays, the British bank, for a record-setting price of nearly $400 million over 20 years. This eclipsed the previous record for naming rights to an American indoor arena. The previous record, set by Royal Phillips Electronics in 1999, was for $185 million over 20 years paid to name Phillips Arena in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the naming rights will go to the developer, not to the state of New York, which would nominally own the land. The naming rights deal provoked additional controversy because Barclays has been accused of being associated with the South African apartheid regime, Robert Mugabe and Nazi financing.</p>

<p>The development would be paid in part by private financing and in part by public subsidies. New York State has committed to $100 million of taxpayer money and New York City is giving $205 million in direct contributions. In addition, there are approved tax breaks and subsidies to pay for the project, bringing the total known public money to be used in the project to approximately $1.929 billion. The tax subsidies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$360 million - 30 Year Full Property Tax Exemption (if the lease for its full term of 99 years, the abatement would exceed $1 billion)</li>
<li>$77 million - Mortgage Recording Tax Exemption</li>
<li>$610 million - 9.1 Million Square Feet of Development Rights (A $910 million value for which Ratner pays approximately $300 million, including a discounted, closed-door price for the Rail Yards, without genuine competitive bidding; Vanderbilt Rail Yards appraised value: $214.5 million, Ratner bid $100, Extell bid $150 million)</li>
<li>$555.3 million - Tax-Exempt and Taxed Bonding for the Arena</li>
<li>$101 million - Housing Construction Subsidies</li>
<li>$26 million - Forest City Pays $1.00 for a 99 year lease for all the land under the Arena, its garages and access ways, including City street, a total of 6.5 acres</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the known subsidies, the unknown subsidies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unspecified (and unlimited) additional funds for "extraordinary infrastructure costs"</li>
<li>Government subsidies and/or tax credits to provide for "affordable housing"</li>
<li>Credit for any costs which Ratner incurs in relocating and installing public utility infrastructure</li>
<li>Guaranties from the City, the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_State_Development_Corporation_4d1f.html" title="Empire State Development Corporation">Empire State Development Corporation</a> and the EDC that they will "use their best efforts" to obtain energy cost savings for the Arena for an unspecified period of time</li>
<li>Arena construction materials and fixtures sales tax exemption</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Yards_bf18.html" title="Edit section: Land to be used">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Land to be used</span></h2>
<p>The proposed development rests at one of the most desirable neighborhoods in New York City. Prospect Heights has seen remarkable explosion of real estate values, pushing out many of the less affluent residents. Critics charge that the few unused buildings are "developer's blight," that is to say, buildings bought by Forest City Ratner and then left vacant.</p>
<p>The bulk of the 22 acre project site is a mixture of public streets, private homes and small businesses. Forest City Ratner has bought much of this private property, but does not own the public streets and intends to use eminent domain to seize the remaining property from private homeowners and businesses. The Public Authorities Control Board, which effectively ended the West Side Stadium plan, approved the Atlantic Yards plan and use of eminent domain. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/nyregion/21brooklyn.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;ex=1166677200&amp;en=7b12a0b28185ef10&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage&amp;oref=slogin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/nyregion/21brooklyn.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;ex=1166677200&amp;en=7b12a0b28185ef10&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> However, the plan still faces lawsuits from residents.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Yards_bf18.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>The main controversy concerning the development of the Atlantic Yards is the use of eminent domain which would destroy a mixed income neighborhood. Developers had offered tenants up to $1 Million to leave their homes, plus guarantee them an apartment in the complex at the same rent they were paying.</p>
<p>Another controversial aspect of the development is that the rail yard was valued at $214 Million in 2005, and is in contract with the favored developer for $100 Million, despite another bid for $150 Million. Even though this property was appraised at $214 in 2004, the MTA decided to negotiate exclusively with Forest City Ratner, which originally bid $50 Million. Extell Corporation bid $150 Million, and FCR eventually boosted its bid up to $100 million. The Extell bid, however, was contingent on a contract for the company to provide energy to the city from a power plant that would have been constructed in the location.</p>
