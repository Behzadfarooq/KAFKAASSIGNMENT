It was previously operated by <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> as <i><b>The Atlantic Limited</b></i> between Montreal and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick_53fc.html" title="Saint John, New Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>. It formed part of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_railroad.html" title="Transcontinental railroad">transcontinental</a> service for both systems.</p>
<p>The <i>Atlantic</i> and its predecessor <i>The Atlantic Limited</i> (along with several other CPR local trains) was the only passenger rail service in the U.S. state of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> from the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> until discontinuance of operations in December <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_%28passenger_train%29.html" title="Edit section: The Atlantic Limited">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Atlantic Limited</i></span></h2>
<p>Inaugurated by the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR) as a "limited stop" service on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, <i>The Atlantic Limited</i> used numbers 41/42 (westbound/eastbound) and took the schedule and equipment for what were previously numbered trains between <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal%2C_Quebec_80c4.html" title="Montreal, Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Station_%28Montreal%29_2c0f.html" title="Windsor Station (Montreal)">Windsor Station</a>) and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick_53fc.html" title="Saint John, New Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a> (Union Station). The service operated overnight using the CPR's former <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Railway_of_Maine_bb69.html" title="International Railway of Maine">International Railway of Maine</a> line which formed the direct route between Saint John and Montreal. Although this was CPR's first named passenger train to the Maritimes, daily passenger service had been offered since <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>.</p>
<p><i>The Atlantic Limited</i> saw the first major change to its route around <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> when the Saint John Union Station was demolished and CPR's Mill Street yard redeveloped to accommodate the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John_Throughway_b8f4.html" title="Saint John Throughway">Saint John Throughway</a> and associated urban redevelopment. A new passenger station was built on the city's west side in the former city of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster%2C_New_Brunswick_1c49.html" title="Lancaster, New Brunswick">Lancaster</a> where new rail yards were developed. During the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, CPR operated the service at minimal levels with usually a single E-8 locomotive (one of only two operated in Canada, both by CPR) and a baggage, coach, diner, and sleeper car. Some of the stainless steel <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budd_Company_94a3.html" title="Budd Company">Budd Company</a> cars originally ordered for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Canadian_2063.html" title="The Canadian">The Canadian</a></i> also made their way onto this train and there was infrequent availability of a dome car as well.</p>
<p>While <i>The Atlantic Limited</i> name was only used officially after <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> on the Montreal-Saint John service, the name, or a variation of it, has possibly seen use for a service which operated on CPR and CPR-subsidiary <a href="../../../s/o/o/Soo_Line_c5a3.html" title="Soo Line">Soo Line</a> between <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, via <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sault_Ste._Marie%2C_Ontario_9d48.html" title="Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario">Sault Ste. Marie</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa%2C_Ontario_5cf0.html" title="Ottawa, Ontario">Ottawa, Ontario</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal%2C_Quebec_80c4.html" title="Montreal, Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick_53fc.html" title="Saint John, New Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, beginning in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> following the completion of the line to Saint John. It is possible that the name "Atlantic Limited" was officially used on the Soo Line portion between Minneapolis-Sault Ste. Marie, although only numbered trains officially existed east of Montreal between 1889-1955. An extension to the Minneapolis-Montreal-Saint John service operated between Montreal and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> (in partnership with the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_and_Maine_Railroad_275a.html" title="Boston and Maine Railroad">Boston and Maine Railroad</a>), possibly using the name <i>Atlantic Express</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_%28passenger_train%29.html" title="Edit section: Atlantic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Atlantic</i></span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/a/VIA_Rail_66f3.html" title="VIA Rail">VIA Rail</a> was created out of a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railway_1825.html" title="Canadian National Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> subsidiary to become Canada's national passenger rail service. In October of that year, VIA negotiated the take-over of CPR passenger service, although routes, equipment and schedules did not change until the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. Thus for the first few months after VIA was created, the company included <i>The Atlantic Limited</i> in its timetable and the service continued to operate using the same CPR equipment and crews. In the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> this was changed with the name <i>The Atlantic Limited</i> shortened to the bilingually appropriate <i>Atlantic</i>/<i>Atlantique</i>.</p>
<p>At the same time, service was extended effective October 1979 with a new eastern terminus at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a> and the 1970s-era CPR passenger station in Saint John was closed in lieu of a new station in that city's downtown. The extension of the train to Halifax was made possible by VIA's decision to not continue a CN train named the <i>Scotian</i>, thus the <i>Atlantic</i> assumed that train's numbers of 11/12 (westbound/eastbound) and equipment.</p>
<p>Under VIA, the <i>Atlantic</i> became a well-used train, given the shorter route (by 150 miles) over the <i><a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_%28passenger_train%29.html" title="Ocean (passenger train)">Ocean</a></i>, and the fact that the <i>Atlantic</i> served the cities of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John%2C_New_Brunswick_53fc.html" title="Saint John, New Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fredericton%2C_New_Brunswick_1eb3.html" title="Fredericton, New Brunswick">Fredericton, New Brunswick</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherbrooke%2C_Quebec_b42d.html" title="Sherbrooke, Quebec">Sherbrooke, Quebec</a>, in addition to many smaller towns and villages in between.</p>
<p>However increased patronage of the <i>Atlantic</i> did not meet VIA targets, although some might say it did not cross as much politically-crucial territory in Quebec as the <i>Ocean</i>. Thus in the VIA budget cuts by the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Trudeau</a> government in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, the <i>Atlantic</i> was terminated in lieu of Budd RDC service between Halifax-Moncton-Saint John-Fredericton. During this time, Fredericton saw its first passenger trains since the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>Southwestern New Brunswickers were incensed at the cutting of the <i>Atlantic'</i>s route, one which had seen daily passenger rail service in both directions between Saint John and Montreal since the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Railway_of_Maine_bb69.html" title="International Railway of Maine">International Railway of Maine</a> opened in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>. Community leaders along the route, led by rookie Saint John mayor <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elsie_Wayne_94ad.html" title="Elsie Wayne">Elsie Wayne</a>, quickly rallied local populations to lobby the federal government. After several years and a personal promise by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Brian Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a> that his government would reinstate VIA service on the route, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">PC Party</a> won election in 1984 and that December it was announced that the <i>Atlantic</i> would be returning to the rails.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> the train was reinstated on its former route between Halifax and Montreal, although VIA made some changes to its operations in the Maritimes to accommodate the <i>Atlantic</i>. The <i><a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_%28passenger_train%29.html" title="Ocean (passenger train)">Ocean</a></i> service was actually downgraded to just a Montreal-<a href="../../../m/o/n/Moncton%2C_New_Brunswick_76a9.html" title="Moncton, New Brunswick">Moncton</a> train with a platform connection to the through <i>Atlantic</i>. This lasted until the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> budget cuts to VIA which saw service on both routes reduced to 3 days/week in each direction (alternating days) beginning on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>. From <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> until <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, the <i>Atlantic</i> operated consistently on its 3 day/week service which saw it share an equipment pool with the <i>Ocean</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, the owner of the tracks between Saint John and Montreal, CPR, began to look for potential buyers of its former <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Railway_of_Maine_bb69.html" title="International Railway of Maine">International Railway of Maine</a> and associated lines. When it became apparent by summer <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> that a buyer would not be found, CPR began the formal process of applying to abandon the entire route. Faced with uncertainty about the continuance of the operation after the abandonment date of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, VIA announced in October of that year that it would terminate the <i>Atlantic</i> effective <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a> (last trains leaving December 16) and switch its equipment to the <i>Ocean</i> which would jump to a 6 day/week schedule in each direction. Prior to the discontinuance of the <i>Atlantic</i>, CPR announced that it had made an agreement in principle with <a href="../../../j/2E/d/J.D._Irving_Limited_030b.html" title="J.D. Irving Limited">J.D. Irving Limited</a> to buy the line and operate it as a shortline to be called <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Brunswick_Southern_Railway_4647.html" title="New Brunswick Southern Railway">New Brunswick Southern Railway</a>, however VIA was not permitted at this time to operate on a shortline railway. Federal regulations stated that it must operate on one of the two national railways of Canada.</p>
<p>Abandonment of passenger service for the second time on this route (by the same political party) was especially controversial for southwestern New Brunswickers who viewed it as a convenient excuse by the federal government to cut the service for both shortsighted fiscal and strategic political reasons. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> was making aggressive budget cuts throughout the federal government, thus concentrating service on the <i>Ocean'</i>s route would likely save some money. The <i>Ocean</i> also travelled a route that passed through then-<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Transport_%28Canada%29_7a93.html" title="Minister of Transport (Canada)">Minister of Transport</a> <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Young_d855.html" title="Doug Young">Doug Young</a>'s riding of <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadie-Bathurst_6c19.html" title="Acadie-Bathurst">Acadie-Bathurst</a>. The <i>Atlantic</i> also passed through the only two ridings in the country which elected Progressive Conservatives - Elsie Wayne in Saint John and Jean Charest in Sherbrooke. It also didn't help that the <i>Atlantic</i> passed through <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> (U.S. territory) on its short route between Montreal and Saint John.</p>

<p>Following the assumption of service by VIA Rail in 1979 until discontinuance in 1981 and restoration of service in 1985 until discontinuance in 1994, the <i>Atlantic</i> followed a somewhat different route, with the most obvious change being the extension over CN trackage east of Saint John to Halifax. There was a subtle change between Montreal and Lennoxville too, where VIA wished to consolidate its trains at the former CN Central Station in Montreal. Leaving Montreal, the <i>Atlantic</i> followed the route of the <i>Ocean</i> on CN trackage through St. Hyacinthe to <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acton_Vale%2C_Quebec_4dc7.html" title="Acton Vale, Quebec">Acton Vale</a>, where it turned south on CN tracks and followed the St. Francois River valley into the Eastern Townships to Sherbrooke where it regained CP tracks. From Sherbrooke to Saint John, the <i>Atlantic</i> followed the same route as its predecessor <i>The Atlantic Limited</i>. East of Saint John, the train followed a similarly scenic route through the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennebecasis_River_9598.html" title="Kennebecasis River">Kennebecasis River</a> valley and its mixed farmland to Moncton and then followed the same route as the <i>Ocean</i> crossing the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantramar_Marshes_256e.html" title="Tantramar Marshes">Tantramar Marshes</a>, the Wentworth River valley, the edge of <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobequid_Bay_3fd0.html" title="Cobequid Bay">Cobequid Bay</a> and mixed farmland through central Nova Scotia to Halifax.</p>
