<li>Hi. You currently have virtually no chances of becoming an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrator</a>, you need a lot more experience and you need to exponentially increase your flow of contributions. I would not risk an RfA until you have at least +3000 edits, of which +1000 on the mainspace and a few hundreds on the WP space. You need to get involved in administrative-oriented tasks, such as <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">countervandalism</a> or <a href="../../../x/f/d/WP%7EXFD_3ea5.html" title="WP:XFD">XfD</a>. And a good knowledge of the <a href="../../../l/o/p/WP%7ELOP_6650.html" title="WP:LOP">policies</a>. And no conflicts. Your <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~aoleg/wp/rfa/edit_summary.cgi?user=Atlantis%20Hawk" class="external text" title="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~aoleg/wp/rfa/edit_summary.cgi?user=Atlantis%20Hawk" rel="nofollow">edit summary usage</a> is too low, please always add an edit summary to your edits. You have a long way to go but I wish you good luck.

<li>Hi there, while I wouldn't have put it <i>quite</i> that way, it's true that you are extremely unlikely to become an administrator at this point in time. Húsönd covered pretty much everything, but let me add that the more you contribute to articles, people will learn your strengths and weaknesses and come to recognise you. As I've said several times today, having the trust of the community is an integral part of being an administrator, and the only way to gain that trust is through increased participation in Wikipedia, with a consistent record of good judgement and civility, even during times of conflict. Or rather, <i>especially</i> during times of conflict. I wish you well. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="zapfino">Kyok</font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_Esperanza_1001.html" title="User:Tachikoma/Esperanza"><font color="green" face="zapfino">o</font></a> 00:45, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, now that I read my review again, I do seem to sound a little bit harsh. Sorry Atlantis, it was not my intention to sound like that, the review was meant to read as with a friendly, advisory tone. But, well, when you're reading something there's no way to know if the person who wrote it had a smile on their face or a Hitler-like expression.&#160;:-) I hope that you didn't find me harsh.

<li>Hello there, Atlantis Hawk. It seems I am late for the party&#160;:-)
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>First of all, I notice you have started using edit summaries since you entered this review. That is very good, you are listening to people here! 75% for major edits and 92% for minor ones is still on the low side (both should be at 95% or above, usually), but I guess it is much better than the one you had in the past.</li>
<li>You have been working pretty hard in November, however note that it is not enough to contribute one month in order to have a successful nomination. One of the requisites for being an administrator is experience, which is usually obtained by both time in Wikipedia and edit contributions. I suggest you to contribute for three or four months at least in order to be eligible as one.</li>
<li>Reviewing some of your contributions, I see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEnrico_Pallazzo&amp;diff=88376862&amp;oldid=88371226" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEnrico_Pallazzo&amp;diff=88376862&amp;oldid=88371226" rel="nofollow">this summary</a> a bit misleading, because AFDs are not votations, but discussions, and you don't vote, you give an opinion. Also, in such discussion, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Enrico_Pallazzo_2a8c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Enrico Pallazzo">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Enrico Pallazzo</a>, you chose to delete instead of redirect (maybe following the lead of the ones who had given their opinion before you). Remember that redirects are cheap, so if an article can be contained by another, it is better to merge and redirect or just redirect. A new user may create the article again, and if that can be prevented with a redirect, much better.</li>
<li>I also notice you have started two wikiprojects (one of which merged with an existing one), and joined several others. That should give you even more interaction with other users.</li>
<li>I have problems with <a href="../../../k/a/h/Image%7EKahuna_Icon.jpg_e1bc.html" title="Image:Kahuna Icon.jpg">Image:Kahuna Icon.jpg</a>, because you are saying <i>This picture is actually copyrighted, but I have permission to use it.</i> You may have permission, but you are not demonstrating it in the page. Either take the picture yourself, get written permission from the owner of the image to release it under GFDL, or request an administrator to delete it. Same goes for <a href="../../../k/o/o/Image%7EKookaburra_Beast.jpg_76d0.html" title="Image:Kookaburra Beast.jpg">Image:Kookaburra Beast.jpg</a>. As for <a href="../../../k/o/h/Image%7EKoh_kood_map.gif_3354.html" title="Image:Koh kood map.gif">Image:Koh kood map.gif</a>, you need to specify if you had created the image, or picked it from somewhere else. Regarding <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_WP_Sex_07a3.html" title="Template:User WP Sex">Template:User WP Sex</a>, you may consider asking WikiProject Sexuality to use it as their own, if a template is used only by one user, it may be better to move the template into your own namespace. Finally, regarding <a href="../../../n/w/_/Image%7ENW_tway_map.jpg_cc85.html" title="Image:NW tway map.jpg">Image:NW tway map.jpg</a>, where in the site states it is a public document? Try to be more specific when giving sources (in example, providing a link to the image and to the page from where you picked it).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>You are off to a great start! As stated above, I would recommend not trying to nominate yourself for a couple of months more, at least until you are more familiar with the different manual of style recommendations. Since you seem to know a lot about Australia, I recommend you to pick an article and try to make it a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">good article</a>. This will prove others in your future nomination that you know how to edit. Also, consider that AFDs are not votations where a side "wins". Finally, try to be a bit more specific when uploading images. The ones I mentioned could be sent to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a>, as their source and claim of permission are not clear in the image summaries. Remember, it is better to have an article without images than images with non-clear free statements. Good luck! -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 18:46, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
<b>Questions</b> 1. There is a contribution that I am particulary pleased with and it's one of my fairly recent ones. They're the edits I made to the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morristown_West_High_School_30fd.html" title="Morristown West High School">Morristown West High School</a> page, which were more a cleanup than anything. I stumbled across this page when skimming through the articles for deletion pages when I realised this page did not deserve to be deleted. It's the subject of a possible copyright infringement now and I don't know exactly why.</p>
<p>2. Well I haven't had any major and I mean very major conflicts but there is a dispute between <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhanatical_fa5c.html" title="User:Phanatical">Phanatical</a> and me over what should be in the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girraween_High_School_f7a1.html" title="Girraween High School">Girraween High School</a> page. The dispute is relatively minor, but I don't think Phanatical understands that a lot has changed since he left, well before me. So now it's more a concern with the awful truth versus watered-down propaganda. I don't dislike Phanatical but I think he should give a little way to other editors. The dealing with this problem still hasn't quite subsided but it's a working progress. Should this happen again however (with anyone), it will be more a debate over talk pages until a common idea is reached. Whether that be good or bad, it won't really be that harmful.</p>
