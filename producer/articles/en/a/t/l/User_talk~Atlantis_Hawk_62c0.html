<p>Firstly, why have you decreased the importance weightings of several VFL/AFL related articles&#160;? Can you please explain the reasoning for this&#160;?</p>
<p>Secondly, what gives you arbitrary right to decide to upgrade the quality rating of the Brisbane article&#160;? --<a href="../../../b/i/a/User%7EBiatch_2130.html" title="User:Biatch">Biatch</a> 04:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a good reason that I have given a 'mid' or 'low' importance rating to many of the AFL/VFL articles and that is because they are insignificant to the whole AFL picture. What I mean by that is the AFL article would be a 'top' importance article, each club would be of 'high' importance, historic grand finals would be of 'mid' importance, considering they are just a single game, and the draft as 'low' importance because the draft really does not mean much as when most people watch the footy, they don't give a damn about the draft. If you are really that concerned about it not being rated highly enough, you are free to change it. If you look closely, you might be able to see that those AFL/VFL ariticles had no previous rating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the thing that does give me arbitary right to rate the Brisbane article is that I'm on the assesment team of Wikiproject Australia which you are welcome to join. If you have an objection to the rating of the Brisbane article, discuss it with a few more editors and then change its rating. I won't have a problem with it</dd>

<p>You're welcome. Well, it depends. You don't have to stick to a specific number of edits every day, there may be days when you'll make a lot of them, and days when you'll make just a few. But try to make at least some edits every day, otherwise your flow may be deemed unsteady in your eventual RfA. I usually make around 150 edits a day, but I'm obsessed.&#160;:-P I'd say that a few tens of edits per day and involvement in administrative-oriented tasks, and you'll be walking the right path to adminship.

<p>I think you were right about Political economy of drugs. But if you were <i>really</i> trying to be perfect for RFA, I'd say you could have done a tad more than a comment.

<p>Hi there, nice to meet you. The number of edits I make per day depends on how motivated I am, how energetic I feel, and (if it's nighttime or early morning) how insomniac I am feeling. This generally varies from just a couple of edits a day to as many as 20 or 30. I try to check Wikipedia at least once a day in order to check for messages and monitor my watchlist. This doesn't mean that <i>you</i> have to do the same, by any means. I hope you find this helpful. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="zapfino">Kyok</font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_Esperanza_1001.html" title="User:Tachikoma/Esperanza"><font color="green" face="zapfino">o</font></a> 13:02, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sorry but I cannot resist making a comment to "<i>2001 (before the dinosaurs in internet time)</i>" on your user page&#160;:-) I suppose in Australia the Internet was still not very widely used in 2001 (I had to cope with modems when I came to Australia in 2001 when I was already using 1.5 Mbps broadband for about the same monthly cost in 1999 where I was from), but you are making Australia sound sooo backwards&#160;:-) How can 2001 be "before the dinosaurs"? Not too far away in southeast Asia, practically all computer users had Internet access in 2001. 1991 would be more like dinosaurs time. Anyway. I hope you change it and then remove this comment of mine.&#160;:-) -- 15:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>but the recent events of <i><a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicgirluk_photo_debate_e976.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate">l'Affaire Publicgirluk</a></i> were extremely disheartening to me, as they showed (to my way of thinking, at least) that WP's editing and administrative community are really not mature enough to handle articles on sexuality both responsibly and fairly. I've seen the toughest, nastiest political POV disputes resolved fairly and openly following WP's policies, but I've also seen those procedures summarily thrown out on their ear when sex was the topic. For now I'll just stick to watching those sex-related articles I already watch. But by all means, if you notice a sex-related article that is in bad shape - specifically in those issues where sexuality and law or community standards come into conflict, such as prostitution or the various genital mutilation/alteration articles (all of which I watch) - then definitely let me know. &#160;:)</p>

<p>Hi: I see the tremendous effort you have put into making the Wikiproject sex.

I have a guideline for images in sexology and sexuality that is fairly active and being worked on to help with the multitude of problems that exist in this area.

<dd>Hey, thanks for the welcome. Would you be able to respond to the thing I have asked on the talk page. Changing the scope is a big step (even though it is just starting), and I would like to reach concensus before changing it.

<p>Hi. I'm one of the persons who reviewed the aforementioned article at the FAC page. I'm just here to give you a little encouragement. The article is quite good as it stands, and with a little collaborative effort, I'm sure it will be featured. Hope you are working on the objections (sources and deficient intro etc); there is still time to address these issues before time expires. Come to me if you need further advice. Though university/work constrains me, I may still be able to offer a word or two. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist"><font color="navy" face="Garamond"><b>O</b>ran</font><font color="#008B00" face="Garamond"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist"><font face="Garamond">talk</font></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist_65e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist"><font face="Garamond">cont.</font></a>) 02:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I doubt it is fit for GA. It has just been restructured. Perhaps there should be a peer review first and if this goes well a GA nomination. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 13:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
