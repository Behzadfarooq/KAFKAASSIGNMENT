TWELVE Atlantic Station</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Atlantic Station is comprised of three distinct areas that are lined along 17th Street between the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Connector_8f28.html" title="Downtown Connector">Downtown Connector</a> and Northside Drive. They are known (from east to west) as The District, The Commons, and The Village.</p>

<p>The District is where most of Atlantic Station's retail and office space is located. Opened on October 21, 2005, it is set up in the style of an outdoor mall, with many choices of shopping, dining, and a 16-screen <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regal_Entertainment_Group_94c4.html" title="Regal Entertainment Group">Regal</a> <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_theater.html" title="Movie theater">movie theater</a>. Above the retail levels is an additional two to three stories of condominiums known as ATLofts. The District is actually above two stories of one of the country's largest <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parking_deck.html" title="Parking deck">parking decks</a>. With the 7,300 space parking garage underneath, the shopping area is pedestrian friendly and many of the surface level streets are often closed off for special events. The southwest corner of The District is home to the 26-story, 336-foot TWELVE Hotel and Residences Atlantic Station, which was completed in December, 2005. In addition, townhomes constructed by Beazer Homes in 2004 line 16th Street one block south of The District.</p>

<p>The District's office space is located along the six-lane 17th Street Corridor and is currently home to two office buildings: the 22-story 171 17th Street (known as the <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wachovia.html" title="Wachovia">Wachovia</a> Building and formerly <a href="../../../s/o/u/SouthTrust_f0fb.html" title="SouthTrust">SouthTrust's</a> headquarters), which was completed in 2004, and the 17-story 201 17th Street, which is expected to be completed in July, 2007. In addition, there are two holes between 201 17th and TWELVE which are slated for future development.</p>

<p>The Millennium Gate is an expression of world class architecture and sculpture, as well as a generous gift to the citizens of Atlanta from the National Monuments Foundation. Located at the center of the Atlantic Station community, the $18 million arch will celebrate human peace and prosperity, with special attention paid to Georgia's rich history and people. The Millennium Gate will house Gateway Galleries, a unique collection of interrelated displays and exhibits showcasing the pioneering and philanthropic spirit behind the development of Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Millennium Gate is comparable to Washington Arch in New York, the Wellington Arch in London, the Carrousel Arch in Paris and the Siegestor Arch in Munich. The structureâ€™s exhibits and art galleries will be open to the public. The rooftop will be available for weddings and other events. The history exhibits within the Gate will recreate the office of Thomas Glenn, the late chairman of Trust Company bank, who in the 1930s ran Atlantic Steel the previous owner of the land that is now Atlantic Station. Glenn's family is among the project's supporters.</p>
<p>The Millennium Gate is scheduled to open in the Summer of 2008.</p>

Atlantic Station from the Buford Highway Connector (GA 13)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The primary roadway access to and through Atlantic Station is an extension of 17th Street constructed by the developers. As part of the project, the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Department_of_Transportation_38be.html" title="Georgia Department of Transportation">Georgia Department of Transportation</a> erected the yellow 17th Street bridge over the I-75/85 <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Connector_8f28.html" title="Downtown Connector">Downtown Connector</a> expressway that separated Atlantic Station and the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Park_%28Atlanta%29_cb23.html" title="Home Park (Atlanta)">Home Park</a> residential neighborhood from the rest of Midtown.</p>
<p>Controversy developed at the time of construction not only because of the bridge's unusual yellow color (resulting in its local nickname, the "Big Banana"), but also for GDOT's insistence that the bridge and street meet suburban highway standards. Indeed, the bridge is eight lanes wide, and the enormous right-of-way afforded to 17th Street east of the bridge lacks street parking and utilizes an unusual arrangement of placing street trees and lamps at the edge of the adjacent buildings' property lines instead of against the street. The section of the Street west of the bridge consists of four through-lanes of traffic, in addition to a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_lane.html" title="Bus lane">bus lane</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bike_lane.html" title="Bike lane">bike lane</a>, and turning lanes in each direction, also lacking street parking.</p>
<p>Access to public transportation is provided via a free shuttle that runs every 5 - 15 minutes to the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodruff_Arts_Center_dbfa.html" title="Woodruff Arts Center">Arts Center</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Atlanta_Rapid_Transit_Authority_4f24.html" title="Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority">MARTA</a> rail station and a recently extended MARTA bus route (Peachtree #23) which also serves the Arts Center Station. A railroad line runs along the northern border, but twice-daily passenger service is available only at the Brookwood Amtrak station, a significant walking distance away. Shuttle service is also provided by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Tech_b422.html" title="Georgia Tech">Georgia Tech</a>'s bus system.</p>
<p>Despite the pedestrian-friendly arrangement of much of the eastern section of the project, parking is inexpensive and easily available in underground parking decks; indeed most visitors arrive by car. The lack of any neighborhood retail services in the western section of the project has also necessitated a considerable amount of driving, even within the project, by its western residents.</p>
