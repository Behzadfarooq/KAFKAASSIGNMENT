<p>Your recent edit of a Tom Swiftie (to read "He's dead", if I got it right) is cool. What it had had was palindromic, however, which fit the pun on "remorsefully". Can you do a Morse palindrome which makes appropriate sense? That would be the best. Otherwise "He's resurrected" or "He's come back" might be better than "He's dead", do you think?</p>
<p>You might discuss it on the Swifties talk page, too. --<a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELavintzin_9308.html" title="User:Lavintzin">Lavintzin</a> 20:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ahh, okay. I changed it when the original Morse didn't make any sense. Howzabout the ever popular "Madam I'm Adam" palindrome? (Well, palindrome 'cept for the apostrophe.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then again, "He's dead! He's dead!" might be even more obvious.</dd>

<p>Hi. I wanted to let you know that I have unblocked <a href="../../../b/p/t/User%7EBptdude_f3a6.html" title="User:Bptdude">Bptdude</a> (<a href="../../../b/p/t/User_talk%7EBptdude_30d2.html" title="User talk:Bptdude">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bptdude_4a91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bptdude">contribs</a>) who I blocked earlier today for removing comments at the <a href="../../../s/t/i/Talk%7EStirling_engine_10e3.html" title="Talk:Stirling engine">Talk:Stirling engine</a> page. Apparently, those comments were placed by him in the article and moved to the discussion page by another editor (Lumos3). Bptdude felt that he didn't need to keep those comments around, and blanked them from the talk page. He's relatively new, and didn't realize that not using edit summaries and continuing to remove them would look like vandalism. So, you were all doing what seemed right...and he was doing what seemed right, but I just wanted to explain the situation to you all. Hopefully I've set him on the right track and you all can continue to create a great article. Thanks! <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 22:04, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I'm not surprised it was something like that (and that's why I tried to write my first "warning" in a more-advisory tone. The thing that made me wonder, of course, was that Bptdude never replied to any of us, but perhaps he hadn't realized that he could?</dd>

<dd>In any case, thanks again for making things right!</dd>

<dd>I think thats exactly the case, that he didn't know he could... or didn't know enough to check the edit summaries in the history... and that some of the warnings were placed on his userpage, not on his talk so when DV8 2XL copied them over to his talk it appeared he had been seeing warnings for several days instead of ~1.

<p>The term 'reference' for the circuit common has a lot going for it. On the other hand, it does have three syllables. I teach an introductory EE course to non-EE majors and I just covered the node voltage analysis technique where step 1 is: "Select a circuit node to be the reference node - the node to which all other node voltages are referred to". <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 23:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No worries. Another semi-common event is that certain browsers will only edit 32KB of text (which is why the Wiki software warns you whenever a page gets longer). If you try to edit the article with these browsers, they have a nasty habit of cutting off the article at the 32,769th character. (That's what I figured had happened to you.)</dd>

<p>Your peculiar habit of placing your sig on a separate line may be intended to make it stand out, but it actually makes it more difficult to discern your entries from those of others. It is also much better to combine sentences into one paragraph if reasonable, for the same reason.

<dd>I actually <b>do</b> use the "in paragraph" signature when I'm participating in a series of parallel replies (such as Wiki votes).

<p>The trolls are loose. What do you think we should do about the Dummie Funnies link. I am certain that it is not an acceptable link for this article, and that they ought to start it a page of its own, or mention it on the Free Republic topic as it is a creature of that message board.</p>
<p>Also, I am an old PDP-8, PDP-15, PDP-11 and VAX guy myself! You wouldn't have any old RSX-11M distribution disk images lying about would you? I want to build an emulator for Linux, but have no OS to run on it.</p>

<dd>I'm actually torn on the <i>DUmmie Funnies</i> link. On one hand, I think it's obvious linkspam, intended to drum-up business. On the other hand, I'd hate to push the issue and see the PFC and PI links taken out as well, as they're probably the left-wing dual of that reich-wing link. I guess the bottom line for me would be to let it stay and live to fight another day.</dd>

<dd>Meanwhile, no, I don't have any RSX docs/disks around (and never had much at home anyway, I was much more a RSTS/E guy before becoming a VMS guy and then Solaris guy), but the first place I'd look would be the Bob Supnik <a href="../../../s/i/m/SIMH_8c10.html" title="SIMH">SIMH</a> emulator project; some of his emulators come complete with the runnable software.

<p>Uncommented deletions? You'll forgive me for pointing out that we have talk pages, where a very thorough debate about this is taking place. Also note that the revision in question was related to an earlier revision which was clearly summarized.

<dd>So add an edit summary (audit trail comment), perhaps as simple as "See talk". Deletions without any audit trail comment are an almost-certain hallmark of a vandal.</dd>

<p>Fair enough. I still dont really get it tho, I'd made 3 edits to the article when you made yours, 2 with manual edit summaries (one was admittedly short, just saying "tags") and a popups assisted revert with the automatic summary. Also vandals dont tend to use popups, which the page history shows I had previously done.</p>
<p>I also know all about vandalism, and one of the first things I do when a bluelinked user with a bluelinked talk page makes a suspicious edit is check their user page. It's usually pretty clear from there if we actually have a vandal in out midst, I would hope that's the case with mine, even without looking at the 3rd userbox&#160;;)</p>
<p>I've never heard the term "audit trail summary" before, is that a tech term from another industry? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 11:20, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's quite likely that I didn't look at the history when making my decision to revert so wouldn't have seen earlier edit summaries; of that, I'm guilty as charged.

<p>May I ask how by any stretch of the imagination the following (re <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>) can be construed as anything other than POV:</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly one of the most significant British politicians in recent political history, she is also one of the most divisive, being loved and loathed in equal measure."</p>
<p>I respect anyone affiliated with the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>, but for you to just state that the above is "fact" is absurd. I really hope you are not motivated by any personal atavisms, because-referenced citation would not pass muster on any other "encyclopaedia", except perhaps one put out by Roberts-Rinehart/Sean McPhilemy.</p>
<p>I hope you will reconsider your rv as it is unfounded.</p>

<dd>Well, which part of that compound statement is untrue?</dd>

<dd>Maggie clearly wrought significant changes on Britain; privitisation, etc. She was also highly divisive, much like her contemprorary, Ronald Reagan, adopting an attitude that she could have her own way regardless of opposition. She's loved by many. She's loathed by many.</dd>

<p>One can say that about anybody in politics who has an impact. I don't think your kind of comment would survive long on, say, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s page or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_O%27Connell_e9b1.html" title="Daniel O'Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>'s (talk about "own way regardless of opposition." What is more you are disrespectful to a great woman ("Maggie") who dealt with things that would have sent you into permanent reclusion, including chaos bordering on anarchy, disloyal opposition, terrorism and a narrow escape from assassination. It is evident that you are guided by your atavisms because otherwise you would know that any sentence that starts with the word "undoubtedly" is obviously POV and not encyclopaedic. I give up. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulRahim%40gmail.com_5ae4.html" title="User:AbdulRahim@gmail.com">LailaRookh</a> 22:46, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course my statement wouldn't last on the GWB page; the political partisans covering his ass would have it out of there in 20 seconds, just as you did for Maggie. But that doesn't mean what I'm saying isn't the absolute truth.</dd>

<p>Atlant -</p>
<p>Thank you for your revision on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecine.html" title="Telecine">Telecine</a> article with regard to the CRT emiting an electron or photon beam. I understand, logically, it should be called a photon beam - as it is visible light - but every resource I can find specifically states a CRT emits an electron beam. Can you point me to a resource or two that specifically states a flying-spot scanner telecine CRT emits a photon beam?</p>
<p>Just some of the resources:</p>
<p>"Lines on the inside of the screen traced by an electron beam to create an image called a horizontal scan line. These lines appear on a CRT monitor or a TV screen." - <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/raster.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/raster.htm" rel="nofollow">Definition of Raster</a> Retrieved 7/2/07.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be correct to say that "the CRT emits an electron beam, which is converted to a photon beam through the phosphors coating the envelope"? I understand the logic of that, however I cannot find a single resource to support that logic. All of the resources I look at refer only to an electron beam.</p>

<dd>The cathode in a cathode ray tube emits electrons (so called "cathode rays" before we knew what electrons are), but once the beam strikes the phosphor screen, the energy contained in the accelerated electrons is converted to light by the phosphor coating on the front of the tube.</dd>

<dd>A flying spot scanner is an alternative to pointing an ordinary video camera (or camera tube) at the film. Instead of taking in the entire picture at a single time, a flying spot scanner creates a moving spot of light that scans through the image in the transparent film. Think of it as moving the film past the face of a CRT 'cause the flying spot scanner tube is just an ordinary CRT except that it uses a phosphor that has a very short persistance. Because of this, any given spot on the phosphor screen only glows for an instant (essentially, only as long as the electrons are striking that spot). Then, a simple photomultiplier tube watches the light coming through the film from whatever spot is being illuminated at the moment. (If you're scanning color, there's a beam splitter splitter to separate the three colors and then three photomultiplier tubes.)</dd>

<dd>Atlant - thank you for the quick response. I understand wholly how a flying-spot scanner works (I have, in fact written about it and taught others). I am discussing the specific semantics of "electron" to "photon" beam. In order to refer in the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecine.html" title="Telecine">Telecine</a> article to a "photon" beam, I do need a verifiable, published resource to cite. As I said, I understand the logical physics implications, but cannot argue with every resource specifically referring only to "electron" beam. To change to "photon" I need a specific citable resource. Can you recommend one? <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELACameraman_422d.html" title="User:LACameraman">LACameraman</a> 21:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I belive the picture diactime.jpg is indeed correct for VOLTAGE REGULATED applied voltage. Note how the image is titled for an ideal diac. Althogh a diac with these exact charictaristics could never be manufactured in real life, it is used for this example to show basic properties of diac without requiring the user to worry about practical limitations of semiconductors, compnents, and of course practical elctonic theory. That being said, this diac has an unlimited voltage, current and power handling abilities. Because of this, the power supply, being voltage regulated, is also ideal. This makes it possible to regulate a voltage across the diac. With the voltage regulated beyond the breakover voltage, the ideal diac continues to conduct in a linear fasion once it is turned on and it stays that way untill it it turned off. Also notice i did not include a scale or units for the graph. this is because the cyan and brown line represent different units, voltage and current. because one scale could not accomadate both of these, they are draw to scale to themselves but not nessasrily to eachother. since everything is relative, one could say the brown trace represnts a sine wave at 1 volt RMS and the cyan trace represents 600000000000 ampres RMS. also the breakback voltage of this ideal diode is 0 volts. is there any other reason you find this graph to be incorrect??</p>
<p>Please let me know because i think a time domain graph of voltage and current in a diac is a very important and useful tool for teaching people the charictaristics of diacs and i would like to see an acurate picture of one on wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Nope, can't be. One the device triggers, you can't force enough current through it to maintain that sort of terminal voltage; the current required would destroy the DIAC. (This is especially true if we're speaking of an ideal DIAC; remember, one of its ideal points is that its forward voltage will be something like 0.6 to 1.0 volts once triggered, <b>no matter what the current</b>.) What the sine wave <b>could</b> be is the voltage applied across the DIAC and a load resistor, but that's not what the caption says it is. So either the waveform is wrong or the caption is wrong.</dd>

ooooooo, i know pn silicon juction regulates 0.6 volts when forward biased. I see what you are getting at but I just figured the parameters of this perticular diac would be so that once turned on the diac would not regulate any more.</p>

<p>I don't care one way or the other about the period at the end of the cow statement, but I must respectfully disagree with your rule against placing periods at the end of incomplete sentences. This is a time-honored and acceptable practice, although not as common as it once was. If you look at old photographs of businesses, for instance, there was almost always a period at the end of the business's name in the sign. Newspapers used to have periods at the end of the masthead (the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> still does). To get closer to this case, plenty of older children's books would have a picture of a cow with "A cow." written beneath it. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok">Chowbok</a> 21:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was aware of <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> masthead, but I'll pay closer attention for other modern sources. Is there a specific recommendation in the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>?</dd>

<p>That was my first thought when I was told about it too. Another editor created it as a result of the conflict over which units are listed first on {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStandard_gauge_0bef.html" title="Template:Standard gauge">standard gauge</a>}}. Now that we've got parser functions, I think a better long term solution would be to merge {{<a href="../../../4/f/t/Template%7E4ft8in.html" title="Template:4ft8in">4ft8in</a>}} into the other by a parameter call (perhaps {{standard gauge|imp=yes}} or something like that to show the result with Imperial units listed first). <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> <small><a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlambo_46ea.html" title="User talk:Slambo"><font color="black">(Speak)</font></a></small> 16:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I was thinking exactly that, but didn't want to get too <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedant.html" title="Pedant">pedantic</a> so I left it at the "joke" level&#160;;-). Plus, someone would eventually want to go back and edit all the template references so they didn't "default"; in this way, we'd best educate the editors to the capabilities ofthe newly-expanded template. How about just "style=Imperial" and "style=Metric" as the keywords? Or maybe "style=Imp_1st" or "style=Metric_1st"?</dd>

<p>Atlan, I specifically chose that spot for the discussion, since it did seem appropriate. I feel your manner of sending the message a little aggressive.

<p>I do not understand your complaint against my changes. I simply added accurate and relevent historical information to the page. Would you have prefered that I cite a source? --89.138.23.12 19:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does that mean that we should remove all obvious information? For example, should we remove from the Independence Day entry the fact that it is on July 4th (this is after the article states that it is also called the Fourth of July) or from the Christmas entry that that holiday is usually celebrated December 25th? Should we perhaps remove from the article on the Yom Kippur war that said conflict was started on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur? Perhaps that the 9/11 attacks occured on the 1th of September should also be removed. In short, where do we draw the line between "content that everyone already knows" and information that should be included? --89.138.23.12</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to fence with you. I believe what you did was done as vandalism, I believe you know that, and if you do it again, I'll escalate the warnings and eventually, if needed, report you to the administrators; then they can decide which of us has the more-correct "read" on the situation.</dd>

<p>Yes, Maria Daines <a href="http://www.maria-daines.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maria-daines.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>and Paul Killington are notable. I found a page here about them recently&#160;!!!! They do sooo much it's incredible&#160;!!!! Really, you should read about all Maria and Paul have done across the globe in terms of their continued commitment to animal welfare and the environment. Here's a link to their most recent BBC interview that was done on July 27 2006. <a href="http://www.paulrichmond.ca/MariaDaines-BBC-Cornwall-07-27-06.mp3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paulrichmond.ca/MariaDaines-BBC-Cornwall-07-27-06.mp3" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>If getting interviewed on the BBC doesn't make you notable, I don't know what does&#160;!!!!

<p>Thanks for this - it was to settle a practical debate, and your pedigree and knowledge looks impressive.

<dd>Believe it or don't, this is still something I ponder each time I leave a room&#160;;-). I've pretty much gotten over worrying about the lamp life versus energy tradeoff, always tending to favor saving the expensive energy, but <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_fluorescent_lamp.html" title="Compact fluorescent lamp">compact fluorescent lamps</a> add a new wrinkle. Many of them, particularly one design we have quite a few of in our house, tend to have that annoyingly long warm-up period before they reach full brightness. (It probably takes 45 seconds to a minute for that one particular design to to reach full brightness.) So I still end up wondering: "Will I be back in a minute or two or gone for half an hour? Leave it on, or turn it off?"</dd>

<p>Hmm...tougher to say. I would have to verge on "no", mainly because it opens the door to including links to all of his reviews. And if Ebert, why not several other prominent reviewers? I admit I find it almost tenuous enough putting the Criterion essay links up, but at the least it's a rare label that not only includes essays but has them available for free online, and furthermore has a very limited scope. I'm generally against link-cruft, even including Rotten Tomatoes links, which generally would aggregate all available reviews. Personally, I'd think it a good thing to link to his Great Movies articles, but again, it just seems to open the door to all his reviews, and everyone else's. That's my opinion, anyway. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 12:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, you're thinking along the same wavelength as I am and so I'll let things stand as they are for now. But again, thanks for including the Criterion Collection reviews!</dd>
