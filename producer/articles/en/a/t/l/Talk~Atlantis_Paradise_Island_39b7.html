<p>Dear editor from Quebec with IP 70.81.136.211 -</p>
<p>No one is allowed to use Wiki as a sales promotion tool as you have seemingly done this week in the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_Paradise_Island_f25a.html" title="Atlantis Paradise Island">Atlantis Paradise Island</a> article.

<p>I am seriously thinking that this article should be merged to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Island_7e78.html" title="Paradise Island">Paradise Island</a> with a redirect from here since Atlantis is a company involved in commercial development of the island. It seems this article would be better showcased within the other article. The other article is by no means too long and would be enhanced by the material here.</p>
<p>I am opening this for discussion and will take it to the proper Administrative page (as soon as I figure out how to find it).</p>

<dd>When I was there a few years ago, this hotel really dominated the island. I can only imagine that it's even huger now. So, I think it's reasonable for the hotel to have its own article, but I definitely think it could be condensed further. I don't really think we need to know where every bar and lounge is. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 23:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, FreplySpang. It's great that you have first hand experience at at this island resort. I thoroughly agree with you about the unnecessary listing of (seemingly) every bar and lounge&#160;:o). I cringe everytime I read the blurb about the chef "working his magic"!! Shall we condense together? I still don't know where to request a merging, but I now know where the Help Desk is, so that is one step more in learning. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">I am Kiwi</a> 05:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spending time thinking about things, learning more about the Atlantis resort, undertanding the nature of the island (apparently more of spit of land in a Nassau harbour, connected to the larger island by two bridges), has been enlightening and thought-provoking.</dd>

<dd>What I have learned it that the rest of the island really is purely incidental to the resort. It always has been since the first hotel and gambling casino went up. And I learned how the man who last purchased the dilapidated, out-dated old wreck. After redevelopment and restoration, it is now worth $2 billion.</dd>

<dd>I'm not at all near any personal decisions about anything here. I DO feel that the Island article is relatively poor at this point. And it is mostly a history of resort communites the island had had. This article is not too long, and could easily incorporate the other.</dd>

<dd>The Island topic is not well titled ("island" is not capitalized) and it would be better served if there was any pre-resort history to access. Or is it relatively identical Nassau? Who lives there, who works at the resort? I am going to call the Atlantis Paradise Island resort Monday and will ask them for whatever literature they might have, travel brochures. I will find out the real low-down as to whether that renowned French chef has really abandoned NYC and all the restaurants he has created for this tiny island. Maybe this is his retirement job. &#160;;o) --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Green in learning mode</a> 03:12, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks to all very much for the photos found. A few days ago, an exceptional photo of the hotel was uploaded (do take a peek while you are here) and I am so excited about the entire page.

<dd>The new upper right photo is an excellent one and shows off the resort well. The article has improved quickly over a couple months. The old down-looking panorama of mine that it replaced could still be valuable to show the water activities/aquarium system. It's still on wikipedia if it might be of use in the future. The remainder of the island isn't the noteworthy destination Atlantis is, so Paradise Island having a lesser page seems accurate and acceptable to me, and is an opinion.</dd>

<dd>Hey Jason. So nice of you to drop by. I have rather taken a shine to this article/topic. I called and now have the email address for the top PR person at the Kerzner Corporation, and so I will be pitching them on releasing a limited number of photos. What is the url of yours, the one that was replaced? Can you please leave it here, on the talk page?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely DO elieve that the island needs its very own topic page completely. I'm hoping that someone can find a history on the island and area -- what native culture preceded the European invasion, who discovered the island (or group of islands), how come so many Africans were brought to the island. I would like to know about the economy before the arrival resorts. It needs material about the history of its governments, social polices, allegiances and so much more. Never mind the other local businessed, agriculture, schools and higher education. There is so much for eager knowledgable editors to dig their teeth into!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will chop out good deal of what I temporarily imported over (so people could see it and talk about it). What I hope for (wherever on the page it ends up), is just enough of salesmanshp to tease people into clicking through and learning more!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an aside, I have found that the company's name for the resort seems to be simply Atantis, not "Atlantis Paradise Island". This is why I orginally thought that the resort owned the entire island - that there was nothing but the thing named "Atlantis Paradize Island. It appears Kerzner does have another Atlantis Resort and Casino elsewhere. Saudi Arabia? If there are (so far) two Atlantis resorts (and who knows about the future), then the other one should rate an article too. I will ask the PR executive about that, too.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will hold off on beginning any discussion regarding how the names of two resorts be handled. Can't have too much going on all at once. It seems it should somehow a parallel construction. Should the name should have a hyphen after Atlantis or have the preposition "at" or "on". I'll get the full story from the company itself. My first priority is to strew more links about so we get more traffic. The more, the merrier. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 05:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's probably well known locally where the resort property ends. When I was there in 2003, I walked away from the resort to some of the island shops on the way to the bridge. After getting away from the marina and close to the shops, someone who was clearly not a guest wanted to know if I wanted any weed. I declined, looked around, and figured I must be off the property. Staff are on the lookout for non-guests on property and seem to do good at it.</dd>

<dd>I see someone disliked just how much I had enlarged two of the photos, so I have compromised. The lobby photo is again large enough to show the mosaic on the wall, et al -- the stuff that turns if from a space with a high ceiling into something beautiful and memorable. The panaramic photo of irregular shape has again been enlarged - tho not as large as is really needed. But at least now one can see a bit of DETAIL -- the stuff that keeps the photo from being a bit more than just blobs of color and vague meaningless shapes. If the photos are meaningless to an article, they should be removed. <b>Look at articles with HUGE photos -- like <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissism.html" title="Narcissism">Narcissism</a> -- and you will see what I mean.</b> It is not a sin to have photos large enough to display necessary detail. - <a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 03:31, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have discovered that there is no resort called "Atlantis Paradise Island". You do sometimes see the resort demonstrate its location as Atlantis, Paradise Island, Bahamas. Paradise Island is its physical location, part of its address, but it is clear that the title of this article must be changed. Possibilities are nearly endless, but "Atlantis (Paradise Island - Bahamas)" seems a good bet. Discussion? Feedback? --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 23:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I regard the reverential language as somewhat innapropriate; the article does not appear neutral but more an advertisment. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.109.235.212_27d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.109.235.212">88.109.235.212</a> (<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User_talk%7E88.109.235.212.html" title="User talk:88.109.235.212">talk</a>) 14:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>You can help. You can edit out or tone down what you believe are 'reverential' languages. If you feel strongly about it, you can gather more information to provide a balanced view. Normally, people edit articles or add images when they feel passionate about a particular topic. The article looks fine to me. Unless you uncover statistics such as how many people drown in the Predator Pool or similar stuff, I don't see how an article about a resort won't look superficially like advertisement. See <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynn_Las_Vegas_d492.html" title="Wynn Las Vegas">Wynn Las Vegas</a>; doesn't it also look like advertisement? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a> 16:00, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more about the aticle lacking a neutral point of view. I think the issues revolve around the lack of a real critism about the resorts impact to the Bahamas. I know that it is a financial boom, but there must be a negative side to having sush wealth in the midst of relative native lack. I would like to see a Bahamian scholar give a view on impact this resort has on the crime, psyche, and morality of the island. Baystate bro 19:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly agree that the "article" reads more like a company glossy promotional magazine for the resort. There was a Canadian IP addy that repeatedly was promoting the selling of time shares and had turned it into an ad. I came along in the fall and spent some time making it much more neutral by removing the excessive promotional hype, but when I dropped by last month or so, I saw that it is worse than ever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, square footage and amentities of various hotels are highlighted, et al. You can TELL that it is the company's own employees who are "running the show" here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also strongly agree that any studies that may have been done regarding the resort's impact the people who actually live on the island and those who travel in each shift change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do love the photos -- and I truly wish someone would deep six that panoramic shot where nothing is truly discernable - only blobs of colour. Surely we have enough other photos of the hotel? And I want photos of the POOR residential and market parts of town -- where the employees live.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How can this article be flagged or something for changes made here to be quickly reviewed and reverted if necessary? I have no idea how that is done. Perhaps the article should be flagged for NPOV, and advertising?</dd>

<p>I ran across the new Cove Atlantis website and took some images of what the new facilities will look like. I will try to add a few in the Atlantis article in Cove Atlantis section. (note that these are not real photos but 3D made)</p>
<p>Uploaded images:</p>

<p>You can't copy images from random websites and add them to wikipedia. You marked these images with <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. Do you own them? Also, Can you please upload images with proper file names, please? Wikipedia has a flat namespace. Naming files with proper names really help a lot. Besides, uploading images to the Wikimedia Commons instead would be even better; images from the common are directly usable in wikipedia sites for all languages. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Hsu_8453.html" title="User:Fred Hsu">Fred Hsu</a> 21:30, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
