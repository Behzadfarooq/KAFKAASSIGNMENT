<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>Ok there is a sly little trick being pulled here. While the length and content of the "Atlas Shrugged" page is just fine, there are these sneaky little links to "Characters of Atlas Shrugged", "Companies in Atlas Shrugged", and about 5 more such pages that really need to be subcategories of this one page. And as subcategories they would certainly make the page way too long. I propose that we delete EACH ONE of these pages and insert a brief summary of them all into this page.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atlas Shrugged section of Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>I am developing the AtlasShrugged section of Wikipedia as a test to push the envelope of what is possible with a wiki. I hope to show that a wiki-based <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a> is not merely the same old <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a> with a different development and editing system, but a tool that allows types of content not easily integrated into conventional <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia</a>s.</p>
<p>I chose AtlasShrugged for this project for a few reasons. I am familiar with it so can do a passable job in summarizing it. It is very large and complex, making it a good test of what is possible. Often people who are into AtlasShrugged are _really_ into it, so there are likely people who will contribute and who will be interested in the section. There is a movie coming out, so interest in AtlasShrugged might be expected to surge soon - it would be good for the project if we were able to sate that interest with a really cool AtlasShrugged section.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">For Your Consideration</span></h2>
<p>I'm new to Wikipedia and don't feel confident enough yet to barge in and make changes willy-nilly in as extensive an article as the one for <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Even so, I'd like to point out some possible changes. There are three main points I would like to discuss.</p>
<p>First, from a strictly literary standpoint it should be noted that <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> has uncertain value. While I read the accompanying page on Ayn Rand and saw where this was addressed, I believe that a truly unbiased accounting of the work itself would have to prominently (under the subsection 'Philosophy and writing') include mention of the novel's many detractors. There is a large consensus in current literary theory that <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is singularly lacking in nuance. Among today's important novelists and novel critics, it is widely acknowledged that one of a novel's main <i>raison d'être</i> is to raise questions, not answer them. While I understand that the value of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> extends beyond the literary, it <i>is</i> a self-described novel, and as such, needs to be accurately placed in context with other major works.</p>
<p>Secondly, the novels philosophical underpinnings, mainly Objectivism, also need context. Like all novels, <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> has aged. We now have insights that just were unavailable at the time of the novel's publication. We are also forced to deal with issues that generations past could never of dreamt. <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> needs to be viewed in relationship to such issues as globalization, intellectual property rights, the open source movement, and the increasing dangers of monopolization by corporations with bankrolls the size of small countries. Understanding that Objectivism has its own page, a balanced accounting calls for these ideas to be at least minimally addressed here.</p>
<p>Thirdly, while sources were cited to back up the novel's ranking (<i>second most influential, most influential...</i>) there are undoubtedly many dissenting opinions and <b>multiple</b> sources to be offered in antithesis. Better to simply state that, "while it remains controversial, <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is considered <i>by many</i> an influential novel."</p>
<p>This last point I find most important, as the inclusion of ranking gives the article a noticeable 'fan' bias. Better to offer as truly a balanced statement of fact as possible and let the reader (of the article <i>and</i> the novel) decide for themselves.</p>
<p><i>Atlas Shrugged</i> falls into deeply divided waters with no clear answers as to the merits of its philosophy and writing. These remarks are in no way intended to enflame, but are instead offered in hopes that another aspect of this work can be brought into the discussion, thereby increasing the merits of the article.</p>
<p>I would like to get a feel for where interested parties stand before I make any changes. As such, I will wait a few days for people to respond and will temper my changes in light of any feedback.</p>
<p>--Michael D. Mullins</p>

<dd>I'll add more input to this later. As for now, I'd like to point out that Ayn Rand was a supporter of intellectual property. Also, the philsophy behind it isn't 'mainly' Objectivism; it is Objectivism, only and completely.<a href="../../../d/_/p/User%7ED_prime_dcf8.html" title="User:D prime">D prime</a> 05:05, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All valid points. I agree that any statements that reflect bias or opinion should be modified or removed. Two glaring ironies here that I'd like to point out for the possible enjoyment of anyone who understands the tenets of objectivism. One, that Ayn Rand's life, philosophy and novels are being summarized by a community of writers. Don't get me wrong, I think wiKi is brilliant, I am a huge fan but the irony is amusing.</dd>

<p>The second is from Mr. Mullins comment: "First, from a strictly literary standpoint it should be noted that Atlas Shrugged has uncertain value.... There is a large consensus in current literary theory.... Among today's important novelists and novel critics, it is widely acknowledged....". This entire paragraph could have been a direct extract from a Rand novel. I'll let you determine from which of Ayn's two distinct archetypes it may have come.&#160;:o)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Influence and Criticism</span></h2>
<p>I believe that the "Influence and Criticism" section has problems.</p>
<p>First, it looks a lot like an article copied from somewhere else. I'm not accusing the author of doing that, but that's what it looks like - it certainly doesn't read as "Wikipedia-like".</p>
<p>Second, it is, IMO, POV - the author seems to go out of his/her way to criticize the book, Rand and objectivism. I realize it is introduced as "a summary, representative but not exhaustive, of reasons readers have reacted in this negative, critical fashion.", but afterwards it changes its tone from "people have said" to "it is". After reading that section, someone who hasn't read the book will have the idea that it's rubbish and childish - which may be <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a>'s opinion, but it's not appropriate here. <a href="../../../d/e/h/User%7EDehumanizer_e929.html" title="User:Dehumanizer">Dehumanizer</a> 10:42, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tone of article</span></h2>
<p>I am slightly aghast at the nature of this article. I appologize that this might be redundant in terms of the preceeding comment, but this article does not tell you about the book, but rather why the book is wrong. I am a fan of Ayn Rand, but that not withstanding, I would be a bit purturbed even if the article on the Communist Manifesto read like this. Commentary on the views expressed in the book do not belong in the description of the book itself. A link to the page on Objectivism would make much more sense. I don't know if this was copied straight from a book review, as the poor understanding of the book's ideas, as well as the writer's cited sources seem to come from someone with very little grasp on philosophy, as well as economics. I do not mean to be insulting, but the writer, whomever it is, is not familier with Rand, nor with the topics mentioned. It would seem to come from someone who knows about those who write, and memorized a few good passages.</p>
<p>At any rate, this article should be changed, or at least disputed. (I would be happy to do either, but this is my first time even responding to a site I love, so I will not presume to know how to do so.)</p>
<p>For those interested in the general ideas of Rand, I would point you to "For the New Intellectual" which is a small book with the article "Introduction to Objectivist Ethics" and the key passages from "Atlas Shrugged" "Anthem" and "The Fountainhead." It elucidates rather well the key ideas of Objectivism, to the contrary of what is stated in the article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias in This Article</span></h2>
<p>This "informational piece", and I use that term lightly, is highly baised. I would suggest either complete revampment, or deletion. As one who takes John Galt as an ideal to strive for, Iwould like to mark this article for review. Unfortunetly, I dont know how do that. Yes, I see the irony in this, but if someone could please report bias on this page, I would be very grateful .</p>

<p>What kind of sentence is <i>this</i>: "It was Rand's last work of fiction before going fully into philosophy, her tour de force, her most famous work, and most Objectivists hold it to be, objectively (as in factually) the greatest novel of all time".&#160;??? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Osgood_3922.html" title="User:Barbara Osgood">Barbara Osgood</a> 01:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure there is a source on the "most Objectivists hold it to be the greatest novel of all time" as it is a commonly held fact. Since Objectivists consider Atlas Shrugged to be their manifesto, this would be similar in looking for a source of "most Christians hold the Bible to be the greatest book of all time." --The Mean Dean 10:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Selection of reviews</span></h2>
<p>It's strange that for one of the best-selling and most often cited books of the last century, wikipedia editors can find only negative and strange reviews. It would be helpful if someone could add a section explaining the disconnect. Presumably something perverse explains the sales or the coverage. 69.17.21.242 17:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I didn't look at the revision on March 12th, on April 3rd, there are only two reviews, both positive. I added a link to a review by Whittaker Chambers, none too positive, published when the novel came out; I think even if one doesn't agree with Chambers, it's an important historical footnote to this article. If you're going to have reviews linked here at all, this is one worth having. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.241.37.140.html" title="User:64.241.37.140">64.241.37.140</a> 22:25, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would advise against using the Chambers review as he doesn't seem to have read the book. He consistently misspells important characters names for one thing. If the review is included, it shouldn't be a link, and it should be edited for spelling.</p>
<p><a name="Wow" id="Wow"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wow</span></h2>
<p>This article could do with a sec, clean purely-the-facts description of the book. Although the intro suggests it's great (I certainly was inclined to perhaps find a copy for a second), the section on the plot is filled with speculative issues, reflections of society, themes which the author <i>might</i> have intended, details which are contentuous. Really, the article should just have an easy structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro (Author, relevance and notability),</li>
<li>Plot (just the plot please!)</li>
<li>Themes of the book (Philosophy, Objectivism, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is impossible to discuss this book without emphasing the themes and philosphies that go with the plot. This is the Objectivist manifesto and is considered the best book of all time from libertarians, despite the fact she has given speeches condemning libertarians.</p>
<p>Obviously the author of this article knows a great deal about the book, and no doubt the book is notable enough to have a great article, but it should be structured much better.</p>

The general consensus seems to be that all these Atlas Shrugged baby pages do not belong on Wikipedia. That is not to say their content is necessarily bad, but rather that they are too free-floating. Most of these pages had content that could be cetegorized three ways: literary analysis; excessive plot summary or lists of incidents and references; character information. I have gone through technologies, topics, and concepts in Atlas shrugged and merged Character info to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged_5e40.html" title="Characters in Atlas Shrugged">Characters in Atlas Shrugged</a> page, which I think we should keep. I have merged analysis and the fictional technologies to this article. The rest of the references are best at home in the Wikibooks section (where they are now). If you do not agree with my edits, please correct them DO NOT REVERT because I also removed a lot of dead-links that went to pages redirecting readers to the wikibooks page. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishJew_f584.html" title="User:IrishJew">Avraham</a> 01:18, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page once had numerous subpages, each covering one location, character, object, and so on; an early experiment in wikibooking.
