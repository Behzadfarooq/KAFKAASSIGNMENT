<p>Obviously, there's a lot more about the label's history to be included here. One thing in particular that I'd personally like to see is the warehouse fire in which a lot of master recordings were destroyed. I don't know much about the fire, myself, other than the fact that it happened (I believe it was during the 1970s). I'll try and dig up more about it when I have time; maybe someone else will beat me to it. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 00:08, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There really needs to be a LOT more here about the history of Atlantic Records. Atlantic was crucial in the growth and spread of R&amp;B and in the opening up of black artists to larger white audiences from the late '40's well into the 60's. It's unbelievabls that there's no mention here that such great stars as Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, and so many more were Atlantic artists.</p>

<p>When anything, be it Stephen Colbert, "Weird Al", or Stingrays cause some sort of need for people to garner attention, they will edit Wikipedia. If I somehow convinced some TV Personality to say "Edit Wikipedia", then the mindless masses that want attention will do just that.

I still can't believe that this is STILL protected... kinda funny, really. A half a second bit of a parody's music video has basically perminately closed this section of Wikipedia.</p>
<p><br />
I can believe its still protected, because I was kind of hoping to open a "YOU SUCK!!!" section where folks sign up if they, like me, would like to make fun of Atlantic Records for no reason other than their bad sense of humor. I guess editing the "editing talk" page so they have to protect the "editing talk" page will have to do..... for now..... Anyone know a hacker?</p>
<p><br />

<dd>I found this page by rewinding the video a few times until I could see Atlantic Records on it. He's using a real screen shot on a Macintosh, but the big "YOU SUCK" is in the edit window, so it was probably photoshopped onto it. There's no way to actually make it displayed like that.

<p>How's this: pick a day in which the content of the page is replaced by a picture of the giant "YOU SUCK". Protect it so it can't be "corrected", and then leave it on for a full day (24 hours) before reverting it. After that, block everyone who vandalizes the page indefinitely. <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundam_Bass_20dc.html" title="User:Gundam Bass">Viewer</a> 05:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't see any need to clutter up the sentence, but if anyone needs a source for the reference to Atlantic Records releasing country music, in 1950 they released the single "Why Do I Cry Over You?" by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_%26_His_Comets_bb6c.html" title="Bill Haley &amp; His Comets">Bill Haley and His Saddlemen</a>, and a reproduction of the label can be found in the Haley box set <i>Rock 'n' Roll Arrives</i> by Bear Family Records. It would be interesting to find out whether this was the only country single released by the label as I know of no others (though I believe they did issue some rockabilly recordings later so I guess those count). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While admitting to being somewhat out of touch with what goes on out there in the real world, apart from daily tallies of killings, etc. etc., am dismayed to see such a large amount of space (both on this discussion page and on the article page) devoted to such a ridiculous (let's just leave it at that) issue/publicity stunt. As a relative newcomer to Wikipedia, as yet unaware of any existing built-in mechanisms for content control, might I humbly suggest that in the interest of serious analysis any polemic content be reserved for the discussion page with a possible flag in the trivia/miscellaneous section on the article page?

<p>In June 2006, <a href="../../../22/w/e/_Weird_Al__Yankovic_79e3.html" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> released a parody of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Blunt_6f74.html" title="James Blunt">James Blunt</a>'s hit "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_Beautiful_f564.html" title="You're Beautiful">You're Beautiful</a>" via the internet (but not on his album <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Outta_Lynwood_728d.html" title="Straight Outta Lynwood">Straight Outta Lynwood</a></i>) called "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_Pitiful_8a66.html" title="You're Pitiful">You're Pitiful</a>". The song is only available for download because even though Blunt gave Yankovic permission to record the song, he is signed with <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custard_Records_7d70.html" title="Custard Records">Custard Records</a> (distributed by Atlantic Records), and Atlantic denied permission for the song's album release. Yankovic's <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record label</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano_Records_50fa.html" title="Volcano Records">Volcano Records</a>, decided not to "go to war" with Atlantic even though they could still legally use "You're Pitiful". Later on, Al recorded some replacement songs for his album, including "<a href="../../../w/h/i/White_%26_Nerdy_91e2.html" title="White &amp; Nerdy">White &amp; Nerdy</a>", a parody of "<a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridin%27.html" title="Ridin'">Ridin'</a>" by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamillionaire.html" title="Chamillionaire">Chamillionaire</a>. In the song's video, the "nerd," played by Yankovic, is editing <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s Atlantic Records page, adding "<a href="../../../y/o/u/YOU_SUCK%21_757d.html" title="YOU SUCK!">YOU SUCK!</a>" in big, bold letters. This is a reference to this event. This inspired a number of copy-cat vandals to put the same text in the Atlantic Records Wikipedia article numerous times. Yankovic has said that he does not approve of the vandalism, though he admits being amused by it.<sup id="_ref-Herald_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Herald" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>I think that semi-protection should be fine for now. Yes there is a lot of vandalism, but as long as there are many of us watching it, it can be corrected within a few minutes (even quicker if a bot catches it).

<dd>The Wexler/Stax relationship is mentioned, though the way it is worded is misleading at best. The way it reads now, it implies that Jerry Wexler ran and/or founded Stax Records, which is incorrect. Even the cited source states it differently (i.e., correctly). As an admin, I'm technically able to make the correction, but since the article is protected, I assume I should not make an edit on behalf of myself. So then, in the "History" section, I'm requesting that the following sentence:
<dl>
<dd>"In 1960, Atlantic began a distribution relationship with a recording enterprise in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, spearheaded by Jerry Wexler<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> which became <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stax_Records_5e47.html" title="Stax Records">Stax Records</a>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>...be replaced with this code:
<dl>
<dd><code>In 1960, Wexler began a distribution relationship between Atlantic and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Stax Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Kurutz | first =Steve | url =http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:i8ae4j271wai~T1 | title =Jerry Wexler Biography | work =[[All Music Guide]] | publisher =All Media Guide | accessdate =2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;</code></dd>

<p>Not an officitionardo of Atlantic but to those who are. I can remember Atlantic records (at least in the uk) back in the 70s when they still used paper labels on albums and singles (as opposed to printed direct onto the record). While the overall design of the atlantic label was uniform, they used 2 different colour schemes on the label. Some artists were released on a blue and orange label while others green and orange but I never found out if there was any significance in this. Dondilly 00:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
