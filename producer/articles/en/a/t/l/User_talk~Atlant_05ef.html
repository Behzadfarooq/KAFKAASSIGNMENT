<p>Bonjour Atlant! I've just come across your message (from late 2005 I think) saying that you are learning French. If you need any help or have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I am very familiar with the problems of anglophones and their lexicon in the apprehension of French, that is to say, I can probably tell you how/why something is said in a particular fashion. Hope to hear from you! I am glad to see that you are not taking the Bill O'Reilly approach of hating the French.

<dd>My principal problem is that I'm still somewhat afraid to actually <b>speak French</b>, although last fall I spent some time with a private tutor who helped me a great deal with both pronunciation and grammar. The key for me will be when I finally believe that I have enough of a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_mass.html" title="Critical mass">critical mass</a> of the language to not fall flat on my face as a fool. I'm getting close; among other small victories, I'm registered and have actually made one or two sensible edits in the .fr Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>An unfortunately large number of Americans seem to be "ignorant and proud of it", willfully maintaining that ignorance of the fact that there's a whole world out there and things to experience besides what they see on their TV <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcoms</a> each night. Sadly, right now, they seem to hold sway in this country, much to our (and the world's?) long-term detriment. Speaking for myself though, I've enjoyed all of my travels around the world including my three trips to France, and my wife and I would be very happy to go there again; she's been showing me a lot of Internet travel sites in a sort of "nudge-nudge" fashion and I hope to accommodate her soon.

<dd><i>But are you sure the Apple ones were locking?</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Pretty sure. The Mini-DIN-3 connector wasn't exactly standard. IIRC, it had a little latching tab that was automatically depressed when you pulled back on the body of the connector. I still have Apple LocalTalk boxes and cables, Farallon PhoneNet boxes, and some Belkin PhoneNet knock-offs; if I can remember, I'll shoot some pictures and add them to the article.</dd>

<p>I understand your impatience, but I did leave a note that the frequency conversion article was a work in progress! Perhaps on the weekend if my wife does not preempt my schedule. cmacd 15:38, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A suggestion:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can always develop a new page by creating a "/whatever" sort of page off of the old page (for example, Frequency changer/new version), and then, when the new page is complete and ready to go live, you can quickly put all the new content into the old page. Some people create the new page off of the existing article page while others create the new page off of their own user page.</dd>

<ul>
<li>1) I don't see any posts on the talk page besides mine and your..</li>
<li>1a) There was one macro requesting "help" - reverting to OLD content that is already been moved elsewhere is not "help" There are other things to fill in on the article as I was writing it.</li>
<li>2) I have already moved the information that was in that article to the articles I have mentioned as "for ---See"</li>
<li>3) Since I am also refactoring the other article- on pentagrids, some of the information that was previously there has now been moved to the version I wrote, which your actions have HIDDEN.</li>
<li>4) The articles on "Power conversion", roptary converter and motor generator need some serious work.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I mis-spoke. It was an audit trail comment and a person adding the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">template:cleanup</a> template to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, great, when you finish the new article, put it in place, But until then, an article about "Frequency changers" that discusses mains power frequency changers is better than a half-baked article that takes about <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_mixer.html" title="Frequency mixer">mixers</a>. In all honesty, I'm not sure the article should be changed at all, given that you're converting it from an article about a more-common usage of the term to a far less common usage of the term, but I am certain it shouldn't be left under construction for days or weeks at a time.</dd>

<p>You nuked some stuff on the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_generator.html" title="Electrical generator">Electrical generator</a> page. Deleting the empty section was probably good, it's what I should have done. However, information on selecting a generator is important encyclopedic information. If it doesn't belong in this article, then it belongs somewhere. It's information on how generators work, and how to fix it. That's encyclopedic. The section title might have been poorly chosen, but let's fix that instead of deleting the whole thing. 65.126.124.21 23:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Generally speaking, Wikipedia frowns on "how-to" stuff.

<dd>Thanks for the heads-up; I generally think, given the fact that Wikipedia is nowhere near any ultimate limits on how many articles it can contain, that we can stand to keep borderline articles around.

<p>This is a contentious practice.

<dd>Unfortunately, it's very intermittent though, which makes it hard to report as a bug; I only know of about three times that it has happened to me in probably several thousands of talk page edits. (In an ironic twist of fate, I just had an edit conflict on the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarth_2b6d.html" title="Talk:Earth">Talk:Earth</a> page reported to me; in this case, I abandoned my edit but when I looked at the talk page history, I was the most-recent editor in the page history anyway!

<p>The editor that added the bit about the vibrator to the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor-generator.html" title="Motor-generator">motor-generator</a> page wrote a longer section on the <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibrator.html" title="Vibrator">vibrator</a> page, but someone deleted it.

<p>I think that vibrators (power conversion) were used only in car radios and perhaps a few other limited situations where only DC power was available. Portable tube-type radios apparently used a variety of batteries: <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_battery_%28vacuum_tubes%29.html" title="A battery (vacuum tubes)">A battery (vacuum tubes)</a>, <a href="../../../b/_/b/B_battery_%28vacuum_tubes%29.html" title="B battery (vacuum tubes)">B battery (vacuum tubes)</a>, <a href="../../../c/_/b/C_battery_%28vacuum_tubes%29.html" title="C battery (vacuum tubes)">C battery (vacuum tubes)</a>. I can not find Wikipedia artcles covering portable tube-type radios or car radios. Since the vibrator was constructed like a tube and mounted in a <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tube_socket.html" title="Tube socket">tube socket</a> perhaps their article should be Vibrator (vacuum tube). Another alternative might be to put the vibrator and A, B &amp; C batteries in an article about portable tube-type radios or vacuum tube power supplies. --<a href="../../../c/_/j/User%7EC_J_Cowie_7c97.html" title="User:C J Cowie">C J Cowie</a> 16:00, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_American_Five_8287.html" title="All American Five">All American Five</a> article for some discussion about portable tube radios. Vibrators (power conversion) also turned up in car-mounted <a href="../../../c/b/_/CB_radio_e863.html" title="CB radio">CB radios</a>, but that's another type of radio, of course. I winder if they were also found in portable military radio gear? I'll take a look at my dad's old Navy electronics training manuals and see if they turn up there.</dd>

<p>I have added Industrial vibrators (including cement) to the <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibrator.html" title="Vibrator">Vibrator</a> article.

<dd>Great job on the page. I was concerned that you had reverted to a "broken" version, rather than just creating the new page directly. But, you took care of it! Although, I am wondering if vibration can be aperiodic... would "aperiodic vibration" be more aptly called "shaking"?

<p>This page had a list of vendors that included both legitimare and not-so-legitimate companies. It was listed as being "outside vendors".

<dd>That's an excellent question and one for which I have never come to a completely satisfactory answer. The Wiki guidelines would probably have us include no commercal links, but this is clearly unsatisfactory for a wide variety of topics. On the other hand, we've seen on many topics (possibly including <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenticular.html" title="Lenticular">Lenticular</a>) where there's been an explosion of clearly self-serving links, inserted by people who have a commercial interest in those links. It's not uncommon; an article often exists with a reasonable number of not-too-commercial links, and suddenly a bunch of new, blatantly commercial websites, or blogs, or MySpace links pop up on the theory that "everyone else is doing it so I can do it too".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think there ought to be a balance, but I've never found one that pleases everyone or is stable over a long period without active "monitoring" and pruning effort. I was trying to ignore Lenticular, but we clearly passed over into "commercial link overload" recently. I'm open to suggestions!</dd>

<p>I believe that some commercial links add usefulness as both a source for information and of course as a source for the actual product (which many if not most people doing a search for "lenticular" are looking for). I am with World3D. We are one of maybe five dedicated lenticular producers in the U.S. and we are consistently complimented for having a site that is informative and helpful. So informative in fact, that much of what has appeared on the Wiki lenticular page was "borrowed" from our site! Lenstar is apparently a site that is sponsored by those in the trade but does not sell product. I certainly have no objection to their inclusion. But some sites like www.3dprintblog.com are pure garbage spam. I am the editor of the lenticular and holographics category at DMOZ and have been for years. I am new to this community but it seems to me that the idea remains the same: provide useful information for the reader. Our site used to be #1 in Google on a search for lenticular and has consistently been on page 1. We employ no "tricks". We simply have a helpful informative site and that has been recognized by both algorithms and humans. I hope that you will agree and I hope that we can work together to include other sites that are helpful while excluding sites that are not.</p>
<hr />
<p>9/22/06 Can't understand why you removed the links as they were helpful and finally manageable. You had indicated yourself that commercial links are not necessarily spam. Please let me know your thinking on this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed them all (again) because once again, the external links section of that article became a magnet for blatantly commercial links. Whichever one was last added pushed me over the edge.</dd>

<p>I understand. It sat nicely for a few weeks but eventually, it creeps back in. I hope you will consider not throwing out the baby with the bath water. I believe that the two links there now (one is to our company) are both valuable additions and others might be as well. Most are not. I will do my best to watch it but I hope you will not just dump the good ones when the bad ones pop up. Thanks.</p>

<dd>The usual phenomenon with lots of big <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switched_mode_power_supply.html" title="Switched mode power supply">SMPSs</a> is that there's a big RFI filter right at the mains power input; the filter blocks both RFI coming into the supply from the line and power supply hash going back out onto the power line. This filter usually takes the form of an LC "pi" filter on both the neutral and hot lines, usually with pretty substantial capacitors to the safety ground which, of course, is then connected to the chassis of the SMPS and whatever the SMPS itself is then bolted to. If the safety ground lead isn't so hot or is outright disconnected, you find that the capacitors make a voltage divider that puts the chassis at about 50% of the line voltage, and most people can definitely feel that&#160;;-).</dd>

<dd>Seriously, EL backlight circuits commonly use either transformers or inductors. Here's an article from <i>EE Times Asia</i> describing the sort of inductors that are typically used:</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The transformers are similar. Transformers are typically driven using a two-transistor free-running oscillator while the inductors often use a dedicated EL or LED driver IC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'll go back and read the statement in context in the transformer article and see if I still think it belongs there.</dd>

<p>Heh; small matter, hardly worth mentioning, but are you sure about your picture? I see one tape head on the left: a set of windings and a gap. There should be 6 of these assemblies spaced around the drum. Since you took the pictures, maybe you can double-check. No big deal, but it does look like only one type head. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 00:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm 100% certain of the picture. While you can't see all the details, if you were holding the head drum in your hand you could circuit trace the various transformer windings to the various head windings, and this would unambiguously make the case. But even in the provided picture, if you look at the high-resolution version of it, you will see that the left "head" is actually two separate heads. Look at the brass-looking bits; see how one faces left and one faces right? In particular, compare them to the single head farther to the right; see how it consists of just one brass bit? My <b>assumption</b> is that the two heads on the left are the normal-mode video head and its associated Hi-Fi sound recording head (which records a much longer-wavelength signal deeper into the videotape, but on essentially exactly the same track as the video track); the head on the right is the "special effects" head for good quality playback in scan mode (when the tracking is different). The other side of the drum has, of course, a symmetrical set of three more heads.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I had a microscope camera, I'd take a better picture for you&#160;;-). Maybe if I have a chance tomorrow, I'll see what the old Nikon is capable of shooting when pointed at just those two heads on the left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there's absolutely no doubt that that picture is a picture of three flying heads.</dd>

<p>What would you consider a suitable citation for pre-twisting being unneccessary before installing wire-nuts? In that case, shouldn't there also be a suitable citation for the mention on Scotchlok connectors? I considered adding a citation link to one of the product pages, but that would have been an arbitrary choice of which product, and in any case the link to the product line already exists at the start of the article.</p>
<p>Pre-twisting has not been required for many years now, and virtually all of the products on the Ideal Industries page cited in the article (a link I added) explicitly state that they do not need pre-twisting. The products which do not make an explicit statement are for automated installation (OEM, etc), and they certainly do not need pre-twisting. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_J_Shea_aa61.html" title="User:Alan J Shea">Alan</a> 15:37, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just spoke to a (US) licensed electrician about this. While he agrees that twisting the wires is not required by code (all that's required is a "mechanically sound connection", and a "listed pressure connector" used by itself meets that criterion), he states that he and his associates still twist the wires and cites the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It makes for a more-workmanlike job.</li>
<li>When there are several conductors (more than two), it makes it much easier to fit the wire nut.</li>
<li>When you remove the wire nut, twisted conductors assure that the connection doesn't spring apart. While we all <b>assume</b> the circuit is dead, it's just as well that it not disconnect itself when you remove the wire nut.</li>
</ul>

<p>After adding some weblinks to wikipedia pages I notice that you have removed it marking as spam.</p>
<p>I do not understand why you are marking my links as spam because I've only added external links to useful resources from a non-commercial Website. Technick.net is a free NON-COMMERCIAL site since 1998 with the same spirit of Wikipedia. Since Internet early days, I've personally spent thousand of hours to collect useful information and write guides without getting a penny.</p>
<p>Consider also that the most pinouts listed on Wikipedia are probably derived from Technick.net that was the first collection of pinouts on BSS networks on early 90' and then in Internet.</p>
<p>Also I'm a bit surprised because I notice that you haven't removed links to Websites like "pinouts.ru" that have taken a lot of content from historical sites like www.technick.net just to make revenues from advertising.</p>

<p>Please chek the following:</p>
<p>1. I've added only useful links to resources that wasn't available on wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>2. I think that www.technick.net must be cited as a reference on most of the wikipedia pinouts page because we have published it first. In fact our project is started in 1991, online on BBS in 1994 and on Internet in 1998. Most of the pinouts pages around the Web are started just as clones of the Technick.net content. A citation on an external links section is the minimum tribute for the efforts of this site.</p>
<p>5. Technick.net is a reliable source:</p>
<p>5.1. We have several written permissions from some hardware manufacturers to publish their pinouts and infos. I don't think that wikipedia or other sites have the same permissions.</p>
<p>5.2. Technick.net has been selected as a useful and trusted site by the National Science Teachers Association (<a href="http://www.scilinks.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.scilinks.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scilinks.org/</a>) and dozens of other associations.</p>
<p>5.3. Technick.net has received dozens of awards for it's quality and content.</p>
<p>5.4. Technick.net has written important pages of the Internet history and has been also positively reviewed by dozens of specialized magazines around the world.</p>
<p>6. Technick.net is not a commercial site.</p>
<p>7. Seems that you are making discrimination between links, you are not using only one measure.</p>
<dl>

<p>When you say <b>your</b> you are not considering that Technick.net is not a personal or commercial website but a free information website exactly as wikipedia is.</p>
<p>I don't think that my links are violating any wikipedia rule, in fact, as stated on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">WP:EL#Links normally to be avoided</a> you may distinguish the following cases:</p>
<p>1. "if the subject of an article has an official website, then it should be linked to even if it contains factually inaccurate material": this is the case for the pages that list pinouts that were first written on Technick.net.</p>
<p>2. "A website that you own or maintain, [...] Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link" this is the case for the links that do not fall on first point (just few links). Let me say that I have added only links to a pages that contains resources not available on wikipedia pages so, I think that an editor may decide in favor of this kind of links. Also, this rule about the ownership of a Website could be easily avoided using another account/person to make the same thing.</p>
<p>You have removed some links and maintained others that published a content that was clearly derived from technick.net. In this way you penalizing trusted sites like Technik.net in favour of sites that were builded freely getting our work just to make some revenues from advertising.

<p>I've been corresponding with Greg's wife Astrid in another online forum for years, so I have an inside link there. I know that Greg is a really thoughtful and considerate person who wouldn't do anything to slant his article, but I've seen people get tripped up time and again when they edit their own articles and get frustrated because they don't know enough about Wikipedia to do it without offending some of the oldtime editors. It can turn into a really bad experience, when really all the person is trying to do is correct an error or add something they feel is important.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't think I'm betraying a confidence by quoting some of Astrid's reply to me:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Boy, did that spark some interesting discussions in our household!</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Yes, Greg did add some material to his article, with the goal of, well, adding more information. He didn’t take out anything, even if it was more opinion-based than fact based. In an interesting generational divide, the dear children were appalled, <b>appalled</b>, that Dad had touched his own Wikipedia article, even with benign intent and action. It seemed like an okay idea to me, thus clearly relegating me to the camp of “older than dirt”! Issues of who knows more about someone, themselves or other people; how groups of activists can control dissemination of information about their pet topics on Wikipedia; what the nature of history and fact is; who are all these people and why do they have so much time on their hands, were only some of things we tossed around.</i></dd>

<p>Not sure about your revert at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28film%29.html" title="Metropolis (film)">Metropolis (film)</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metropolis_%28film%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76981146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metropolis_%28film%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76981146" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I agree that it looked suspicious, particularly with the lowercase "g" and the anon editor, but the US version is dealt with in the paragraph just after that one, and seems to be at odds with this one. I've never seen the German version, so I don't know which is right, but the Machine Man in the US version can't be both sentient <i>and</i> an automaton. This needs a bit more looking into. Your thoughts? <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't sure about it either. (And I'm not sure the lower-case "g" is a useful clue; it seems common in many European languages to downcase stuff that most English speakers would upcase and I can't remember the current rules for German right now.) What triggered me, though, was the discussion above our suspicious sentence that stated that the American version of the character was an automaton. This seemed to match well with the earlier version of the dubious sentence.</dd>

<dd>Sorry I put the question in there, but it's part of my standards and I should be consistent in my own noms. I think you answered it well—I'm looking for if the nominee understands the spirit of IAR. It's not a bad policy, but I see far too many admins quote it when the action taken doesn't clearly help the project and the admin shows a lack of understanding of true policy. I think badlydrawnjeff has misunderstood you. I think the edit counts issue is silly; it's only become a standard for some in the past few months.

<p>I wouldn't bother answering any more about the IAR issue. It's a waste of time because, despite what they claim, you'll never convince the dissenters to change their minds. It doesn't hurt your case to just let the other guy get the last word. Everyone who looks at the issue will see that you've answered the question. Everyone who just jumps on the opposition bandwagon won't see that, but there's nothing you can do to stop them anyway. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 19:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Arguing on an RfA never helps anyone. Since he stopped answering he's gotten four support votes and no more oppose votes. Absolutely everything constructive has already been said, and nobody else seems to have any questions about it. If it wasn't enough, there's not much more that can be done in any kind of positive and constructive way. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 01:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're looking at this as a wee bit of a campaign... what is to be gained is a better understanding of each other. I'd really appreciate it if Atlant would share his frank view of IAR -- outside of the RfA -- just so we could each get perspective on the other's point of view. I think your view of RfA is a bit odd, too -- I've changed "votes" at least a dozen times this year.

<dd>(Just happening by) I'm inclined to agree with Kafziel and with Xoloz: you would likely do well not to engage at RfA in extended colloquies over "votes" but would surely do well to continue discussions with RfA participants outside of the RfA, perhaps at the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Atlant_7766.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Atlant">RfA's talk page</a>. FWIW, like Xoloz I often change my "vote" during the pendency of an RfA (or refrain from participating in the discussion until issues about which I am concerned are fully fleshed out); even if such change is facially to <i>neutral</i>, the concomitant comments often change substantively, which changes might well, one would hope, provide the prospective admin with more feedback from the community and provide those who partake subsequently in a given RfA something more about which to think. Notwithstanding that the value of ignoring all rules here is qualitatively different from that of ignoring all rules in government and law courts, a fellow ACLU member might remind you that IAR is essentially the spirit that underlies nearly every alibertarian decision taken by the present administration...&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, if I were to view this solely as a campaign, then what I ought to do is find those positions that will garner the most votes and stick to them, recognizing that taking any actual stances will also drive away some votes. Presumably, the stated positions might not even correspond to what I actually believe, but might instead be the results of consultations with advisors, focus groups, or polls.</p>
<p>But I'm not going to do that. This isn't a campaign, it's more like a job interview. I have the skills and a demonstrated willingness to work that I think would be assets to the encyclopedia. So I'll simply set out those views that I actually hold. And, at the moment, the position I've taken vis-a-vis <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is not only a pretty accurate, complete-yet-still-concise representation of how I feel about IAR, but it also seems to be garnering votes.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for those votes that I won't get; perhaps as a result of this interviewing process I won't be "hired". But as I said, I think I've laid out my views (on the topics that I've been asked about) accurately, clearly, and concisely. If my views are not a sufficient match for the other participants in the project, then in the long run, we'll both end up happier if I'm <b>not</b> hired. So I'll gladly answer new questions that are posed to me, but I don't see any reason to continue arguing the IAR issue; I think those things worth saying have mostly all been said already.</p>

<p>My contribution to the above article:</p>
<p>"The most elaborate forms are usen in schools and laboratories or by developers of electronic circuits. Their outputs are regulated, adjustable and deliver up to 5 amperes at 30 volts." could well be improved especially the spelling or perhaps it should be relocated. But I am prepared to offer as many references as you would like to support the statement. My experiences with power supplies including design, manufacture and repair are limited to about 50 years. The reason for deleting this part of my contribution "Revert a comment that probably arises from limited experience." doesn't realy apply. Cakeandicecream 10:10, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In all honesty, I misread your statement and so missed the part about developers of electronic circuits, focusing mainly on schools (which I've never found to be all that well equipped). I'm sorry I did that but I'd definitely focus on development labs rather than schools; the high-end <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agilent.html" title="Agilent">Agilent</a> supplies and other similar supplies from other vendors are certainly pretty sophisticated supplies. On the other hand, "most sophisticated" is likely to be a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">PoV</a> statement: the sophistication of <b>any</b> power supply depends on which parameters we're focusing on.</dd>

<p>Thanks for the quick response. As an administrator I can well imagine that you're under considerable pressure getting errors out of contributions. I've inadvertantly caused enough myself. Many courses in electronics that I have attended are so-called "Hands On" courses meaning that the students actually experiment with circuits they had just learned in theory. For such circuits we used power supplies with an adjustable voltage output and an adjustable current limiters. I had assumed that this is general practice. Of course, schools with better resources can afford better equipment, One supplier of such power supplies claimed that the ones he offered had been built in Russia and were left over from deliveries to french schools. (The circuits were quite strange, used exotic components and had no protection against false connections.) Should you still have doubts I would be quite happy to send you corresponding documents (in French and Russian) by email. That supplier is long since bankrupt, the manufacturer most probably also. I've discarded his catalog. Cakeandicecream 11:10, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not an administrator yet, although I hope to be by day's end Tuesday!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand your point. The sorts of supplies that are common in teaching environments are certainly adjustable voltage, and thankfully almost always have adjustable current-limiters (see <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_test.html" title="Smoke test">smoke test</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_smoke.html" title="Magic smoke">magic smoke</a>&#160;:-) ). But when I think of a truly sophisticated supply, I think of one that has digital control, digital, accurate instrumentation, <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE-488_d23d.html" title="IEEE-488">GPIB</a> programming, and the ability to slew quickly from voltage to voltage. Perhaps it's even a "four-quadrant" device, able to both sink and source both positive and negative current. It's probably also quite high-powered yet still reasonably compact.</dd>

<dd>But there's nothing that makes my opinion here "special", so please <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and re-edit the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_supply.html" title="Power supply">power supply</a> article as you see fit.

<p>Hello, I am a new Wikipedian and am asking for your guidance. Recently you place a 'clean up' tag on Race to the Right and I would like a little direction in what you were looking for.

<dl>
<dd>Sure. Wiki articles have a certain "style" to them; that's what I meant by "Wikification" (in the audit trail comment). For example, the keyword(s) that appear in the very beginning of the article ought to be bolded (so <b>Race to the RIght</b>). (Because those words are bolded further along, it looks like maybe that first paragraph in the article was added later but no one adjusted the "markup".) Also, there are lots of words around the article that can be Wikilinked to other articles. For example, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_show.html" title="Talk show">talk show</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article also needs some general editing. For example, karoke appears to be a misspelling of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaoke.html" title="Karaoke">karaoke</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The cleanup tag wasn't meant to imply that there's anything radically wrong with the article; it just needs, well, "cleanup". And there's no better practice for you to become an experienced Wikipedian -- welcome, and best wishes!</dd>

<p>You're now an admin, so have fun using the new tools to help make the project better. Do the best you can to take into account the spirit of the comments in your RfA to the extent that they can help you be a better editor and a greater asset to the project. As you get the hang of the new tools use them to help clear out the backlogs, but still use them conservatively, especially the punitive ones like blocking, and especially at first. Polite warnings and de-escalating the situation can go a long way instead of antagonizing. Also, re-read the policies as necessary before acting.

<p>Just so you don't think you're going insane, the reason "people" keep changing the voice of Genie is because "they" are actually sockpuppts of Woodylogan. He basically runs around and edits family movie-related articles, inserting misinformation and then editing any related articles to conceal the vandalism. <b>Any</b> changes by IPs caught doing this should be reverted immediately. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I just wondered if there was some Dan C. website out there that had all these folks fired up. Clearly, they're wrong because a) there's no legitimate website out there from Disney to IMDB that suggests the Genie was anyone other than Robin Williams, and b) I <b>know</b> the movie and I can recognize Robin Williams, and there's no doubt in the world that the Genie is Williams.</dd>

<p>Hello Atlant,</p>
<p>I was working on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_underground.html" title="Democratic underground">Democratic_underground</a> where you reverted some changes I made yesterday.</p>
<p>Here is the appearance of the page as my last edit:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Underground&amp;diff=84959450&amp;oldid=84956267" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Underground&amp;diff=84959450&amp;oldid=84956267" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>I edited the "Forums" section and the "Online Community" section. Mostly, what I did to other peoples work was some reorganization. I tried to not delete anything that other people had written. I added a section on terms, and I expanded the section on the forum reorganzation.</p>
<p>I'm posting here to ask what I did wrong. Did you have a problem with the point of view of what I wrote, or did you consider it to be original research? Would you be so kind as to explain how I have offended?</p>

<dd>It's entirely possible I was mistaken, but what "pushed my button" was your edit summary: "This edit needs more cowbell."; that sort of set me up to consider your string of edits as "flippant". The article about DU is extremely contentious, often vandalized, and subject to many, many <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> pushers. I think I looked at the last edit of yours, (erroneously) decided it was a bogus edit, and pushed the "Rollback" button (which undid all of the edits back to the edit by whomever editted the article last before you). I should have looked at the diff which would have summarized all of your edits at once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I would probably still have objected to, for example, your <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_pedal.html" title="Soft pedal">soft pedaling</a> of the details about the I/P forum and the Gungeon. The fact that these topics need to be "isolated" away from public view is an important fact about the culture at DU and I think that needs to stay in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless, my opinion is just one among a million or so Wikipedians, so don't take me too seriously; I certainly didn't feel strongly enough about your edits to consider them vandalism so feel free to re-apply them. I won't intervene in this particular edit again.</dd>

<dd>Hi Atlant, thanks for the reply. You are right that my last comment was flippant. One lesson I might take from this is not to make pithy statements in the Edit Summary.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>I'll take your advice about soft-pedalling the Gun Dungeon and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict forums. I didn't mean to tuck those forums in a closet, and looking at what I wrote after a night's sleep I can see your point. When I start putting my edits back in, I'll keep that in mind.</dd>

<p>Hey! Did you ever see the networking driver that Fermilab put out for VAX, RT-11, and RSX-11M? I was the architect of that one! <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 17:40, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so; did it implement some sort of point-to-point DR-to-DR link? What higher-level protocols did it support?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mostly I saw home-grown drivers. Because the DR11-W had those cool (where's the sarcasm tag?) "Write-zero-to-clear" status bits in the main Control and Status Register, I ended up talking to nearly everyone who ever wrote a driver, explaining how to <b>not</b> lose interrupts by accidentally clearing those bits. Well, I talked to everyone until I eventually re-wrote the User's Guide and made it very clear where the traps were.</dd>

<dd>It implemented sockets, though at the time we had never heard of the unix/Arpa socket architecture, we re-invented it. A task could declare its affinity for a particular packet type code, and then when a packet appeared on the link would either get an AST to alert it to place a read, or would have a pending read for that type satisfied. We did not buffer the data as DECNET did, but instead DMA-ed from one task's core to another's.

<dd>We broke all of the RSX rules and had a protocol in a driver rather than an ACP. And made it work. It was bulletproof. Vicky White (Still at Fermi) taught me the basics of how a proper state machine operates, and I have used her wisdom throughout my subsequent career. The driver as I originally wrote it was a mess, but she and I re-wrote it as a state machine and it was great!

<p>I'd like to apologize for IP Address 64.39.127.245 which, unfortunately, committed acts of vandalism on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Jew (disambiguation)">Jew (disambiguation)</a>. The attack was unfortunate and irresponsible. I tell you this because I've used the IP Address although I did not in fact make the edit.</p>
<p>However, I'd also like to regretfully inform you that the address is widely used because it is a school IP Address. Therefore, it is almost impossible to tell who is using it irresponsibly just by the address. In spite of this however I would hardly blame you if you banned the address from editing Wikipedia. If you did so it would become necessary for any school users of Wikipedia to simply acquire acounts, which they should do anyway.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that users of this address have caused Wikipedia problems and apologize wholeheartedly on behalf of the entire community. <a href="../../../n/i/v/User%7ENivenus_4e6a.html" title="User:Nivenus">Nivenus</a> 17:49, November 13 <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>

Generally, admins are careful about banning a shared IP, although I can say that, for me, it depends a lot on ratio of good edits to vandalistic edits coming from that IP. And, as you noted, anyone can create a personal account and avoid getting caught up in most of the mess surrounding an anonymous IP.</dd>

<p>hi Atlant, random stranger here. I noticed your history with DEC and I have a rather curious question... in about 1996 I was fresh from college and got a summer contract job for Kimberly Clark in Mobile Alabama as a top-level "problem engineer" during their systemwide upgrade. They had just purchased a very specialized paper plant, and were upgrading their entire network (all servers, desktops, CAD and CAM). I remember in the midst of the upgrade we always had to make provisions for legacy support of the vaxen they employed. The corporate IT guys insisted that all the CAM and production interfaces (from VAX to machine) were too specialized/big/expensive to re-engineer for newer platforms. I specifically remember them purchasing all vax parts and resources they could find, citing impending EoS/EoL from digital. Do you have any direct knowledge of that particular use/problem? I was with IBM for a time, and they carried on OS/2 support for an extra half-decade to support ATM's that (still probably) run OS/2. Anyway, was vax ever so specialized that a solution couldn't be implemented in emulation? Just curious about an insider's view! /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 21:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have any direct experience with the Kimberly Clark situation, but it wasn't uncommon. And there were several aspects to that question of migration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you may recall, DEC <b>did not</b> provide any emulation layer to allow <a href="../../../v/a/x/VAX_a10c.html" title="VAX">VAX</a> binaries to run unmodified on <a href="../../../d/e/c/DEC_Alpha_cb8e.html" title="DEC Alpha">Alpha</a> systems; instead, they forced users to recompile from source. It wasn't for any hard-and-fast technical reasons, it was mostly just a managment choice. (Much of the code that was needed was already available; remember, the MicroVAX is a major subsetting of the full VAX instruction set.) To me at the time, and to many looking back in retrospect now, that was a major mistake, but none of the high mucky-mucks were asking my opinion at the time&#160;;-). (Meanwhile, Apple proved that an emulation layer kept the users happy as they moved from <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola.html" title="Motorola">Motorola</a> <a href="../../../6/8/k/68K_f9cb.html" title="68K">68K</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/w/PowerPC_1c02.html" title="PowerPC">PPC</a> and then from PPC to <a href="../../../x/8/6/X86_architecture.html" title="X86 architecture">IA32</a> machines. And, as I recall, <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> has done well supporting ancient <a href="../../../o/s/2F/OS_360_7af9.html" title="OS/360">OS/360</a> customers right on up to <a href="../../../z/2F/o/Z_OS_0da1.html" title="Z/OS">Z/OS</a>.) So some users stuck with VAX because they wouldn't or even couldn't recompile from sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A few other users were more constrained. In government contracts, in certain applications certified by regulatory agencies, the users simply <b>couldn't</b> change anything about the systems. These users had no flexibility to migrate to Alpha so they stuck with VAX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oddly enough, nowadays, by far the fastest VAXes (and PDP-11s, PDP-10s, and PDP-8s) <b>are</b> the emulators. Bob Supnik and others have designed entire system emulations and, running on modern hardware, these blow the doors off of any of the real systems that DEC ever shipped.</dd>

<dd>When I was working at Commonwealth Edison in their nuclear systems group, I was amazed to fine that ancient Westinghouse computers, then 25 years old, ran the nuclear plants. The reason for this is that those machines were the ones qualified for those plants by the Atomic Energy Commission, and replacing them would be much more expensive than having technicians laboriously repair boards at the component level to keep them in operation. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 03:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's exactly right -- I used to deal regularly with <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited_696a.html" title="Atomic Energy of Canada Limited">AEC of Canada</a>; it turns out that that <a href="../../../c/a/n/CANDU_reactor_6498.html" title="CANDU reactor">CANDU nuclear reactors</a> were certified with a fuel-management system that was designed around PDP-11/70s running RSX, and they needed to maintain that exact configuration into perpetuity in order for the plants to stay certified. So they created a plan where they bought a substantial number of spare systems, etc., etc. I had an open invitation to visit the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington_Nuclear_Generating_Station_584a.html" title="Darlington Nuclear Generating Station">Darlington, Ontario</a> plant, but never took my counterpart upon it; I wish I had.</dd>

<dd>It was also a very common situation in military contracts.

<p>Hi Atlant!</p>
<p>Thank you for your prolific and excellent work -- it is appreciated by many, including this old RT-11 user. But...I am concerned about the continuation of the misuse of the trademark "Charactron" to include electrical-output CRTs better described as "monoscopes."<br />
I've added a little to the Charactron page but wanted to check with you before making any major additions and certainly before any major deletions. My background is in display engineering and I have lots of documentation (and devices) of the Charactron line of products from Hughes and the entire Convair to Lexel lineage, but nothing included electrical readout devices, nor dot-matrix devices from any monoscope supplier. Any information you could supply would be greatly appreciated for my edification as well as for our fleshing out the page.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<dd>You sound a lot better-informed (and certainly more-directly-informed) about this particular topic than I am, so I would strongly encourage you to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and make such changes as you deem necessary (especially where trademarked products are involved).</dd>

<dd>My first direct experiences in character generation come shortly after the age of any of the "creative"/"inventive" character generators such as monoscopes, character plates in '029 keypunches, diode ROMs, and the like. That is, I began working with computers in the age of the Signetics 2513 (IIRC) 5x7 character generator ROM (and I probably could still find one of those in my junkbox). So I defer to your knowledge.</dd>

<p>I added the "see also" section on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifuse.html" title="Antifuse">Antifuse</a> article. I mentioned Actel because they manufacture antifuse based FPGA.

<p>Thanks for your comment on the imaginative 'aviation' section. I'll give it a few days and delete the whole thing. You might be interested to learn that I am running a DEC Alpha workstation in one of our main engine test cells, on Tru64 Unix. I also have another one as a development system.</p>
<p>I got a laugh out of the rant you quote on your user page. It reminds me of the cartoon in which Porky calls Daffy a no-good, lying, thieving, backstabbing, treacherous, double-dealing, unsanitary old duck. Daffy, greatly insulted, replies, "UNSANITARY?" Your correspondent's use of "self-indulgent" is similar to Porky's line.</p>

<dd>Do you really think it was that "good faith" of a question? This user couldn't even be bothered to sign their post, yet they want a high school (slight assumption there) physics course handed to them in some way. Normally, I'm pretty open to fishing expeditions on the Reference Desks, but this one must have just contained one too many triggers for me. Perhaps it was their claim to be "ambitious".</dd>

<p>Hi Atlant</p>
<p>I have been working together with user skeeves to make this article a bit better, and somewhat more complete. What I would like to ask is to re-consider the merging with Kerosene lamps. We are working on a couple of other Kerosene Lamps pages for different types and brands. If they all would be merged, the page would not be found so well and grow to be very long.</p>

<p>Hi Atlant;</p>
<p>RE: Removing links to "How To Pick a Pin Tumbler Lock" at RemodelingMySpace.com</p>
<p>While I appreciate that from a certain perspective the links I posted could be construed as merely "for advertising or promotion", I put them there because I felt that they added merit to the article(s). EG: on the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> - which is about 'bumping' or, picking a pin tumbler lock, there are other references to 'how-to' there, and adding our link is merely another perspective (a how to with legal warnings and links to legal references here). Note that on our page linked to we are not selling anything. Whereas - on this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksmith" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksmith" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> - where we posted a link to tips on considerations for hiring a locksmith (which is valuable information) - right above is a link to this site "Home Security Tips" [<a href="http://www.reactfast.co.uk/htm/locks_home_security_tips.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reactfast.co.uk/htm/locks_home_security_tips.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>] which is CLEARLY just a business website looking for link promotion. From the same wikipedia page, there is a link to [<a href="http://www.discreetsecuritysolutions.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discreetsecuritysolutions.com/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>] titled "Typical UK NDE locksmith services&#160;: Discreet Security Solutions" which is an article about nefarious locksmiths in England - yet you removed our article on what to look for in a locksmith??</p>
<p>Can you please explain your reasoning? - Again, we don't sell anything on our website (except ad space) - mostly everything we link to is a free resource or valuable service to the visitor. If selling adspace is a bad thing then there are a lot of external links that should be removed from wikipedia.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for all your time and effort put into the wikipedia project (I hope they crush Google!) &#160;:)!</p>
<p>Also, I am very new to this so please forgive any of my newbie mistakes - not even sure if I'm posting this where I should be?!</p>
<p>Paul M.</p>
<p>ADDED:</p>
<p>Hey Atlant;</p>
<p>Never mind the above post I made - I just read post #26 - "Why are you marking my posts as spam?</p>
<p>Now I get it - the links are to MY site. Too bad, but understandable.</p>
<p>Anyone know where I can buy a Wikipedia editor? &#160;;)</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for understanding. Our policies on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">external links</a> are some of the hardest stuff to enforce because there's no "bright line" that separates useful links from spammy links.</dd>

I spent about 2 hours tonight trying to refactor the talk page so that people could see what was being said and by whom. I had to proxy sign about 20 of his posts.</p>

<dd>Meanwhile with regard to tube amps, my experience certainly extends back that far (and into some pretty high-quality single-channel, high-powered amps from the 60s), but I'm a pragmatist and an objectivist when it comes to evaluating hi-fi components, and by the late 70s, I think transistorised amps had surpassed tube (valve) amps in every respect from power capability, frequency response, and distortion right through to <a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean_time_between_failure.html" title="Mean time between failure">MTBF</a>. Don't like the way transistor amps clip compared to tube amps? Don't drive them into clipping. And unlike tube amps, it's trivially easy to have hundreds of watts of low-ditortion, low-impedance power on tap. And now, with the coming of <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switching_amplifier.html" title="Switching amplifier">Class-D</a> (switching) amplifiers, hundreds of watts of power now takes less space than did 50-watt amplifiers in the 70s and these amps burn very little standby power when they're idling, so the AV amp in the sitting in the cupboard below my TV can deliver 5.1 channels of audio at 125 Watts per channel without the need for a cooling fan in the cupboard.</dd>

<dd>Yes I think really a big difference between tubes and transistors is the overload performance. I just wonder why no one thought of putting a soft limiter on transistor amps (to get that smooth tube sound). Maybe they have. THe only thing Ive seen is clipping indicators that tell you you should turn down the gain.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other main difference seems to be that the damping factor is not that high and this may accentuate cetain portions ao the frequency response. If there is less NFB at band edges (due to o/p transformer limitations, )this would tend to accentuate the response at low and high frequencies giving a 'presence' boost that may sound prefereable to a flat response. So hey presto, you get a warm, in your <s>face</s> ears lifelike sound that doent sound too bad on the loud bits.&#160;? 8-?--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 00:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'd think so, but we admins have been clearly instructed that at least for IPs, a "final" warning expires after about 24 hours. This makes some sense on shared IPs, where any number of users might be editing, and yesterday's vandal isn't today's vandal. On the other hand, {{blatanvandal}} doesn't seem to have a "use-by" date&#160;;-), but is only applied if they're really, really blatant.</dd>

<p>Hi. I also work at Teradyne, and your statement that all DIBs have DUTs on them is inaccurate. I can't give more details as some of it may be trade secrets but definitely there are DIBs without DUTs.<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZaydHammoudeh_3b03.html" title="User:ZaydHammoudeh">ZaydHammoudeh</a> 17:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your comments on the Global Warming page, I thought I would make a few points. First, while removing a POV tag is not "simple vandalism," it may nevertheless be vandalism. While simple vandalism presents an exception to 3RR, other forms of vandalism do not, and it is perfectly acceptable to revert non-simple vandalism 2 times a day forever. Additionally, suggesting that it is a "personal attack" to claim someone is violating a Wikipedia policy (owning) when they actually are violating that policy is absurd.</p>
<p>I appreciate your cordial comments, but strongly disagree with them. I will also note that I'm perfectly capable of reading text without the important words <b>bolded</b>, and I bet other people are too. &#160;:-) CleanHarry29201 04:32, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I won't bold anything in this reply. But I will call your attention to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, and especially <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="WP:Vandalism">What vandalism is not</a> where it clearly states that stubborness is not vandalism, no matter how much you wish it were. So if you approach the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">guidelines in the three-revert rule</a>, even over a content dispute that you mischaracterise as vandalsim, I will have absolutely no qualms about blocking you (or any other 3RR violator).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will also call your attention to the Wikipedia guideline <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Accusing someone of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owning</a> a page is an assumption of bad faith and a breaking of that guideline. Admittedly, it's a guideline, not a rule, but I would urge you to keep it in mind as you edit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, of course, if you disagree with any of my actions, you have recourse. A good starting place is always <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">the incidents page of the administrator's noticeboard</a>.</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid you have a very poor understanding of the dispute ongoing on the Global Warming page. Stubbornness is not vandalism, but I have not accused the opposing side of vandalism because of their stubbornness. I have accused them of vandalism because they have removed a POV tag during a POV dispute. That is clearly improper, and it's just as clearly vandalism.</dd>
<dd>I will continue to replace the POV tag as long as it is vandalized and removed. I appreciate your threats, they appear to be the only way things are done around the Wikipedia. If people don't do what you want, threaten them.</dd>
<dd>With respect to good faith, I have not "assumed" bad faith. I have evidence of bad faith. Removal of a POV tag during a POV dispute is evidence of bad faith.</dd>
<dd>In the end, it's sad to see people like you and this William Connolley fellow ruining the Wikipedia with these absurd, results-oriented interpretations of rules and policies. It doesn't surprise me though. If you want to block me for reverting vandalism outside of 3RR, better get started. CleanHarry29201 03:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I have a very good understanding of the debate and an important clue is that one side of the debate claims that an alleged "both sides" of the issue must be presented, as if there were only two sides to this rather-complex issue. It's also useful (and occasionally, entertaining) to see what other contributions the "both sides" people are making to the encylopedia as compared to those of us who "threaten" people.</dd>

<dd>Why do you feel the need to lie? I didn't encourage anyone to break the rules. I told Magiwand I appreciated his useful edits but not to break 3RR. Exactly how does that constitute "encouragement" to break the rules? And do you typically lie and blatantly mischaracterize the actions of others, or is this an isolated incident? And don't go quoting to me stuff about "assuming good faith." I assumed your good faith, until now. CleanHarry29201 01:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason I haven't reported Mr. Connelley is that I don't know how. I have never found a situation so blatantly improper that there was a need to report anyone. And I don't care how much administrative attention I garner; again, the threats and intimidation may work with a lot of the newbies around here but they don't work with me. I await an apology from you, and an edit to remove, your accusation that I encouraged someone to break a rule. You know, as demonstrated above, that I have done no such thing.

<dd>Oh, and so far as the accusation that I've "canvassed" anyone, I haven't. Magiwand was threatened by a member of the Global Warming clique, and I responded that he need not feel threatened and should continue to edit the page within the rules. He had already attempted to edit the page, so in no sense did I "canvass" him. Further, it seems clear to me that all of these threats of blocking, etc., are the exact opposite of canvassing and just as improper, if not moreso. Several folks have commented on the Global Warming talk page that the clique owning the page has run off a variety of editors in the past, and the suggestion is that this was accomplished through threats and intimidation similar to those that have been levelled at me recently. I simply advised Magiwand that he need not succumb to these sorts of threats, as others apparently do. That's not canvassing, and you know it. But again, the actual facts seem rather unimportant to you. CleanHarry29201 03:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, this is a student at Thayer Academy. This school has a network that encompasses all of our computers. I am writing to discuss the many messages this IP address has received about a user or users who has tried to vandalize wikipedia articles. I would appreciate it if there was some method to determine if the user was intending to contribute negatively or not. As this is most improbable, I would suggest that this IP address be prevented from making edits. Maybe there will be a better solution, but as of now I cannot see one. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Thanks for writing! As you realize, there's no way the encyclopedia software automatically characterizes edits into "likely good" edits and "obviously bad" edits, although there are some 'bots (pieces of robotic software) that run on the enclopedia and have been trained to recognize and fix some of the obvious cases of vandalism. With regard to blocking the school as a whole, there's a whole series of steps we administrators are (generally) required to take in response to vandalism, but it certainly looks like your school is moving through those steps&#160;:-(. I'd encourage you (and any other folks at the school who want to help rather than hurt the encyclopedia) to create a Wikipedia username now, before the school's IP address ends up getting blocked and creation of usernames from the school becomes impossible. Once you have a username, you can avoid the blocking of anonymous editors. Meanwhile, I'd also encourage you to approach the administration of your school, explain to them what's going on and what the consequences will be; perhaps they can figure out who's vandalizing the encyclopedia from your school.</dd>

<p>Thanks for answering my question! er... I would have thanked you in the question itself, but apparently they get archived very quickly.&#160;:( Which is a shame too since while you were useful in answering about near IR and UV, I'm still not sure whether or not there's ambient UV at night too (though I imagine not much), or how much far IR there is (though I have slightly biased suspicions that far IR mostly comes off of life forms and stuff!) But anyway, thank you!~ (the question was about ambient infared/ultraviolet if you haven't guessed already, by the way!) 67.83.72.38 15:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And with regard to your new questions: both good questions, but neither of which I know the answer to! I'd <b>guess</b> that light from the sky at night has about the same spectral distribution as daylight (assuming that the moon is uniformly reflective at all frequencies (dubious assumption #1) and that starlight, on average, is roughly the same as sunlight (dubious assumption #2), but that would just be a guess.</dd>

<p>I wasn't endorsing those claims. I was just stating that the ACLU is commonly alleged by Christians and conservatives as being biased against them. If you take a look at any major conservative website (e.g. Focus on the Family), I'm sure you'll find some long diatribe about how the ACLU's sole purpose is to "destroy" Christianity or something along those lines.--68.91.194.221 01:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. But to qualify for inclusion on Wikipedia, the facts should be balanced; see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. In fact, the ACLU does a fair amount of litigating on behalf of the rights of Christians, and omitting that makes the presentation biased.

<p>The revert you did was of an attempt to get a growing wikitext out of the article. You appear to have misunderstood the purpose there.

There is a discussion on going <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_user_warnings_714a.html#Overview_-_Now_time_to_finish" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject user warnings">here</a> that might be of interest to you about the future of this project. There are two strawpolls on the talk pages and the second one is about the future of the WP:UW project. Now we have the end in sight we are looking at wrapping up the project and merging it with Template messages/User talk namespace <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a> and creating a one stop shop for all userspace template issue. As you have yourself down as interested in this project we thought you may have some input on this issue, and would like you to visit the discussion and give any thoughts you may have on the matter.

<p>I noticed you are a regular editor of the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor.html" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> article. I recently created the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extrinsic_semiconductor.html" title="Extrinsic semiconductor">extrinsic semiconductor</a> article for a technical communication class and was wondering if you could read it and leave some comments for me. I need to do another revision for my final grade for this project, and I believe some input from an experienced Wikipedia editor would be a great asset. If you do not have time, I fully understand.</p>
