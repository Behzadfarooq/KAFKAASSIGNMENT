<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edits to make Article More Encyclopedic</span></h2>
<p>I excised a number of sentences that were mostly superfluous personal commentary. In addition, I removed a handful of personal pronouns. It is pretty clear this article in its current form is more or less someone's personal essay. I am also of the opinion that the article should be reorganized to have Plato's account first, since that is probably the most pertinent information about Atlantis. The history timeline, while interesting, doesn't talk much about Atlantis, and it could be cut up a bit, but I will leave that to someone else as I am not Atlantis scholar. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_M._O%27Hare_a594.html" title="User:Shawn M.

<dd>Well, I just saw that this article was written again, and honestly, I'm impressed ( I was chocked with the previous article). I think the article is now fine. It is not a personal essay, I watched and read about this issue, and this follows the usual and same pattern.Maybe your suggestions should be added. But I think it is a good article and now it can be translated to other languages. -<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 02:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your concern Shawn. Actually, the article <i>was</i> a mess. True.

<dd>Now, we have <a href="../../../l/o/c/Location_hypotheses_of_Atlantis_33a0.html" title="Location hypotheses of Atlantis">Location hypotheses of Atlantis</a> as well as <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_in_fiction.html" title="Atlantis in fiction">Atlantis in fiction</a>. Those two articles have been originated from the main <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. The <i>good news</i> is that we are being consistent now in terms of <i>what goes where</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=29850074&amp;oldid=29841704" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=29850074&amp;oldid=29841704" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis_in_fiction&amp;diff=29849836&amp;oldid=29820031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis_in_fiction&amp;diff=29849836&amp;oldid=29820031" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. As for my part, and as a consequence, I created <a href="../../../a/t/l/Category%7EAtlantis_c681.html" title="Category:Atlantis">Category:Atlantis</a>, as an expectation that the main article would generate many other generic ones. Also, because that the main article would only treat the origins of the story, myth, fact (call it whatever you like) and the generalities. As of today, we have 14 articles under that category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I don't believe there exsit any original research. In fact, the articles lack sources. True. Let's work on that too. If you are knowledgeable about the topic (at a minimum, not necesserly an expert), you'd agree that Atlantis is a <i>controversial</i> topic. However, all theories related to Atlantis that are presented in wikipedia articles are encyclopaedic. It doesn't matter if they are right or not but they exist as theories. True again. In other words, the article(s) are neither a mess nor are <i>original research</i>. -- Cheers -- <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 19:38, 2 December 2005 (UTC) <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange">&#160;<sup><i>Wiki me up™</i></sup></font></a></small></dd>

<p>I've removed the stuff about the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panathenaea.html" title="Panathenaea">Panathenaea</a>, as this festival had nothing to do with Atlantis or Poseidon. The idea that Poseidon founded Atlantis and that the Athenians had a war with the Atlanteans isn't part of mainstream Greek myth at all--it's a bizarrre fiction of Plato's. There is a myth that Athena and Poseidon had a competition to become the patron god(dess) of Athens, which Athena won, but this myth isn't very closely connected to the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panathenaea.html" title="Panathenaea">Panathenaea</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other Greek accounts</span></h2>
<p>The "other Greek accounts" section is a mess. We need more precise citations of ancient authors. It would also be good to avoid equating every mythical island in the west with Atlantis. The island of the Hesperides, for instance, is definitely not the same as Atlantis. The material about Ammianus Marcellinus appears to be inaccurate, but it's hard to confirm without knowing what passages are being cited...</p>
<p>I'm tempted to just delete the whole section, but perhaps someone else can suggest a less drastic course of action. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">Akhilleus</a> 22:05, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the authors don't talk about Atlantis, as far as I can tell right now, and so should be removed. Any authors that talk about Atlantis, of course, should be retained! But since the section doesn't give precise references, it's hard to check whether the authors say anything about Atlantis or not--reading through all the fragments of Theophrastus without some kind of specific reference would take forever. And Atlantis is the kind of thing where enthusiasts seize on anything that seems to prove their point, so it's quite possible the original passage will have absolutely nothing to do with Atlantis. Again, I'm not going to just start deleting things wholesale, but if someone has a secondary source that talks about these authors, and can point us to a specific work or passage, that would really help. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">Akhilleus</a> 06:28, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The inhabitants of the latter had preserved a recollection (transmitted to them by their ancestors) of the island of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, which was extremely large, and for a long time held sway over all the islands of the Atlantic Ocean. <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/atl/ataw/ataw204.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/atl/ataw/ataw204.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "root races" template</span></h2>
<p>At the bottom of the article appears the {{Epochs}} template, which stems from some Theosophic theory of human evolution/history. The template has NPOV problems, in my opinion: it's not at all clear, until you follow a link, that the idea of "root races or epochs in human evolution" is an esoteric theory. Someone might mistake it for something that's scientifically valid.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 19th/20th century views of Atlantis are only one part of what's covered here, Theosophic views an even smaller part, so putting the {{Epochs}} template here misrepresents the content of the article.

<dd>I agree. Templates at the bottom of the article like that are usually reserved for widely held concepts, not one person's theory. There have been many esoteric theories about human evolution that include Atlantis, and if we were to be NPOV, we would have to include them all as similar templates, or none at all. Since including them all as templates isn't practical, I'm removing the Epochs template accordingly. I sympathize with whoever made it, it must have involved a fair amount of effort to make, but it's POV to include it here. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 00:01, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I really doubt it. Even if it could have possibly been Atlantis (which is doubtful because out of sheer distance the ancient Greeks wouldn't have been able to have continued contact with Indonesia, and vice versa), the other claims (the Garden of Eden, the Island of Avalon, the Garden of the Hesperides, the true location of Troy, etc) kind of make it ludicrous. The Garden of Eden, if it was an actual place, would exist somewhere in Africa if it were to be the origin of the human race, the island of Avalon is a legend only in the British isles (which is on the opposite side of the globe), and Troy's ruins are well established in northwestern Turkey. The Garden of the Hesperides is slightly more realistic because it was said to be to the far west across the water, but that would be west, not east: if you were sailing west from Greece you'd run into the Americas before you ever got to the Pacific, much less Indonesia.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mythical?</span></h2>
<p>Why is Atlantis described to be a "mythical" island? If it was real, it was not mythical. If it was an invention, it was not mythical either, since an invention is no real myth. I only agree that Atlantis "became" a myth during the centuries, but originally it was no myth. Do you agree? --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 21:39, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's typical to speak of Plato's myths, like the Myth of Er. He (through Socrates) speaks about the purpose of these invented myths in the <i>Timaeus</i>. Scholars talk about the Atlantis story as one of these myths (e.g., Vidal-Naquet, "Athenes et l'Atlantide: Structure et signification d'un mythe platonicien," <i>Revue des Etudes grecques</i> 77 (1964): 420-444.) So I don't think calling the island "mythical" is wrong either for Plato's invention or for the the later history of Atlantis. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:16, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not valid to call a "platonic myth" just a "myth". A "platonic myth" is a "platonic myth", and not a "myth". There is a vast difference between an invented story, whose inventor is known, whose intention is known, and - on the other hand - a traditional story deriving from ancient times. So if we would accept, that it is an invention by Plato, we should not just call it a "myth". - Secondly, we cannot be sure, that it is a platonic myth, i.e. a platonic invention. What, if there is a historical kernel in the story? Let's take an example: Is the war of Troy a myth? What Homerus made of it - surely. But if a war of Troy really happend, is it a myth? No, it is reality. Is Troy itself a myth? No, it is reality. So it is wrong to call Atlantis just a "myth", independently of whether you think it is an invention or reality. Terribly wrong. --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 22:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of how you feel about this, it is fairly normal to speak of Plato's inventions as myths. See, for instance, <a href="http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780192805089" class="external text" title="http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780192805089" rel="nofollow">this collection of Plato's Myths</a> published by Oxford University Press. Or do a Google search for "Myth of Er".</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I'm pretty sure Plato refers to his inventions as <i>muthoi</i> (near the beginning of the <i>Timaeus</i>, I think). So it's true both to Plato and to modern scholarship to call Atlantis "mythical". <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 22:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. First: In Plato's dialogues Atlantis is called to be not "mythos" but "logos". Of course it still could be an invention by Plato, but we have to take into account, that it is called clearly to be a "logos". Secondly: I described already the difference between a "myth in general" and a "platonic myth". I emphasize this: A "myth in general" is a story, derived from ancient times, with a long history of tradition, of which the author usually is not known. A "platonic" myth is a fully artificial story, the author ist known, the purpose is known etc. etc. - these are totally different things, and it is the duty of Wikipedia to make it clear to the readers, that Atlantis has nothing to do with a "myth in general meaning". --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 10:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the word "mythical" really meant just "a traditional story deriving from ancient times", then I'd agree. But that's simply not the case. Alternative meanings include:

<p>I am not at all happy with these definitions. Then every uncertain thing and every imagination is a myth. This is not a wise definition of "myth" one can clearly see. What do you think of at first if you hear "myth"? You do not think at all of an artificial story, but of something old with uncertain roots. Let us search compromises: What about using "artificial myth" or "platonic myth" to point out, that it is not a myth in general meaning? --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 16:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, whether you're happy with the definitions or not, they reflect common usage. Your claims about what one thinks when they read the term "mythical" are really just your own intuitions and frankly have nothing to do with my own reaction. I know what is meant by calling Atlantis "mythical" and dictionaries suggest that I'm not alone in my interpretation. On the other hand, I don't know what "artificial myth" means and "platonic myth" is more likely to confuse than to clarify.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any particular reason to object to the word "mythical", aside from personal preference.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 18:00, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>regardless of your personal objections, Atlantis is a myth, by the ordinary definition of the word and by the usage of Platonic scholars.</dd>

<dd>Might I suggest that we're spending a lot of effort discussing the use of one word in the article, and that we might better spend this effort on improving the body of the article? For instance, Athenaios, you think that the article needs to have Vidal-Naquet's viewpoint included. Why don't we work on that instead--seems like a better thing to be doing rather than arguing over whether we should use "mythical" in one sentence. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I really wonder about your perception of the word "mythical". Maybe it is a difference between German and English language. In German you would never define "mythical"/"mythisch" as you do it. Calling Atlantis "mythical" makes it equal to biblical creation stories or something like that, but indeed, the Atlantis story is clearly something very different to that. I hope we can agree on the level of the definition, if not on the level of words. --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 19:04, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really care about the definition of myth. All that matters here is that scholars usually refer to Atlantis as a myth; Wikipedia's role is to report the views of authoritative sources, not to establish the absolute truth. Here's an excerpt from a reliable source:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"There are then three rules for the historian who wishes to understand the <b>myth</b> of Atlantis. He must not sunder the two cities that Plato has linked so closely together. He must constantly refer himself to the physics of the <i>Timaeus</i>. And consequently, he must relate the historical <b>myth</b> whose structure he is trying to explain to Plato's "idealism." The success of a properly historical interpretation depends entirely upon the extent to which this preliminary task is performed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Although for Plato it is proto-Athens that is the paradigm, Atlantis has attracted enormously greater attention thanks to the simultaneously circumstantial and imaginative character of the <b>myth.</b>" (emphasis mine. This quote is from Pierre Vidal-Naquet, "Athens and Atlantis: Structure and Meaning of a Platonic <b>Myth</b>," in <i>The Black Hunter</i>, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986, p. 264.

Also, many people who come to this page will have no idea who Plato was, so it is not very helpful for many Wikipedia users to describe Atlantis as "Plato's island" in the disambiguation line. On the other hand, "mythical island" means something most users will understand. And at any rate, Plato is mentioned in the second sentence of the article; do you really think people are unable to read that far? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 20:09, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The agenda behind ...</span></h3>
<p>One last time: The English word "mythical" does not always mean "comes from a myth". Wikipedia's definition of "myth" is not particularly relevant here, since "mythical" has well-established meanings including "fanciful" or "imaginary". These meanings are perfectly standard and acceptable. Let us leave the article as it is, since acknowledging the fictional character of Atlantis is perfectly appropriate (and substituting "fictional" for "mythical" would not convey the same meaning). <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 21:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, now you show what you really think, we come to the nitty gritty: The real reason, why you want to keep the word "myth" is not, that you consider Atlantis to be a myth in the sense of "comes from a myth", but you simply consider it to be not true! This means, you want to imply from the beginning by using the word "myth", that Atlantis is an invention made by Plato. You reject <i>a priori</i> the possibility, that the Atlantis story is based on history. Again I have to disagree: This question is an open question.

<p>The view that Plato's Atlantis is an invention (though one that perhaps draws upon historical events) is the standard one in classical scholarship. It's a pretty good "agenda" to represent mainstream scholarly opinion.</p>
<p>And note, Athenaios, calling Atlantis a myth does not eliminate the possibility that it's based upon historical events. This is the difference that Phiwum sees between "fictional" and "mythical"--"fictional" means that it's an invention like Islandia or Erewhon, "mythical" means that there may be a core of history in Plato's depiction of Atlantis.</p>
<p>If you think Zangger's work is so important, why don't you work on including his views in the article? I think that would be more profitable for us all, rather than continuing this discussion. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 17:55, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you Phiwum and Akhilleus, that you made clear your opinion, that the article should be based on the mainstream in classical scholarship, which means considering Atlantis an invention of Plato. This is your agenda. --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 18:59, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, whatever. Golly, you found us out. Anyway, you still seem to think that if Atlantis didn't exist, then Plato must have invented it. That's a false dichotomy. Plato may well have been reporting what he believed to be true. Hence use of the term "mythical".<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 07:24, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No no, also in this case, it is not valid to talk of a myth. But let's stop the discussion, I simply surrender, since the case seems to be not suitable to find consensus, ok? --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaios_8f5a.html" title="User:Athenaios">Athenaios</a> 12:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atlanteans</span></h2>
<p>Atlanteans have a power source of some kind that keeps them alive. Each Atlantean has a crystal that keeps him or her alive for thousands of years. Each time there is a disaster the power source will choose a person of royal blood to protect it. The Atlanteans also have a religon with many gods and a language. They combine different languages from England to Afracia. Sort of like the tower of bable. The Atlanteans have a writing that they can't read because the knolage was lost when the sea swalowed the City of Atlantis. Alot of this information was writen in a book called the shepords journal. It is one of the only books that have not been copied. This book is found in Iceland. The Atlanteans were so greedy that thier gods punished them by swalowing them in the ocean over 11,000 years ago. Fact, or Fony? We night not ever know. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.27.164.163 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.27.164.163_bf1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.27.164.163">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
