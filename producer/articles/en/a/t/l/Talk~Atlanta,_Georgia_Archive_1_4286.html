<p>In reviewing this page, I realize it is in need of better organization. A quick glance at the table of contents reveals both <i>City attractions</i> and <i>Major attractions</i> sections. The City attractions section contains significant info on businesses, yet there is a <i>Businesses</i> section as well. I know there other who watch this page, so I wanted to get some input before doing something dramatic.</p>

<p><br />
I believe you are mistaken in the meaning of the claim. It may be used as boosterism by some, but to others it has exactly the opposite import. Environmental organizations in Atlanta use it to provoke alarm, at the high rate of expansion of developed areas at the expense of open space. For them, the fastest-expanding human settlement in history is something to be worried at or ashamed of, not proud of. I disagree that CNN and the AJC are incapable of presenting a fact about Atlanta honestly just because they are based in Atlanta (they merely have a greater incentive to care, one way or the other); on the other hand, I think the fact is impossible to know or prove, and must in any case be clarified. (I believe the claim refers to consumption of open space in absolute area, over a period of three decades. But <i>at best</i> it was only an estimate. The records for historic settlements are hardly definitive.) Leaving it here (or in metro Atlanta) would be fine <i>with the attribution</i>. That is a good deal better than the “some say” formula that prevails in the rest of the encyclopedia.<br />

<dd>I agree the claim is almost impossible to substantiate. It should be in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_metropolitan_area.html" title="Atlanta metropolitan area">Atlanta metropolitan area</a> if anywhere; the City of Atlanta proper has not expanded appreciately in land area (would require annexations) in the last ten years at least. The city has also just recorded its first population increase (year over year) in several years as well. I honestly don't know that it's worthy of inclusion even as an attribution. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger">Autiger</a> 20:17, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MARTA</span></h2>
<p>The new transportation section says 'However, the public transportation in Atlanta is seen by many residents as unreliable and not comprehensive enough, so many commuters in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs use automobiles as their primary mode of transportation.' I wonder about this, as it has a hint of NPOV about it, and it doesn't quite match my experience.</p>
<p>I'm a Brit who for some years worked for a high tech company HQed in Atlanta. As a consequence I was a frequent visitor, and a reasonable frequent user of MARTA (it really is the best way from Hartsfield to Sandy Springs). My experience of MARTA is that it is actually pretty reliable and comprehensive, although the frequencies of both rail and bus could be better and the bus obviously gets impacted by traffic delays. My experience of discussing MARTA with my Atlanta based colleagues was that very few of them knew enough about the subject to make a judgement on reliability or comprehensiveness; many had never ridden MARTA despite having lived in Atlanta for long periods. My conclusion was that the lack of ridership was more a socio-economic thing rather than a usability thing. All of this is a bit too much like 'original research' to include in the article; but what do other contributors think. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 13:34, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Concur, though I think you meant a hint of POV, and I was planning to revise the new addition after seeing it. At best, it's a gross over-simplification and somewhat inaccurate rendering of MARTA's condition/perception. The writer's proposition (that commuters use cars because of the perception) is not supportable as a direct cause and effect. MARTA rail's issues are directly related to historical factors such as low densities, Georgia tranporation funding limitations, and "white-flight" suburbs rejecting the system at it's origin. Automobile preference is related to the sprawl (low-density), and as you indicate, socio-economic perceptions. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger">Autiger</a> 16:55, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, after rereading what I wrote, I agree with Chris. I went back and removed the reference to reliability and usability. <a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayeth_39df.html" title="User:Sayeth">Sayeth</a> 18:05, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>However, in a way, MARTA is still a little unreliable. I am a high school student in Atlanta that uses MARTA almost daily for normal things. I use the train more than the bus, and I have to say that the trains are not that reliable. I have had the Train Driver during many of my rides over-shoot the station. This delayed my ride by at least 10-20 minutes as the driver walked through the train to the other end to drive it back the way it came. This also caused a ripple effect. I have also had the doors jam many times, causing 5-10 minute delays; and I have waited up to 45 minutes for a late train. I love MARTA, but it does need some help. But as far as the track layouts go, I enjoy them. I can get from my house(Midtown) and meet up with them at Lenox Mall in no time. I also enjoy the Grant Park, Candler Park, and Inman Park stations very much. Downtown Atlanta is my life. But as far as it goes, MARTA is useful. (Chris Cruz)</dd>

<li>Well, let me explain something. Study the history of the <b>Atlanta</b> re-direct. For a long time, it was simply a re-direct. Then one day very recently, somebody removed the re-direct and created a 2-choice dis-ambiguation page, one of its choices was this page itself, the other of which is an article that he created that is orphaned. This is a good advantage of having this article at <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> because then the user who created the article would have known that the link belongs in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Atlanta (disambiguation)">Atlanta (disambiguation)</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 22:49, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

Furthermore, you still have not explained why Atlanta should belong to Atlanta, Georgia instead of simply belonging to the general disambiguation page. Your reasoning isn't justified when you consider the fact that there are other items of interest to the wikipedia community that share the same name. You seem to be ignoring this point. I say put it all in the disambiguation page, without giving special attention to any particular "Atlanta", and let the person accessing wikipedia decide where (s)he wants to go. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYafuetodo_348f.html" title="User:Yafuetodo">Yafuetodo</a> 3:19, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the mass edit was more than justified although i probably took out a bit too much but I will leave it until we have some more opinions here. Have you actually read the lead sections - its ridiculously long and absolutely untypical for the lead section of a city article or for a lead section in general. It is certainly not just "slightly long" - six long paragraphs for a lead sections is not normal for wikipedia (for a good reason). Also it is extremely <b>repetitive</b>; half of it is devoted to the city's history, which is covered in the History section right below the lead section. Look at the first sentence of the second paragraph in the lead section compared to the first sentence in the History section.
<dl>
<dd><b>Lead section, second paragraph</b>- <i>The Atlanta area was originally inhabited by Cherokee and Creek Indians, and was named Standing Peachtree. In 1823, the area was opened to white settlement. It remained mostly woods until 1836, when the area was chosen as the southern "Terminus"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>History section</b>- <i>The region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally Creek and Cherokee Native American territory. In 1835, leaders of the Cherokee nation ceded their land to the government in exchange for land out west under the Treaty of New Echota, and act that eventually led to the Trail of Tears. In 1836 the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad to provide a trade route to the Midwest, with the area around Atlanta--then called Terminus--serving as the terminal.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Almost all of the facts in the extremely long lead section - beyond the first paragraph that is - could be added to other sections or are already mentioned. It really hurts the article and makes it quite unattractive and somebody who contributes here regurlarly needs to edit it extensively.I still beleive extensive editing of the lead section is neccesary and needs to be carried out to bring that section up to a higher standard. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikostar_a858.html" title="User:Nikostar">Nikostar</a> 02:09, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. If you read something like a World Book Encyclopedia article, there is an emphasis on history and population. Let's face it, some people are full of themselves and like bluster, hip-hop, modern marketing, etc. Yet, isn't this supposed to be an "encyclopedia?" Also, if you don't put some history at the top, most people won't read it. As for the repetition, Wikipedia has plenty of space...this is not a problem. Further, a lack of history was one of the criticisms levelled at the "lead article" nomination. Finally, some people think Atlanta "emerged" in just the last 40 years; this type of thinking is a problem and unfounded. There is little more important about a city than history and population. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 08:31, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lead sections are going to be proportional to the article length and Atlanta is a pretty long article (with good reason) and with long articles, are <i>necessarily</i> going to be repetitive. The lead needs to hit the highlights of the article such that it may stand alone as a summary giving the most important points for a casual reader. The remainder of the article goes into further detail with sections that can even point to stand-alone article for full treatment of certain subjects for the truly geeky. It's a heirarchy of information. I understand Nikostar's position and agree the lead section as it is now should be reigned in - I've been looking at it off and on since Niko posted the comment with an eye towards tightening it up a bit, but it's a challenging balancing act. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 21:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Atlanta is circled by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_285.html" title="Interstate 285">Interstate 285</a>, called the "Perimeter" by locals, which has come to delineate the interior of the city from the surrounding suburbs. This has given rise to the terms ITP (inside the Perimeter) and OTP (outside the Perimeter) to describe area neighborhoods, residents, and businesses. In this respect, the Perimeter plays a social and geographical role similar to that of the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Beltway_bb1b.html" title="Capital Beltway">Capital Beltway</a> around <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>.</i></dd>

<dd><i>It is fairly common, although by no means universal, among some residents of the city to make concerted efforts to stay "ITP" in daily life.

There is a sometimes considerable friction between the area including the city of Atlanta, and other "ITP" communties with their their majority black populations, as well as considerable gay populations, from the mostly white and far more conservative suburbs.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>None of that is POV. That's simply terminology used in Atlanta. If one was to remove all terminology deemed offensive by some, then a good portion of wikipedia would become useless.

<dd>The article needs to be balanced. Your removing negative but true facts is papering over the truth. No statistics are 100% accurate, but certainly the FBI is a reputable source. Also, the withdrawing of "crime index scores" still doesn't change the fact that any way you measure it, Atlanta's crime rate is much higher than the U.S. average. Picking and choosing sourcing is BIASED. Yes, look in the mirror. What a hypocrite to dress someone down for using FBI stats. 66.64.156.146 05:38, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the one using the most current FBI stats and statements as a source. You're completely ignoring the FBI statement I reference above - the FBI are saying that the former crime index is <b>not an accurate measure</b> and is a <b>biased</b> tool. The comparison you insist on having the article is ridiculous on its face - the crime index score implies that Atlanta's crime is twice is bad as New Orleans' which is crazy. The only reason to include that is to paint Atlanta in a negative light. To continue to use a metric whose creator has disavowed and refuted the metric is intellectually dishonest. Feel free to use the raw UCR numbers for select violent crimes, but don't use the flawed and abandoned metric.</p>
<p>Btw, you added back the completely unverifiable speculation about the Olympics selection process; how do you justify that?</p>

<dd>This is a case where you think you're right, but you're wrong. First, you selectively choose to attack numbers and sources you don't like. Yet, do you think the Atlanta crime stats from the city of Atlanta are 100% accurate? Interesting, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently discovered 208 falsely registered voters at just one homeless shelter. Yet, do I see you disputing the vote count numbers? It would be very easily to selectively not report or under-report crimes that occurred. We can't make things 100% accurate. What we can do, however, is cite sources, and whether you agree or not, the stats were properly cited by reputable sources. As for the metric, I wasn't concerned about that. Instead, I was concerned that you are "throwing the baby out with the bath water."</dd>

<p>I did source (directly from the FBI website) the retirement of "Crime Index" based on its flawed nature. As for you not being concerned with the validity of the metric? Don't you think accuracy is important in an encyclopedia? I think you may have missed the point completely.</p>
<p>Your voter registration comment is an awfully poor analogy considering the Atlanta Police Department doesn't handle voter registration, not to mention I don't recall seeing any voter counts in the article to challenge. If there were and the Fulton County Registrar subsequently came out and said the numbers were wrong, we would change the article to reflect that statement. Finally, even if your argument that the Atlanta PD numbers are questionable were valid, it subverts the very metric you want to include because the Crime Index is based on the APD-reported UCR numbers and if those underlying numbers are inaccurate then the derived index cannot be accurate either.</p>
<p>Beyond my accurately sourced deletion of the crime index, there's nothing for me to source, because the onus is not on me to prove that a statement is unverifiable if it is speculative in its very nature. There is still no verification of this statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The high crime rate has also negatively affected Atlanta at the International level, where crime statistics were among the greatest factors in the possibility of the International Olympic Committee awarding the 1996 Olympic Games to a safer host city in the early 1990's.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no way to know what factors were in the minds of the IOC voters in the selection process; even journalistic coverage of the voting that claimed to know the factors of a <i>possibility</i> would be speculative. That statement (and its verification) is the lynchpin for the rest, because the Andrew Young and African nation voting block statement (and cite) is completely off-topic in a "Crime" section and would (should) not be included if not for statement saying crime almost cost Atlanta the Olympics. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 06:30, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
<p>Stop trying to make Atlanta seem as a chilly city. And the analogy of Dallas is false both cities expierence extreme variation of temperature making those two impossible to compare but to say their climates in winter are similar. As long as the article stands you will be ridiculed. And 100 degrees reading have happened past 2000, check the noaa almanac you'll find more than 4 readings. and a sum of the summer time avg. temperate of 86 is misrepresentful we all live in Atlanta and we know thats not true especiallyin the outlying areas where the temp shoots over 90 nearly everyday. Several corrections, if you want it to be like britanica. You can't make Atlanta seem like the San Diego of the South when in true fact its not. Oh and one more thing why are you puting the snowfall measurement in metrics first? So it seems like a larger amount. Tell the truth and you know snow hereis rare, I am originally from Bedford, TX and Atlanta's not the cold place you make it out to be. The winters are very mild compared to most of the Dallas Metroplex, true Atlanta's summers are milder but with that humidity it feels worse here.</p>
<p>---Living in the Dallas area now (and having spent many years in Marietta as well), I can say that the temperature records in Atlanta are definetly colder than Dallas. It almost never gets below 10°F in Dallas, but single digits are AT LEAST a once annual occurrence in Atlanta. And Atlanta experiences more ice and snow than Dallas, not just because of temperature, but because it is further east and experiences more precipitation year round than N. Texas.</p>

<p>I've lived in Atlanta for 20 years and I only remember the temperature dropping below 10 degrees two different times. That "fresh blanket of snow" was I think in January of 2001 and was the only 2+ inch snowfall from one storm that Atlanta has had in many years.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of putting a picture of Phoenix Arizona in an intense monsoon rain and labeling the picture "A typical rainy day in Phoenix"</p>
<p>And while it might be true that the summers here are RELATIVELY mild and not to humid compared to the rest of the south, they are still very hot by many people's standards.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Mafia</span></h3>
<p>The year was 1931, the bottom of the Great Depression in American. Things were bad for almost everyone. While the citizens wondered what they would eat the next day, the government wondered what they would do with the new problem, gangsters. And the gangsters seemed to be the only ones doing well. It was they who lived outside the law, thus were not hurt when the law gave up on America in 1929. From California to Chicago, the gangsters ruled with an iron fist. And in 1931, Atlanta, Georgia, almost came under complete mob control.</p>
<p>Since 1930, Irishman Mack Ashcroft was gaining control of Atlanta. He had started out as a petty thug and had climbed the ranks through blood and betrayal. Ashcroft’s name was feared through out the town but the mayor and the police force still had not submitted to him. But the Irish gangster had plans, big plans.</p>
<p>Ashcroft owned half of the pubs in Atlanta, four of the six well-to-do hotels, and all but one of the fine resturaunts. He knew how much he had and was willing to share the power with others. Phillip Carson operated the north side of town, Tony Bronx operated the downtown area and Caleb Yimmen oversaw the Southside. All three men were dangerous, and willing to submit to Ashcroft’s authority.</p>
<p>Then in February of 1930 Ashcroft called together his “three”. He introduced his big plan. It included purchasing the rest of the hotels and restaurants in Atlanta, the murder of a good cop, and the forced election of a corrupt official.</p>
<p>The major part of the plan was to obtain all the hotels and restruants in the city that Ashcroft did not already own. While this would be expensive, once it was acheved Ashcroft would have a major say in the city’s social life. The rest of the plan was pure politics. The mayoral race was comeing up and Ashcroft had found his canidate. The man was Jim Broth, the most corrupt politician in the city. And that was why he had won favor with the Irishman. On the other hand, not every official could be bought. Commissioner Tim Wayne would not be out of office for another year and he totally despised Ashcroft, so the mobster planned to dispose of him. Wayne and the current Mayor, John Bernstein, were the two major political figures who stood up against Ashcroft. Bernstein would loose the office and Wayne would be killed. On June 30th, the purchases, the murder, and the election were to take place, and one man, Mack Ashcroft would rule the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>Carson, Bronx, and Yimmen all agreed with the plan and started working on it. Anticipation grew and exciment rose to a fever pitch. Then on June 25th, Ashcroft’s body was found stuck in the sewer beneath City Hall. What the Irishman was doing there or who killed him still eludes historians today. But the important fact was that the leader was dead, and someone had to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p>One day after Ashcroft’s death, a gang war broke out in the city of Atlanta. Carson’s gang and Bronx’s engaged in a bloody dogfight that ended with both of the leaders’ deaths. Carson was found in a meat crate that had been shipped to Texas while Bronx was tied to his car while it plunged into the river. Yimmen on the other hand had decided to spend his time executing the “big plan.” While his lawyers were working out the hotel purchases, Yimmen and his men strolled up to Tim Wayne’s house. The gangster and his ten stooges came up to the suburban home. They knocked three times. The door opened. Yimmen and his men were blown away. One of Wayne’s men had caught wind of the plan and had warned his boss. So thirty officers were set up around the house while Wayne’s family escaped. Only one of Yimmen’s men survived but his boss was torn to pieces seconds after the door opened.</p>
<p>The next day, Jim Broth was soundly beaten in election and John Bernstein was reelected mayor. In a matter of days Atlanta’s fate was saved. All gangster threat was eliminated and a secure government was reinstated. All because a man’s body was found in the sewer.</p>
<p>Historians still wonder to this day who killed Ashcroft and why. Some speculate Yimmen planned it; others, suicide and a few claim that Ashcroft never really died but fled to Cuba, were he lived the rest of his life in peace. But it was ultimately not his life, but his death that had great affect on Atlanta. The city could have been like Chicago under Al Capone. But greed came in the way. Yimmen, Bronx and Carson all had enough to live, but wanted more, so they got death.</p>

<p>Atlanta has never been under mob control, especially in the depression era. Atlanta in those days was a city populated by half working-class residents who worked in the cities industries or picked cotton on the outskirts of town. The well established residents had profitable local buisnesses. The only mob affialation with Atlanta if any at all was perhaps the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Federal_Prison_eaff.html" title="Atlanta Federal Prison">Atlanta Federal Prison</a>. Where Al Capone was imprisoned. The Irish did not have a significant ancestry population in Atlanta until present-day, unless your referring to those in the Mountains. Atlanta was hit extremely hard by the Depression, and at the time there were no Pubs in Atlanta, infact a Pub was unheard of. Rumrunners and moonshiners were the only means of transporting alcohol to area because the city of Atlanta had been dry until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. There was no reason to establish a organized crime ring in Atlanta. The city was dominated by Dixiecrats and extreme conservatism. The only type of organized crime ever established was perhaps the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and their relations with political leaders of the day. Also, Italian and Irish americans were hated by the local residents, infact Fulton County tried to establish laws segregating those of non-Germanic European Descent (aimed to protect the Anglo-Saxon identity of the region).</p>

It really should only contain one or two nicknames that are very commonly used, and even "officially" referenced by the city council or convention &amp; visitors' bureau. Nicknames that are briefly coined in a newspaper or personal website should generally be avoided, unless they become very widely used.</dd>

<dd>I removed 'The Horizon City' from the infobox, and I also added a brief statement on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colloquialism.html" title="Colloquialism">colloquialisms</a> to the introduction, for mention of some of the names that people may have for the city but aren't necessarily 'official'. Currently, 'A-Town' and 'The ATL' are here. The <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico_7a09.html" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> articles have such a reference, and it seems to have cut down on a lot of the abuse to the nicknames field in the infobox. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 04:05, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Virtual Tours</span></h2>
<p>I keep posting an external link to a general, voice-narrated virtual tour of Atlanta. Every time I do, somebody removes the link. The virtual tour that was posted does contain various ads cycling through a seperate window on the media player, so I hope this isn't the reason the link is being removed. After all, click on the Yahoo Maps link and you'll see ads. Even the Chamber of Commerce link leads people to the names and contact info for commercial businesses. The virtual tour is relevant, informative and offers this page content it otherwise does not have - something interactive. So, why is the virtual tour link being removed time and time again? Bueller... Bueller...</p>
