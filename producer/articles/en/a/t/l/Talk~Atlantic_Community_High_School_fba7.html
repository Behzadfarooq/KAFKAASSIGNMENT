<p>Hello all, and thank you for contributing to this school site. I'm part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_Assessment_4157.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools/Assessment">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Schools/Assessment</a> team, and I'm reviewing this page.

<p>My reasoning is as follows: more refs useful and some pics. Refs required to get B status. More alumni to get mid. Welcome to schools <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictuallers_dc4b.html" title="User:Victuallers">Victuallers</a> 14:16, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How useful is the new "Band" section? Is the band an major part of the culture of the place? If this section is retained, it needs a lot of work to better describe its relevance, the bands history, and recent upheavals &amp; achievements. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">Jayvdb</a> 03:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Jayvdb regarding the "Band" section. It is fairly incoherent with redundant content and very little depth, development, and insight. Also, as a former IB graduate (and band member) of ACHS, I am appalled at the quality of this wiki entry in general. As a response to Jayvdb, in my time of 1995-1999, the band was indeed a major part of this school's culture, with a quarter of the student body being member. ACHS attracted and retained a number of high-caliber musicians by virtue of its existing high-caliber band plus the IB magnet program. It appears that a lot has changed in the band program since then -- the band (marching/wind ensemble) has a LONG history of "straight superiors" which makes me wonder what happened to warrant this new boast of "superior" status. Please describe the downfall of this band, when, and how. I edited the Colleges section to remove misleading information. Most significantly, I changed "colleges which are known to accept many Atlantic students..." to "graduates have matriculated at many top-tier and state universities..." Notice the position of "many" in the two versions. 206.148.32.200 05:30, 8 June 2006 (UTC) by priestess[at gmail]</p>

<dd>As a 2006 ACHS band graduate, I have to say that the band program has lost a great deal of its prestige from those years, and certainly is not well-known as a "straight superior" band. That said, I too am embarrassed by this article, and I'm going to try to clean it up as much as I can. Nevertheless, I think that "Band" is not significant enough — and certainly doesn't pass my "encyclopedic merit" standards — to be included here. (Neither, I think, does the factoid about Dr. Weigel's sister.) <a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMJSkia1_226c.html" title="User:MJSkia1">MJSkia1</a> 17:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also of interest is that the former IB director, Ms. Hubert, was a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader. 206.148.32.200 05:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC) by priestess[at gmail]</p>

<li>If you can provide some corroborating evidence on this subject, by all means add it to the trivia section of the article. I attended Atlantic but we only ever had Youngman as IB coordinator.</li>

<p>I hope that you agree with the changes I've made here. Some of my rationales:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to see the statistics on enrollment—I'd be quite surprised to hear that current enrollment is less than 2000.</li>
<li>Reorganization and rewrite for clarity.</li>
<li>I deleted the "colleges" section because I didn't see that in other high-school articles.</li>
<li><b>Band:</b> I decided to encyclopedize this and make it seem more notable. I know that there's more than this, but I couldn't remember specific dates for anything else.</li>
<li><b>Trivia:</b> So I changed my mind. Big deal.</li>
<li>I made it a stub because I think there's still a lot more to be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>A to-do:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>History:</b> I would <i>really</i> like some more information on the school's history. With over fifty years of it, there's bound to be something good.</li>
<li><b>Athletics</b> and <b>Other programs</b> need more info—anyone willing to help?</li>
<li><b>Band:</b> Need dates for other noteworthy performances (such as Aloha Bowl).</li>
<li>Whatever else you think is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, one quick poll: do you think I should include major school controversies and "embarrassing" incidents? I mean, ideally I should, but as I can't think of positive events quite so readily, I would be hesitant to add those sorts of things. Skirting POV? Perhaps. Let me know what you think. —<a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMJSkia1_226c.html" title="User:MJSkia1">MJSkia1</a> 15:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC), edited 19:07, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Atlantic Community High School" is technically the school's official name. I'm sure that I could do a cut-and-paste hack job, but I want to make sure the talk page comes along too.
