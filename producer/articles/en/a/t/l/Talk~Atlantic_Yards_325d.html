<p>I did a major rewrite of the article, but then immediately reverted it realizing how this is a very controversial project. You can see it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantic_Yards&amp;oldid=94838177" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantic_Yards&amp;oldid=94838177" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The main points of the rewrite is to change the focus on the article from the public opinion surrounding the project to the actual project itself. I know that the opinions are an important part of the project, but should not be the bulk of the article. I made a new article, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Yards_public_opinion_fa02.html" title="Atlantic Yards public opinion">Atlantic Yards public opinion</a>, to serve that purpose. I also made an additional article, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Terminal_Urban_Renewal_Area_3b9e.html" title="Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area">Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area</a>, about the history of the area, before and during the Atlantic Yards plans were made public. I also think a <a href="../../../d/e/v/Develop_Don%27t_Destroy_Brooklyn_7577.html" title="Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn">Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn</a> article should be made, as they have been a major driving force in the public opinion against the project. Looking forward to your opinions on how we should reshape the article. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 05:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Yards_public_opinion_fa02.html" title="Atlantic Yards public opinion">Atlantic Yards public opinion</a> definitely has enough for its own article. But then I see statements like this from <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Nets_Arena_2b54.html" title="Brooklyn Nets Arena">Brooklyn Nets Arena</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Supporters of the project often cite the promise that 50% of the 4,500 apartments will be low-income. A few days after announcing that figure, the number of apartments was raised to 7,300, and the definition of "moderate income" was set at $109,000 per year. The average income in Brooklyn is $35,000, and the number of apartments that will supposedly be available for residents who make less than that will be 900. Of those 900, many of them will not be on the main Atlanitc Yards site, thus segregating the new residents by income. City Councilmember Charles Barron has asserted that the project will be "instant gentrification.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>...and I'm tempted to put it in the housing section of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Yards_bf18.html" title="Atlantic Yards">Atlantic Yards</a>. That's part of the problem - a lot of the plan is still in flux, and public opinion may change with it.

<dd>The opinion part of the Nets Arena article can be tackled next. The immediate item to be worked on is certainly this article since it lacked organization and intertwined fact and opinion. I switched it back to my rewrite, but feel free to continue discussion and changes. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 16:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "major rewrite" removed much objective information. I have made some quick changes, but the differences need to be closely looked at to arrive at a complete, accurate, objective article. Tommyill 01:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the author of the rewrite, I appreciate your input. As I continue to stress, the article should be about the development, and not about controversy surrounding it. Please continue to make changes and add comments, as long as the article is about the <i>Atlantic Yards</i>, and not the <i>Atlantic Yards Controversy</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 15:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comments from BrooklynWiki dated 12/26/06: I did a lot of work on this page, and I came back to it to find that it was basically rewritten by what looks to me like a publicist for the developer. The article now looks like an advertisement for the project. I am a partisan in this fight, and I admit that I think it should not be built, but I have tried to be fair, and the recent edits show no such concerns.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did the rewrite, and my goal was not to make it look like an advertisement. In fact, I don't think it is. The article was very sloppy with little organization, with a very strong anti-development slant. The article is about the proposed development. It is not about a fight to keep it from happening (although that is one element of the story of the Atlantic Yards). I just edited it to <b>clearly</b> describe what Ratner plans on putting there, and what land is to be used, including the Vanderbilt Yards and the properties which they want to buy out or use emminent domain on. This article, as I continue to say is about the Atlantic Yards and not the Atlantic Yards Controversy. In the event that the Atlantic Yards isn't built, then the focus of the article could be more about the community groups that stopped it. The article should be about the facts, with opinion taking up only a small percentage of it. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 16:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is incorrect to emphasize the 1/3 of the proposed site that is comprised of the railyards. This is consistent with the developer's misrepresentation of the neighborhood. It is more accurate to emphasize the remaining 2/3s of the project area. To overemphaize the smaller part sounds partisan, whether or not that is your intention. Even supporters of the project differ in their representation of the area. I've heard Bertha Lewis describe the area as gentrified and then Stuckey describe it as blighted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.162.229.11 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.162.229.11.html" title="User talk:207.162.229.11">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.162.229.11_8a58.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.162.229.11">contribs</a>) 20:37, 26 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I don't want to put the name and address of the condo pictured because there has been too much emphasis on this remaining resident's personality. There are other individuals and businesses that are suing the ESDC over their use of eminent domain, but this building is striking both because it was recently renovated (which I believe disproves the developer's argument that the area is blighted) and because the property would sit at center court of the proposed arena, assuming the developer wins the eminent domain case. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.162.229.11 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.162.229.11.html" title="User talk:207.162.229.11">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.162.229.11_8a58.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.162.229.11">contribs</a>) 21:09, 26 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news service. If the person who lives there has been making a big deal about losing their building, that should be noted, otherwise, it shouldn't be mentioned at all. Also, proper citation is needed that the particular building, and not the yards is the site of the arena. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 21:26, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The lawsuit section is too long, and merely a cut and paste of the legal argument.
