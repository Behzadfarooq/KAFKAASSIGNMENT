The only difference I can see is that giving two links provides the reader with a pointless link to the state. Personally I'm a strong advocate of <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_only_links_relevant_to_the_context_57f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context">making links that are relevant to the context</a>. That Apple is based in Cupertino is relevant. That it is therefore also based in California doesn't seem to be. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:25, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a pointless link, it's a link to the state, and the user can <b>choose</b> whether they'd like to browse their way specifically to Cupertino or to the larger topic of California. Given that somebody took the time to do it the more-difficult way, you should leave it that way.</dd>

<dd>Interesting approach. I cannot agree with the reasoning that, since someone spent time doing it "difficultly", we should therefore leave it alone; edits should be judged on their own merits, not the amount of effort somebody put into them. By the same token you're saying that my edit is inferior because it's "simpler". This criterion is not tenable.</dd>

<dd>Of course, the last thing I'm interested in is a discussion on whether there should be one link or two... There are more sensible ways to spend one's time.

<p>Thanks for reverting that. I was going to do it later, but was perhaps being overly cautious and left the anon a message on their talk page (does that even do anything for anons?) asking them to explain why. They seem new, so they might not know to fill in the reason box yet.</p>
<p>Looking at the image in question, it looks more chinese in style. It has the overall golden coloration that I find odd for Ukiyo-e...but I also agree the attribution says it comes from a site of Ukiyo-e images. Hopefully if the anon feels strongly about it being added again they can explain why it doesn't fit.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 17:49, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, assuming that they don't do something to change their IP address, anons can create user pages and can read what gets posted at the talk page associated with their current IP address. Whether an anon knows to read their pages is, of course, another question, but I think they get the same "You have new messages" message that registered users get when their personal talk pages are modified.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Right. That's all I ask for, and if a good reason is given, then I'll certainly assume that the editor knows more about the topic than I do (which, in this case, is <b>quite</b> likely). But simply coming along and doing a <i>drive-by deletion</i> from an article is a very common behavior of true vandals, so I mostly-always revert such things with the message that I posted. Serious editors simply come back and do it again, telling me why I'm wrong.&#160;:-) And that's fine by me.&#160;;-)</dd>

<dd>For what it is worth, I attempted to ask my old professor of Japanese Art History from college (whose dissertation was on Hokusai) about the image in question, but he has either retired or passed away. His colleage who responded to my email is a professor of Chinese Art, and said it looked Japanese to him but that it wasn't good enough quality for him to read who it was signed by. I guess my suspicion was unfounded, that the webpage it was found on was mislabeling it as Hokusai when it was Chinese in origin. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 14:53, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's jocular. Allegedly, the mutton or lamb harvested from the sheep that graze on those salt flats is, in fact, saltier ("pre-salted") compared to ordinary sheep. But feel free to revert me if you wish.</dd>

<dd>Indeed, one of the modern reasons for setting the sheep to graze in the salt marshes is for the flavour of the meat.

<dd>For once, I <b>didn't</b> have a dictionary handy (let alone the two or three that I often have at hand) so I polled Google and "woolen" won over "woollen", and also seemed to be the U.S.-biased version as compared to "woollen" which seemed to be U.K.-biased. But I don't feel strongly about this particular spelling in any case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And with regard to "nationalisation", as far as I'm concerned, you can have this whole country back, not that you're likely to want it in its current rather-damaged condition. I can learn to spell everything with an "s" instead of a "zed" or with that extra "u".&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Wow! Suddenly I feel old!&#160;:-) Just FYI, my first training on actual computer hardware was the TTL SSI ('TI '7400 logic) stuff embodying the <a href="../../../p/d/p/PDP-8_ceca.html" title="PDP-8">PDP-8</a>/I and 8/L (and pretty much the same generation of logic in the 8/E/F/M). But I did have some experience with the older discrete-transistor modules that we used for the "Straight 8" as well. (They were also very common in the older I/O adapters that were still interoperable with the 8/I and 8/E/F/M.) But if you start suggesting that I worked on <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_tube.html" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tube</a> computers, I may have to report you to the WikiPolice for civility violations&#160;;-). We had several big pieces of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whirlwind_%28computer%29.html" title="Whirlwind (computer)">Whirlwind</a> at Digital, a logic rack in the entrance to Building 10 at the Mill and a (4KW?) memory rack in Marlboro, but they were passe well before my time.</dd>

<p>Hi. As you probably have noticed, it has been suggested again to merge <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage_regulator.html" title="Voltage regulator">voltage regulator</a> with <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage_regulator_module.html" title="Voltage regulator module">voltage regulator module</a>. This time, I suggest to collect some opinions in the talk page before removing the merge tag (and possibly add a note in the pages saying what is the difference). Otherwise, it is likely that the merge will be proposed again. Do you agree? (you can answer here).

<p>I'm not entirely up on the rules of this, and given your apparently clean record compared to an unknown IP number you are probably in the right (certainly he/she has no right to call you a "vandal"), but what exactly is the big problem with the little link they keep adding to bottom the <i><a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">Mythology</a></i> article? <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 21:45, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>About a year ago you were part of a discussion about moving <a href="../../../p/d/p/PDP_d7a8.html" title="PDP">PDP</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmed_Data_Processor_e854.html" title="Programmed Data Processor">Programmed Data Processor</a> for disambiguation purposes. I've stumbled across a few more PDP terms, so have already put together a <a href="../../../p/d/p/PDP_%28disambiguation%29_ae12.html" title="PDP (disambiguation)">PDP (disambiguation)</a> page and cleaned up most of the PDP links already (see <a href="../../../p/d/p/Talk%7EPDP_ffd3.html#Disambiguation" title="Talk:PDP">Talk:PDP#Disambiguation</a>). However, since I'm a Wikipedia newbie, I can't move either the PDP page to Programmed Data Processor, nor the disambiguation page to PDP. Can you take a look and possibly help out?

<p>I have started a section on substation design and protection, and I would value your input on something. It is the Luton flashover and related matters.</p>
<p>The Luton flashover was interesting becuase what happened was that an arc from a HT conductor to earth occured. This short then caused circuit breakers to open becuase of the overcurrent. Too many protection devices were activated and then everything went to pot. The defense against such an overreaction in the event of such a fault which I was told about was that a substation has all 'earthed' metal work isolated from earth except for one cable which passes through a current transformer. If current is detected in the earth cable then the location of the fault is clear to the protection electronics. Hence with good design of the protection systems it is possible to open fewer circuit breakers then it would be otherwise. The problem is that I do not have the references to back up this design concept which I was told about some years ago by a substation expert.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 21:29, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but this is pretty far outside my area of expertise. I am pretty sure that American practise isn't as you describe, though. AFAIK, Most of our substations have some sort of ground-plane, but it tends to be actually buried in the soil/gravel under the substation and not isolated from it, so it has pretty good direct connectivity with the earth; as a result, you couldn't measure current flows through it to the ground. I think all of the station structural steel, equipment cases, external fencing, and such like is all tied to this common ground plane. But again, this is not an area I really know much about.</dd>

<p>Thanks for the concern. I thought of that myself, but I'd be willing to defend the user's actions as vandalism. He has been warned numerous times to discuss links before adding them, but simply persists in his actions without any explanation. He's been blocked once, but that doesn't stop him either. His site is relevant to the topic, but is a personal site with little to no (current) use as external reading for those articles. If he had shown any effort to defend his adding the link to several articles, the situation would be different. So far all he has commented on the matter is that he "does not consider it vandalism because it is relevant to the topic." As it is other administrators have reverted his addition and I have no qualms with calling his actions "simple vandalism" or at least stubborn, ignorant vandalism. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 19:12, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
