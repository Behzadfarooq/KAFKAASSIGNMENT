<p>To avoid flip-flopping between 'degree Fahrenheit' and 'Fahrenheit' or 'degree Celsius' and 'Celsius', I propose that we have a discussion on which we want. I see you have contributed on units of measurement, please express your opinion at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Units_of_measurement#Page_name_for_temperature_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Units_of_measurement#Page_name_for_temperature_articles" rel="nofollow">Talk:Units of measurement</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the invitation. I'd definitely like to see us standardize all our temperatures as "n°C (m°F)" and yes, I agree that the articles describing those units ought to be "Degree Celsius" and "Degree Fahrenheit". Now, any thoughts on the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a> article?&#160;;-)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your vote. Incidentally, your examples should really be "n °C (m °F)" if we follow the Wikipedia and ISO recommendation for a space between digit and unit symbol. As far as <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a> is concerned, I get the joke (i.e. 'degree' does not apply), which must make me a unit nerd. But that article may become <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin_scale.html" title="Kelvin scale">Kelvin scale</a> if we lose the vote. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 23:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"n °C (m °F)" -- that's one where I think the style guide is wrong as the (sort-of) superscripted degree symbol pretty clearly separates the number portion from the units portion. But I'm willing to go with the flow here.</dd>

<dd>I regard the space as a benefit, but only a minor one. It is well down on my list of things to worry about. But is a binary choice, so you will either annoy those that want a space, or annoy those that don't. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">User:Freakofnurture</a> even blocked me over it and resorted to swearing about it. See my talk page. I think it is wrong that some admins use blocking powers to get their own way. But there is nothing I can do about that. If I sound frustrated, it is because I am. Sigh. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 00:58, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(Without taking any side on your situation, I will observe that) At least two admins have had their sysop privileges revoked for using those privileges in content battles and more have been called to task. The Wiki Powers-that-Be definitely frown upon such shenanigans.

<p>Thank you for the information, I was wondering if there was an easier way to fix vandalism and hadn't gotten around to checking. Looking back though, it appears that I didn't actually revert any vandalism on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> got there a minute before I did. I already had the edit window open and consequently I didn't realize. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Lewk_1739.html" title="User:Sir Lewk">Lewk_of_Serthic</a> 00:56, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's how I knew the method you'd used&#160;;-). Because your edit differed by one blank line from the non-vandalized version, I knew you'd hand-edited it. Using the method I described, your "revert" would have been identical to <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a>'s version and the Wiki software would have simply ignored your saving of the page. It's very common that more than one person attempts to revert vandalism. If you're interested, after a revert, you can see if you "won" the revert race by looking at the article's history; you'll see who actually accomplished the revert first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A lot of us spend a lot of time dealing with vandalism, both by maintaining watch lists of articles we're especially interested in (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> is on mine) and by watching the "<a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Recent changes</a>" feature shown in the left-hand "navigation" area. It's amazing how many (apparent) kids have time to insert junk into articles!&#160;:-(</dd>

<p>Hi! You asked in an edit summary about the link in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainframe_computer.html" title="Mainframe computer">Mainframe computer</a>. I removed it because it was in the intro where it doesn't belong. Seems like you were moving the link to a better place at the same time. Wikipedia is supposed to show an "edit conflict" page when two edits happen simultaneously but I'm starting to suspect the conflict detection and the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">popups</a> tool don't work well together. The link indeed does have good info; of course it would be better to have any pertinent information in Wikipedia itself and not use Wikipedia as a link collection. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 14:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the explanation! And I think I agree with you that certain edits don't get the "conflict" warning; the other example I can think of was also a place where a manual edit conflicted with a reversion, but I don't know if "popups" was involved; if I get a chance and can remember, I'll go take a look.</dd>

<dd>You are correct and I apologize for falsely accusing you. I can't say for sure but I suppose that I clicked on the wrong entry in the article's history table after doing my revert. I've now put the warning in the correct place (and I see that you removed it from your "talk" page).</dd>

<p>Atlant, thanks again for the pointers. I'm thinking of updating some of the electronics articles with symbols (both American and European where they differ). I was reading the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Wikipedia%7EGraphics_tutorials_ac76.html" title="Wikipedia:Graphics tutorials">graphics tutorial</a> and it said .png is preferred. Ideally I'd want a vector format, but the only way I know to do that is with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Visio_07d6.html" title="Microsoft Visio">Visio</a>, and I <b>know</b> that's not an open format. The other question is whether filled-in or outlined diode triangles are preferred. Maybe I should just show both representations. -<a href="../../../w/0/l/User%7EW0lfie_34d4.html" title="User:W0lfie">W0lfie</a> 16:37, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think Wiki likes .<a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> for "political" reason; it's an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_software.html" title="Open software">open software</a> standard and isn't likely to be subject to any licensing hassles as time goes by (whereas .<a href="../../../g/i/f/GIF_95a6.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> and .<a href="../../../j/p/e/JPEG_907e.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> have been, at least for the software that creates them although not yet for the software (such as Wiki) that stores them). Also, .PNG is pretty good at seamlessly bridging the world of realistic photographic images that .JPEG does so well and the artificial images that .GIF does well, and a lot of people (though not all) have now installed browsers that support .PNG .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, Visio vector objects (or Adobe Illustrator vector objects, etc.) are fine for the creation of the objects, but they won't display in most browsers, so you need to render them out as something else that's more-commonly supported like .PNG or .GIF .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to open or closed diode bodies, I've seen both in schematics so I guess that argues for putting both in your drawings along with a caption that says that they're equivalent.</dd>

<p>Hi, I notice you revert my edit 'revert odd edit'. If you look at the page there are some problems. For example in the section of (design and manufanture) the 'pic' of the 3 minifigures hides or covers some of the words in the paragraph. Also in the ' Triva' section the number chart or 'Blocks/Configurations' overlaps the line of 'See also'. It doesn't matter if I use 3 different web browers or adjust the brower to fit. In other words it doesn't look very good. I hope you can see and understand what I am talking about. So if you know how to fix or clean the page. It would be great. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Atlant. I see that you have downcased my upcased '<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trisil.html" title="Trisil">Trisil</a>'. My reason for capitalising it was that it, like Transil, is a registered trademark. I found it in the European, UK and US patent office databases.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, you telling me that it's a registered trademark is sufficient, no worries&#160;;-)&#160;! The only thing I'll mention (and you may have already done this) is that if it is a trademark, make sure it's used like an adjective so that it modifies a noun. That is, use it similar to the following: "Transil diode".</dd>

<p>There are lots of web sites nagging us to use trademarks as adjectives, but even the owners of the trademarks don't follow their own advice. See the above-mentioned app note for starters. I stumbled on <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html" class="external text" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html" rel="nofollow">this rant</a> <i>against</i> the "noun modifier" rule, and it makes some good points. There is something fishy about the uniformity of all those nagging web pages, and I suspect that the rule was just made up by lawyers to keep themselves busy. Now it has become an internet <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a>. I prefer to ignore prescriptivism and write according to common usage, although I will respectfully bear your advice in mind. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 19:35, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

It can usually be done without making the writing sound too weird. But I'll try to remember to read the link you've provided -- thanks!</dd>

<p>Thank you for noting the POV statements made by Pollinator. I am not sure if you are speaking of the end of the section or the entire section itself, but I have tried my best to make the section a bit less biased and expand it a bit, but he keeps adding biased material to it and as a result it's actually -more- biased than when I first edited it.

<dd>Thanks for your kind words. I was speaking specifically of just the part I removed (paraphrase: "...whereas all those other religions and the godless atheists get to do whatever they want whenever they want, unlike we poor set-upon Christians"), but as you can probably tell, I'm rather jaundiced about the whole "Oh woe is us majority Christians" thing.

<p>I noticed your revision of my "messages and themes" section on <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a> and I didn't want to just revert your change without conversation. I wasn't implying that all of Dean's supporters are far-left, just that it was those supporters who were more radical (combined with his tenor) that led to centrists considering Dean to be a radical himself. I agree that my original phrasing made that unnecessarily vague, but your change removes the point I was trying to make (one which I think summarizes Dean's plight well). Can you think of phrasing that restores the point without the ambiguity of my language?</p>

<dd>Humo[u]r, in order to be funny, requires a certain subtle set-up. Cow #1 has it. The picture is simple and pastoral (it is, after all, a pasture) and the cow is placidly looking at the camera while impending doom descends on it from parts unknown. Picture #2 introduces too many confusing elements: too many cows (or cattle) and the user will spend too much time pondering what cow defecation has to do with cow tipping.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Trust me, picture #2 doesn't add to the quiet humor. And there are enough people who come along and try entirely edit-out the gag as it is; we don't need to assist them with a bunch of cow poop (whether real or just inferred).</dd>

<p>Is this the same thing as a back-to-back DC link/tie/intertie common between grids? I noticed this article on the request for photos and I was trying to figure out exactly what it is. I'm an EE, but i've only been on the generation side of things, so substations and DC links are a bit foreign to me. I should be able to find one of the ERCOT interties to take a picture of, if it is the same thing. --<a href="../../../w/0/l/User%7EW0lfie_34d4.html" title="User:W0lfie">W0lfie</a> 17:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're not really surprised are you? The question, of course, is what to do going forward. Me, given the fact that Wiki has, essentially, an infinite capacity for articles, I tend to oppose most calls for deletion of articles, whether about about minor websites or anything else, so it certainly doesn't seem to me like an AfD blitz is in order. To me, it would be far better to simply have our ducks in a row the next time someone puts up a lefty article beause the Wiki brownshirts will certainly only be emboldened by this episode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I think the whole "meatpuppets" thing is a stinking crock of shit. The idea that Wiki should run like some kind of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_chamber.html" title="Star chamber">star chamber</a> where the affected people have no right to come and voice their opinions is just wildly bogus to me, as is the idea that people can go around calling other people "meatpuppets" without immediately being considered to be in violation of <a href="../../../d/b/n/WP%7EDBN_b18e.html" title="WP:DBN">WP:DBN</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> but that's brownshirts for you: they love to cite the rules at you but they're not so keen on obeying the rules themselves.

<p>Yeah, parallel computing is usually done with many more than two. At least on a server level. So, the definition and page is a bit weak ... But; as I am quoting from memory, it would be a good idea to hunt for a whitepaper on it and add a reference. Are you up for it?</p>

In the distributed approach, we're often not looking for the ultimate in throughput, just looking for an elegant distribution of the computational responsibilites. For example, for my work life, I maintain a system that may contain between two and forty (or so) nodes and I certainly describe that as a "distributed system", even when it's configured in its measly two-node minimal configuration. The system was designed the way it was in order to achieve good real-time responsiveness, not to create high overall throughput.</dd>

<p>Hi Atlant,</p>
<p>I´m sure you will read this text in a minute or so.</p>
<p>I don´t know anything about you, just read this page, but as you removed a little thing I just added to the ´Hot tub´ page (and yes, it was a link to our company, but is this forbidden?), I think you can give me some explanation.</p>
<p>Was I violating any rule?</p>
<p>How did you come to the conclusion the link is Spamlink?</p>
<p>Why are the other two links allowed?</p>
<p>I don´t want to do anything anonymous, I want you to know who I am, without any hidden name. I don´t have any political message. Please reply to theo@illice-spas.com.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the invite, but they've now closed the discussion. My vote would obviously been "keep" which is, more-or-less, how it worked out anyway. George W. Bush remains a huge embarrassment for America and Americans, and his minions here on Wiki work very hard to hide that fact, but fact it remains, and I'm certain that the judgement of history will not fall lightly on Gee Dub.</dd>

<dd>Ahh, I see. having lost the previous vote, they've called for a new election. (Not unlike the way Bush was elected in the first place, ehh? Stop counting the ballots once they've won?). Okay, my vote is now cast, but please keep me apprised of the upcoming fourth, fifth, etc. votes for deletion.</dd>

<p>Thank you for your kind help on fighting vandalism, a critically important task here. It is obviously equally vital that we not bite the newcomers, and I am glad that you are looking out for that.</p>
<p>However, for the record, I feel it is right for me to vindicate myself in this instance.</p>
<p>As seen in the ip's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.221.88.5" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.221.88.5" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>, we have eighteen edits, none being helpful. "If the edit is clearly vandalism, consider using blatantvandal or starting with test2. For continuing severe vandalism, test3 may be skipped and a test4 given straight after a test2." from wp:vand. He/she was already issued warnings in this manner when I had to revert repeatedly.</p>
<p>I do apologize for the confusion. I realize I have not earned trust here yet, but looking at my contributions, you will see I have not shown "frustration" yet, on the contrary, I genuinely enjoy playing the friendly policeman. I always issue warnings before posting on wp:aiv, and I usually assume more good faith than I probably should! I was just bored of writing "rvv" all the time. Of course, I won't do that again. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFish_6175.html" title="User:MrFish"><font style="color:#7FFFD4;">MrFish</font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/r/f/User_talk%7EMrFish_4ffc.html" title="User talk:MrFish">Go Fish</a></sup> 15:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, I may have not communicated what I'd hoped! In no way was I accusing you of any of: vandalism, frustration, or any bad behavio[u]r. I was just giving you a gentle nudge to add templates when you could. Remember, the Wiki admins won't block an IP based on old warnings (such as the March 28 warning that was the most-recent for our vandal-under-discussion). So we have to add up-to-date warnings if we expect them to take action.</dd>

<p>Hi Atlant! I saw your edit summary ("<i>Revert; function main() is of type implicit integer and so must return a value to be valid</i>") on <a href="../../../c/_/p/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a> and the corresponding change. While I prefer your version for stylistic reasons, the C standard does <i>not</i> require a return from main(). See e.g. section 5.1.2.2.3 from the ANSI-99 standard: "<i>If the return type of the main function is a type compatible with int, a return from the initial call to the main function is equivalent to calling the exit function with the value returned by the main function as its argument;<b>reaching the } that terminates the main function returns a value of 0</b></i>". Also, there is nothing implicit about the int in C99, it is required. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 19:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi -- thanks for writing back. This isn't something I feel strongly about, so if you wish, revert me. I just know that when I run the Solaris compiler with full error checking enabled, it yells at me any time I omit the return value from main()&#160;;-).
