<p>The Atlanta Campaign followed the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Army_b45c.html" title="Union Army">Union</a> victory at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chattanooga_III_0db7.html" title="Battle of Chattanooga III">Battle of Chattanooga</a> in November 1863; <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee_d431.html" title="Chattanooga, Tennessee">Chattanooga</a> was known as the "Gateway to the South", and its capture opened that gateway. After <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S.

While he, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_G._Meade_1d67.html" title="George G. Meade">George G.

<p>At the start of the campaign, Sherman's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Division_of_the_Mississippi_2b7d.html" title="Military Division of the Mississippi">Military Division of the Mississippi</a> consisted of three armies: Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_B._McPherson_43f5.html" title="James B. McPherson">James B.

When McPherson was killed at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Atlanta_69fe.html" title="Battle of Atlanta">Battle of Atlanta</a>, Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_O._Howard_dd96.html" title="Oliver O. Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a> replaced him. Opposing Sherman, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Tennessee_dc07.html" title="Army of Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> was commanded first by Johnston, who was relieved of his command in mid-campaign and replaced by Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bell_Hood_4e04.html" title="John Bell Hood">John Bell Hood</a>. On paper at the beginning of the campaign, Sherman outnumbered Johnston 98,500 to 50,000,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> but his ranks were initially depleted by many furloughed soldiers, and Johnston received 15,000 reinforcements from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>. However, by June, a steady stream of reinforcements brought Sherman's strength to 112,000.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Johnston was a conservative general with a reputation for withdrawing his army before serious contact would result; this was certainly his pattern against <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_B._McClellan_d12c.html" title="George B. McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> in the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula_Campaign_ba2d.html" title="Peninsula Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a> of 1862. But in Georgia, he faced the much more aggressive Sherman. Johnston's army repeatedly took up strongly entrenched defensive positions in the campaign. Sherman prudently avoided suicidal frontal assaults against most of these positions, instead <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanking_maneuver.html" title="Flanking maneuver">maneuvering in flanking marches</a> around the defenses as he advanced from Chattanooga towards Atlanta. Whenever Sherman flanked the defensive lines (almost exclusively around Johnston's left flank), Johnston would retreat to another prepared position. Both armies took advantage of the railroads as supply lines, with Johnston shortening his supply lines as he drew closer to Atlanta, and Sherman lengthening his own.</p>

<p>The following battles comprise the Atlanta Campaign:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rocky_Face_Ridge_2fa1.html" title="Battle of Rocky Face Ridge">Battle of Rocky Face Ridge</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>)</dt>
<dd>Johnston had entrenched his army on the long, high mountain of Rocky Face Ridge and eastward across Crow Valley. As Sherman approached, he decided to demonstrate against the position with two columns while he sent a third one through Snake Creek Gap, to the right, to hit the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad at <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resaca%2C_Georgia_2097.html" title="Resaca, Georgia">Resaca, Georgia</a>. The two columns engaged the enemy at Buzzard Roost (Mill Creek Gap) and at Dug Gap. In the meantime, the third column, under McPherson, passed through Snake Creek Gap and on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">May 9</a> advanced to the outskirts of Resaca, where it found Confederates entrenched. Fearing defeat, McPherson pulled his column back to Snake Creek Gap. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a>, Sherman decided to take most of his men and join McPherson to take Resaca. The next morning, as he discovered Sherman's army withdrawing from their positions in front of Rocky Face Ridge, Johnston retired south towards Resaca.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Resaca_2c84.html" title="Battle of Resaca">Battle of Resaca</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>)</dt>
<dd>Union troops tested the Confederate lines around Resaca to pinpoint their whereabouts. Full scale fighting occurred on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, and the Union troops were generally repulsed except on Johnston's right flank, where Sherman did not fully exploit his advantage. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, the battle continued with no advantage to either side until Sherman sent a force across the Oostanula River at Lay's Ferry, towards Johnston's railroad supply line. Unable to halt this Union movement, Johnston was forced to retire.</dd>

<dt><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Adairsville_3c3b.html" title="Battle of Adairsville">Battle of Adairsville</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>)</dt>
<dd>Johnston's army retreated southward while Sherman pursued. Failing to find a good defensive position south of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calhoun%2C_Georgia_3218.html" title="Calhoun, Georgia">Calhoun</a>, Johnston continued to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adairsville%2C_Georgia_3263.html" title="Adairsville, Georgia">Adairsville</a> while the Confederate cavalry fought a skillful rearguard action. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_O._Howard_dd96.html" title="Oliver O. Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a>'s <a href="../../../i/v/_/IV_Corps_%28ACW%29_8a79.html" title="IV Corps (ACW)">IV Corps</a> ran into entrenched infantry of Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_J._Hardee_5af9.html" title="William J. Hardee">William J. Hardee</a>'s corps, while advancing about two miles (3 km) north of Adairsville. Three Union divisions prepared for battle, but Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._Thomas_08ef.html" title="George H. Thomas">George H. Thomas</a> halted them because of the approach of darkness. Sherman then concentrated his men in the Adairsville area to attack Johnston the next day. Johnston had originally expected to find a valley at Adairsville of suitable width to deploy his men and anchor his line with the flanks on hills, but the valley was too wide, so Johnston disengaged and withdrew.</dd>

<dt><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_New_Hope_Church_284a.html" title="Battle of New Hope Church">Battle of New Hope Church</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>)</dt>
<dd>After Johnston retreated to Allatoona Pass from <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, Sherman decided that attacking Johnston there would be too costly, so he determined to move around Johnston's left flank and steal a march toward <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Georgia_d94e.html" title="Dallas, Georgia">Dallas</a>. Johnston anticipated Sherman's move and met the Union forces at New Hope Church. Sherman mistakenly surmised that Johnston had a token force and ordered Maj.

<dd>Sherman's army tested the Confederate line. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, Hardee's corps probed the Union defensive line, held by Maj.

Fighting ensued at two different points, but the Confederates were repulsed, suffering high casualties. Sherman continued looking for a way around Johnston's line, and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, his cavalry occupied Allatoona Pass, which had a railroad and would allow his men and supplies to reach him by train.

<dd>When Sherman first found Johnston entrenched in the Marietta area on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, he began extending his lines beyond the Confederate lines, causing some Confederate withdrawal to new positions.

<dd>Having encountered entrenched Confederates astride Kennesaw Mountain stretching southward, Sherman fixed them in front and extended his right wing to envelop their flank and menace the railroad. Johnston countered by moving <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Hood_660a.html" title="John B. Hood">John B.

Union artillery and swampy terrain thwarted Hood's attack and forced him to withdraw with heavy casualties. Although the victor, Sherman's attempts at envelopment had momentarily failed.</dd>

<dd>This battle was a notable exception to Sherman's policy in the campaign of avoiding frontal assaults and moving around the enemy's left flank. Sherman was sure that Johnston had stretched his line on Kennesaw Mountain too thin and decided on a frontal attack with some diversions on the flanks. On the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>, Sherman sent his troops forward after an artillery bombardment. At first, they made some headway overrunning Confederate pickets south of the Burnt Hickory Road, but attacking an enemy that was dug in was futile.

<dd>Johnston had retired south of Peachtree Creek, about three miles (5 km) north of Atlanta.

Johnston had decided to attack Thomas, but Confederate President <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> relieved him of command and appointed <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Hood_660a.html" title="John B.

<dd>Hood determined to attack McPherson's Army of the Tennessee. He withdrew his main army at night from Atlanta's outer line to the inner line, enticing Sherman to follow. In the meantime, he sent William J. Hardee with his corps on a fifteen-mile (24 km) march to hit the unprotected Union left and rear, east of the city. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wheeler_1b7e.html" title="Joseph Wheeler">Joseph Wheeler</a>'s cavalry was to operate farther out on Sherman's supply line, and Gen. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Cheatham_63a5.html" title="Benjamin F. Cheatham">Benjamin F. Cheatham</a>'s corps was to attack the Union front. Hood, however, miscalculated the time necessary to make the march, and Hardee was unable to attack until afternoon. Although Hood had outmaneuvered Sherman for the time being, McPherson was concerned about his left flank and sent his reserves—<a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenville_Dodge_2ecf.html" title="Grenville Dodge">Grenville Dodge</a>'s XVI Corps—to that location. Two of Hood's divisions ran into this reserve force and were repulsed. The Confederate attack stalled on the Union rear but began to roll up the left flank. Around the same time, a Confederate soldier shot and killed McPherson when he rode out to observe the fighting. Determined attacks continued, but the Union forces held. About 4:00 p.m., Cheatham's corps broke through the Union front, but massed artillery near Sherman's headquarters halted the Confederate assault. Logan's XV Corps then led a counterattack that restored the Union line. The Union troops held, and Hood suffered high casualties.</dd>

<dd>Sherman's forces had previously approached Atlanta from the east and north and had not been able to break through, so Sherman decided to attack from the west. He ordered Howard's Army of the Tennessee to move from the left wing to the right and cut Hood's last railroad supply line between East Point and Atlanta. Hood foresaw such a maneuver and sent the two corps of Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_D._Lee_4ba4.html" title="Stephen D. Lee">Stephen D. Lee</a> and Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_P._Stewart_d3fb.html" title="Alexander P. Stewart">Alexander P. Stewart</a> to intercept and destroy the Union force at Ezra Church. Howard had anticipated such a thrust, entrenched one of his corps in the Confederates' path, and repulsed the determined attack, inflicting numerous casualties. Howard, however, failed to cut the railroad. Concurrent attempts by two columns of Union cavalry to cut the railroads south of Atlanta ended in failure, with one division under <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_M._McCook_b558.html" title="Edward M.

<dd>After failing to envelop Hood's left flank at Ezra Church, Sherman still wanted to extend his right flank to hit the railroad between East Point and Atlanta. He transferred Schofield's Army of the Ohio from his left to his right flank and sent him to the north bank of Utoy Creek. Although Schofield's troops were at Utoy Creek on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, they, along with the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, did not cross until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>. Schofield's force began its movement to exploit this situation on the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, which was initially successful. Schofield then had to regroup his forces, which took the rest of the day. The delay allowed the Confederates to strengthen their defenses with <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abatis.html" title="Abatis">abatis</a>, which slowed the Union attack when it restarted on the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>.

<dd>Sherman had successfully cut Hood's supply lines in the past by sending out detachments, but the Confederates quickly repaired the damage. In late August, Sherman determined that if he could cut Hood's railroad supply lines, the Confederates would have to evacuate Atlanta. He therefore decided to move six of his seven infantry corps against the supply lines. The army began pulling out of its positions on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a> to hit the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macon_%26_Western_Railroad_c622.html" title="Macon &amp; Western Railroad">Macon &amp; Western Railroad</a> between Rough and Ready and Jonesborough. To counter the move, Hood sent Hardee with two corps to halt and possibly rout the Union troops, not realizing Sherman's army was there in force. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, Hardee attacked two Union corps west of Jonesborough but was easily repulsed. Fearing an attack on Atlanta, Hood withdrew one corps from Hardee's force that night. The next day, a Union corps broke through Hardee's line, and his troops retreated to Lovejoy's Station. On the night of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, Hood evacuated Atlanta, burning military supplies and installations, causing a great conflagration in the city (the dramatic fire scenes depicted in the 1939 film <i><a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29_6d15.html" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>). Union troops occupied Atlanta on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>. Sherman cut Hood's supply line but failed to destroy Hardee's command.</dd>

<p>Sherman was victorious, and Hood established a reputation as the most recklessly aggressive general in the Confederate Army. Casualties for the campaign were roughly equal in absolute numbers: 31,687 Union (4,423 killed, 22,822 wounded, 4,442 missing/captured) and 34,979 Confederate (3,044 killed, 18,952 wounded, 12,983 missing/captured). But this represented a much higher Confederate proportional loss. Hood's army left the area with approximately 30,000 men, whereas Sherman retained 81,000.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Sherman's victory was tainted because it did not fulfill the original mission of the campaign—destroy the Army of Tennessee—and Sherman has been criticized for allowing his opponent to escape. However, the capture of Atlanta made an enormous contribution to Northern morale and was an important factor in the re-election of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.</p>
