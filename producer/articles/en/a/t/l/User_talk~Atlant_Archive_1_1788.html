<dd>I think i read your question (I've been travelling so my access has been intermittent) and concluded I didn't know anthing "authoritative". I think the answer was "the Silver Line in South Boston isn't going to run as a single unitary line; it's going to be more like the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Line_%28MBTA%29_48c2.html" title="Green Line (MBTA)">Green Line</a> with separate branches". But now that I'm back, I'll certainly go read your question again; I'm sure the answer to your routing question can be found (and knowing the way Wiki works, may already have been posted by someone else!).</dd>

<p>Hi Atlant - just a quick note to say that stub articles for places in the US should get {{US-geo-stub}} rather than simply {{geo-stub}}.

<dd>Thanks! I actually tried {{us-geo-syubs}} (note the incorrect case!) but saw that it didn't work, and I was running out of time before I had to catch a bus! I'll try to remember the proper casing from hereon out (and I can always refer back to here for those times when I forget).</dd>

<p>Just wanted to say that I like the F Market page. I added a bit of information to it -- hope you find it useful! <b>Not sure how familiar you are with other SF transit lines</b> (emphasis added by Atlant) but I'd like to eventually add similar pages for each Muni Metro line...</p>

<dd>Not as familiar as I'd like!&#160;:-) I only get to spend a week or two each year in The City. With regard to the <a href="../../../f/_/m/F_Market_2310.html" title="F Market">F Market</a> article, you're entirely welcome. A few weeks ago, I discussed the need for it with someone (was it you?) and finally got around to writing it, mostly using as my source information the brochure handed out on the trolleys.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Writing articles about the other lines would be fairly consistent with the approach that's been taken with the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority_d11d.html" title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority">MBTA</a> articles; there's an article regarding each of the major divisions (the "colors") of the subway lines while the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Line_%28MBTA%29_48c2.html" title="Green Line (MBTA)">Green Line</a> article contains all of the more-inter-related branches of that line.</dd>

<dd>Do me a favor: If you write an article about the <a href="../../../l/_/t/L_Taraval_e0b9.html" title="L Taraval">L Taraval</a> line, please be sure to mention "Carousel", the "Doggie Diner".&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I know the exact instant, but the news broke today, February 9th here in America. It's quite likely that she actually "resigned" yesterday, however the <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2005/050209a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2005/050209a.html" rel="nofollow">HP press release</a> is also dated the 9th. Wiki's really slow right now so I can't look at the article history, but if I typed the 5th, that was purely a typo on my part.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the explanation, but I think it's often better to leave something in an obvious "top level category" (that any naive user of the encyclopedia can find) than to push it down into a sub-category. This is clearly an area where the Wiki culture hasn't settled on one true style yet, though.</dd>

<p>Hi Atlant,</p>
<dl>
<dd>And even laser light occupies a small, but non-zero frequency spectrum.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks, I had never realized that, but it makes sense, given the nature of quantum physics. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleon_Teunissen_354f.html" title="User:Cleon Teunissen">Cleon Teunissen</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/e/User_talk%7ECleon_Teunissen_4622.html" title="User talk:Cleon Teunissen">Talk</a> 14:06, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's in the nature of things. (Are you familiar with the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourier_transform.html" title="Fourier transform">Fourier transform</a>?) At the ultimate limit, if the laser has any sort of modulation imposed on it (deliberate or random fluctuations in intensity, or even being switched on and off), it can't be truly monochromatic because the modulation <b>MUST</b> create sidebands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And there are other effects as well. For example, in a gas laser, there must be some minor contributions from the <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doppler_effect.html" title="Doppler effect">Doppler effect</a> as the gas convects around in the laser discharge tube and I suppose atomic vibrations contribute a little in solid-state lasers. Lasers are pretty darned good, but even they aren't perfect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a paper from <a href="../../../n/i/s/NIST_a44b.html" title="NIST">NIST</a> where they're discussing a laser with a linewidth of about 0.6 Hz; amid 532 terahertz, that's pretty good, but still not perfectly monochromatic.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for writing!</dd>

<p>I am familiar with fourier analysis, that's related to fourier transform? There is also ring laser interferometry. In ring laser interferometry the laser cavity is shaped like a torus, with at a single point in the ring the mirrors. Light in it goes back and forth, completing circles. When the ring is rotating the lasering splits into two frequencies, one upwards according to doppler shift, one downwards. These two frequencies are then allowed to interfere with each other, which is then measured as a beat frequency. The beat frequency is proportional to the angular velocity. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleon_Teunissen_354f.html" title="User:Cleon Teunissen">Cleon Teunissen</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/e/User_talk%7ECleon_Teunissen_4622.html" title="User talk:Cleon Teunissen">Talk</a> 00:43, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right; Fourier analysis is based on the transform. And thanks for reminding me about <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_gyroscope.html" title="Ring gyroscope">ring gyroscopes</a>; they make a nice point about how very small frequency shifts can have nicely detectable effects. <strike>Hmm, I notice there's no article about them -- feel up to creating one?</strike> Nevermind; I found <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_laser_gyroscope.html" title="Ring laser gyroscope">Ring laser gyroscope</a> and created a redirect to it.</dd>

<p>I'd like to start a table of integrated circuit logic speeds. We can say CMOS is not as fast as TTL but that isn't always true...some buck-rogers 74HCT part probably clocks faster than a flip-flop in the obsolete 74L series for instance. So a table of comparisions is in order; I've got at least one good reference ("Art of Electronics") and a bunch of catalogs. Another thing for my to-do list. Thanks for the edit.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but at any given point in time, the fastest bipolar logic has always been faster than the fastest (C)MOS logic. This is still true today; SiGe ECL (or especially GaAs ECL) logic still clocks quite a bit faster than the fastest CMOS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With specific regard to your list of logic speeds, I'd like to suggest two metrics:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Typical gate propagation delay (in ns/ps), and</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>flip-flop toggle speeds (in MHz/GHz).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Hi Atlant - I noticed your edit to Brave New World, reverting to a version with the phrase 'physically engineered to not desire "dangerous" knowledge', instead of physically engineered not to desire "dangerous" knowledge.

<dd>Well, I have no camera here, or I'd happily show you a picture of several different <b>nine-pole</b> CD/DVD spindle motors (which are technically DC brushless motors but are, practically speaking, operated as three-phase synchronous motors). Strange, but true! There's no theoretical reason to prevent odd-pole motors, especially for external-rotor designs where the flux flows through the middle (the merger) of the stationary field coils (as compared to internal-rotor designs where the flux flows through the circumference of the field-coil laminations). But as I mentioned, they pretty much do have to have a number of poles that is a multiple of the number of phases or things would get <b>really</b> weird!&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>I note you've added what you refer to as a "Wiki-standard final comma" to several articles I've been involved with. Looking at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Serial_commas" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">the relevant section of the Manual of Style</a>, it doesn't seem to me that there's a standard to be applied. Indeed, the Manual of Style says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In most cases, however, the presence of the final serial comma does not affect ambiguity of the sentence, and in these cases there is no Wikipedia consensus on whether it should be used.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't object to its being there, and I'm not going to revert it, but whatever else it may be the final serial comma isn't as Wiki-standard as you seem to imply. Certainly in the sentence you changed on the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watership_Down_abdf.html" title="Watership Down">Watership Down</a> page, I think the comma-less version looks better, and is certainly the more common style here in Britain. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> 22:29, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>As stated by <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Turabian_8dca.html" title="Kate Turabian">Kate Turabian</a>'s</i> A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations<i>, the</i> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a><i>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strunk_and_White_b552.html" title="Strunk and White">Strunk and White</a>, and other authoritative sources, when a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series of three or more elements, a comma is used before the conjunction: "The wires were brown, blue, and green." The reason for the final <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_comma.html" title="Serial comma">serial comma</a> is to prevent the last two elements from being confused as a unit. Consider its utility in this sentence: "The author would like to thank her parents, SinÃ©ad O'Connor and Pope John-Paul II." See <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_comma.html" title="Serial comma">serial comma</a> for further discussion.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>So at that time, my statement was correct; thanks for calling this change to my attention! I guess I'll have to wade into this debate because I feel quite strongly that <i>Strunk &amp; White</i> got it right (in their call for always including the final comma).</dd>

<dd>Interesting. I feel the other way, as I've said before (except in cases where including the comma clearly avoids an ambiguity), but on the whole I take a fairly pragmatic view that it's largely a British/American split, and tend to treat it in much the same way as <i>artefact</i>/<i>artifact</i> and leave the style as the original author wrote it. Carry on changing my style if you like, but I see no need to use the commaless style to begin with. I know Oxford use the comma here in Britain, but they're in a minority in this country, just as they are in preferring the <i>-ize</i> suffix; the vast majority of Britons (including me) use <i>-ise</i>. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> 23:11, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are consumer video cards with Dual Link DVI ports now? I thought you had to get a multi-grand workstation card like a Quadro 4000. What changed?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even at the introduction of the 30 inch Cinema display, Apple was selling the Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra DDL Video Card "loose-piece" for about US$600, so at that moment, there was certainly a "consumer" card available that could be purchased by anyone at a reasonable price. Now, there appear to be quite a few possible cards from both Nvidia and ATI, although a lot of the dual-link cards still seem to be packaged as "Macintosh" editions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But you're starting to have lots of choices, for example, <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/workstation/fireglmatrix.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ati.com/products/workstation/fireglmatrix.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the Apple Store is now selling the (easier to use, single-slot) ATI X800XT at US$500. Also, it isn't just the Apple dislay that uses multiple links. That monster IBM 200 dpi display also needs them if you expect to use a refresh rate gigher than a dozen Hertz or so.</dd>

<p>Hey man&#160;:) OS/360 *itself* was lightyears ahead of anything at the time. OS/360 as a <i>software engineering project</i>, was horribly late and out of budget due to the points that Brooks made. That's why I tagged it with <a href="../../../s/o/f/Category%7ESoftware_engineering_disasters_2199.html" title="Category:Software engineering disasters">Category: Software engineering disasters</a>.

<dd>I understand what you're saying about it being way over budget and late, and Brooks clearly formulated a lot of his thinking as a result of his experience leading that project. But when I looked at what was actually currently included in the category of <a href="../../../s/o/f/Category%7ESoftware_engineering_disasters_2199.html" title="Category:Software engineering disasters">Category:Software engineering disasters</a>, it seemed to me that OS/360 isn't really eligible for inclusion yet.

<p>Hi, let me start out by saying i've now sampled your dedicated editing, and find it wise and careful.</p>
<p>And i'll continue by making sure you realize that my overkill response on <a href="../../../b/a/s/Talk%7EBASF_d307.html" title="Talk:BASF">Talk:BASF</a> reflected my mistaken assumption that you had been rv-warring against both <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherlin_8676.html" title="User:Christopherlin">User:Christopherlin</a> and some IPs, and that it'd take firmness and thoroughness to rein you in. Far from the truth!</p>
<p>And it's embarrassing to go off half-cocked as i did, making assumptions too early.</p>
<p>I will offer you my observation that it's wise to limit the term "revert" to instances of using either the admins' roll-back button, or a save (without having edited it, and in defiance of the "editing an out of date page warning") of an old "revision" that you reach via the Page-history tool. Calling it an "rv" when you have merely tried to edit the old version of a passage back in can (if you make any mistake) at best confuse others who later read the history, and at worst create (however briefly) the appearance that you are using the summary "rv ...." to camouflage stealthy vandalism.</p>
<p>I particularly noted some "Swept Away ..." edits you did, including the lk-via-cmt to a talk page. Do you think it'd be justified to make <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swept_Away_de6e.html" title="Swept Away">Swept Away</a> the title of what you so deftly called "the real" one, with a Top-of-Page Dab lk'g to (probably) <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swept_Away_%282002%29_64eb.html" title="Swept Away (2002)">Swept Away (2002)</a>? The full title of the original is so seldom used (i slightly dread being asked to reproduce it!) that i think the two-word title belongs to the original. (At a glance, i'm pretty sure [Always knock on wood!] that the move won't even require deletion of an obstructing redirect.) What sayest thou?</p>

<dd>No worries -- Thank you for writing! Like any internaut, my first instinct was to "blast back" but I've been around that loop more than once in my youth so I instead gave a lot of thought how best to respond to you, finally deciding that I just caught you on a bad day and I shouldn't respond at all. Then I saw your comment associated with your "dummy edit" and already felt a lot better about things. And here you are confirming that!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think your advice about the use of the term "revert" is good; sometimes I'll revert someone explaining that "the other version was better/more clear/etc." but perhaps I shouldn't be using the word "revert" at all in that case.</dd>

<ul>
<li>I figured I'd caused enough chaos for one day and I'd let the dust settle from all the earlier edits. (I wondered if my tweaks against SA2002 would provoke a response, but I'm weak and simply couldn't resist making some of them.)</li>
<li>Also, my watchlist has gotten caught in the new "Wikimedia 1.5 won't update watchlists" bug so it's a lot harder for me to see right now how people are responding to edits I make; I sure hope they fix that bug soon!</li>
</ul>

<dd>If things <b>do</b> settle out okay and if you don't beat me too it, I'll probably make the re-arrangement that you've proposed. There are only about a dozen "Madonna-related" links from the current SA2002 page so it wouldn't be too messy to do the switch.</dd>

<p>Hi, noticed your change to SF-Oakland bay bridge. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuelWantman_a4bf.html#Bay_Bridge" title="User talk:SamuelWantman">I've been chatting about this</a> with <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html#SF_Oakland_Bay_Bridge" title="User talk:Calton">User:Calton</a>. I suspect that there are two scenes where he is driving on the top roadway of the bridge, once towards SF and once towards Berkeley. I haven't found any definitive citations, and I haven't seen the film in years. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 7 July 2005 20:26 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's <b>one</b> shot -- what either of you "suspect" has nothing to do with whether it's true. Instead of vague suspicions, how about some documented proof BEFORE making an assertion? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 8 July 2005 00:35 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Over on the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighting.html" title="Lighting">Lighting</a> page, you recently reverted an anonymous user's claim that fluorescent lighting systems can achieve better than 100 lumens per watt. My interest in lighting systems is mostly through the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_pollution.html" title="Light pollution">Light pollution</a> aspect, and I'm not a lighting engineer. There are definitely sources around that claim that level of efficiency, though.</p>
<p>One that comes to mind is the International Dark Sky Association -- at least one of their information sheets (<a href="http://www.darksky.org/infoshts/is052.html" class="external text" title="http://www.darksky.org/infoshts/is052.html" rel="nofollow">over here</a>) claims that HPS, Fluorescent and LPS lights can all do better than 100 lumens per watt... with some Fluorescent lights apparently being able to get 600 lumens per watt.</p>
<p>Is it the sort of citation that would satisfy you? <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 23:54, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That last bit (600 L/W) is patent nonsense, so I'd worry about citing any source that claimed that.&#160;:-) The maximum theoretical efficiency of an optimally-colored monochromatic light source (at 555 nm so "greenish-yellow") is ~683 lumens/watt and the maximum efficiency of "White" light is somewhere around 200 L/W depending on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_rendering_index.html" title="Color rendering index">CRI</a> that you're willing to accept. Google for "theoretical-maximum lumens watt" for a lot of references, many of which aren't HTML unfortunately, but here's one very good .PDF link: <a href="http://lighting.sandia.gov/lightingdocs/StolkaMOLEDRoadmap200103.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://lighting.sandia.gov/lightingdocs/StolkaMOLEDRoadmap200103.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It contains a graphic that clearly explains how luminous efficiency relates to wavelength and another that shows common efficiency ranges (with full-sized and U-tube fluorescents topping out below 100 L/W and compact fluorescents topping out at about 55 L/W).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But if a reputable vendor, scientific report, or trade study claims a production fluorescent lamp with &gt;100 L/W, that would satisfy me just fine.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for writing!</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comments -- you've just given me another reason to be quite skeptical of the IDA's resources. I know they have the best intentions and I agree with what they promote in principle, but I've found reasons to be cautious of some of their resources in the last few years. (Not clearly dated, no clear references or sources cited, mixing good objective information with things like poetry and people's rants, and now this.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I'll re-visit this if I come across any sources that might confirm it more clearly. Much appreciated.</dd>

<p>I'm not going to bother reverting again, but note that there's more than one standard for the use of dashes; the one that I'= (and many other people) have always used reserves em-rules for setting of or introducing a separate thought (something like, but not exactly, a colon), while en-rules are used as parentheses. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ÎœÎµÎ» Î•Ï„Î·Ï„Î·Ï‚</font>)</a> 21:46, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My Color Theory links that I had added had been erased/reverted, and the explanation that you had given was that you were reverting deletions. I don't recall deleting anything, only adding links (though they had no summary; I figured it would have been obvious that I was simply adding links). Is there a reason my edits were reverted?</p>

<dd>You're correct; based on your deleting your own HSV color space link, I completely misconstrued what was going on. I've reverted your edits back in.</dd>
