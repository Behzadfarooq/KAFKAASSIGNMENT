Unprecedented bad weather led to 6 boats retiring from the race. As the most recent event, the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race is covered in more detail below than previous races:</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Rowing_Race_2e44.html" title="Edit section: Bad weather">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bad weather</span></h3>
<p>Just as the majority of the crews had completed between a quarter and a third of the race, there was a prolonged spell of time where the conditions were not favourable for rowing. Rather than the typical <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_winds.html" title="Trade winds">trade winds</a> that would have been helping the fleet, there were often strong westerly winds, some of which were associated with <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Epsilon_c455.html" title="Hurricane Epsilon">Hurricane Epsilon</a>, forcing many of the crews to stop rowing completely and put up a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_anchor.html" title="Sea anchor">sea anchor</a> to prevent drifting.</p>
<p>In early January, much of the fleet ended up passing through the southern edge of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Storm_Zeta_2328.html" title="Tropical Storm Zeta">Tropical Storm Zeta</a>, which raised high seas and created adverse wind conditions. The tropical storm formed unusually late in the hurricane season.</p>
<p>The bad weather all but prevented most crews from any attempt at a world record for the crossing.</p>
<p>The late-November start date was chosen because, in a normal year, the hurricane season is all but finished for the year, but 2005's season lasted for an unusually long time.</p>

<p>The crew <i>All Relative</i>, a four-man boat with participants from <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer%2C_Devon_ebb2.html" title="Beer, Devon">Beer, Devon</a>, had a fast start, and were able to get clear of much of the bad weather that has dogged other crews. As a consequence, they had stretched their lead to several hundred nautical miles before other crews were able to start moving again. <i>All Relative</i> crossed the finish line in Antigua at 15:37:47 GMT on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">8 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, a crossing time of 39 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes and 47 seconds, falling 3 days outside the World Record for the crossing, but breaking the race record by just over 22 hours.
