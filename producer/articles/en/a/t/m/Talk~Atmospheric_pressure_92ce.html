<p>A useful addition to this entry is the normal ranges of atmospheric pressures. From a little research it appears the the maximum recorded atmospheric pressure was in Siberia at 1200 GMT on 31 December 1968: 32.01 in (1083.8 mb). See <a href="http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.99.pressure.html" class="external free" title="http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.99.pressure.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.99.pressure.html</a></p>
<p>The lowest recorded pressure appears to be in the 920mb area.

Presumably, these are SLP's. Well the pacific one clearly is. But the Mongolian one can't be, Mongolia being quite high up. So it must be station pressure reduced to sea level (unless its really an actual reading - unlikely) and reduction to sea level is fraught with difficulties, ie the temperature profile that gets assumed under the ground.</dd>

<dd>Note I have reduced the precision values of the millibar values. Pressure measurement to 0.01 millibar precision, particularly at the centre of a typhoon, is unrealistic. The value given for Typhoon Tip was obviously a conversion of 25.69inHg, with too many decimal places quoted. I have rounded to the nearest millibar. 143.252.80.110 19:22, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Steve Miller</p>
<p><br />
some effects: pilots in military jets feel sometimes toothache as pressure changes rapidly.</p>
<p><br />
I'm sure this must have other causes. An air pressure, as 'invented' by Otto of Guericke, as a<br />
clue for his hemispheres attempt might not be existing in this nature on the planet.</p>

<p>An extension of the article considering the atmospheric pressure on other planets, notably mars, would be interesting, as a low atmosperic pressure diminuishes the temperature range where water can exist in liquid form.</p>
<p>From phase diagrams found randomly on the internet (and evaluated by moving the thumb) it looks like the average body temperature of a terrestrial bird would be sufficient to boil liquid water given the pressure of the martian amosphere. 84.160.201.148 11:00, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure, the water in the martian atmosphere starts boiling well below the body temperature. But that doesn't mean that the blood in a human body boils instantly when someone is exposed to the martian atmosphere. For a while the pressure inside the body is a lot higher than outside. If you ever be exposed to martian atmosphere you suffocate long before your blood boiled away&#160;:-). You won't explode either. But your lung might be ruptured if you hold your breath before you are exposed.</p>
<p>A similar effect, but less of course, is if you ever climb the Mount Everest. The pressure on the top is just one third of the amount on sea level. At this low pressure your cup of coffee will never be more than 70 degrees celsius, because it boils away above that temperature. So, you never burn yourself because you coffee was too hot&#160;:-). --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius1976_ad53.html" title="User:Lucius1976">Lucius1976</a> 17:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>considering other planetary masses have atmospheric pressures as well... such has Venus and mars. this makes it sound like if I say oh the atmospheric pressure is .6 KPA then... its on earth, when i could be referring to mars. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarcode_666f.html" title="User:Barcode">Barcode</a> 16:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ok, but rather than an approximation (as is given - and is unclearly cited at that) which only applies for a narrow range of conditions, it would be much more instructive and illustrative if an equation were provided that were general. The equation given is honestly quite confusing in its foundation. The numbers in it are just stated to give it some sense of authority but for all we know they could have been pulled out of a hat. The source cited for this equation is not one that is available to any of us and so cannot be verified. The Wiki standard is then to delete it if it cannot be verified.

<dd>It's pretty terrible at the moment.

The US Standard Atmosphere is a model (or series of models) of the entire atmosphere including temperature, pressure, density etc (including a definition of sea-level atmospheric pressure). IMHO, fixing this situation would seem to require having <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Atmosphere_2cca.html" title="Standard Atmosphere">Standard Atmosphere</a> be a disambiguation page, pointing to here and the Standard Atmosphere (model).

<ul>
<li>It is not true to state that <font color="maroon">“In 1985, IUPAC recommended that <b>standard atmospheric pressure</b> should be 100 000 Pascal…”</font> In 1985, IUPAC did <i>not</i> redefine the value of "one standard atmosphere;" they defined "the standard pressure" at which material properties should be measured.<br />
<br />
* It is not true to state that <font color="maroon">“this "standard pressure"</font> {one standard atmosphere} <font color="maroon">is a <b>purely arbitrary</b> representative value for pressure at sea level.”</font> The definition for a standard atmosphere is far from arbitrary and, as a practical matter, truly reflects the mean sea level barometric pressure for many of the industrialized nations (those with latitudes similar to Paris, France).<br />
<br />
* One mm-Hg is <i>not</i> interchangeable with one torr {<font color="maroon">“(1 atm) is defined as 101.325 kilopascals (kPa) or <b>760 mmHg</b>”</font>}. A torr is fixed by definition as being precisely equal to 1/760th of a standard atmosphere. The value of a millimeter of mercury is determined by: 1) the definition of gravity (9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>), 2) to the density of mercury (13.595 078(5) g/ml @ 0 °C, NIST value), and 3) to the temperature at which mercury's density is taken. Whereas the value of gravity is fixed by definition, the density of mercury is determined by experiment and is subject to revision. And of course, the temperature of the mercury should be noted in any definition.<br />
<br />
* The attempt to mix-in the specification of gage pressure: {<font color="maroon">“14.696 psia or 0 psig (pounds-force per square inch, absolute or gauge) (lbf/in²)”</font>} produced two specs that were so intertwined, the line was next-to-impossible to decipher. The most notable problem is it is not spelled "gauge"; it's <i>gage</i> pressure. And gage pressures are <i>always</i> zero so it is utterly meaningless to include them (it) in any specification of atmospheric pressure. Since 1) all the other values were absolute pressures, and 2) none of the other values had equivalent gage pressures, why bother for psi and why bother for any of the others.<br />
<br />
I've corrected these in the article. The values for psi and psf that are now expressed to 15 significant digits have all their terms fixed by definition. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_L_aa93.html" title="User:Greg L">Greg L</a> 08:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I came here just looking for some basic information on air pressure. Specifically, does air pressure increase when it's about to rain or when it's raining as opposed to during a clear day? Just thought it'd be useful information. I'd add it if I was sure about it.&#160;: / --Anon.</p>

<dd>Please sign your messages with ~~~~. Air density is the (local) mass per unit volume (kg/m3). Air pressure is the force per unit area exerted by the weight of the total column (just about) and is thus N/m2.

<p>I don't recommend that anyone use the equations given for pressure vs. altitude without checking them very carefully. The user who posted them seems to have converted the units of the universal gas constant incorrectly; there may be other conversion errors etc. Strangely, even the US standard which is cited for this material uses SI units for the universal gas constant. I don't understand why the editor felt it useful to convert them. I haven't reviewed the whole standard, though, so perhaps there was a good reason for it. Ideally, the whole section should be scrapped and replaced with a <i>cited</i> calculation in SI units.</p>
<p>Note that converting a complicated calculation like this from one set of units to another may violate the policy against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, for precisely the reason seen here: it's easy to introduce errors. --<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 01:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about? There are no errors and it is not original research. The equations are correct. They are the equations specified by the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 which was cited. The basic formulae remain the same; only the units changed. It is not <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. It is a simple conversion from metric to standard. The conversion factors are very old and are well-published (refer to NASA SP-7012, <i>The International System of Units: Physical Constants and Conversion Factors</i>). I edited the chart to reflect both SI units and English units. It should now be useful for people who utilize SI units as well as people (like myself) who still use English units. The conversion of the gas constant for air is correct. The conversion is simply "SI units / 0.3048^2" OR "8.31432 x 10^3 N m /(kmol K) divided by 0.3048^2" (note that 0.3048^2 is the conversion factor of square meters to square feet). The only weird thing about all of this is that the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 uses the value 8.31432x10^3 as the gas constant for air which it admits is not consistent with the cited values of the Avogadro number and Boltzmann's constant. Still though, it uses this value for all it's calculations. The effect of this disparity is negligible (less than 0.08 pascals at 35,000 feet and less than 0.00004 pascals at 250,000 feet) and, in any event, it really does not matter because the actual pressure/temperature at any given altitude is rarely the same as the value in the tables. (Just as the actual pressure and temperature at sea level are rarely 1013.25 mb and 15 degrees celsuis on any given day). Still though, it is a realistic, usable average. Additionally, all aircraft flight instruments (worldwide) are calibrated using the same Standard Atmosphere as the reference. Therefore, all altimeters are equally "inaccurate". I feel English units should remain in this article because they are still widely used today. Instrument shops in the United States use inches of murcury and feet when calibrating altimeters; not pascals, millibars or meters. The current, active military standard (MIL-STD-859, <i>Standard Calibration Table For Aeronautical Pressure Measuring Equipment</i>) is tabulated in feet and inches of mercury. Also, the equipment used to calibrate the altimeters are themselves calibrated using feet and inches of mercury (refer to Air Force technical order 33D7-3-60-71). In Europe, however, they use SI units. The chart in the article now shows both so everyone should be happy. It should also be mentioned that the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 is identical to the ICAO standard up to 32 km and the ISO standard up to 50 km.
