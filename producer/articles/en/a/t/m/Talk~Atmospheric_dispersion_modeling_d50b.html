<dd>As the primary author of the article, I disagree with you slightly. Having worked in the air dispersion modeling field for over 30 years, I am aware that it is often referred to as "air dispersion modeling" and as "atmospheric dispersion modeling". However, I have never seen the field referred to as "air dispersal modeling".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for choosing the the current title when I contributed the article is simply that I felt it was more precise. The article is not about dispersion of the air nor about dispersion of the atmosphere. Rather it is about dispersion of air pollutants in the atmospheric air ... and therefore the current title is more precise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I should point out that I also created the following pages <i>all of which redirect the reader to the page as it is now titled</i>:</dd>

<dd>If you really believe that the above list is inadequate, I would be happy to create another redirected page entitled "Air dispersal modeling".

<dd>thanks for your quick and detailed response. i am mainly trying to shorten the title and make it register with the general public. i am a scientist too and have been in the field 34 years. i agree the phrase i threw out makes little sense, but three of your other redirects would make good titles: [[Air quality modeling], <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling.html" title="Atmospheric dispersion modeling">Atmospheric dispersion modeling</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_dispersion_modeling.html" title="Air dispersion modeling">Air dispersion modeling</a>. would you be at peace with any of these? one of my motivations is that i am writing in a number of other air quality and environmental articles on wikipedia and it is nice to be able to use one term in the article which also becomes the title of the page to which it is linked. i think many readers get distracted when they click a link and the article title is different from the title she or he clicked. let me know what you think, best regards, <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 01:30, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page was developed by renaming and manually moving <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispersion_modeling_of_air_pollutants.html" title="Dispersion modeling of air pollutants">Dispersion modeling of air pollutants</a> at the request of <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">User:Anlace</a>.

<p>However, I do not know how to move the history of the old page and, thus, the history remains with the old page, namely <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispersion_modeling_of_air_pollutants.html" title="Dispersion modeling of air pollutants">Dispersion modeling of air pollutants</a>.

<p>If Air Quality modelling redirects here then I think regional and global models should also be mentioned here. These are grid point models in general and are used for air quality forecasting and scientific studies. The basic methodology of these models seems very different from approaches such as that of Gaussian Plume approaches and this needs to be reflected in the article. I am involved in global modelling of air pollution so my knowledge of regional modelling is limited and I am aware that these approaches are also now nested for example <a href="http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Miljoe-tilstand/3_luft/4_Spredningsmodeller/5_thor/default_en.asp" class="external text" title="http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Miljoe-tilstand/3_luft/4_Spredningsmodeller/5_thor/default_en.asp" rel="nofollow">THOR</a>.--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 07:50, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that regional and global models are different from the local scale, point source Gaussian models described in this article. I also agree that regional and global models are often nested or integrated with a number of modules. The purpose of this article was to introduce readers to the simplest fundamentals of dispersion modeling without writing a book ... which is what would be required to completely cover the entire field. If you will look carefully through <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compilation_of_atmospheric_dispersion_models.html" title="Compilation of atmospheric dispersion models">Compilation of atmospheric dispersion models</a>, you will see that I did include regional to global models there (in fact, I included NAMEIII developed by the UK Met Office).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAir_dispersion_modeling_273a.html" title="Category:Air dispersion modeling">Category:Air dispersion modeling</a> needs more articles. To that end, it would be quite helpful if you or one of your colleagues were to write an article on Air Quality Modeling. It would then be quite easy to change the current redirection of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_quality_modeling.html" title="Air quality modeling">Air quality modeling</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_quality_modelling.html" title="Air quality modelling">Air quality modelling</a> to that new article.

<dd>I will give it some thought. However as I said I am working more at global scale and so it would require a fair amount of research. I don't want to rush into this. I also have a long list of other articles to edit...</dd>

<p>I think there should be an explicit note about grid point models and maybe also something about urban dispersion modelling (street canyons etc.).

<dd>Vladimir, I agree that there are a great many types of dispersion models in use today. And I think that the major types do indeed deserve to have articles written about them. However, as I said in response to NHSavage (see above), this article was written to explain the fundamentals of the classic Gaussian dispersion algorithm and the classic Brigg's plume rise calculations. If we tried to include discussions of all the various modern dispersion models in use today, this article would become much, much too large. Rather than that, I think it would be much more useful if you (or anyone else) would write separate new articles about the other types of models. Is that something you would be willing to do? - <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbeychok_616b.html" title="User:Mbeychok">mbeychok</a> 23:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, now i have not enough free time now, because i'm preparing for finals in meteorology. Then i can try write something, but i don't feel to be much competent. But again, if the name of article is Atmospheric dispersion modeling, there should be at the beginning short info about all possibilities. At least a short list or simple mention. Also there could be a separate article Gaussian dispersion models with more details about Sutton model etc. which can not be all in this introductional article.--<a href="../../../l/e/j/User%7ELejzy_acba.html" title="User:Lejzy">Vladimír Fuka</a> 15:07, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vladimer, good luck on your finals. As for mention of other models, the "See also" list in this article includes the article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compilation_of_atmospheric_dispersion_models.html" title="Compilation of atmospheric dispersion models">Compilation of atmospheric dispersion models</a> which has descriptions of dozens of other models of various different types. The purpose of having a "See also" section is to do just what you are asking for ... a simple mention of other model types and other related articles ... is it not?? In my mind, there is no point of a short list of other models in this article when there is already an existing article with a very long list and description of other models.

<dd>As I explained when I deleted your external link to that observational data base, the link you provided led to a website that I found so difficult to understand that it was virtually incomprehensible. It was obviously written for the cognoscenti ... whereas this dispersion modeling article is no more than an introduction to the subject. Also, this dispersion modeling article does not include a discussion of atmospheric chemistry.</dd>

<dd>I have a great deal of respect for your very advanced expertise and credentials in the field of atmospheric chemistry. In my opinion, it would be much better if you wrote a separate article on that subject and how it relates to atmospheric pollutant dispersion modeling.
