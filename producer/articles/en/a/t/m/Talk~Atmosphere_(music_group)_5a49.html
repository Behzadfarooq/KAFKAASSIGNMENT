<p>Yeah.. it looks good huh? Thankz. I'm trying to find external information about the Unofficial releases, but it's kind of hard. I'm not sure if they're just fan releases that circled through P2P [etc...]. It seems some of them are releases by MP3 Rip Groups. BTW, did you add "We Do Freestyle" I added (Slug and Eyedeas) to the Title. I also found this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Atmosphere_albums" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Atmosphere_albums" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Atmosphere_albums</a> . This has to be updated at some point. I'm not sure if The Lost Live Cuts should go under Bootleg... (That's the category it was under when I found it) or under Unofficial.</p>

<p>There was a small typo under the Singles section for "Uptown Jesus". Its year was listed as (200). I changed it to (2002). The only verification that I found for it was at this website: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop/sluggoatmosphere/" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop/sluggoatmosphere/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop/sluggoatmosphere/</a> Hopefully someone can find some better verification.</p>

<p>I've removed the category "White Rappers" Since Slug is half Black and half white. "Mullato Rappers" would be a more fitting category but it's rather silly to point out.</p>

<p>Slug is not half white and half black. He has a black grandfather making him only a quarter. I think the "White Rappers" tag is appropriate.</p>
<p><br />
This is a touchy subject but since he's commonly perceived as a white rapper that would seem to be a valid categorization. [[[User:Asher14|Asher14]] 21:20, 4 March 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>Since the subject of Slug's fanbase has come up, can we broach the subject of possible misogynist readings of his lyrics? Stuff I've read and heard of his is iffy at best. I was wondering if anyone else thought about this.</p>
<p>Possible misogynist readings of his lyrics? This sounds like speculation and probably doesn't belong in the wiki. -69.225.194.195 21:20, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
That doesn't sound like a valid Wiki addition unless it's been talked about in a more formal domain (journalistically, scholarly, etc). Could you give examples of what you mean? Slug repeatedly talks about the God and Devil as being female and likes to feminize the ungendered pronoun. If anything I think he's almost paganistic in his worshipping of women. I'm intrigued to see what you are referring to.</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAsher14_4d5e.html" title="User:Asher14">Asher14</a> 21:19, 4 March 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I don't think Atmosphere is mysogenistic. I can see how it would be interpretted that way, but when you compare it more mainstream rap (like 50 Cent, Ludacris, etc.) you'll notice that not once does Slug refer to women as either "bitches" or "hos" or any of the typical rubbish you get in hip-hop. Slug's lyrics that complain about women are more based around the usual frustration that most men have towards them than mysogeny.</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>He is not a misognist - women just evoke feelings of both love and hate. Take the song "The Woman With the Tattooed Hands" he talks about how both evil and good are embodied in women. He often speaks of his own codependency issues as a reason for failed relationships. Just because he has a song like "Fuck You Lucy" where he tears his ex-girlfriend and son's mother a new one, doesn't mean he hates every women. Many more songs are dedicated to his love and lust for women. After all he's just trying to "make it cool to rap about love again"</dd>

<p>It would be great to add some audio bits. How could we do this? I've seen some pages use .ogg files. Are they full samples or just 30 sec. clips? We should add some of atmosphere essential tracks like: God's Bathroom Floor, The River, Tattooed Hands.</p>

I agree we should add audio bits but the "essential" tracks are up for debate. We'll do so when we figure out a good way.</p>

<p>Woman with the Tattooed Hands, Trying To Find A Balance, Always Coming Back Home To You, God Loves Ugly, Nothing But Sunshine and Pour Me Another would all be great audio clips, I think.</p>
<p><br />
Essential hits could also be singles: "Say Hey There" off the recent "You can't imagine how much fun we're having" and previously "Trying To Find A Balance" off "Seven's Travels".</p>
<p>Definitely "nothing but sunshine" as it was the song that started it all and i think "Always Coming Back Home To You" also</p>

<dd>It's probably not necessary: he hasn't done that many side-projects and Atmosphere has been Slug/Ant since since spawn left at the very beginning. The two stand-out projects is Deep Puddle Dynamics and Felt. Everything else is just guest-verses on random songs. For the most part, Atmosphere is synonymous with Slug, at least lyrically.</dd>

<p>Working on a related Wikiquote article, I came across this article and started to do some basic style and format cleanup, but was stymied by the extent of case, punctuation, link, date, and formatting problems, compounded by the inconsistency of album and song title spelling, case, and formatting. Normally, I would go to sources like <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">All-Music Guide</a> and Amazon.com for clarification, but I found inconsistencies there as well. I have therefore tagged this article with both {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tags, so that editors with more knowledge about this group can determine appropriate sources with which to fix these problems.

Is Slug a moniker for 'Sean Likes Ugly Girls'?</p>
<p><br />
No... well, I very much doubt it. If anything, Sean Likes Ugly Girls is a backronym of Slug <a href="../../../f/e/b/User%7EFebodyed_4080.html" title="User:Febodyed">Febodyed</a> 18:07, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Slug is the main alias of Sean Daley, (born in 1973[1]), who is an underground rapper from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The name "Slug" is derived from Sean's childhood nickname "Little Sluggo", which came from his father's nickname "Sluggo". The backronym "Sean Likes Ugly Girls" was formed from his name as the title of an unofficial 5CD set. He also goes by the name Seven which he has tattooed (as Se7en) on his forearm." - Slug article</p>
