the mere act of observing alters what happens on the subatomic level, imagine what this theory means to our preception of everyday reality. this opens up limitless possibilities. for example, Heisenberg said, "the path comes into existence only when we observe it." in other words, the observer takes part in the actual creation of the path. to have a universe that depends on the observer is both exciting and disturbing. Does the universe change everytime we alter how we view it? does the way we look at something influence our choices? in the subatomic world of the electron it does. - Quantum Leap Thinking</p>

what are morals? they are just guidlines that society has set right? well if they are guidlines why does everyone follow them. if you dont think they are guidlines the you think they are rules? if they are rules who is so powerful that they can say what you can and cant do? i believe that life is just one big waste. why live if all you are living for is to have sex, maybe some kids, and die? what is the point? if you are living a miserable life then why do you even live at all? what drives people to go to work everyday just to make enough money to get through? what would happen if everyone decided to kill themselves at the same time? there would probably just be a loser that would act like he would do it and not because that is human nature, to come out on top. everyone adheres to a moral docterine. in other words everyone gets stuck in a morality that they cant get out of. i did some research on morality and they say a society couldnt last long without morals, but if everyone is stuck in morality than they will always have morals, so you cant get a society without morals. and you cant say it would fail without doing a proper experiment, we should have one generation with no morals and see what would happen. would they destroy themselves because they are too ignorant. would they survive and become a new attitude of the human race? i am done rambling to you now, i doubt you even read this so i am going to stop wasting my time. but if you had "morals" wouldnt you have read this whole thing?</p>

<p>what is 0/0? if you express it using z then it would be 0/0=Z so Zx0=0. since anything times zero is zero then z could be infinite. but the equation could also be expressed as such, 0/Z=0 this is also showing that z can equal and infinite amount. but if this single equation has multiple answers then how can you use it to describe something? no single object is equivilent to everything. and since math is just expressing things then 0/0 shouldnt be able to express anything. or would it express everything?</p>

<p>My story written for Cassie</p>
<p><br />
there once was a man who lived in the woods and he made a</p>
<p><br />
living by slaying trees. one day he got a visitor which</p>
<p><br />
was wierd because no one ever vidited him. he was joyed at</p>
<p><br />
this visitor so he brought him in the house to have tea</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>and cookies. this visitor however was very peculiar for he</p>
<p><br />
had on a brown cloak with the hood up and all the man</p>
<p><br />
could see of this visitor was his extremely large nose and</p>
<p><br />
his amazing beard. he had a nice conversation with this</p>
<p><br />
visitor and found out his name was aaron son of arcturous.</p>
<p><br />
he also learned that aaron studied the ancient ways of the</p>
<p><br />
samuria and the jedi. aaron took off the hood of his cloak</p>
<p><br />
and looked into this mans eyes and spoke very softly, "you</p>
<p><br />
must go into the forest and find the biggest tree, there</p>
<p><br />
you will find your destiny" and aaron disappeared with the</p>
<p><br />
wind. so the man set out to find thsi great tree. after a</p>
<p><br />
long days worth of looking the man headed home empty</p>
<p><br />
handed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
when he got home he looked up and noticed that the tree 
</pre>
<p><br />
he had been looking for was right in his backyard. the man</p>
<p><br />
went overjoyed to look at teh tree. he had seen this tree</p>
<p><br />
before in a dream</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
it was a white tree and it was on fire. the tree spoke to 
</pre>
<p><br />
him with great wisdom in a voice taht sounded like the odd</p>
<p><br />
visitor he had ealier. the tree said "you must go and find</p>
<p><br />
the great winged dragon in the east and it is there you</p>
<p><br />
will find the house of a man that is the wisest of them</p>
<p><br />
all. he will tell you what you must do." the man went into</p>
<p><br />
his house and pondered what the tree had said. his mind</p>
<p><br />
told him that he should go but also in the back of his</p>
<p><br />
mind he knew he shouldnt and that he should just keep on</p>
<p><br />
doing what he had been doing for his whole life. after a</p>
<p><br />
good nights sleep he decided that he was going to go but</p>
<p><br />
he had just one question, how far west do i have to go? so</p>
<p><br />
the man went into his backyard to ask the great talking</p>
<p><br />
tree, but it was gone. the man was puzzled, how could a</p>
<p><br />
tree that big just disappear overnight? and where the hell</p>
<p><br />
do i go?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>just then a great gust of wind blew through his house</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
the misterious visitor named aaron appeard again and 
</pre>
<p><br />
said "did you not listen to the tree? you go west silly</p>
<p><br />
until you get to a great castle it is there you will find</p>
<p><br />
the dragon that will tell you where to find thet house."</p>
<p><br />
the man shrugged his shoulders and set off with his</p>
<p><br />
rations of food and water. it was a long road but after a</p>
<p><br />
few months of traveling he finally found the castle of the</p>
<p><br />
dragon</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>and then he stepped inside and the dragon smiled at him</p>
<p><br />
with glistenign white teeth. hello said the dragon. you</p>
<p><br />
are looking for a house are you not? the man replied why</p>
<p><br />
yes i am! so the dragon spoke the directions to the house</p>
<p><br />
to the man in a soothing voice that sounded vaugly</p>
<p><br />
familiar. the man set off again to get to the house. when</p>
<p><br />
he got the the house he saw a man in a brown cloak. and</p>
<p><br />
from here there are three alternate endings:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
1) the man in the brown cloak told him his name was aaron</p>
<p><br />
and the man astonished asked him why he just traveled all</p>
<p><br />
this way to meet him. aaron replieed you have played my</p>
<p><br />
game AND NOW ITS TIME TO DIE!!! and aaron killed the man</p>
<p><br />
with a swift swing of his lightsword.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2) aaron replied that he was in search of a husband for</p>
<p><br />
his daughter and that he had come across him in a vision</p>
<p><br />
and he was the purest of men. aaron had chosen the man to</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>marry his daughter and they lived happily ever after....</p>
<p><br />
3)Aaron and the guy sat down for a wonderful feast of a dinner, but it turns out Aaron is evil and poisoned the guy so he died a slow painful death and his spirit haunted Aaron for the rest of his life...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE END!</p>
