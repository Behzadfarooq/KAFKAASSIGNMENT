The problem is, the only good way to learn chemistry is to learn through a series of simpler outdated models then add details and new discoveries along the way.

<p>I think there needs to be a different page for each part of this. Atomic orbitals, their own page, Electron configuration, their own page, and etc. It would help separate different parts of the Atomic structure. I'm doing research on one specific part: Atomic Orbitals, and when all of the information is meshed, it keeps it from being allowed to be expanded upon. I don't know, just putting in my two cents.--- JulieRaven</p>
<p>I agree with User:JulieRaven - the articles need to be kept separate - they are all quite long as it is - although there is quite a lot of duplication between them I think this to be expected as they all cover closely related topics. As for a place to start the explanation of electron shells - how about with the first experimental evidence for them - I think this was Balmer/Lyman lines in the sun's spectra - this leads to (amongst others) Bohr's model of the atom (first example of a theory involving quantisation?) and eventually to quantum theory. I think it is important to include the experimental data/physical phenomana in an explanation of a model that attempts to explain it - if these lines in the spectrum hadn't been found we wouldn't have this article in the first place...HappyVR 20:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've amplified the introduction to say what an orbital is, and is not, and linked to the electron configuration and periodic table pages. The former page duplicates quite a bit of this one, but why not? Having the same material in several places may not be efficient storage wise, but can help the reader. Similarly, I reckon its helpful to have large topics slpit into smaller pages, so wouldn't want to consolidate everything together. I've also clarified the description of the p and d atomic orbitals, and their relation to the orbital's energy - it isn't the shape that determines it, but the detail of the probability density in the radial direction.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan___2b16.html" title="User:Ian**">Ian</a> 10:02, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Below is a link to a video produced by astronauts at the international space station that shows wave patterns in a very large sphere of water (something not attainable on Earth). It reminded me of the various orbitals within an atom. It would be particularly useful for demonstrating the electron wave patterns of hydrogen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHLwla2WiI" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHLwla2WiI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHLwla2WiI</a></p>
<p>Notice that at 0 &amp; 180 deg. to the initial energy pulse, the oscillations resembled a p-orbital along that axis, but the globule retains the basic (lower energy) spherical shape throughout the course of its vibration, and eventually comes to rest back at that ground state (you can almost pick out the other two p-orbitals as well, but they are not well resolved. Also, the multitude of concentric rings running up and down the axis of the initial pulse seem to me to resemble one of the possible d-orbitals (d<sub>Subscript z</sub><sup>Superscript 2</sup>) and f-orbitals (I think it is the f<sub>Subscript x</sub>)<sup>Superscript 3</sup><sub>Subscript - 3/5xr</sub><sup>Superscript 2</sup>). These patterns are all simultaneously present, oscillating from one orbital type to another and back again, or even appearing and vanishing again. I found it very interesting to see the one lobe of the p-orbital mimetic appearing in one direction, and then vanishing again as the lobe in the opposite direction appears.</p>
<p>These vibrational patterns appear to me to be analogous to an atom absorbing a photon, kicking an electron to a higher orbital, followed by the atom relaxing back to its ground state as it remits the photon and that orbital shape dissapears (although the possibility for the orbital to reappear is always present when the next photon interacts with it).</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see the result of using a more energentic pulse to initiate the globual's vibration. I suspect that at higher energy, a smaller water droplet would be ejected from the larger globual, similar to what is observed with the photoelectric effect, where only photons with sufficient energy can kick electrons from a metal plate to complete a circuit.</p>
<p>Many students find the entire subject to be confusing in the extreme, and seem to fixate on the idea that these orbitals are solid, tangible objects hiding under the surface of the atom like steel girders in a building). Perhaps this video could help (assuming no one here finds serious fault with my interpretation).</p>
<p>There are some other very interesting videos on cymatics (the study of wave behavior) given below:</p>

<p>The discussion regarding the shapes of orbitals is not complete until the Heisenberg picture view of the Hydrogen atom (and more generally: the Kepler problem) is included. The two sets of parameters that determine an orbit's shape and size in the classical Kepler problem (angular momentum and eccentricity/direction of closest approach) have magnitudes that assume perfectly well-defined eigenvalues in the quantum version of the Kepler problem for each orbital state; hence the shape of the orbital is, itself, well-defined. The uncertaintly actually applies to the orientation of the orbit, not its shape or size.</p>
<p>In the quantized problem the two vectors generate a constrained version of SO(4) (hence the term "Hydrogen SO(4)"); or E(3) for parabolic orbits, or SO(3,1) for hyperbolic orbits. Both the eccentricity e and the magnitude of the angular momentum |L| assume eigenvalues in the orbital states. The orbital shapes resulting from the eigenvalues both supersede and refine those that had historically been associated with the Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits; namely that the major axis (a) is proportional to the square of the energy number n; the semilatus rectum is proportional to 1 + l(l + 1) (in contrast to Bohr-Sommerfeld's l squared), where l is the angular momentum quantum number. The terms in the correction 1 + l to the Bohr-Sommerfeld figure arise, respectively, from the uncertainty in the direction of the closest approach, and in the components of the angular momentum.</p>
<p>More generally, there should be a discussion concerning the Heisenberg picture and Hydrogen SO(4) -- either directly here, or provided by a link. -- Mark, 23 October 2006 '<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.89.32.142 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.89.32.142.html" title="User talk:129.89.32.142">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.89.32.142_17e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.89.32.142">contribs</a>).</small>'</p>

<dd>Hi Mark, the way you describe it here is probably too much for a high-school student (which probably use the wikipedia more to increase their knowledge than people with a degree in quantum mechanics), but I do agree, a good and complete picture is necessary. Could you write either a paragraph about this subject, or indeed maybe a new articles, e.g. something like atomic orbital shape and molecular orbital shape?

<p>I'm distressed by these modifications. I don't have the expertise to corroborate or dispute their factual correctness, but one thing is clear: they're inaccessible to anyone without extensive training in mathematics and quantum mechanics. Wikipedia is not a physics reference text; it's supposed to be written so as to be readable by as many people as possible. The corrections should be written into a special section, and the remainder of the article be left as it was. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 02:31, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that we should go back to the simpler first paragraph. Talking about slater determinants right up front is way out of line. People who read this may not even know what a wavefunction is. But the rest of the changes look good, and the info in the new first paragraph can be moved down to another section. <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfalstad_5494.html" title="User:Pfalstad">Pfalstad</a> 03:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem with the older first paragraph was that is was simply false. Moreover an atomic orbital is a wave function. Thus it is quite difficult to discuss about an atomic orbital without referring to the concept of wavefunction. Of course one can make it more pedagogic but pay attention not to write anything false. --131.220.68.177 12:01, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe the section Hydrogen-like atoms should be moved to the article <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">Hydrogen atom</a> or to a new article which could be "derivation of the hydrogen atom formulae" which solution would be preferred since the article <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">Hydrogen atom</a> is very good as it stands and should not be expanded anymore.</p>
<p>Atomic orbitals are quite different from the eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atoms are one electron atoms only and this is a big conceptual difference. Of course one can use the Hydrogen atom eigenfunctions as atomic orbitals but one does not have to. In practice one often does not! --131.220.68.177 08:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Two important points:
<ol>
<li>Hydrogen wavefunctions are indeed different from the wavefunctions seen in more-complex atoms, but they're an important special case, and should IMHO be retained here.</li>
<li>Hydrogen wavefunctions are not unique to hydrogen. Ions such as <span class="texhtml"><i>H</i><i>e</i> <sup>+</sup></span> or <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><i>i</i> <sup>+ 2</sup></span> may be oddities that occur primarily in physics textbooks, but they do exist. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 02:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry for the neologism. See <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">Internet slang</a>.</dd>
<dd>The partial derivation (it's neither complete nor a proof) is found here because, as I said above, these things are not unique to hydrogen. They're also found (in a somewhat more general form) in one-electron <i>ions</i> such as <span class="texhtml"><i>H</i><i>e</i> <sup>+</sup></span> . Though these ions are exceeedingly rare here on earth, they probably occur in larger quantities in space, and at any rate, the natural occurrence of a substance is of little theoretical consequence. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 18:14, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason why this result can be found in almost all textbooks (and also in the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">hydrogen atom</a> article by the way) is because the atomic orbitals used is practice are often <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slater-type_orbitals.html" title="Slater-type orbitals">Slater-type orbitals</a> but with some <i>Z</i> different from the actual charge of the nuclei.</dd>

<dd>So, if hydrogen-like orbitals (or Slater-type, or one-electron, or whatever you want to call them) are used in LCAO, isn't that by itself justification enough to talk about them in a general article?</dd>
<dd>Why do you insist on calling this derivation a 'proof'? A proof always starts with the thing to be proven. Even if it is not used explicitly as a starting point in a series of transformations, the end result is always given beforehand.</dd>
<dd>More to the point, why must all derivations given on the wiki be complete? You still haven't given me a reason, but I can give you a list of reasons to the contrary:
<ol>
<li>Most people don't care about all of the messy mathematical details, and shouldn't be forced to scroll through them.</li>
<li>Many people who do care about the mathematical details probably already own at least one physics reference text that outlines the derivation in sufficient detail.</li>
<li>But, you say to #1, we can put the full derivation on a separate page. To that I reply that people like you and I have more valuable things to do with our wiki-time than to code pages and pages of TeX. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 00:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well I agree with you we don't need it so suppress it because what this paragraph is all about is explaining people a bright example of separation of variables which is summarized in the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">hydrogen atom</a> article and can be found in any low level text book! Do you really think someone interested in atomic orbitals wants to know something about how to derive their mathematical formula in the very special case of hydrogen-like atom - information which can be found easily on wikipedia anyway --81.209.204.11 08:16, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, what do you mean by 'it' and by 'this paragraph'?</dd>
<dd>Honestly, I don't care much more than a rat's thighbone about whether or not a particular bit of information is contained <i>somewhere</i> on the wiki. I often like to ask myself: should this information be contained <i>here</i>; does it really belong in that other place where someone has decided to put it; and how likely is it that someone will come here looking for it and not be able to find it? In my opinion, there are two good places to put that derivation: here, or in a separate article called Hydrogen-like orbital or something to that effect. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 15:27, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry I agree my English was not that bright! <i>It</i> and <i>this paragraph</i> both mean the <i>Hydrogen-like atoms</i> paragraph. Thus I see we begin to agree&#160;: we could put this info in a new article named <i>Hydrogen-like atom</i> -- hydrogen-like orbital is equivalent to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slater-type_orbital.html" title="Slater-type orbital">Slater-type orbital</a>. I would suggest you to merge this with <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">hydrogen atom</a> but this is just my opinion.--81.209.204.4 15:39, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm still concerned that the pictures associated with this text as well as some of the links (appear to) show incorrect (ie non degenerate) d orbitals - I can't see the point of including an image for visualisation purposes if the image gives the wrong impression. I refer to [electon_orbitals.png] and also the external link "the orbitron" and "David Manthey's Orbital Viewer renders orbitals with n ≤ 30" also gives incorrect d orbitals - I can't check the other links at the moment. Previously I added a warning to the external links but that was removed.HappyVR 19:37, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
