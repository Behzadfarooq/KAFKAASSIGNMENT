<p>Using a mass of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_dwarf_star.html" title="White dwarf star">white dwarf star</a> matter, he fashioned a <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lens_%28optics%29.html" title="Lens (optics)">lens</a> that enabled him to shrink any object to any degree he wished. However, any object so treated soon exploded as a side effect, which obviously precluded any practical use of the lens.</p>

Ray Palmer (back) with his girlfriend/wife Jean Loring.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelunking.html" title="Spelunking">spelunking</a> expedition, Palmer and his friends found themselves trapped in the cave when the entrance collapsed. In desperation, Palmer secretly used the lens he carried with him to shrink himself down in order to be able to climb to a small hole high in the wall that led to the outside, knowing full well he would likely explode himself being so treated. Using a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engagement_ring.html" title="Engagement ring">engagement ring</a>, he enlarged the hole sufficiently and descended to the floor to try to alert the others of the escape route before dying. However, upon entering the lens' beam, he found himself returned to normal size. As the lens was covered with cave moisture, Palmer thought it altered the beam to allow this strange effect. When subsequent experiments showed no change with the explosions, Palmer concluded that there must be some mysterious force in his own body that allowed him to be shrunk safely and later returned to normal. He decided to use this effect to become a superhero.</p>
<p>Ray Palmer created a belt tool, from what was initially depicted as <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_dwarf_star.html" title="White dwarf star">white dwarf star</a> matter, which allows him to shrink down to subatomic size. Furthermore, he developed a special costume that he can wear at most times that only became visible when he shrunk significantly. In addition, he developed new equipment that allowed him to instantly alter his molecular density to whatever degree he desired. This allowed him to glide on air currents on a low setting, while a high setting allowed him to handle or strike objects with the equivalent strength of his normal size and build. However, a favorite travel method he had was to call some location on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> and when the intended phone was answered, Palmer could shrink down enough to literally travel through the phone lines in seconds to emerge out of the answering phone.</p>
<p>Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from mechanisms in his belt with a back up device in his gloves. He carried out the bulk of his early superheroic adventures in his home of Ivy Town, New York where he often helped his girlfriend, lawyer <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Loring_5c00.html" title="Jean Loring">Jean Loring</a>, win her cases. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers with his own body.</p>
<p>He has been a member of several incarnations of the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a>, and the team was gracious enough to supply a special chair scaled to his default size which could elevate to whatever height needed so he could easily partake in team meetings without having to go out of costume. There, he met <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkman.html" title="Hawkman">Hawkman</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkman_%28Katar_Hol%29_d347.html" title="Hawkman (Katar Hol)">Katar Hol</a> pre-<i><a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkworld.html" title="Hawkworld">Hawkworld</a></i>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkman_%28Carter_Hall%29_e282.html" title="Hawkman (Carter Hall)">Carter Hall</a> post-<i>Hawkworld</i>), one of his closest friends in the superhero community. Neither character appears regularly in comics, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, often with Palmer as a specialist who was needed to access extremely confined areas only he could access although he has had several short-lived series.</p>

</div>
<p>One of them was a four-issue <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_series.html" title="Limited series">limited series</a> and three subsequent specials all entitled <i>Sword of the Atom</i>, in which he abandoned civilization and became a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_the_Barbarian_bf04.html" title="Conan the Barbarian">Conan</a>-like figure, hero of a tribe of six-inch tall yellow-skinned humanoid aliens in the jungles of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>).</p>
<p>Eventually the colony was destroyed by loggers despite Palmer's attempts to stop it, and he was forced to escape via the telephone to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. In the attempt, he failed to anticipate that the connection would involve <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_satellite.html" title="Artificial satellite">satellite</a> relay and the unexpectedly arduous trip caused him to remain at approximately three feet high and without his costume's size changing equipment. With the help of a friend, Ray created a new costume from the material of the white dwarf star. This time, instead of a belt, Ray used an encephalotronic grid in the costume's headpiece to control the costume. The grid is keyed to his unique brainwaves. This enabled him to transfer his mass into an unknown dimension which allows him to alter his size and weight just by thinking about it. He could even make the new costume appear or disappear with a thought by shifting most of its atoms to or from the other dimension. This allows him to be in costume while at full height or to shrink without having to have his costume appear. He could even increase his weight while remaining six inches tall or reduce his weight while remaining at full size. Ray would often do this and would then be light enough to ride wind currents, where he would appear as if he was actually flying to a limited degree. Ray also developed a mental link with the white dwarf matter to which he has been regularly exposed. Most of the mass lies within another dimension. Ray can draw upon that mass and hit with a super-concussive force. He has been shown to punch through concrete walls, crush an exam table and break an axel of a car that was moving at high speed.</p>
<p>Later, during the events of <i><a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Hour_%28comics%29_4444.html" title="Zero Hour (comics)">Zero Hour</a></i>, Palmer was rejuvenated to a teenage state, and became a mentor of the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans_%28comics%29.html" title="Titans (comics)">Titans</a>. He subsequently regained his original age and memories.</p>
