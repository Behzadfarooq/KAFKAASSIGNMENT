<p>I have tried to expand the bit on Judaism a bit. Someone better informed than me about Judaism specifically might want to change and add more information to that section.</p>
<p>Does Islam have a doctrine of atonement, specifically? This might be another useful addition here. ---<a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Ihcoyc</a></p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better to move all this material to the article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>? These two topics (sin and atonement) really should be discussed together. We could then redirect this title to <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>

While these two subjects may go hand in hand with each other (maybe even more so for Judaism), these subjects also go hand in hand with many other religious subjects. And other Wikipedia article-subjects also go hand in hand with other article-subjects, but Wikipedia generally doesn't merge articles merely because they go hand in hand. There needs to be a compelling reason demonstrated first why subjects each with their own unique concepts should be merged before they actually are merged. That has not been done. I could agree that maybe a separate article called Sin and Atonement is needed IN ADDITION to articles for each subject, but as it is, even the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">Sin</a> article is not properly titled for its subject matter! <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a> 18:19, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added four theories of atonement in Christian theology, leaving them primarily blank, for future elucidation by myself and/or other editors. These are not written in stone, obviously; I took the four from Miley's classic work. The categorization of the four seems fair to me, but, as always, I'm open for discussion. Hope this helps us develop an excellent article. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 3 July 2005 21:35 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has been greatly improved, but it's an outline for a history of systematic theology, for Christ's sake. It'll be too long (just the outline alone is too long, by wiki-standards). For myself, in my more Christian moments, I follow Paul that Jesus was a new human being, the New Adam, and why this sinless immortal being of the flesh died gets very complicated, and does not make much sense anymore.</p>
<p>I suggest a strong (but brief) thesis statement be made, indicating the centrality of the Atonement to Christian doctrine.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertC_b5b0.html" title="User:RobertC">RobertC</a>, excellent summarization of the untidy LDS discussion about the atonement. I didn't realize how messy it was until you added those formatted bullets. As a result, I believe the LDS perspective seems to be represented somewhat more coherently and lends accessibility to these beliefs. I do have to say, as bulleted, "God's limited omnipotence" sounds paradoxical. I understand where you're going with this...meaning that God the Father couldn't atone for us, so He sent a messenger, Christ, and thus God's power is really not "all-powerful", but pretty much as powerful as you can get given delegation and free agency...which I think if I read you right, you intimated that the inherent limitations to omnipotence begin at personal choice (free agency), obviously of which God cannot change except by persuasion. I think it's important to note that God not only created agency/autonomy for humanity, but that He respects and universally protects it as well (most likely by the power of the atonement) as a means to eternal progression. Overall, I'm surprised LDS views of the atonement have not yet been challenged on this discussion page. I think an inter-faith discussion of the atonement would be healthy. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 17:51, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came across this article for the first time the other day and was surprised by the partisan nature of it - too much was written with one or another obvious predisposition to the topic. I tried to tidy it a bit so that opinions on each theory were instead kept to the appropriate pages on each theory (although I admit these need a bit of work). I also removed the LDS section as this did not relate directly to the bare bones of the definition of atonement, and secondly represents a fairly minor off-shoot of the Christian faith. Thus I didn't see the justification of having an LDS section if there wasn't a JW section, Scientology section etc.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a> 13:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm happy an interfaith discussion has begun. I'm okay with your rewording of the first paragraph. The essentials are there. My concern was that Christ should be in the very first sentence for obvious reasons, and He is. I'm afraid, <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a>, that your deletions of LDS perspectives of the atonement are unwarranted for many reasons (bulleted below). You opened a can of worms there. The religions you mentioned—or any others that advance particular concepts of the atonement—bear the responsibility of including their own particular beliefs. Exclusion on the basis of a failure of other faiths to balance out the LDS perspective is, well, exclusionary, and it's not right. I see other sections on varying theological perspectives of the atonement waiting to be grown! If it gets too big, we can spin off faith-specific articles as direct links.

<dl>
<dd>Firstly I'm sorry if my editing was perceived as "trigger happy". Secondly, I am fully aware that the atonement has been the source of much debate in the past, and as such I think any "encyclopedia" should represent the most neutral, hostorically based account possible. As such, in my earlier attempt to edit, I tried to remove the parts that I thought were related to individual theories, and thus just leave the most general definition. As an example, saying that the atonement in THE central doctrine of Christianity is actually far more Anselmian than Abelardian. Similarly I think many would argue that doctrines such as the trinity are as equally important as atonement, and thus calling atonement A central doctrine of Christianity is far more justified. Similarly references that mankind is in need of "physical repair", or to be "reunited to God" are again based on individual theories rather than the central concept. Thus I do actually think my editing of the initial paragraph was entirely justified in order to remove doctrinal bias to the initial definition. (For the record I take a Girardian view on the whole issue but figured if people wanted to read about Girard they can find the Girard page themselves!).--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Skolstoe</a> 10:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding my deletion of the LDS points. Firstly you actually say that LDS doctrine is based on an "expansion of the substitutionary atonement concept". Surely this means that the whole section should be included on the substitutionary atonement page rather that the top atonement page? Secondly, although many Americans may think so, the USA is not the entire world! Infact if I hadn't of actually grown up in Lingfield in the UK (the site of one of the few Mormon temples in Europe) I wouldn't have even heard of them. As such, and despite what you say about the popularity of Mormonism in the US, it IS historically and currently a rather small spin-off of Christian tradition . Again I have no problems with you including your beliefs on the appropriate page, however having a whole section on mormonism on the top atonement page sounds an awful lot like an attempt to proselytise rather than give a good general explanantion of atonement.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Skolstoe</a> 10:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have had fairly bad experiences in the past talking about doctrine/religious issues with people who find it difficult to recognise the difference between their own personal view AND the context within which that view is held. This was the original reason why I attempted to edit the atonement article; simply because I could perceive strong bias in some of what was written. Now granted everyone is guilty of not understanding enough about their own background most of the time, however the distance between a post-modern approach and that from a late-modern philosophical background (which Mormonism reprsents) is such that right from the start misunderstandings can be had. For instance, Piewalker says above that his reversion constitutes a "community reprisal", immediately suggesting that his point of view constitutes the dominant narrative. Similarly since only a relatively few (mostly mormon) people have contributed to this page, again we find bias towards a dominant view. Now do not get me wrong, I think dominant views are important, HOWEVER I do not see the purpose of a general article on atonement to be that of specifically spelling out one viewpoint. As I said before, lets put that in the relevant sub-article.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Skolstoe</a> 13:49, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The expanded view of the atonement should be summarized here as it is a notable miniority view - I add the complementary after reading the substitutionary atonement article - and agree that the details could be fleshed out there. However, I think the dominant view reflects the interests of those editing the article, and there would be no objection to adding more information to give the article more interdenominational balance, and their limited knowledge of other views of the atonement. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 14:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Skolstoe</a>: I can imagine that my narrative comes across as "dominating." So does yours. Articulate people usually come across that way, and I've been dealing with that my whole life. And so we find ourselves in a debate. Our senses are most certainly shaped from our scripting, moral development, academic cultivation, and how we choose to respond to others. We are poised to expose flaws in each other's defenses. It's natural. My community reprisal comment was a cautionary note to you to expect resistance with edit jobs like yours. Deletion, the sweeping away of an entire section, not to mention minimizing the LDS Church as an "off-shoot," as if it is an anomolous irrelevancy in the grand scope of religious consequence, is not a good-faith action. Your argument is that this article seems biased. There are many other viewpoints present in the article. The LDS one is the most fleshed out. You have chosen to focus on its prominence, not its accuracy and relevance to the topic and how it advances our understanding of the Atonement. You have certainly not emphasized the importance of developing competing viewpoints, as have I. I very much look forward to others, and plan to contribute to them. We need more competent thinkers here. You are one of them. I ask you kindly to contribute to this article and relax your antagonism, else we find ourselves within the war of words, a maze of meanings, a dark labyrinth. It is best to rely on scripture, from which the doctrine of Atonement solely originates, though other sources are extraordinarily illuminating. I'm sure you have some now waiting to be appended faithfully. The doctrine presented in this article and the scriptures originates not from me or you. Our interpretation of it is certainly of consequence. Competing interpretations must have a forum for expression. This article (and this very talk page) is the perfect place for engendering such a discussion. Deleting entire sections of text that has been carefully developed by our community over the course of months and years is not the answer to the unambiguous goal of progressing this article.

<dd>As for the start of the article, I still maintain that the paragraph I wrote is a fairer take on the subject because not everyone agrees that a) atonement was initiated by Jesus Christ, b) that atonement was needed at all in a mechanistic sense c) that it is indeed the central doctrine of Christianity, d) what exactly the phrase "come to Christ" means, and e), that atonement is THE central doctrine of Christianity. Secondly, the whole paragraph relating to "Need for a Redeemer" is straight out of the Anselmian satisfaction view and would not be accepted by more liberal scholars, so thus should be under the satisfaction heading, NOT the main atonement heading.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Skolstoe</a> 15:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that the "Need for a Redeemer" paragraph is unnecessary.

<dd>I like the section, not just because I created it, but because it attempts to approach the rationale for Atonement and the need for a redeemer. This is probably described in other articles, so if anyone can find a link, say to the Fall of Adam or something similar, then we could dichotomize the content, abbreviate the remainder, and let it be absorbed by the other sections in this article. That is, of course, there isn't an overwhelming move to keep it. If so, speak now. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 17:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Atomement is first and foremost a word that means nothing to two thirds of the worlds population and should be introduced from a neutral perspective.</p>

<p>This is not a religious text and matters of faith should not be touted as fact. The religious particulars of the concept of Atonement belong in the "The Atonement in Christianity" section.

<p>Seeing as there is now quite a lot in the article from a Jewish perspective, could I suggest combining the "atonement in Judaism" section with the initial introduction, so that it reads something like:</p>
<p>The Atonement is a doctrine found within both Christianity and Judaism. It describes how humankinds sin can be redeemed before God. In Judaism Atonement is said to be the process of forgiving or pardoning a transgression. The Holiest day in the Jewish year is the Day of Atonement known as Yom Kippur. In Christianity Atonement refers to the redemptive death of Jesus Christ making possible a reconciliation between God and creation. Within Christianity there have been numerous theories of Atonement put forward by theologians, with the most popular including the ransom theory, the Anselmian theory and the Abelardian theory.</p>

<p>I would suggest the material in the <b>perspectives</b> section specific to the LDS beliefs belongs in a separate article. To create this article click here.

<p>I think we don't need a seperate article on the LDS view until there is significant enough text to warrant splitting the article - in which case it will still need to be summarized and use the {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} template to direct readers to additional information - currenlty there just isn't enough material to warrant all that. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 18:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not going to do this now as I imagine others will have something to say, however could I suggest removing the entire section "The Atonement in Christianity" in favour of just keeping the later section entitled "Atonement theories in Christianity" which has the relevant links. Then, perhaps someone can perhaps take Lurkers suggestion of adding a new page called something like Atonement in Mormonism etc. I'll then add a page (or perhaps edit the page on Rene Girard) to include his particular atonement theory--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a> 11:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your suggestion <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a>. <i>The Atonement in Christianity</i> section is not theory-based that requires a hypothesis to be tested. It's a belief system. Theories come from the academic realm, and we're not in school here. A host of Christian beliefs here are simply stated, although they are certainly not complete, but it's an adequate overview nonetheless. If we remove the section as you propose, I believe the overall meaning of the Atonement according to the Christian world would be improperly diluted because it would not be represented within the very topic it's addressing. So again I petition you and others: please contribute. I find it disconcerting you'd like to delete the entire thing all over again, just as you did before. The section you speak of, which you had previously removed on your own (and from your intentions cited above overtly indicate you'd still like to), frankly doesn't require removal, merging into another article, or the creation of another article because this content is appropriate for reasons I have extensively argued above. I really wish we had more voices on this issue representing still other positions other than <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">myself</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel">Trödel</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a>, and <a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker">Lurker</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 14:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I don't see much point in a split at present; there's not the material at present to justify it, and everything here seems to be reasonably related to the root concept. OTOH, it could do with considerable reworking. Can I suggest for one thing that the Judaism section be placed earlier, and better-connected with the discussion of Hebrew terminology as related to the etymology of the Christian terminology? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just because the article is short does not mean that material that is best placed on another page deserves to be where it is. I agree that perhaps the whole thing should be re-worked to take into account the Jewish view, and thus maybe citing atonement as a "Christian" doctrine could be slightly misleading in the introduction.</dd>
<dd>Either way, the section entitled "Atonement in Christianity" is a biased POV based section, and until Piwalker can come up with answers to my criticism voiced below, I am going to revert it.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a> 17:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The paragraph:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>"The Atonement was necessary to compensate and reverse the fall of Adam, as noted in Christian scripture. In 1 Corinthians 15:22, Paul wrote: “As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” Christ therefore submitted voluntarily as the mediating representative for both humanity and God to answer the ends of the law previously transgressed by Adam. Paul taught that “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; … this mortal must put on immortality” (1 Corinthians 15:50–53)."</i></p>
<p>... has a strong bias towards Anselmian theory, and thus is NOT general to the subject of atonement. Furthermore the passage is also ambiguous regarding whether or not "the fall" is an allegorical representation of the human condition (as Abelardians would contend), or is something to be taken literally. Thus this paragraph does not belong where it is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to declare <i>why</i> there is a "strong bias" toward that theory and not others. Plus, you didn't explain away the 1 Cor substantiation of that position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Mediating representative"??? Similarly the need for a "literal Adam" is entirely necessary for the logic that if one man caused the fall, one man is needed to redeem the fall (hence the idea of substitution!!).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the next paragraph, the phrase:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>"The Atonement is a perceived to be a crowning doctrine in Christianity that also attempts to answer why God the Son condescended to live upon Earth as a human man, born to the virgin Mary as the human baby Jesus, and the need for an intercession for the human family."</i></p>
<p>... would also not be agreed by all people. Again a large number of liberal scholars would suggest that Jesus' example was as much a revelation as his death, and indeed that some branches of Christianity have become too "death orientated". Thus it is not universally agreed that soteriology and the atonement act are entirely the same thing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is perceived by the majority of Christians. If it is not "agreed" by "all people", explain their position instead of deleting it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just did explain the alternative position by saying "...would suggest that Jesus' example was as much a revelation as his death, and indeed that some branches of Christianity have become too "death orientated"..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>"As a preamble to the Atonement, Christ ministered to organize His church, taught love, faith, hope, kindness, forbearance, pacifism, to bear one another's burdens, repentence, forgiveness, baptism, and endeavored to overcome the sins of the world through the Atonement by fulfilling the ends of the laws of heaven, which Christ is said to have established with direction from the Father. This was summarily accomplished through his preeminant example of perfection, overcoming temptation, descending below all things (including the Crucifixion), and overcoming the the world by making all things new physically (resurrection) and spiritually (salvation)."</i></p>
<p>...this is a specific faith position about Jesus himself rather than being specifically relevant to atonement per se.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jesus enabled the atonement. One cannot have a conversation of the atonement without mentioning Who accomplished it. Christ was (and is) the atonement in Christianity, and the Bible does not disentangle Christ from the atonement; He is the atonement personified—they're inextricably connected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we are going to expand the article to consider the Jewish definition of atonement then Jesus is clearly not entirely necessary for ALL accounts of the atonement. Again you are letting your personal theology get in the way of this being a balanced article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Finally:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>"Many Christian denominations believe the Atonement was finished with the suffering and execution of Christ on the cross, and still others believe it was finished with the resurrection. Nevertheless, Christians largely believe the infinite Atonement is considered to be accomplished, forever unlocking the gates of heaven to the human family."</i></p>
<p>...Although this is the only section of the paragraph I think is OK, I might want to replace the reference to heaven with perhaps a reference to reconciliation, and perhaps include the idea in the opening paragraph of the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So why did you delete the whole thing if you thought this part was "OK"? Additionally, reconciliation is not a synonym for heaven. Heaven is used in the Bible. Let's stick to that. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 16:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Indeed the scholar <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Wright_d76c.html" title="Tom Wright">Tom Wright</a> is quite famous for his escatological work in explaining the concept of heaven not as some "place that you go when you die" but rather as a spiritual position before God. --<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a> 18:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/o/Talk%7EAtonement_d76f.html" title="Edit section: Roman Catholic view">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roman Catholic view</span></h4>
<p>Held by the majority of Christians, the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> view is that Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience (the Gospels show him struggling with this in the <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gethsemane.html" title="Gethsemane">Garden of Gethsemane</a>), atoning for the disobedience of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a>, and thus cleansing Mankind of the stain of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a>. Jesus's sacrifice was an offering of love that pleased God more than man's sin offended God, so now all who believe in Jesus and keep his commandments may receive salvation in his name, see also <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Commission_a9b6.html" title="Great Commission">Great Commission</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>.</p>
<p>Catholics believe one can fall from grace again if one continues to sin after being saved. One can be restored to grace through the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament.html" title="Sacrament">Sacrament</a> of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">Penance</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconciliation.html" title="Reconciliation">Reconciliation</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">Confession</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/o/Talk%7EAtonement_d76f.html" title="Edit section: Judicial view">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judicial view</span></h4>
<p>By contrast, the Catholic view off-shoot titled the <i>judicial view</i> was held by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>, and a major cause of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a>. It is held by the majority of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a>.</p>
<p>This view emphasizes God as Judge. Humanity had sinned and God was therefore required, in His justice, to punish humankind. However, God sent His Son, who was sinless, to take the sin of the world on his shoulders, so that anyone who accepted the gift of Jesus's act could be freed from the consequences of his sin, without violating God's judgement.</p>
<p>The result is that through Christ's death, the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Old Covenant</a> passed away and all things became new in a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Covenant_e0e4.html" title="New Covenant">New Covenant</a>. The veil separating man and God was torn, and the people were free to work out their own salvation through the only true Mediator, Jesus Christ, rather than seeking salvation through rituals, rules, or an exclusive priesthood. People who hold this view generally believe that only acceptance of Christ's sacrifice is necessary for salvation, not a ritual or a sacrament. See also <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antinomianism.html" title="Antinomianism">Antinomianism</a>.</p>
<p>This view of the theological significance of Jesus's resurrection is analogous to the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Kippur_c0e4.html" title="Yom Kippur">Day of Atonement</a>, by which the sins of the Israelites were put onto a flawless scapegoat, who was then released into the wilderness, taking the sins of the people with him.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/o/Talk%7EAtonement_d76f.html" title="Edit section: Christus Victor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christus Victor</span></h4>
<p>The Christus Victor view, which is more common among Lutherans (see, e.g. G. Aulen's book Christus Victor), and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Christians, holds that Jesus was sent by God to defeat death and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>. Because of his perfection, voluntary death, and Resurrection, Jesus defeated Satan and death, and arose victorious. Therefore humanity was no longer bound in sin, but was free to rejoin God through faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Judicial view, the Christus Victor model emphasizes a spiritual battle between good and evil. This battle is on a cosmic scale. The Judicial view would require Christians to believe that God voluntarily punished Jesus for their sins, whereas the Christus Victor view sees humanity as formerly in the power of Satan, who was defeated by Jesus; and God, through Jesus, broke us out of Satan's power.</p>
<p>The Christus Victor sometimes has also been used to argue that Jesus defeated sin and death for everyone, whether or not they hear of Jesus, granting non-Christians the chance of eternal life (or a guarantee thereof, depending on the particular theology in question).</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/o/Talk%7EAtonement_d76f.html" title="Edit section: First Man view">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Man view</span></h4>
<p>The First Man view, held by a small minority of Christians, especially <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelagianism.html" title="Pelagianism">Pelagians</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semipelagianism.html" title="Semipelagianism">Semi-Pelagians</a>, states that Jesus was a person just like the rest of humanity, but due to his remarkable faith, purity, sinlessness, and perfection, he <i>earned</i> eternal life, and was resurrected because Death could not hold him. They also believe that by following his teachings and example others may also ultimately earn eternal life.</p>
<p>The First Man view can be compared with the Old-Testament stories of <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch.html" title="Enoch">Enoch</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>, who walked with God to such a degree of faithfulness that they were not required to die. Enoch 'was no more,' and Elijah was carried in a whirlwind. In the same way, Jesus was faithful to such a degree, that even though he was killed, his Faith earned him Eternal Life. And in the same way, if we are faithful to the same degree, we can also be free from death.</p>

<p>The theory of the atonement as understood by the Church of Jesus Christ of LDS - is so differnt it should be listed as a seperate theory rather than a "perspective" - any thoughts? --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 21:56, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will admit a certain level of ignorance on this one as my knowledge of the Mormon doctrine of atonement is based solely on the section in the article. However, I do not see how the Mormon doctrine described in the article does actually differ from other views already expressed in other theories. To take the four bullet points under the LDS section already in the article:
<ul>
<li><i>Suffering in Gethsemane</i> - I do not think this is an important enough point to even merit a mention.</li>
<li><i>The relationship of justice, mercy, agency, and God's unconditional love.</i> - this is exactly the same as the substitution view.</li>
<li><i>No need for infant baptism</i> - this is a separate issue and should perhaps be discussed elsewhere.</li>
<li><i>Empathetic purpose -</i> this is similar to Robin Collins "Incarnational theory" which is variation on some of the Girardian thought. For example, in an essay published on <a href="http://home.messiah.edu/~rcollins/Swart7.htm" class="external free" title="http://home.messiah.edu/~rcollins/Swart7.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.messiah.edu/~rcollins/Swart7.htm</a> Collins says:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>We will begin by examining some aspects of Christ's subjectivity that are particularly associated with his death. First, as the kenosis hymn of Philippians 2:6-11 reminds us, during his death on the Cross Jesus experientially entered into the depths of the human life-situation of vulnerability, dependence, death, suffering, brokenness, and alienation, even the depths of our alienation from God the Father as evidenced by his cry on the Cross "My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?" (Mark 16:34).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact I think the LDS section is more a chance to squeeze in references to LDS scripture then say something new about the subject.--<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkolstoe_83ef.html" title="User:Skolstoe">Simon</a> 10:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is precisely because the view incoprorates different theories into a single view of the atonement that I am proposing it be listed seperately - the combination is unique, the individual items are not necessarily unique. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 10:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In which case why not sum up the whole LDS view within the perspectives section but using a paragraph sich as:</dd>
<dd><i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints expands the doctrine of the atonement complementary to the substitutionary atonement concept but also including an incarnational element (or empathetic purpose). Thus Christ is perceived as suffering pain and agony not only for the sins of all men, but also to experience their physical pains, illnesses, anguish from addictions, emotional turmoil and depression, "that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities."
