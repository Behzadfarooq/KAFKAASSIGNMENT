<p>This talk by Tim Bray (at Emerging Technology Conference, feed from IT Conversations) might be useful addition.

<p>1) This article would give a naive user the misleading impression that all properties and benefits of web feeds generally are properties restricted to Atom feeds. Example: "Atom, from a user's perspective, allows Internet users to subscribe to websites that have provided web feeds; these are typically sites that change or add content regularly...A program known as a feed reader or aggregator can check Atom webpages on behalf of a user and display any updated articles that it finds...There are also search engines for content published via Atom feeds like Feedster or Blogdigger..." (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) The POV language you are complaining about is actually the same that is used on the RSS article -- I just removed RSS and inserted Atom. I think it is a great idea that we balance the leads of both articles to mention the other format in an equivalent light. (said Bhouston)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that copying the RSS article and posting it here as an Atom article is a sensible way to create Wikipedia content. My suggestion was that we should distinguish between properties of web feeds in general and those of a specific format (RSS or Atom) in particular. Not long ago, the only web feeds around were various dialects of RSS. There are a lot of oldtimers who talk about RSS and webfeeds as if they were synonyms. I can appreciate that doing so would hurt the feelings of partisans of Atom. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apples and oranges are both edible, one would expect reference on each of their Wikipedia entries to their use as foodstuff. A naive user might misinterpret this to believe that apples are the only fruit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) Such an impression is especially misleading considering that Atom is uncommon outside the blog-universe. CNN, the NY Times, and the BBC (just to mention the top three newslinks on my bookmark bar) have RSS feeds only, and don't mention Atom. (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(2) There are many major content providers that provide Atom feeds including the NYT-owned About.com, and the Google websites Blogger, Google News, Gmail. The popular O'Reilly Network and Wikipedia also support Atom. My contention is that you picked a specific link that does not support Atom in order to make a broad and unfair claim. (said Bhouston)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I picked the top three newssites that came preinstalled in my Safari browser. I looked at them because my memory was, from the days when I worked at Feedster, that the enthusiasm of Sixapart and Bloogle for Atom was never picked up by our mainstream media feeds. I don't dispute your contention that many content providers offer Atom feeds; I think it's misleading to imply that all do. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Atom is common, as anyone that cares to look will discover.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
3) This article article uses non-neutral language about Atom's rival format RSS. Example, "the deficiencies in the frozen RSS format." "Atom improvements over RSS 2.0" "the shortcomings of RSS". (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(3) Can you address those points? I'll then build upon your changes. Please remember that I am trying to represent <b>reality</b> here, not the specific consensual reality common within the clique of Dave Winer. BTW here is one of the first calls to develop Echo, which become Atom: <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. (said Bhouston)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ben, you have spent several days making changes large and small to articles related to Atom, web feeds, various newsreaders, even my own user page. I have an actual job and a family life and many other activities more rewarding than fighting with you. You need help from a neutral third party here, IMO. Somebody who understands that <b>reality</b> should include at least some research into, and a sympathetic presentation of, the consensual reality of people who are not strong supporters of Atom. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Technical deficiencies can be measured without "consensual reality". Those of RSS are well-documented on the Web, as is their role in motivating the development of Atom.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4) The repeated mantra that RSS is frozen and can't evolve is no longer true, if it ever was. Harvard is updating the specification and soliciting input from the community: <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-draft-1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-draft-1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(4) I will address the frozen for three years and then unfrozen claim and I will include references to people that explain the politics of these shinanigans. (says Bhouston)
<dl>
<dd>People from both sides of the fence, I hope. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>According to the specification: "...the RSS spec is, for all practical purposes, frozen at version 2.0.1".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>5) The suggestion that Atom is the standard for podcasting isn't borne out by community practice, e.g. "Blogger only provides a Atom newsfeed, and RSS 2.0 is the standard for podcasting...There is a free service, FeedBurner, that can be used to translate the Blogger Atom feed into a RSS 2.0 feed.." <a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/articles/Make_Podcast_Blogger.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.podcastingnews.com/articles/Make_Podcast_Blogger.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(5) iTunes, the permiere pod casting application support Atom podcasts. I think you are again trying to make a POV claim. <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/syndication-dev/2005/Nov/msg00004.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lists.apple.com/archives/syndication-dev/2005/Nov/msg00004.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (says Bhouston)
<dl>
<dd>I don't know much about podcasting, but I had always heard it talked about in terms of RSS. I posted something I thought was relevant from the first page of Google results for "atom + podcasting". BTW, are you aware that the URL you posted is a complaint from a guy that his Atom feed is being rejected by iTunes, despite their claim that they support it? <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Atom may be used for podcasting, but RSS 2.0 is probably in more common use for podcasting than Atom.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>6) Another example of confusing Atom with web feeds in general: "On Web pages, Atom feeds are typically linked with an orange rectangle, or with the letters XML." (said BDevine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(6) Again, the POV language you are complaining about is taken from the RSS page with Atom inserted for each mention of RSS. Again, I think it is a great idea to balance both articles such that the other format is mentioned in reference to the little orange box. Although I did just removed the XML orange box from the Atom -- it may be RSS specific. (says Bhouston)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that copying the RSS article and posting it here as an Atom article is a sensible way to create Wikipedia content. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 21:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The history of RSS and Atom is full of contention. If you consider it of encyclopedic interest, maybe you could create a separate article "Rival web syndication formats", and link to that article from both the RSS and Atom articles. But it's not OK to slant the Atom article (or the RSS article) to reflect only one side's version of the controversy, praising one format while denigrating or minimizing its rivals. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 04:08, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hey Betsy! Great to see you again. Of course, I spent the last three days bring this article up to speed. (Anyways, let's remember that <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betsy_Devine_08f0.html" title="Betsy Devine">Betsy Devine</a> is a close friend of <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Winer_e258.html" title="Dave Winer">Dave Winer</a>, a strong headed individual who prefers the RSS standard to Atom. Betsy Devine is such an admirer of Dave Winer]] that she creates images of Socrates with the head of Dave on them. Dave links to her all the time and she links to him. Thus Betsy Devine is really fighting her friend's battle here. She is not a neutral person. Just had to get that disclaimer out of the way.)</dd>

<dd>Hey, Ben, great to hear these accusations from you once again. I especially enjoy your misleading spin on the joke post I once wrote about somebody else's comparison of Dave to Socrates: <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05" class="external autonumber" title="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Dave and I are friends who read each other's blogs.

<dl>
<dd>I will remove the NPOV dispute tag and we can get around to fixing up the article. Or I suggest that we also add it to the RSS article since it contains much of the same POV text. I also believe that we need a neutral third party here to critique this article -- Betsy Devine is the wrong person to do it. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 13:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The NPOV dispute tag should remain there until the problems with this article are solved. I agree that a neutral third party should help with this. I'll see if I can find one over at Wikipedia third opinion.

<dd>Let's get a third party in here if one has the time. It is of no use for use to throw accusations at each other. I posit that all my edits have been legitimate and that you, as an RSS supporter, are just display a lot of bias wrapped up in high sounding language. Let's see if my edits are reverted on an individual article basis? I created an Atom category to mirror the RSS category and added it to pagese that support Atom -- I confirmed each product before I did so. If not then the people watching those pages most likely feel that they are legitimate -- none have been reverted so far, and only one has been slightly modified to better fit with the section I put it in. The best demonstration of your bias is that you complained about the "bias" in the Atom article but you feel no qualms about the same "bias" in the RSS article -- I did that in part to make a point and you proved it well. Also, I only copied two sections (part of the user's perspective lead) and most of the usage section -- maybe we should pull out the usage section of both the RSS and Atom articles into a separate web feed article to avoid unnecessary duplication? --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My apologizes for moving the POV tag to specific sections -- I was trying to narrow the dispute. I don't think I messed up the whole article to make a point -- I strongly dispute your claim that I did.

<p>I don't see anything wrong with the article as it's written now. It doesn't appear to be too biased in favour or against RSS.

<dd>I don't see any problems with the "Atom Compared to RSS 2.0" section. As far as I can see it's a set of factual statements.

<dd>I agree. I was just at both specifications from the standpoint of an engineer with extensive xml background what the article states as technical merits seem accurate. It's interesting also that the <i>neutrality</i>, not the <i>accuracy</i>, of the article is being questioned - a sort of case of, "what your saying isn't wrong, but I require it be said in a way I can accept." That said rss is the vhs of it's space and has those types of advantages: it's adoption is widespread in providers and consumers and the fact that rss has become the everyday term for active content distribution. Maybe those points could be added to the comparison of atom and rss and finally take off the neutrality tag? Loudej 02:27, 01 July 2006 (ET)</dd>

<dd>As XML applications developer, I think that the <i>Atom Compared to RSS 2.0</i> section <b>is neutral</b> and accurate. â€” <span class="user-sig"><a href="../../../a/n/r/User%7EAnrie_Nord_4815.html" title="User:Anrie Nord">Anrie Nord</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">07-01</a>&#160;14:47<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></span></dd>

<dd>It's says multiple times, what atom is standartized, it should be only one time and saying that specifically. It don't say what is good in rss, btw., from google: <i>Results 1 - 100 of about 377,000,000 for atom</i> (not really about atom feeds), <i>Results 1 - 100 of about 4,290,000,000 for rss</i> (rough 10 times more and mainly about rss feeds), only that wide spread is advantage. I don't see neutrality and it's clearly misleading, until not answered question: why rss so popular and atom isn't.

<p>Both the Atom and RSS articles put both formats in the web syndication field only. It would certainly be good to explain that Atom (at least) aims beyond syndicating news. In fact, some active Atom users have stopped using the Syndication term alltogether. It is for example debated whether or not Atom could "replace" SOAP for conveying web services.

The core of Atom is the Atom Format (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC 4287</a>) and the Atom Publishing Protocol (under development).

<p>The detailed early history of who invented what web syndication format element when has become a matter of interest and dispute. The same kind of problems cropping up in the article about <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> were largely solved when somebody created a separate article for <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_podcasting.html" title="History of podcasting">History of podcasting</a>. This seems like a possible solution for web feeds also.</p>
<p>Another possible benefit of the change is to prevent a Wikipedia fork in feed history, so that somebody with a new citation adds to info to one article but doesn't realize that an incorrect version still lurks in a different article.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../r/s/s/RSS_bf19.html" title="RSS">RSS</a>, I copied the earliest history over to the new article, then went back to <a href="../../../r/s/s/RSS_bf19.html" title="RSS">RSS</a> and re-phrased that earliest history as summary.</p>
<p>I'm not sure, however, if people who edit this Atom article would like to see its technical history moved into a different article. On the good side, that would give people interested in technical history one place to look. On the dark side, if there aren't severe credit disputes on early Atom, maybe you feel such a move isn't needed. Or maybe you would like to keep all the history of Atom here, and just put a history summary in the new article? Just for the sake of symmetry, I copied the Atom history over to that page. It shouldn't be left in both places, or it will fork--one page should have the history, the other should just summarize and point to t he long version. Could we discuss on this talk page which course would be best?My intention is good, please don't flame me. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 03:18, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
