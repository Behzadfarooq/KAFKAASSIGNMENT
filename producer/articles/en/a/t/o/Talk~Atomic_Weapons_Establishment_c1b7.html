	    <p>Oak Ridge really isn't a counterpart to Aldermaston, I don't think.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oak Ridge enriches uranium. Aldermaston designs and manufactures warheads; Los Alamos and Livermore labs design the US warheads, and they are manufactured at Pantex (Oak Ridge does neither). Maybe I'm just splitting hairs... --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:59, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
AWE Aldermston builds warheads using plutonium previously produced at Sellafield nuclear power plant in the 1970s to 1990s. AWE has a huge stock of Pu taken from the Chevaline warheads withdrawn from service on the Polaris submarine fleet in the early 1990s. Although a tiny amount of Pu is under IAEA Safeguards at Sellafield,the MoD will not send its Pu stockpile back to Sellafield to add into the Safguards regime. Neither will it have it inspected on the AWE site. It is therefore available to the military and used to build the occasional Trident warhead to keep up the workforce skills. It is also available if a follow-on-to-Trident warhead is built.</p>

<p>Having read this article again, I'm thinking of rewriting it article in a more logical fashion over the summer, as it seems a bit messy and badly structured. Could anyone with anything to add post the link in here please? Cheers. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyohale_3b2e.html" title="User:Paddyohale">Paddyohale</a> 09:39, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea, it is a bit of a mess of accumulated facts. The official AWE website historical timeline, which I've just added to external links, seems pretty good and fair, and I think warrants close study. It even admits bluntly "The [US-UK] Agreement permitted an exchange of classified information which effectively would allow British delivery systems to be fitted with warheads based on American designs", so seems largely spin-free though quiet on costs. Maybe thier 50th anniversery book <a href="http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/2000a/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/2000a/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> would be a good source. Another good background source would be the National Archives selection policy <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/selection/pdf/osp11.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/selection/pdf/osp11.pdf" rel="nofollow">Nuclear Weapons Policy 1967-1998</a>, which is useful for accurate dates and an indication of costs. <a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwendland_44de.html" title="User:Rwendland">Rwendland</a> 11:39, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that most information regarding what goes on <i>inside</i> the facility is almost certainly classified, with only general overviews released by the Government. There are also Discoveries (the AWE Journal) that provide bits of information, but I'm not sure if these are publicly available outside the base. I'm not sure if they still distribute copies of <i>AWE Today</i>, a kind of newspaper about the company, like I think they used to (years ago). I suspect most information could be taken from the AWE site and certain government sites, although Aldermaston is actually a government owned-contractor operated site.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One also has to consider the OSA when writing this, so all facts will <b>have</b> to be referenced. I believe there were references to Aldermaston in Hansard last summer, so I can try and have a look at those too - there was a decision to give AWE an extra Â£1bn over three years, which was announced in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4697605.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4697605.stm" rel="nofollow">Summer 2005</a>.</dd>

<p>I've reinserted the paragraph noting U.S. staffing contribute to doubts if UK is really an independent nuclear power. Note the paragraph doesn't say UK is not an independent nuclear power, just notes one of several sources that express these doubts; it is a factually correct paragraph I believe. Up to the 1980s I doubt any non-British citizen would be security cleared for any significant position in the UK nuclear weapons programme; to have the MD of the AWE operating company a U.S. citizen is a notable change to those days worth noting. We probably have few nuclear secrets from the U.S. now. <a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwendland_44de.html" title="User:Rwendland">Rwendland</a> 16:43, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The paragraph is based on the arguement that American citizens being employed "contribut[es] to doubts that the UK's nuclear deterrent is truly independent of the U.S." I'm sorry but that's conjecture. Also I have problems with the two sources given:
<ol>
<li>The first, while pretty thorough proof that the UK nuclear deterrent is not independent, focuses on the Trident missiles, not AWE's warheads. Hence it would be excellent to argue the point at <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom_aba8.html" title="Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom">Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom</a>.</li>
<li>The Lockheed source is five years old.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The employment of US citizens (2.7% of the total) is not definitive proof that the UK's nuclear deterrent is any less independent than if 100% of AWE staff were British. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 18:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is OBVIOUSLY not the proportion of the workforces that is of a particular nationality (otherwise cheap immigrant labour would own half the UK AND the US), but who works for a particular job role (the key to American DOMINION). Perhaps some (probably non-classifed information) concerning the typical hierarchical organisation of at least *some* of the Aldermaston workforce might be useful (certainly nothing technical, just an indication of how much power the Americans have in determining the course that technological development takes. For example, do the Americans ever get the opportunity to increase the likelihood of technological dependency upon either what they produce, or their skills?).

<dd>Not exactly. In essence - I was merely stating that the correct (or, at least, more reasonable and rational) point to make wasn't the proportion of the workforce that has a particular nationality (or indeed, a particular IQ), but the types of positions that particular nationalities are likely to be employed within. For example, if all the cleaners are from Africa, this really isn't an issue (assuming that they don't clean *inside* the nuclear warheads, et al....). If all your technicians are changing the toilet roll, then you are going to have problems. These issues aside - I was not making a conjecture - just pointing out that the correct statistic should be something else.</dd>

<p>I think this article should include more information about the issues this site causes due to its proximity to residential population, rather than just mentioning that it is nearest town is Tadley, it is virtually IN Tadley. There is private housing and business premisis directly accross the road from the site, probably not more than 50 metres from one of the sites entrances. Local radiactivity and other obvious issues has been a big concern of residents local to AWE, although the AWE publishes leaflets claiming that radioactivity levels are lower at Aldermaston than the naturally occuring level in Cornwall.</p>
<p>Their leaflets also detail emergency procedures, automated telephone early warning systems to every local home and business, etc.</p>
<p>The site is linked by underground tunnel to the Burghfield site and Greenham Common air base, which used to be the main method of transporting ordanance. It is now transported above ground as a moving convoy with heavy police and fire service escort blocking roads, roundabouts etc to ensure the convey never comes to a standstill during transportation.</p>
<p>There are frequent CND demonstrations/camps on the 'lawn' outside the sites east entrance.</p>
<p>The site was once the subject of an episode of the Mark Thomas Product, where he hired a mobile tower crane, parked it outside the site to film the goings on within the site(on the surface at least) <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.170.64 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.3.170.64_bb09.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.3.170.64">contribs</a>).</small> 08:16, 4 October 2006</p>

<dd>Not really worth creating an 'issues affecting the locals" section. Tadley is to some extent a "company town", and a large proportion of the locals have direct or indirect knowledge of what actually goes on 'inside the wire' as they call it. They know that the place is very unlikely to produce any form of 'disaster' which could affect anybody outside the fence. Therefore most of them are quite at ease or ambivalent to the proximity of AWE, and are probably happier living next to it than they would be to other types of large industrial complex, such as a refinery/oil storage depot or chemical plant. In fact the thing that they probably resent the most is the traffic chaos that results when outsiders come dressed in silly 'radiation suits' to be filmed doing the 'dying fly' during routine scheduled tests of the site incident alarm system. As the business end of AWE is (reassuringly) securely behind multiple layers of heavily-guarded barbed wire, people fill their 'knowledge vacuum' with ill-informed conjecture about what actually happens there. In fact, the only things worth knowing that you cannot glean from AWE's own public website are those facts which are simply 'secret'.&#160;:-). MaxieT 15:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to say, I live about 400 yards from the site (and have done for the past 18 years), and have never heard anyone ever say "inside the wire", be it kids or adults. And regarding people's thoughts about the plant, most people go on the basis of, "well if something does go bad, I'm gonna die 0.0000001 seconds before you" --Scuzzmonkey 20:21, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The AWE is one of the UK's premier siesmology detectors using the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty system(CTBT) designed orignially to detect underground nuclear explotions of 20 kilotons, it is now so sensative it can detect events of 10 tonnes and detects over 500,000 events each year, it detected the Boxing Day Asain Tsunami, and at the same time it also detected that the whole of the UK landmass increased in elevation by 15mm.<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.170.64 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.3.170.64_bb09.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.3.170.64">contribs</a>).</small> 08:33, 4 October 2006</p>

<dd>This is done at Blacknest, a small country house near Brimpton, a little to the West of Aldermaston. The place is totally unclassified (i.e. public knowledge), and is also used for civilian seismic science uses. MaxieT 15:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
