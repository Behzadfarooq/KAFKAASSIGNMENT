<p>Craft became a feminist and activist in the late 1960s, and was one of the first people to publicly protest against <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty_pageants.html" title="Beauty pageants">beauty pageants</a>. In the summer of 1975 Craft organized her first anti-pageant action in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a> at the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Texas_ed07.html" title="Miss Texas">Miss Texas</a> Beauty Pageant, where the protesters threw raw steak onto the stage during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing_suit.html" title="Bathing suit">bathing suit</a> contest. In 1976 she altered a billboard by changing it from "Miss America" to "Myth America," an action covered in the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parade_%28magazine%29.html" title="Parade (magazine)"><i>Parade</i> magazine</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1975, she presented the Rockwell International Board of Directors with "bloodied" dolls to protest their <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-1_Lancer_9d5f.html" title="B-1 Lancer">B-1 bomber</a> called "The Peacemaker"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The same year, Craft founded Women Armed for Self Protection (WASP), which advocated armed self-defense for women and retaliation against <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rapists</a> by their victims; she wrote and recorded <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/audio/rapesong.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/audio/rapesong.html" rel="nofollow">the Rape Song</a> about <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inez_Garcia_901a.html" title="Inez Garcia">Inez Garcia</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Little_9689.html" title="Joan Little">Joan Little</a>.</p>
<p>In 1976, Craft co-founded the <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Genovese_b87c.html" title="Kitty Genovese">Kitty Genovese</a> Women's Project (KGWP) when she and another activist posed as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a> students under the pretense of doing a "statistical study on violent crimes" and obtained the names of every indicted sex offender in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_County%2C_Texas_5263.html" title="Dallas County, Texas">Dallas County</a> from 1959 to 1975. This was before such records were kept on computer and so the activists worked for nine months writing all the names down on index cards. A year later 25,000 copies of the KGWP newspaper were published. The paper listed all 2,100 sex offender indictments, 1,700 of which were multiple offenders, and was distributed throughout Dallas. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Women%27s_Day_1e3d.html" title="International Women's Day">International Women's Day</a>, the group read the names over local <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_radio.html" title="Community radio">community radio</a> KCHU for 13 hours.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1979, Craft helped organize the first Myth California Anti-Pageant in Santa Cruz, California. In 1980 Craft joined other pageant protesters and over the next nine years conducted other actions, including throwing raw meat on the stage and pouring the blood of raped women across a pageant entryway. One year three men locked arms on stage and yelled "Men Resist <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a>! Men Resist Sexism!" preventing the crowning until they were dragged away. There were many arrests, and each year the crowds grew larger at the anti-pageant protests which later resulted in the Miss California pageant leaving <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Cruz_8ebe.html" title="Santa Cruz">Santa Cruz</a>. The protests continued in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> and in 1988, after the pageant left Santa Cruz and moved to San Diego, an anti-pageant infiltrator won the local pageant and advanced to the state finals where she unveiled a banner from her bra that read "Pageants Hurt All Women." An award-winning documentary called <i><a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=176328" class="external text" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=176328" rel="nofollow">Miss or Myth</a></i> examines these protests and Craft's role in starting them.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s Craft became a <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramicist.html" title="Ceramicist">ceramicist</a> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> at <a href="../../../u/c/s/UCSC_1267.html" title="UCSC">UCSC</a>. One year she made 500 handthrown pieces and signed them all "Stop Violence Against Women."</p>
<p>In 1980, Craft started the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preying_Mantis_275b.html" title="Preying Mantis">Preying Mantis</a> Women's Brigade. Preying Mantis organized actions to remove <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Hustler.html" title="Hustler">Hustler</a></i> from local liquor stores in retaliation for publishing violent <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>. Over the next year they succeeded in getting <i>Hustler</i> removed from 28 stores in the Santa Cruz area. These actions were documented weekly in <i>City on a Hill Press</i> at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Santa_Cruz_b9d8.html" title="University of California, Santa Cruz">UCSC</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, Craft entered the UCSC Special Collections library and destroyed <i>The Incredible Case of the Stack o' Wheats Murder</i> print reproductions a <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> collection of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parodies.html" title="Parodies">parodies</a> of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_scene_photography.html" title="Crime scene photography">forensic photography</a> by the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Krims_e66b.html" title="Les Krims">Les Krims</a>, by pouring chocolate syrup on the torn pieces. At that time she released <i>In Defense of Disobedience</i>. Months later she donated another set of prints, exactly the same as the one she destroyed. She was arrested for felony <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28crime%29.html" title="Conspiracy (crime)">conspiracy</a> and malicious mischief, but charges were later dismissed. She was later nominated for a chancellor's award for "significant contribution to campus understanding of ethical principles" by her arresting officer, the provost of her college and the then mayor of Santa Cruz. The action received widespread press coverage, was reviewed in art journals, and was documented in Diana Russell's book <i>Femicide</i>.</p>
<p>In 1981, Craft formed the Cross Your Heart Support network and organized numerous <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topfree_equality.html" title="Topfree equality">shirt-free</a> rights demonstrations. Over a period of several years, members, including Craft, were arrested on state beaches in numerous demonstrations. During one of these demonstrations, they marched to the Santa Cruz police station. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Baxandall_3837.html" title="Lee Baxandall">Lee Baxandall</a> reproduced one of their photographs of this latter event in his <i>World Guide to Nude Beaches</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1981, Craft was arrested, along with others, for pouring her own blood ("the blood of raped women") across the entry way of the San Jose Miss Nude Pageant.</p>
<p>In 1981, and again in 1988, Craft was arrested at the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_Canyon_Power_Plant_ee43.html" title="Diablo Canyon Power Plant">Diablo Canyon Power Plant</a> while protesting against the proliferating use of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> in the USA. During the 1983 "Weight Slavery" Myth California protest, Craft vomited during a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_theatre.html" title="Street theatre">street theatre</a> performance, in order to bring about public awareness about <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_disorder.html" title="Eating disorder">eating disorders</a>.</p>
<p>In 1983 Craft founded Citizens for Media Responsibility. During the next year and a half, Craft and Dr. <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Farley_489c.html" title="Melissa Farley">Melissa Farley</a> organized the National Rampage Against Penthouse which resulted in hundreds of arrests of women and men across the country to protest <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/Penthouse_%28magazine%29.html" title="Penthouse (magazine)">Penthouse</a></i> magazines publication of what they called "violent <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asian</a> pornography." That same year she founded Meredith Stockholders Against Penthouse to protest Meredith printing the magazine. The following year, Merideth Corporation stopped printing <i>Penthouse</i>. Craft was arrested 16 times in eight different states over the next year and a half.</p>
<p>She was arrested in August 1984 while sunbathing at the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_National_Seashore_3ec6.html" title="Cape Cod National Seashore">Cape Cod National Seashore</a> for refusing to put on her shirt. She later organized a class action suit funded by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Naturist_Society_54f1.html" title="The Naturist Society">the Naturist Society</a> against the Federal government, which manages the Seashore. Later in the proceedings, she and others withdrew from the case because the Society's attorney had made concessions to the respondents related to clothing requirements for Seashore visitors that included gender distinctions, specifically, the covering of women's breasts.</p>
<p>In March 1986 Craft and eight other women were arrested in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> after chaining themselves in front of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Foundation_20c2.html" title="Playboy Foundation">Playboy Foundation</a> demanding that <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Hefner_ab5e.html" title="Hugh Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> "get naked" and pose in his own publication.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s Craft published a newsletter called <i>The Iconoclast</i>, which reported on <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudist.html" title="Nudist">nudists</a> and naturists who had been accused or convicted of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a>, and her assertion that the nudist/naturist leadership was not taking the problem seriously.</p>
<p>In May 1990, Craft spent 23 days in jail for tearing up four copies of <i><a href="../../../e/s/q/Esquire_%28magazine%29.html" title="Esquire (magazine)">Esquire</a></i> magazine on a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellingham%2C_Washington_1fe8.html" title="Bellingham, Washington">Bellingham, WA</a> mall bookstore, to protest its cover story, "Your Wife: An Owner's Manual," which included articles the magazine claimed were "humorous" about <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_violence.html" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990 Craft opened the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Dworkin_4ba1.html" title="Andrea Dworkin">Andrea Dworkin</a> Online Library. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_E._H._Russell_fd8f.html" title="Diana E. H. Russell">Diana E. H. Russell</a> dedicated her book <i>Femicide</i> to Craft. In 1997 Dworkin dedicated her book <i>Life and Death</i> to Craft. In 2000, Craft and <a href="../../../d/2E/a/D.A._Clarke_1346.html" title="D.A. Clarke">D.A. Clarke</a> organized "Feminists for <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Nader_6df8.html" title="Ralph Nader">Nader</a>" and campaigned for Nader's presidential bid.</p>
<p>In 1995, the feminist journal <i>On the Issues</i> published Craft's article entitled "Busting Mister Short Eyes" about a naturist <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">child rapist</a> sentenced to 30 years in prison, partly as a result of Craft's advocacy. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2001 she took a stand against the war in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and called upon her feminist colleagues to do the same. In 2005, she created the "<a href="http://HustlingTheLeft.com" class="external text" title="http://HustlingTheLeft.com" rel="nofollow">Hustling the Left</a>" website, criticizing leaders in <a href="../../../l/e/f/Leftist.html" title="Leftist">leftist</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive.html" title="Progressive">progressive</a> movements who published articles, interviews and expressed public cooperation with <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Flynt_1649.html" title="Larry Flynt">Larry Flynt</a> and his magazine, <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Hustler.html" title="Hustler">Hustler</a></i>.

<p>One of Craft's major projects involves researching and publishing articles about <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudism.html" title="Nudism">nudists and naturists</a> who have been accused or convicted of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_molestation.html" title="Child molestation">child molestation</a>. These were initially published in her newsletter <i>The Iconoclast</i> and they now appear on her website. Craft contends that the nudist/naturist organizations <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_for_Nude_Recreation_a5e1.html" title="American Association for Nude Recreation">American Association for Nude Recreation</a> (AANR) and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Naturist_Society_54f1.html" title="The Naturist Society">The Naturist Society</a> (TNS) fail to address this issue by not doing enough to investigate and remove offenders, report them to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_enforcement.html" title="Law enforcement">law enforcement</a>, or modify club procedures for dealing with <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuse.html" title="Abuse">abuse</a>. As one example, she reported on William D. Peckenpaugh, who wrote a whitepaper proposing that children's exposure to nudity is beneficial<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>, himself eventually pled guilty to 33 counts of sexually abusing a Romanian boy he had adopted. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>For 15 years Craft has insisted that children are not safe in naturist and nudist environments. The Virginia legislature now requires a parent to attend nudist youth camps with their minors as a result of legistlation enacted in 2004. Subsequent legislation to ban minors at nudist parks was defeated.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
