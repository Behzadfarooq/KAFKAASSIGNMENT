<p>The pilot's report stated that Nagasaki was only his secondary target. I find it weak to include this without mentioning the originally intended target. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 20:18, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll dig in my papers, but I seem to recall that the second bomb is considered to have been dropped too shortly for any of the great powers of the time to be able to surrender at all because of the massive logistics involved. David</p>
<dl>
<dd>David -- look at e.g., <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hiro/feld.htm" class="external free" title="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hiro/feld.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hiro/feld.htm</a> . There is a debate about whether the second bomb needed to be dropped, and it should be included (in an NPOV manner) in this article. Some have said the second bomb was the first act of the cold war -- an early surrender preventing Russia from getting into the war against Japan. Google "nagasaki second bomb" for lots of links to filter through. Also, <b>unprotect</b> this page, people.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure if I agree with the way the logic of the "no unconditional surrender" argument is given in the last section. Since Japan still has an emperor, the United States must have agreed to a conditional surrender. If the US, however, agreed to such a surrender <i>after</i> the bombs, that is, from a stronger position, it is hard to see why they wouldn't have done so before the bombs. In other words: The problem was not, as implied here, that the US were unwilling to accept an unconditional surrender, but that the Japanese were unwilling to surrender before the bombs, peroid. -- Also, some mention should be made in the article about the Japanese reaction to the Potsdam Declaration, where the Allies warned Japan of "prompt and utter distruction", should Japan continue fighting. -- <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_Deunan_99af.html" title="User:Wolf Deunan">Wolf Deunan</a> 11:11, Jul 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is what I call strange logic. The US justifies the bombings with "Otherwise Japan would not have surrendered." As we know, Japan was willing to surrender, but not to give up its emperor. After the bombing the US accepted that condition, so the bombing was not about unconditional surrender. Period. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 11:32, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Prompt and utter distruction" is what wars are all about, take a look at <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II_6c21.html" title="Bombing of Dresden in World War II">Bombing of Dresden in World War II</a>. But no one warned Japan of the atomic bomb, which was unknown and unexpected as the article indicates. A demonstration on uninhabitated ground would have been sufficient. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 11:35, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sigh. This discussion, I fear, is not going to work out, especially since I get the feeling you are pushing an agenda on Wikipedia after reading your home page (not that your nick doesn't say one or two things). For the record: Wars are not "all about prompt and utter destruction", at least not from the point of view of the military -- there is this thing about <i>Die Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln</i> by this guy <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clausewitz.html" title="Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a> you might want to look into, and in fact the bombing of Dresden is such a debated chapter in WWII exactly <i>because</i> it did not fit into any military strategy but was a simple "revenge" slaughter (semi-amusing note: When in Dresden, take the bus tour and listen to the guide tell everybody it was the Americans who ordered the bombing. So much for <i>Geschichtsunterricht</i> in Saxony). There is no big discussion, for example, about bombing Essen or Bochum to the bedrock outside of the general question if any of the bombings were justified, because getting rid of Krupp's factories still is seen as a valid target.</p>
<p>Japan never came out and said "we want to surrender, let's talk", and their reaction to the Potsdam declaration could only be interpreted in one way by the US:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On July 28, the government issued a carefully worded response to the Potsdam Declaration, which unfortunately used a word with a double meaning. [Japanese] English-language broadcasts used the word "ignore" and the Western press picked up that sentiment.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>(From <a href="http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/japansurrender.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/japansurrender.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). This is a must for a balanced article on the topic, because it shows that whatever the Japanese might have been discussing internally, what was sent to the U.S. looked very clear-cut indeed: No deal, we're going to fight. In fact, what passed for the Japanese government at that point was highly divided on the question, and even after the two bombs, the military tried to keep the emperor's crucial broadcast from reaching the Japanese.</p>
<p>Another must is Japan's own infant atom bomb project -- start <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2170881.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2170881.stm" rel="nofollow">here at the BBC</a> if you need material. And then there is the question of how many people were being killed by conventional bombings; see the Tokyo raids. Would it have really been better if the conventional bombings had gone on, actually killing more people, just to avoid nuclear bombing? Your answer might (and probably does) differ from mine, but any article about the bombings must definitely address the question, sick as it of course is.</p>
<p>This entry is lacking in too many ways to provide a fair POV, and thereby does not do either side justice.</p>
<p>Sadly, you appear to have more time on your hands than I do and certainly more of a chip on your shoulder than I am wiling to try to bulge, so I'll be leaving this to others to discuss with you. I would urgently suggest that you do add a "the objectivity of this page is contested" tag to the entry, though. -- <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_Deunan_99af.html" title="User:Wolf Deunan">Wolf Deunan</a> 01:50, Jul 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Judge whether I am "pushing an agenda on Wikipedia" after reading my edits, not my home page. I defend my opinion on talk pages, if you see any edits you think that lack neutrality point that out at discussion.</dd>
<dd>I am happy that we agree that the bombing of Dresden did not fit into any military strategy but was a simple "revenge" slaughter. How many guided tours have you had in Dresden? In Germany "Bomber Harris" is well known as an English guy, especially after the Queen showed her appreciation for the mass murderer. Americans and British were allies and bombed jointly. To be honest I do not know if the Americans were involved in Dresden and I do not see that it would matter much. When talking about history lessons in Saxony you may also take into account that only in '89 did the wall come down and history lessons changed a bit, and not immediately. I do not know when you had a tour with how old a guide.</dd>
<dd>For sure bomb factories are a valid target, but I think we agree that all sides in WWII used bombings of civilians deliberately in order to terrorize the population and break support for their leaders. Fortunately millions on the streets all over the world embarassed euphemists into not using "Shock and Awe" as much again.</dd>
<dd>Japan's intention to surrender is well known and documented, even <i>General Douglas MacArthur, Commander of US Army forces in the Pacific, stated on numerous occasions before his death that the atomic bomb was completely unnecessary from a military point of view: "My staff was unanimous in believing that Japan was on the point of collapse and surrender.".</i> <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
<dd>My impression is that it was done as deterrence for the Soviets - maybe even also because some Americans did not understand how big an issue it was for Japan to keep its Emperor. The question is not how to bomb civilians most efficiently, the point is that bombing civilians intentionally is a war crime.</dd>
<dd>If you have anything specific to edit just do it. If you perceive others preventing needed edits and discussion is fruitless add {{NPOV}}. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 00:59, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That word would happen to be 黙殺 <i>mokusatsu</i>, "ignore; shelve; smother; treat with silent contempt;" (WWWJDIC) I do not really percieve a double meaning, but it is a rather poor choice of words. I believe that phrasing was used so as to avoid declaring that they would outright ignore it - <a href="../../../z/h/e/User%7EZhen_Lin_87ed.html" title="User:Zhen Lin">刘 (劉) 振霖</a> 14:05, Aug 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are of course right that I should be judging you by the edits, not your home page. That was uncalled for, please accept my apologies; probably I have been getting too much bull about this question over the years to keep my shoulders clean, too.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested Additions</span></h2>
<p>(not in sequence)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><i>List of contemporaries' views on the bomb</i>. People who had something to do with the bombing and their views pro and con, if possible with quotes. Each view gets a section. This is MacArthur would belong.</li>
<li><i>Timeline list of events</i> Starting with Truman being informed that the bombs are ready, Potsdam declaration, Japanese response in Japanese, the translation problem, and how it was received; first bomb; allies redemanding surrender, Japanese reaction; second bomb.</li>
<li><i>Table of number of dead in each city.</i> This would include number of people who immediately died, who died in the first years after, who have died until today. There is some controvery about the numbers, so this would be delicate and require carefull sourcing.</li>
<li><i>Number of dead due to conventional bombing for comparison.</i> The number of dead, though terrible enough, is not the most important reason for the horror of the bombs; to make this clear, the number of dead due to conventional raids should be mentioned. There was a large raid on Tokyo in March or April (this is from memory) which almost killed 100,000 in one night.</li>
<li><i>Role of the atom bombs for Japanese radical-right.</i> The radical right in Japan have used the bombs to portrait themselves as vicitims, a major aspect of the way Japan views WW2 today (compare Germany), and this influences things like views on the compensation for Korean sex slaves</li>
<li><i>Question of bombs as war crime or terrorism</i> This is going to remain controversal, and therefore should be isolated in a separate section so changes over the years due to radically opposing views won't affect the other parts. Related to that:</li>
<li><i>Use of the bombings in anti-American propaganda</i>. This includes stuff published by the Soviet Union, China, neo-Nazis, leftist groups.</li>
<li><i>Alternatives to nuclear bombardment.</i> Probably there should be organized by date: Discussions before the bombs (death tolls expected in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">Operation Downfall</a> would have trippled U.S. war dead, planned use of chemical weapons); right after the end of the war (new information about the real state of the Japanese defenses, willingness to surrender); present day (mordern estimates, Soviet archives).</li>
<li><i>Role of the emperor</i>. The emperor had a crucial role in ending the war; because keeping him was the major hurdle for the Japanese surrender, and the decision to let the Japanese keep him was very controversal in the U.S. ("just like keeping Hitler"), a separate section might be warranted.</li>
<li><i>Famous details</i> (Not a good name) There are all sorts of aspects and quotes that are famous, such as the response of one of the pilots, the "shadow on the wall", etc., which should be included, though they are not hard facts or stricly of historical importance. This would include the songs that have some reference</li>
<li><i>Commomerative dates and ceremonies</i>. Brief note on the yearly bell ringing etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is of course the danger of overlap with other entries, but there always is. Comments?</p>

<dd>I think all your proposals make sense. It would be quite an ambitiuous project. Not only time consuming but also at high risk of inflicting strong controversies. For example, what are "leftists", what is "propaganda" - did the U.S. not make use of it? There are also disagreements about the facts, stronger ones about estimations of numbers of casualties and even more so for alternatives. Keep in mind that this is an encyclopedia article, therefore should be concise and not essay-like. I would advise you start with what you regard most important and where the risk of major conflicts is comparatively low.</dd>
<dd>Just minor points: The Emperor has a separate article, and some of what you suggest can be dealt with there. The comparison with Hitler is far-fetched in my eyes. I do not know much about the Japanese Emperor, but as far as I know even though horrible crimes were committed by Japanese nationals in WWII and he was involved he did not personally create a totalitarian regime with industrialized murder based on his own racist theories. The comment about comparison with Germany for how WWII is seen today, did you mean allegations like the ones that Japan uses biased textbooks and that Germany in contrast has lots of memorial sites about Nazi terror and paid restitutions to victims? Or do you think that Dresden's tourist guide(s) represent[s] ignorance of Germans? Do U.S. textbooks cover deliberate bombings of civilians as war crimes? Or the <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laconia_incident.html" title="Laconia incident">Laconia incident</a>? I did not even know much about that when I started my university studies, kind of a taboo. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 21:18, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I recommend reading <i>The Last Great Victory</i> by Stanley Weintraub, and <i>Downfall</i> by Richard Frank, for anyone who doubts that dropping the bomb was the least bad alternative.</p>
<p>The Japanese wanted to get out of the war, but on terms totally unacceptable to the Allies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>p. 64 (July 15, 1945) [quotes from <i>Victory</i>]</dd>
<dd>... Togo was forced to cable Sato in Moscow that he should inform Foreign Minister Molotov before the leadership left for Potsdam that Japan, "in preparation for the ending of the was, has absolutely no ideas of annexing or holding the territories occupied as a result of the war."</dd>
<dd>&#160; The cable was deliberately couched to protect Japan’s northern empire--Korea, Manchuria, and the northern islands seized from Czarist Russia in the 1904 war--ironically, the areas in which the Soviets had the most interest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>p. 142 (July 19, 1945)</dd>
<dd>&#160; "Magic" had known as early as the Leyte landings in 1944 that the Imperial Navy saw the war as lost. After Okinawa there was almost no navy, but for the die-hards in its air arm. The leadership had long scorned the hard terms and had planted suggestions through diplomatic third parties that if Japan could keep this conquest or that, and the Emperor and the old system, and possible avoid occupation, that even the Army, the hard-line service, might accept a peace. The decrypts were only as credible as their sources, and as a chronicler of codebreaking has put it, "The historian has to shed hindsight, and consider what the situation looked like <i>at the time</i>." And at the time the army hierarchy dominating the government was suicidally belligerent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other hand, the Allies <i>were</i> willing to deal on the question of the Emperor--and the Japanese knew it. They also knew that the Allies were explicitly offering softer terms than they had just imposed on Germany.</p>
<dl>
<dd>p. 259 (July 26, 1945)</dd>
<dd>[terms of the Potsdam proclamation:] ... Those responsible for Japan’s militaristic ways had to be eliminated from "authority and influence." Until Japan was judged to be peacable, it would be occupied. Sovereignty for Japan would be limited to the home islands "and such minor islands as we determine." After disarming, military forces would be permitted to return home. Japan would not be "enslaved as a race nor destroyed as a nation"; however war criminals ... would have to be punished. Fundamental human rights and freedoms would be established. Japanese industries needed "to sustain her economy" would be permitted, but [war industries] would be abolished. "We call upon the Government of Japan," the thirteenth point declared, "to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of Japanese armed forces, ..."</dd>
<dd>&#160; The intent was clear between the lines as well as in the text of the declaration. The Allies--in effect, the Americans--showed that they were aware of Japanese feelings regarding the institution of the Emperor, but only by indirection. Nowhere was specific language about the future of Hirohito or the imperial institution he represented. there was neither call for his dethronement not his punishment. If that question had been an obstacle to surrender, it had been blunted.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>p. 265 (July 27, 1945)</dd>
<dd>&#160; Within hours of Tokyo’s interception of the text of the Potsdam proclamation--at 10:30 A.M. Japan time--the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War met at Premier Suzuki’s request. To his "inner Cabinet" he explained the very positive shift he saw from the unconditional surrender <i>of Japan</i> called for earlier to the unconditional surrender <i>of the armed forces</i>. The imperial structure, as Suzuki saw it, had been rescued, and it would be "extremely impolitic" to reject what amounted to an offer to preserve the key political institution of the Empire.</dd>
<dd>&#160; The military representatives among the six--the Ministers of War and Navy and the chiefs of staff of the Army and Navy--could only be persuaded to withhold a no until further word from Moscow.</dd>
<dd>... an official translation was brought to the Imperial Presence by Togo himself as soon as it was ready, ... [Hirohito] wondered to Togo why the text had come to Japan by broadcast and not through diplomatic messages. ...</dd>
<dd>&#160; Togo explained the means of delivery as discouraging for Japan. It was not so much a communication but a declaration of policy beyond negotiation. The terms were hard, the Emperor agreed, but they specifically ruled out making the Japanese a subject race. They were acceptable, as the war had to be stopped.</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd>&#160; If the Emperor assumed that his communicating a desire to his Foreign Minister that the war be stopped would indeed stop the war, he was more naive than the record of his bellicose statements indicated. ... Yet if he wanted the war to end he had to talk to his generals who kept it going, not the harassed and impotent civil servants who did their bidding. He had not attempted that, ... The idea had long surfaced that the imperial system might be preserved through asking for a modification of unconditional surrender to guarantee that, but he could not specifically ask to save his own neck if surrender turned his military leadership into war criminals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>p. 288 (July 28, 1945)</dd>
<dd>&#160; As far as Premier Suzuki’s government was concerned, the Potsdam insistence on unconditional surrender was impossible for Japan to take seriously. Supporting Sato’s contention that Potsdam was the only avenue to peace, and that the Zacharias gloss on its terms was a crucial "divergence" from the utter surrender forced upon Germany, Minister Kase cabled Togo from Bern that he saw real guarantees offered. The "Imperial House" was unmentioned, and thus sanctioned by implication. Further, "a Japanese domain is recognized in which Japanese sovereignty holds sway." ("It seems to me," Kase added in a parenthesis, "that this Proclamation provides a basis on which we [can] carry on our national structure which the Japanese race is now protecting with its very life’s blood.") As Sato did, Kase also observed that unconditional surrender applied only to the military and not to the government or the people, and he pleaded that is should be understood that the careful language of Potsdam appeared ”to have occasioned a great deal of thought” on the part of the signatory governments--"<i>they seem to have taken pains to save face for us on various points.</i>" And he pointed out in particular the promise that the Japanese people would "be given the opportunity to lead a peaceful and productive life."</dd>
<dd>&#160; "Magic" intercepted the cable ... possibly before Suzuki saw it in Tokyo,, ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>... Suzuki’s [dismissive <i>mokusatsu</i> statement] actually was intended to be ambiguous and to postpone judgment while awaiting a reply from the Soviets, but no one outside the Cabinet knew that, and Togo was helplessly furious. ...</dd>
<dd>&#160; With no overtures to the United States through neutral governments explaining that all the Japanese wanted was an explicitly favorable construction of Potsdam language with respect to the Emperor, Suzuki’s statement, even to watchers of "Magic" intercepts, appeared inescapably to be a victory of the all-or-nothing military over the moderates.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Even after Hiroshima, and the Soviet attack, the holdouts were still holding out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>p. 499 (August 9, 1945)</dd>
<dd>&#160; All six [members of the War Council] quickly agreed that retaining the imperial house was "the indispensable condition of acceptance." Short of that they would fight to the bitter end. War Minister Anami and the two chiefs of staff laid down additional terms, described by Togo as "specifically, that occupation of Japan should if possible be avoided or, if inescapable, should be on a small scale and should not include such points as Tokyo; and that [our] disarmament should be carried out on our responsibility; and that war criminals should be dealt with in Japan."</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd>&#160; Before the discussion could go further, news arrived of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, but even that stunning development could not break the deadlock.</dd>

<p>I've got quotes from <i>Downfall</i> on the Japanese and American views of the prospects for the Olympic invasion <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=_Downfall_+author:bill+author:woods&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=38B48B47.EEB8A887%40popd.ix.netcom.com&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=_Downfall_+author:bill+author:woods&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=38B48B47.EEB8A887%40popd.ix.netcom.com&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=_Downfall_+author:bill+author:woods&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=38B79E5E.FA0ED319%40popd.ix.netcom.com&amp;rnum=1&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=_Downfall_+author:bill+author:woods&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=38B79E5E.FA0ED319%40popd.ix.netcom.com&amp;rnum=1&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I won't copy them here. <i>I</i> think it's quite possible that, absent the bomb, the Japanese <i>would</i> have surrendered before the invasion began, but not soon enough to prevent mass famine in the winter of 1945-46, and of course until then the conventional bombing would have continued, with no need to spare Hiroshima and Nagasaki the fate of Tokyo.<br />

<dd>Your text is excessively long for an article discussion, you should rather present a concise argumentation. And I am not sure if you should quote such long parts of a copyrighted book online. Furthermore, it only presents one opinion and presentation of facts, check the listed external link <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html" rel="nofollow">Was Hiroshima Necessary?</a> for a very different one. And again, especially note that General Douglas MacArthur, Commander of US Army forces in the Pacific, stated on numerous occasions before his death that the atomic bomb was completely unnecessary from a military point of view: "My staff was unanimous in believing that Japan was on the point of collapse and surrender."</dd>
<dd>The quotes you provide show in some parts a clear bias. Not only that "the Allies were willing to deal on the question of the Emperor--and the Japanese knew it. They also knew that the Allies were explicitly offering softer terms than they had just imposed on Germany." is an unproven, unsourced statement. "Nowhere was specific language about the future of Hirohito" can be seen as much as support for the view that Japan had to think the institution of the Emperor would be abolished as it can be seen for the opposing view.</dd>
<dd>"The terms were hard, the Emperor agreed, but they specifically ruled out making the Japanese a subject race. <i>They were acceptable, as the war had to be stopped.</i>" is an obscene conclusion. <i>The Japanese would not have been enslaved as they deserved, so why did they not happily surrender?</i></dd>
<dd>Bombing innocent civilians is a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a>, atomic bombs or not, so the argument of the "alternative" is nonsensical. As the text shows clearly, "<b>Before the discussion could go further</b>, news arrived of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki." Slaughter was preferred to diplomacy, a strategy that could still be observed in the recent past. And "They should be happy with the atomic bombs, otherwise they would have starved to death" is just cynical. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 03:21, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MacArthur's views on the bomb are not necessarily objective:
<dl>
<dd><i>Victory</i> p. 436 (August 6, 1945)</dd>
<dd>... Theodore White ... interviewing General MacArthur in Manila, ... listened to the general, ... blame the Bomb as likely to end the days of heroic warfare. "Scholars and scientists" had stolen future wars from military professionals and made "men like me" obselete. There would be "no more wars" of the kind he knew, MacArthur mourned.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Nor did he or his staff suggest at the time that the invasion was 'completely unnecessary'. Neither did they think they were certain of victory. More importantly, neither did the leaders of the Japanese Army.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>from <i>Downfall</i>: The intelligence revelations about Japanese preparations on Kyushu emerging in mid-July transmitted powerful shock waves both in the Pacific and in Washington. On July 29, [MacArthur's intelligence chief] Willoughby ... noted first that the April estimate allowed for the Japanese capability to deploy six divisions on Kyushu, with the potential to deploy ten. "These [six] divisions have since made their appearance, as predicted," he observed, "and the end is not in sight." If not checked, this threatened "to grow to [the] point where we attack on a ratio of one(1) to one(1) which is not the recipe for victory."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for "Japan was on the point of collapse and surrender", maybe so but they'd been at that point for months and--absent some shock--there's no reason to think they wouldn't have tottered on for more months. <i>I</i> said above that I thought they might have surrendered before the invasion began in November, but that means a couple of months more of blockade and bombardment, and a couple of months less of relief supplies.</dd>

<dd>"the Allies were willing to deal on the question of the Emperor..." is <i>my</i> statement, supported by the following quotes. (Quotations are set off by indentation and page reference.)

The problem was the Army, for which that was not enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The discussion in "Before the discussion could go further" was among the members of the Japanese War Council. And reread the last line--<i>even after the second bomb</i> the Army leaders were still unwilling to surrender.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ultimately, after the Emperor took a stand,
<dl>
<dd>from <i>Downfall</i>: In a postwar commentary, [the Emperor's principal adviser Koichi] Kido reinforced Suzuki's analysis with the insight that the atomic bombs served not only as an important cause but as an indispensable excuse for the surrender: "If military leaders could convince themselves that they were defeated by the power of science but not by lack of spiritual power or strategic errors, they could save face to some extent."</dd>

I think it would be cool to mention how the various scientists that built the bomb felt about this question. Fascinating to me was to learn that the right wing zealot Edward Teller, 'father of the h bomb' , felt that the bombing of hiroshima was barbaric, and that a 'demonstration' should have happened. In fact many scientists signed a note to the government authorities to tell them that a demonstration should happen before the UN, and not use a city as a guinea pig. Meanwhile, Robert Oppenheimer, leftist wingnut, communist party donator, union organizer, and self-styled champion of the 'underdog', and head of the los-alamos lab during the manhattan project, who was almost kicked off the project many times for being a leftist political radical, actually argued against a 'demonstration', and that its first use should be on a target!!!!! This is all in the book 'brotherhood of the bomb', quite an excellent book.</p>
<p>I think it might be important to talk about how the military people, and what exactly they said, especially Stimson, Bush, Groves, and others.</p>
<p>Furthermore i think you should consider mentioning the firebombings of dresden, tokyo, and other cities, which in sheer numbers of deaths, were equivalent to the atomic bombings, although when you consider the horrible long-lasting deaths from cancer, it is a bit of a different picture. at least doctors knew what to do with burn victims.</p>
<p>Also you might want to mention that many US/allied POWs were in these cities when the bombs were dropped. Or if this is just a myth, definitely mention why its false. But I read somewhere that it was true.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good points. Albert Einstein also opposed the bombing, the article text "Soon <i>after</i> WWII discussion started to criticize" is definitely wrong, the bombing was already criticized <i>before</i> it happened. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 14:41, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is obviously impossible to know the exact toll; the margin of error on such an estimate is likely on the order of several thousand. Giving a figure of '237,062' implies more precision than is warranted (see <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_precision.html" title="False precision">false precision</a>); it would be better practice to represent this as '240,000'. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:11, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once the page is unprotected, another criticism of the U.S. decision should be added.

Operation Olympic was tentatively planned for November 1945, so there was no rush about dropping the bomb. The U.S. could have waited a couple weeks. With the Soviet declaration of war, any Japanese hopes of Soviet mediation would have been dashed, and the largest army in the world would have attacked Japanese forces in Manchuria. That might have prompted a surrender. If not, the bomb could have been tried later in August. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 13:51, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) I happened to find it (I was not searching for it, so it is possible that some "serious" equivalent could exist in reference newspapers, I didn't do a proper research on the subject)</dd>
<dd>2) It was published immediatly after the bombing, and I find it interesting to see that even during the war, some criticism still existed toward the goverment official stance (not to say propaganda), even on the subject of the Japanese Empire -- on which a mixture of revengefull sentiment dating back to Pearl Harbour mixed with utter racism.</dd>
<dd>3) <i>The Onion</i> seems to be a very old and almost reference satirical newspaper in the USA, and thus its point of view could be of some interest. Besides, the satirical nature of the newspaper might have helped expressing its point of view more freely and clearly than in a "serious" newspaper (though, again, I've not been searching for "serious" critics, so this supposition might actually turn out to be wrong).</dd>

<dd>Wooops... I was not aware of this. I think that you are right, and indeed such a parody has nothing to do in this article. I did not question the idea that <i>The Onion</i> could date back from the 1900's, since it actually is the case of <i>Le_Canard_Encha�n�</i>, which I am accustomed to... a serious reminder of triple-checking my sources it is&#160;!

<p>According to a docudrama on Hiroshima coproduced by the CBC and NHK, the use of the word <i>mokusatsu</i> was ambiguous purposefully. The military faction demanded unequivocal support from the civilian government so the government answered something like "In response to the military faction's demands for an answer to the Allies' insistance on unconditional surrender, we give 'mokusatsu'". This is ambiguous. Were the government ignoring the Allies, thus satifying the military, or were they answering (ignoring) the military, thus asking the Allies for time? If Prime-Minister Suzuki had been negotiating with other Japanese, it would have been a brilliant choice of words, but unfortunately the Americans misinterpreted (not unreasonably) by thinking the contempt was directed towards them. This is the how docudrama presented this story. I'm sure other interpretations are possible, but this one strikes me as plausible. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 01:54, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel I should comment here. I'm well informed of the attitudes in Japan that opposed surrender, but you're overlooking one major detail which is that the United States demanded <i>unconditional</i> surrender, which is certainly a very excessive demand to make of anyone and certainly not an easy demand to accept. Under unconditional surrender Japan may well have become a territory of the United States. The necessity of nuclear attacks to reach such an impossible goal does seem realistic, but a more explained and diplomatic form of surrender might well have been easily obtained. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:42, Sep 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While it is true that some elements within the Cabinet were seeking an end to hostilities, no one person could negotiate a surrender, not even the emperor. All members of the Japanese cabinet had to sign on any succession in hostilities, and before the bombing only a few were willing to do so, and this was not an unconditional surrender. They sent out feelers to the Soviets, but it was harldy a true negotiation. The JIA as well as the majority of the Navy, thought they could bleed the allies into a more favorable position including retention of the emperor, no occupying army in Japan, no disarmament, and no forfeiture of China and Korean territories. When the Soviets invaded Manchuria, the JIA ordered the starving and ill equiped troops to fight to the last, and they did.</dd>

<dd><i>It has been argued that, under the Nuremberg Principles and the Hague Convention, then in force, the use of atomic weapons against civilian populations on a large scale is a crime against humanity and a war crime. Some people consider the bombings the worst acts of terrorism in history. One officer of the International Court of Justice has stated: "Nuclear weapons can be expected - in the present state of scientific development at least - to cause indiscriminate victims among combatants and non-combatants alike, as well as unnecessary suffering among both categories… Until scientists are able to develop a 'clean' nuclear weapon which would distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, nuclear weapons will clearly have indiscriminate effects and constitute an absolute challenge to humanitarian law."

But I must say that I really think that attributing reluctance to classify the event as terrorism to americano-centrism does not do justice to the current. I am very sure that lots of people who would disagree with this classification are not from the USA, not bear much sympathy to the bombings or the people who ordered them. And again, I reallz would stress that "terrorism" is so very politically connoted that it has lots most of its meaning (like "anti-american" or "Communist", in the discourse of some people) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 15:51, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I certainly appreciate and welcome any dissent from my views, but only if that dissent can be presented in a rational medium. Verbal aggression I do not appreciate, nor pitiful attempts at trolling, nor opinions spouted verbatim from years of cultural brainwashing. Five years ago I though the attacks were justified and even praiseworthy. More recently I took to analyzing the situation more rationally.

<p>After much thought and research into this subject, it seems to me that those most critical of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagisaki are western intelectuals and the best defense for the bombing comes from Japan. Why is that? <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 21:31, Sep 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, Japan has been quite critic of this&#160;: the Hiroshima monument for Peace, and the Peace bell in fornt of the UN, are quite transparent, and the engagement of Japan against nuclear weapons is explicit as well. On the other hand, some people from all political horizons do somehow temper down the criticism&#160;: for the "left wing", it would be a display of rejection of the military State of Tojo and peace with the West and the World. For the "right wing", it would be some way of "forgiving it all", "all" including the crimes of the Japanese Army during the War&#160;; a kind of trade, which is understandable under the light of the absence of a "Nurenberg of Asia". <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 06:39, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Edit wars are pointless in the sense they're simple thoughtless refutations ("Is so!" "Is not!" Is so!"...).

Since most of this page is already related to the debate over the bombing rather than to the facts themselves, why not consider a new "Nuclear bombings on Japan -- Controversy" page which would link to here&#160;? We could have a section there about the question of wether the bombing qualifies as terrorism or not (or beter, <i>to what extend</i> is qualifies), and this would re-equilibrate the actual page (in the sense deplacing the center of gravity of the article to the facts). Besides, considering the arguments and references which have come forward in the discussion, I would consider the Controversy itself quite an interesting matter, which deserves its own entry -- I mean, if "<a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboo.html" title="Naboo">Naboo</a>" can have its entry, why not this&#160;?

<dd>This topic is going to remain controversial however it's organized (unless you're considering critique be ignored completely, which seems very much a POV gesture). I don't see the need to leave out critical opinion, since obviously most critique is philosophical and can't be proven (e.g. Just War Theory) or something no one can come to a consensus on (e.g. a definition for <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>). I'm not sure that a secondary page is a bad idea, though it should obviously wait until there's so much debate it imbalances the article as it is now.

<p>The current statement goes too far, it states that some consider it one of the worst acts of terrorism in history. That statement should not be made without further clarification about who, why or what standard they use. There is a lot of historical commentary available that the Japanese did not consider them worse than the fire bombings of Tokyo for instance. Where do they rank compared to Stalin's purges or China's cultural revolution, the bombing of dreden, the rape of nanking, etc. Perhaps some of the terror of Genghis Kahn while not larger in absolute terms is larger in relative terms.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 16:02, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't consider it too far to say "one of", personally I might not consider it necessarily the largest.

<dd>It might be one of the "best" acts of terrorism in history, if those who argue that it saved lives are correct. It is obvious that the US was hoping to win the war through the terror of the weapon. Those who used the weapon would not have had such high hopes for it, if it were to take out the same military targets precisely. If it was a defensible act, the leadership should have been willing to defend it and amend the appropriate international conventions, whether it is technically "terrorism" or not. The fact that they weren't willing to defend it, I think, points to the moral muck of the decision, because of the elements of terrorizing the Soviet Union and the vengence of unconditional surrender. Hardly noble causes, but then Gulf War one was supposedly noble, but left Saddam around with oil resources and an unimproved character. Perhaps noble isn't "right". --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:25, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the point was only to save lifes and end the war as soon as possible, then why not start negociations on a conditional basis&#160;? Japan would probably have agreed to a conditional surrender, and the main condition it wanted to stick to was preservation of the Emperor (Japanese military could have been dismantled, those responsible for he war would have been arrested and tried, etc.). Additionally, the US eventually did not deposit the Emperor, so sticking to the inconditional surrender seems somewhat futile act. I would be interested to hear an explanation to this. But anyhow, presenting the bombing as an act of salvation seems really extreme to me -- especially with the bombing of Nagasaki. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 22:54, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I think that keeping the WWII allies as permanent members is anachronistic and it should be possible to do something against vetos for selfish reasons that have nothing to do with justice. And it is a joke to have five countries as permanent members ruling about weapons inspections when these five countries have five of the biggest arsenals of weapons of mass destruction themselves and do not allow inspections. Even if a dictatorship entered the council, it is better to work with dictators than just let them do what they want. And in cases of ethnical cleansings or invasions of souvereign nations, is it not good to have a force that stops such crimes? <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 14:02, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

On the subject of whether the dropping of the bombs should be classified as terrorism, it has been dismissed as opinion. I am unwilling to dismiss it so as such per se. Certainly it the dropping is just called terrorism, then it is mere opinion or name calling, however if a definition of terrorism is referenced and an argument made applying the terms of that definition to the facts, then it is not opinion, but an argument to be responded to on the merits.</p>
<p>We don't want wikipedia to have the dryness of a dictionary, but rather a cutting edge of the academic debate. If an argument is without merits, it will easily be debunked.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical justification and criticism vs revisionist justification and criticism</span></h2>
<p>I propose that we have 4 sections of justification and criticism. Two that are documented historical thinking (contemporary at the time of the dropping and its immediate aftermath). And two that are the best of the current revisionist debate. Modern nihilistic reductionism finds both sides equally culpable. The bombing was a terrorist attack upon "innocent" civilians. Those civilians were treated as military assets by their government legitimizing them as military targets through the policy of conscription of men, women and children. The bombings themselves are nothing special vis'a'vis the other weapons of mass destruction that took a toll, firebombings and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a>--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:06, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To the extent that there is a serious body of opinion that defends the bombings on the grounds that they killed civilians who were employed in war-related work, we can report that POV (properly attributed). The issue of whether the Japanese government acted wrongly in implementing conscription and/or in putting those civilians in those circumstances is out of place in this article. Therefore, I don't see any virtue in drawing an artificial line between "old" and "new" arguments. Of course, we can and should note that some of the debate was contemporary and that other issues have arisen since then. For example, supporters of the bombings have pointed to Japanese government documents, not publicly available at the time, that they say show that Japan would not have surrendered without the bombings. Opponents have pointed to declassified U.S. government documents, also not publicly available then, that they say show American motives as being strongly related to intimidating the USSR rather than ending the war. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:14, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think whether those civilians were entitled to protective classification as civilians is relevant to the argument or controversy surrounding the bombings. Any opinion which can be rigorously and consistently defended and sheds light on the issues is valid, whether it is part of a "serious body" or not. The contemporary arguments are good to know but often they are poor justification for what was just a gut instinctual or intuitive decision. Their actions demonstrate that they knew that the civilian/military distinction had broken down, but that does not mean they could articulate or even understood why. It is left to postererity to try to understand why, and how it can be avoided in the future. Leaders who have already killed hundreds of thousands of their own innocent civilians by conscripting them and sending them to war, could easily lose any inhibition about also killing the "other side's" civilians. Modern reductive thinking has already dismissed the men, women, and children distinctions as mere ageism and sexism, although, admittedly it has not been able to strip the distinctions of their emotional content, especialling in the case of children. Revisionist thinking may look like 20/20 hindsight, but it is essential to extracting all we can learn from history. If we limited ourselves to contemporary thinking about WWI, we might learn that the US should never have enterred the war and that the treaty of Versaille was unfair, but we would not have learned that it should never have been fought and that all of the combantants would have been better off surrendering than fighting. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 04:43, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Civilians: This article can properly include the pro-bombing argument that the targets included industrial facilities of military importance, and the anti-bombing argument that the mass killing of civilians was wrongful.

<dd>You write: 'Any opinion which can be rigorously and consistently defended and sheds light on the issues is valid, whether it is part of a "serious body" or not.'

That's why it matters whether there's "a serious body of opinion".

<p>At least the policy gives some space to minority views. But you are wrong that if "no one else agrees with him, then it just doesn't matter how rigorous his argument is.", especially since your example was from a scientific field. The theory that global warming had a largely human cause had serious trouble with the high inverse correlation in the data between the warming and a non-human phenomena, comsic ray flux and solar sunspot activity. The then mainstream viewpoint, had to acknowlege the great uncertainty in their models and knowledge of cloud physics. The theories about the cause of ulcers had to yield when despite the mainstream opinion, it turns out bacteria could live in the high acid environment of the stomach. The peer review in a wiki philosophy "encyclopedia" has the potential to be more lively in its debate and more challenging of complacent assumptions. Laughing retrospectively after trillions of dollars of resources have been diverted and millions of lives have been lost in opportunity cost is a trajic and unjustifiable (although perhaps excusable) solution. Theories and facts that cannot be rejected, must be addressed, otherwise we fall prey to the errors of democracy and community. We may not be able to enforce this ideal in a wiki enviroment, but we can try to develop and encourage this as an element of the culture.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 05:44, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Current Wikipedia policy is that Wikipedia is not a place for "peer review" with the purpose of lively debate that challenges current assumptions. Instead, it's to report significant facts. Of all the scientific theories out there now that almost no one believes, I'm sure at least a couple will be the accepted orthodox wisdom sometime in the future. Of all the political or other opinions that are now held only by a handful of people, who are derided as crackpots or whatever, I'm sure at least a couple will be widely accepted sometime in the future. For purposes of editing an encyclopedia in 2004, though, that doesn't matter. We're just reporting the views that have some significance in terms of their adherents. If you disagree with that approach, you're going to have to try to get Wikipedia policy changed. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 06:00, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historians</span></h2>
<p>I do not see why we should mention certain historians in this text who do not have their own article and who are unknown to most readers. There are certainly "historians" who say that the World War was all the fault of the treaty of Versaille and the Jewish world conspiracy, that the holocaust never happened and that the concentrations camps were set up by the US and the Soviets for their German prisoners. However, I would get sick if I read in a wikipedia article: Many historians like EX-WHY-Zet point to the facts that the World War was all the fault of the treaty of Versaille ...</p>
<p>I think in the present case it is sufficient to present both views and to name only prominent individuals like those who ordered the acts, those who worked on the scientific project, the official view of the cities... If there was a prominent historian like Goldhagen who started a famous debate ok, but we should not single out university professors arbitrarily. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 12:22, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the reasons I stated above, I agree with you that not every conceivable viewpoint deserves mention. (As for your examples, though, certainly there are plenty of reputable historians who point to the Treaty of Versailles as being at least part of the cause of World War II.)

<p>I would like to chime in.</p>
<p>You may be correct when you stated that GBWR’s source claimed that the total number of deaths from the bombing were in excess of Hiroshima’s population at the time of the bombing. Hiroshima’s population at the time of the bombing was approximately 210,000 according to the Japanese census <a href="http://www.pref.hiroshima.jp/chiiki/toukei/sta/s_jink-e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pref.hiroshima.jp/chiiki/toukei/sta/s_jink-e.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. It is not clear if this figure includes Korean forced labor, and military personnel, but it does not indicate one way or the other. It should be noted that most census records were destroyed in the bombing, but the Manhattan Engineer District’s estimate accounts for population evacuated from the city prior to August 8th, 1945.</p>
<p>I would also like to dispute the given numbers of dead and injured for Hiroshima as well as Nagasaki by drawing on several sources.</p>
<p>A post bombing study performed by the Manhattan Engineer District in 1946, came up with the following information <a href="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/MED/index.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/MED/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p>I have seen population estimates for Hiroshima that go all the way up to 400,000, but it is unclear where these numbers were drawn from.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that GBWR’s source does not say that 237,062 died as a result of the bombings. It states that 237,062 is the total number on its monument. The number on the monument is made up of those individuals believed killed in the bombing, exposure to radiation, subsequent deaths of hibakusha (whose cause of death could not be linked to the bombings) as well as US POW’s who had been killed elsewhere in grisly experiments that the Japanese military apparently wanted to hide.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the only medical study which has tracked the health of hibakusha, was the one linked in the prior vesrion of the article <a href="http://www.rerf.or.jp/eigo/faqs/faqse.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rerf.or.jp/eigo/faqs/faqse.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 20:42, Oct 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to the UN commision on the after effects of the Hiroshima and Nagisaki bombings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term study of the survivors of the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki showed that high radiation exposures cause excess cancer in the exposed individuals. Till 1990, the Radiation Effects Research Foundation recorded 7827 cancer deaths in the survivor population of just over 86,000. Radiation exposure might have caused 421 excess cancers. Of the 17 types of cancers considered, survivors suffered excesses in 16; at lower radiation levels the risk of cancer has not been demonstrated. The cellular repair mechanisms play a role at all levelsA few `mavericks' believe that low level radiation exposure is beneficial to man. They assert that radiation safety professionals have a vested interest in arguing that radiation is risky at any level. They ignore the fact that the assumption of risk at low level radiation is advocated as a matter of abundant caution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Studies on 1600 children who were irradiated while they were in their mother's womb during the atomic bomb explosions in the two cities revealed that 30 of them suffered clinically severe mental retardation. Between 0 and 7 weeks post conception mental development was not affected. Between 8 and 15 weeks the sensitivity for mental retardation was maximum. This is possibly because neuronal proliferation and cell migration in the cortex is most active during this period. From 15 weeks to 25 weeks the incidence of metal retardation was clearly lower. In general, mental retardation was found to depend on radiation dose. There was no detectable threshold dose below which the effect was zero. But a threshold of 100 milligray cannot be ruled out. (milligray is a unit of radiation dose; the skin dose in some medical x-ray examinations can be as high as 1 milligray).</li>

<dd><a href="../../../w/w/o/User%7EWwoods_7169.html" title="User:Wwoods">—wwoods</a>, A) Yes, the city is quoted, and the text says so. No reason to let the city's statement be followed by an obscene lie. B) out of "cancer and other long-term ailments" you make "not explicitly radiation related" and then conclude "everyone is counted". So everyone in Hiroshima dies of cancer and and other long-term ailments? Long-term car accidents? Long-term heart-attacks? Long-term murders? C) is completely unfounded.</dd>
<dd>As the provided article indicates, the estimate includes all bombing-related victims, also Americans. I could imagine that Hiroshima also counts those they believe to have died of radiation related causes even if they were born after the bombings, e.g. by sick mothers. And as you admit, you do not know the exact number of inhabitants of Hiroshima at the time of the bombing. Feel free to find out how Hiroshima came to the number, but do not dare to include your own sick phantasies in the article again as if they were factual. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 06:07, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>B) <i>You</i> said, "it was easy to find a major news source that explicitly wrote that the added deaths were radiation related." But in fact your article doesn't mention radiation at all. C) Find an example of a hibakusha who has died and not been included in the list.</dt>
<dt>You're missing the point of the list; it's not a list of people who have died as a result of the bomb, it's a list of 'atom-bomb victims' who have died, period.</dt>
<dt>It might help you control your rage if you kept track of who you're talking to, but TDC had a good point</dt>
<dd>I've got a figure of ~330k people in Hiroshima at the time; doesn't 237k/330k = ~70% seem implausibly high for bomb-related deaths? How much higher do you expect the final count to go?</dd>
<dt>As for your "sick phantasies", don't bother to project them on me; deal with them yourself.</dt>

<dd>Again: "Hiroshima city added to a list - encased in a stone monument - 5,142 names of those who have <b>died from cancer and other long-term ailments</b> over the past year". It is not my job to find a hibakusha who has died and not been included in the list. I have sourced my version.

<dd>My source did include the statement that only those who had died of bomb related causes were added. . One of the sources is not precise. This makes the case for a sentence like "The city of Hiroshima's list of bomb victims who have since died included 237,062 individuals in 2004" or so, it does not make the case for a statement like "The city of Hiroshima keeps a list of 237,062 individuals it ridiculously claims to have died of bomb related causes although it just includes everyone who was in the city at the time of the bombing and who since died." <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 00:59, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Given that no one has so much as mentioned the link on this page, and given that -- when I take the novel approach of actually looking at the site linked to -- I find that it contains useful information at a greater level of detail than is appropriate for the article (the exactly correct circumstance for an external link), I think it should be in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:14, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

I also remain neutral on the issue in controversy but found protection highly necessary due to an edit war currently in progress and a request requested here by <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a>. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a>'s primary complaint was my employing the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">three revert rule</a> suggested by protection policy in a way that he disagreed with. I would at this point severely recommend someone look carefully over the current state and situation within that article before unprotecting it, although I see I am too late.

<dd>Even the appearance of impropriety presents a problem, and there is no doubt from your past actions that you would like to exaggerate the awfulness of the bombings, as GBWR is doing. Yes, a page should be unlocked if it is improperly locked, regardless of whether locking it at all is a good idea. Especially if an admin is taking it on themselves to choose a version, as you did. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">V</font></a> 06:28, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it would be less awful than 230,000 dead. &lt;GBWR-style demagoguery&gt;You apparently find the deaths of 70,000 people wholly unworthy of note.&lt;/GBWR-style demagoguery&gt; And quit with the red herring link issue. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 07:53, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I categorized it as terrorism, which is not in any way an exaggeration, it's an alternative classification which I argued for as logically as I could in the talk page. Unlike GBWR, I am not and have never been involved in an edit war on that page or on any other page. You question my ability to maintain a NPOV, and yet there is very little evidence to suggest that I do not. "Past actions" includes nothing more than said classification and a perceived grude against you in a talk page. Having a page unprotected because a single user does not trust an administrator because of perceptions of friction and their overall political nature does not in my judgement constitute enough of a reason to unprotect a page that was handled following standard procedure. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 06:55, Oct 6, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps the word <i>exaggerate</i> is not quite the right one, but on a continuum between "incinerating two cities was an act of moral purity" and "we should have surrendered rather than risk harming a Japanese fly", you clearly have an opinion well outside the mainstream which you are willing to fight for. And yes I consider your comments to me on Talk to be aggressive and incredibly uncalled for, and furthermore a clear sign you should not be acting as an admin there. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 07:58, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Strangely enough, I find your comments hostile to me as well. A single user perceiving some sort of hostility in comments that no one else seems to feel are out of line, I would argue, is probably not the most logical reason to de-admin someone. Considering comments involving you listed <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_VeryVerily_8ac7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/VeryVerily">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_VeryVerily2_d40a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/VeryVerily2">here</a>, as well as three <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">requests for arbitration</a>, I would ask you to consider to yourself whether it is coincidence that other users hold you in a similary low level of regard, or whether it is in some way a consequence of your behavior. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 09:36, Oct 6, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>You now appear to me to be extremely dishonest. It was you who attacked me out of nowhere, you have no evidence that "no one else" feels your comments were out of line, and I never suggested de-admining anyone. The negative comments you note exist because I do much to defend the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy over those who push views on political articles, something which most users leave to others (to keep their own hands clean?). Now if you can see over your nose you might read your initial comment to me again and wonder how it might sound to others. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 10:07, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's a clear difference in saying "no one seems to" and "no one else"; the former case as I used means no one else seems to have acknowledged any objection to my comments. I didn't "attack you out of nowhere", and if in my personal judgement I consider people who engage in edit wars to be "problem users" I don't think that makes me an exceptionally vicious or unusual user. I find your claims to uphold the values of a NPOV extremely laughable (in a literal, and not necessarily condemnable sense), in light of comments such as "I have no objection to saying that some critics say [that the bombings were acts of terrorism]. It might be worth showing (thought not saying) that most such critics are ignorant of military history." I don't regret anything in my initial discourse with you except that I called you a deliberate troll, I would now use the adjective subconscious. As for the de-adminning comment, it came from me misreading there as here, for which I apologize. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 10:53, Oct 6, 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where does the 237 thousand debate, now stand?</span></h2>
<p>I read the link that apparently supports the 237+ thousand figure, and it appears to be a political attempt to let everyone that dies be a "victim", since it names particular victims. Most of the recent deaths could be defended as "associated" with the atomic bomb, only to the extent that the death of someone who shook Trumans hand, and died 40 years later, could be "associated" with Truman. If the language "associated" is to be used in the article, then it must be highly qualified so that all implications of causality are explicitly denied. The other link to a site showing the proportion of deaths that statistics indicate are excess deaths is far more scientifically credible. Hopefully, this community won't allow this scientifically illiterate figure into the article without proper qualification. Perhaps language like, "Since with particular deaths are excess deaths attributable to the bombings is impossible to determine, the city of Hiroshima has chosen to memorialize all deaths."--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:06, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not the news "source" that has the agenda they are probably correctly reporting what they were told, it is the Hiroshima politicians, that don't want to pick and choose whose name goes on the memorial. It is like the agent Orange controversy here in the US, there are some small percentage of excess cancer deaths that must be due to the exposure, but what politician is going to look the family of the victim in the eyes and say that the odds are your relative would have gotten cancer anyway.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:39, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Read the paragraph carefully, they are clearly adding all cancer and long term ailment victims to the list, only a small percentage of these could be correctly a part of the "toll". "toll" is a loaded term and probably should not be used with this figure. It looks to me like they may be making SOME discrimination among the deaths, such as not including auto accident victims, the people who manage the memorial are choosing not to discriminate further.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:46, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said earlier, I take it to be a list of "atom-bomb victims" who have died--of whatever cause. Of course, most of them <i>did</i> die as the direct or indirect effect of the bomb. The other <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibakusha.html" title="Hibakusha">hibakusha</a> on the list are also 'victims' of the bomb, having suffered materially, medically, psychologically, and/or socially--it just didn't cause their deaths. Properly characterized, the 237k number belongs in the article--it's the sort of thing some people will be wanting to look up. However, we don't want to mislead them as to its meaning.</dd>

<dd>You "take it to be" is something slightly different from "you are entitled to present it as the truth in the article". Also, nothing in the article indicates that they are "clearly adding all cancer and long term ailment victims to the list". You can also "take it to mean" they only add those believed to have died of long-term effects of the radiation. As long as we are not sure about how they come to the number we should write that, e.g. "In 2004, the city of Hiroshima listed 237.062 atom bomb victims at the Cenotaph". 213.23.141.19 21:39, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

In most cancer's the percentage of excess deaths is small. Even in leukemia where the percentage is significant, there is still no way to tell which particular deaths are due to the radiation exposure. Why try to inflate the figure and risk the credibility of the article. Even without the inflation it is one of the largest single acts of terror in history, unless one counts the decisions to initiate a compaign of terror as a single act, even though the duration of that decisions effects was much longer.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 23:43, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no reason to doubt your word on this, and wiki policy requires the assumption of good faith and the Pacific War Research Society sounds authoritative. I searched for your mention of the documents, but must have used the wrong search strategy, apologies. I was assuming they would be near the statement about the order. Given the length of the discussion, and poor quality of our search tools, I hope you don't mind, if I ask another possibly redundant question. What is the purpose of presenting the order, unless it can be shown that American authorities knew of it (is there also evidence of that?) it can't be used as justification of their decision. However, of course, it may be post hoc confirmation that the American leadership assessment of or fears about the character of the Japanese leadership and militaristic culture were correct. They had plenty of other evidence to allow them to justify their conclusions.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:54, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>If this order existed in order to mention it we would also need to know that it was still relevant so long after Tojo's resignation. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 21:40, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be difficult to establish, given the post war self interest of those who would have been knowledgable. I see no problem with using the order, post hoc. We would know more about it however, if the US leadership had any knowledge of it at the time the decision was made. While the order was a violation of international law, was it an immoral order in Japanese culture of the time? I know they had little respect for people who surrendered, so perhaps there would have been no hesitation to execute it even after Tojo was gone. Were the Japanese signatories to the international treaties involved? If they weren't, and if the order was not immoral in their eyes, then of course it could not justify the use of the atomic bombs in their eyes either.</dd>
<dd>I think it is a disservice to international morality to focus so much on the dropping of these bombs. After all the other demoralizing decisions world leadership had made during the war, such as the millions of innocent civilians conscripted to their deaths, the bombs are small potatoes, and although there were possible alternatives that would have saved more lives, a reasonable argument can be made that they did. If the US leadership is to be criticised because they should have become immoral only as a last resort, then they had already crossed that line long before these bombs. Having done these things, it should be no surprise that they also lacked the honor to submit themselves to international law, plead no contest and accept their just execution. At least these weasels were able to produce a fairly cogent spin, that has left the verdict of history up in the air. I don't think the rape of Nanking has faired quite as well in retrospect.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:33, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Silverback, think "Two evils do not make on good". I really find that the "it is a disservice to international morality to focus so much on the dropping of these bombs" is clumsy; it reminds me the time when a far-right wing History professor of mine stated that he would not tell us about the Nazi extermination camps because he though they were "spoken about quite enough". I do <b>not</b> mean to imply anything about Silverback himself (especialy since he makes his point quite clear that he's not subject to this kind of bias later in his post). I would like to caution everybody not to be carried out to concepts like "morality", especially when one comes to evoke "morality" to discard the importance of law, or historical facts. "Morality" is a relative concept. Facts and law ar not (law is actually <i>designed</i> not to be). Most of the ideals we stand for (scientific truth, democracy,...) stand without need for morality, because they can rely on facts and laws alone. Only dictatorships are obsessed by morality by opposition to laws and facts (the Taliban regime, Franco's Spain, Nazi Germany, ...)&#160;; when morality starts to cloud facts and laws in a democracy, people can start to be very worried. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 06:59, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We've got a start Rama if we can agree that "Two evils do not make on good". That undermines the justification for conscription and even net-lives-saved goverment programs during peace time such as the regulation of drugs by the Food and Drug Administration, etc. While the concept and purpose of law can be elegant in theory, the reality can be quite different and that difference can undermine respect for the law. Demoocracy and law are not intrinsically stable systems and there must be shared values to sustain them. Law is prone to erosive precedents that spread like viruses, reducing constitutions and legal principles to nihilism. Courts defer to majority sentiment too often. Legislatures pass laws that they know there are not the resources to enforce. Not only is there selectively in which laws get enforced, there is further selective in who they get enforced against. International law, that only gets enforced against the loses of wars is one example. International sanctions that pile up without enforcement is another erosion of the law. Law that protects corruption and hides its workings, such as the stonewalling in the Oil for Food program, and sealed court cases erodes the law. Law requires open proceedings, shared values and intellectual honesty, in other words, "morality". Or it will not be respected, otherwise it is just a tool of those in power, that provides the illusion of legitimacy. Democracy without constraining law, values and respect for others is just a tool of the mob or those who can manipulate it. I hope we can progress from "Two evils do not make on good" to also agree that "Two morally neutral social tools, democracy and law, also do not make a good".--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:19, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While there is consensus about the fact that the Nazis committed horrible war crimes that under no circumstances can ever be allowed to happen again, there is still reluctance to face the fact that the response was immoral and in some cases illegal as well. In order to draw conclusions about how to deal best with crimes as those committed by the Nazis one most discuss the failures in history. If you can add relevant information about the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a> you are invited to do so. Whether you "see no problem with using the Tojo order, post hoc." is irrelevant.

<dd>Why is it relevant whether it was still valid? US decision makers apparently didn't know about it when they make the atomic bomb decision, it use here, would be as a demonstration of the Japanese military character at that time. Even if there was a tradition of standing orders expiring when the order giver is changed, or after 6 weeks or whatever, it still serves as a negative character reference. The onus on those who wish to rehabilitate Japanese WWII character, would be to find that the order was opposed at the time within the Japanese hierarchy on either moral or legal grounds. Just saying, after it had been in effect for many months, that since Tojo was no longer in charge, so subordinates would have checked up the management chain before executing, or some such, does not decrease its relevance, since its relevance is in the post hoc analysis of whether the pre-decision judgements made on uncertain facts, were in retrospect a fairly good assessment of the character of the Japanese. The actual pre-decision assessment was probably extrapolated from other experience during the war. BTW, don't assume that the Nazis were the only immoral acts during the war. United States conscription, fire bombings and aid to the its Russian ally which was also conscripting wasting lives as if they were toilet paper, were also reprehensible. The NAZI crimes don't justify US and Russian offenses against their own innocent civilians.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:15, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then you obviously have no problem justifying an attack upon a civilian population with the intent of influencing its support for its government (terrorism), because that is what conscription is. Conscription takes away a government's moral authority to protest terrorist attacks against its civilian population, because it has claimed them as military assets making them legitimate military targets. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">Conscription</a> is also torture, with sleep and food deprivation, physical and verbal abuse, conditioning to follow orders and desensitization to killing. In the United States it also violates the liberty clause of the Pledge of Allegiance. Ask yourself, if you have just been conscripted, which government is the most immediate threat to your freedom. Conscription is based on the nationalist premise that nations <b>own</b> individuals and have rights that supercede the individual. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, women and children were conscripted to work in factories, do you defend the "right" of that government to do that, or do you just reserve that "right", just for governments you like, or perhaps just democracies, reserving dictatorial perogitives for the dictatorship of the majority or plurality? Other than the fact that it is slavery, terrorism, torture, and legitimizes enemy terrorist attacks, I have no moral problems with it either. Why give up the best argument yet for justifying the atomic bomb attacks, that they are the responsibility of the Japanese government, which had used the Japanese people like military property? You must be one of those "reporting for duty" types, that think only subjects not governments must obey laws and respect individual rights.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 03:26, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>I don't have a reference to Tojo, but the Japanese were known to be capable of giving and carrying out such orders. From Richard Frank's <i>Downfall</i> (1995) , p. 161</dt>
<dd>&#160; When the tide of war turned, Japan began to move POWs from regions likely to be retaken by the Allies to Japan or the Asian continent. But when the Japanese shipped POWs, they did so in unmarked vessels without notice, so when Allied airmen and submariners destroyed Japanese shipping, they sank also thousands of POWs. By Japanese count, 10,800 POWs died out of 50,000 transported.</dd>
<dd>&#160; By 1945, the war had already turned up ample evidence that the Japanese would kill any prisoners if there was threat of liberation. [Examples of atrocities: Gilbert Islands, Ballale, Wake Island, Palawan]</dd>
<dd>&#160; Nearly to a man, Allied POWs believed that Japanese would kill them if the Homeland was invaded. Surviving written documentation to support this belief is limited but highly suggestive, as Daws records
<dl>
<dd>At Taihoku on Formosa, an entry in the Japanese headquarters journal recorded <i>extreme measures</i> to be taken against POWs in <i>urgent situations: Whether they are destroyed individually or in groups, or however it is done, with mass bombing, poisonous smoke, poisons, drowning, decapitation, or what, dispose of the prisoners as the situation dictates. In any case, it is the aim not to allow the escape of a single one, to annihilate them all, and not to leave any traces.</i>[Gavan Daws, <i>Prisoners of the Japanese</i> (1994)]</dd>

<dd>I shall assume the good faith of someone who told other users "suck your own dick" and who wrote that "only limp-dicked historians" doubt the legitimacy of the atomic bombings of hundreds of thousands of civilians, but on the other hand I shall assume bad faith of the Japanese because "Allied POWs believed that Japanese would kill them"? What do you think did Axis POWs believe about how they would be treated? I can easily find you books claiming that the real concentration camps were those built by the US close to the Rhine were hundreds of thousands were starved to death.

<dd>I doubt that allied POWs believed this in general. "Japanese atrocities, known at the time, lent credence to this fear." is about as neutral as "the unprecedented atrocity of the nuclear bombings would have made such a vengeance understandable". The question whether Tojo's order was still valid is critical here. Mentioning that he had resigned months ago is the least we have to do for the sake of neutrality. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 01:00, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Get-back, the current language seems fair in terms of the resignation. However, unless the Japanese military practice is radically different, the order should be assumed in effect until rescinded. Commanders are changed or killed often during war, soldeirs continue doing their duty, guards don't abandon their posts during a change in command because they aren't under orders any more, supply ships don't pause and drift waiting for new orders, etc.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 01:42, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>As to whether decisions of a U.S. President continue in effect after he leaves office, some do and some don't. If something goes through the public comment period and other requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, and is formally promulgated in the Code of Federal Regulations, then it's a valid regulation until rescinded, regardless of who's President. Was there a Japanese equivalent of CFR? If so, give us the citation to the written and published direction that all prisoners be killed. If not, drop the analogy. We should report the fact that Tojo was no longer in office. Any reader who chooses to dismiss that fact as totally immaterial to the effect of the order is free to do so. There's substantial grounds for considering the fact relevant to that effect, though. There's also substantial grounds for considering the effect of the order to be irrelevant to the decison to drop the bomb, given that the U.S. decisionmakers didn't know about the order, and given that the serious arguments against the bombing don't say that the U.S. should instead have launched an amphibious invasion. The serious arguments are that other courses of action (waiting for the Soviet entry, offering less-than-unconditional surrender, dropping a demonstration bomb instead of taking out a city) would have obviated the invasion. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:34, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where specifically does the dispute currently stand? Is TDC proposing language stronger than the current language in the article? Is Get-back-world-respect proposing removal of the current language? Apologies, I have just lost track of where we are. While, US decision makers lacked direct knowledge of the order, it is an after the fact confirmation that a policy and character they suspected and feared also had an explicit official existance and fit overall into their view of the costs of an invasion, and the extremes the Japanese military culture would go to, and the leadership's unwillingness to admit defeat and their likely determination to come back from anything short of defeat. Whether or not the Japanese agreed with international standards for the conducting of war and the treatment of prisoners, they certainly knew what those western standards were, and what the likely consequences would be if they were defeated. The order is confirmatory evidence within this fabric. Although, I don't see that it needs much more than its current language and real estate. Perhaps a less qualified statement than "supporters claim" is justified, based on documentary evidence that TDC has reported.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:47, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am ok with the current wording that I had suggested. Both Silverback and JamesMLane seem to agree, however, TDC tells me "You lost". I have to admit that you lost me here. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 01:22, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sentence now is

<dd>"Supporters also claim that Allied POW's, numbering over 100,000, would have been executed at the first sign of an invasion of the Japanese mainland because General Tojo had ordered this before his resignation as premier in July of 1944."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This clearly improves neutrality as it leaves open the question we cannot answer whether the order was still valid so long after Tojo's resignation. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 23:36, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since the order is agreed to exist, TDC is correct in "point"ing to it. According to the order, all the POWs were to be executed at the first sign of an invasion. Get-back-world-respect believes the order might not have been considered still in effect after Tojo's resignation. However, TDC's version mentions the resignation and does not comment on whether it was still in effect or likely to be followed. I think Get-back-world-respect is trying to use "claim" to qualify the wrong phrase, he is wanting to qualify a phrase or sentence that is not in TDC's version. I think what he is getting at would be TDC's version with this sentence added: "Supporters claim that this order was still in effect and likely to be followed." perhaps followed by "Opponents claim the order might have been null and void following the resignation." I think TDC's version gives the resignation information and makes no claim about whether or not the order would still be in effect. In fact we don't know for sure whether it would have been or not, although standing military orders like this should probably be considered in effect unless explicitly rescinded or replaced, or in conflict with a more recent order. TDC's version, which just gives the facts and makes no statement about whether it will still in effect, seems a good compromise.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 07:08, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
