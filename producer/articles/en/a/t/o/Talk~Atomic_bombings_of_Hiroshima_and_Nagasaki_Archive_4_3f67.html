<dd>Whether or not there was a direct link between the bombings and the surrender is debateable. It is likely Russia's breaking of their treaty with Japan and their invasion of Manchuria was a large part of why the decision to surrender was made. However, be that as it may, the closeness in time between the dropping of the bombs and the surrender is noteworthy. In addition, Russia's decision to break the treaty and launch the invasion on an earlier schedule than they had planned was likely a consequence of their understanding of the immediate import of the atomic bomb insofar as their aims in Manchuria and the various islands including the Habomai group were concerned. For these reasons, it seems to me that the date of the surrender is relevant. I think it would be a great idea to perhaps start a supplemental article about what is known about the surrender so that greater clarifications can be made. I would also like to point out that I don't believe my re-wording of the sentence in question at all implies the surrender was a direct result of the bombing. However, for the reasons I have stated above, it seems to me that is relevant. I hope you understand my position. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 11:26, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "support the bomb" section presents arguments in favour of using nuclear weapons on cities, it is very expected to find arguments that it was the cause, usually presented as the only cause, of the surrender of Japan. The section "opposition to the bomb" presents counter-arguments (which is also expectable, but there are objections of high ranking US officials (including "war heroes")).</dd>
<dd>Also, showing some sort of respect for the victims of this tragedy in the wording of your comments might be appreciated. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 08:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NOT mentioning the surrender date is just a poor injection of POV. I like the reworded sentence of Xaliqen better which makes it neutral as to the exact causal nature of the surrender, but not mentioning it at all would be silly. Trying to insert POV by omission of a major fact is just incorrigible. Since the after-the-fact stated point of the bombs was to get Japan to surrender, it is worth noting when they did indeed surrender. Whether or not you think it actually was a causal force (I think to assume that it played no role is a bit ridiculous, though the Russian invasion of Manchuria obviously played a role as well), it should be put in there. Let people come to their own conclusions, but don't make it difficult for them to look up facts. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 13:26, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am very unwilling to debate whether there is a direct connection. Personally, I believe saying there is none is a quite naive view, yet some subscribe to it anyway. First of all, I really liked Xaliqen's idea to have an article about issues surrounding Japan's surrender; in it we can examine a lot of these difficult issues. in it. As for the sentence in question, I think it is irrelevant not because there is no connection between the bombings and the the surrender, which is probably not the case, but because it is not necessary to touch this issue at the first paragraph. Fastfission made a good point; it was a stated aim of the bombings to force Japan to surrender. Then why do we say this? Maybe I am missing something, but mentioning the effect without mentioning the rationale behind it is POV too. I will try to reword the intro again, never hesitate to rework on it. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 16:17, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the most neutral statement <i>for the intro paragraph</i> is simply: "On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, Japan officially surrendered to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html#World_War_II" title="Allies">Allied powers</a>.". The intro is not the place to debate whether or not it causally followed or not, or what the "stated reason" was (there were many stated reasons by many different "official" people). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:40, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know why saying about Japan's surrender is more neutral than the others. Even if the bombings are not to get Japan to surrender, mentioning Japan's surrender at all would make no sense. I think it's better to stick to something less debatable. If even merely saying the rationales behind the bombings are controversial, why do we have to say more besides the bombings themselves? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 06:06, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't say "mentioning Japan's surrender at all would make no sense.". I said we would come to that conclusion if we suppose that the US has no intention to get Japan to surrender by dropping the bombings. And we know this is absurdity.

<p>I don't much care for, "One of the primary reasons given for the useage of the bomb, was that it would force Japan to surrender unconditionally." How many primary reasons were given; how many primary reasons weren't expressed; what <i>other</i> reasons were there?&#160;:-) Also, while "unconditional surrender" is useful shorthand, the Allies' demand was that Japan accept the terms of the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potsdam_Declaration_2eae.html" title="Potsdam Declaration">Potsdam Declaration</a>, <i>one</i> of which was the "unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces". <a href="../../../w/w/o/User%7EWwoods_7169.html" title="User:Wwoods">—wwoods</a> 01:57, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a matter of fact, there were a number of primary reasons given. One reason was to strike a devastating psychological blow ahead of the potential invasion of the home islands, another was to demonstrate the weapon to the world (specifically keeping Russia in mind) and another reason given was just to see what the bombs were capable of. As far as many of the people immediately responsible for the decision to drop the bombs, including Truman, it was simply a new and useful tool and there was hardly a doubt about its being used if it were ready. So, these were some of the reasons given. In fact, many, if not most, of those involved in dropping the bombs thought it was only a long-shot chance that atomic weapons would shorten the war (though, those who knew of the secret Japanese peace-feeler communiques with Russia are somewhat suspect). The resistance encountered during the invasion of Okinawa led many to believe that Japanese resistance would persist until all had died in battle. So, I think describing the idea of forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally as being just one of the primary reasons to drop the bomb is correct. As far as the Potsdam Declaration goes, it was relatively well-known among higher circles of the U.S. government (especially those with knowledge of Japanese politics) that the unconditional surrender and what status the emperor would hold after the surrender would be the two primary sticking points in any peace negotiation. Truman decided not to accept anything less than unconditional surrender most likely due to what he felt were the expectations of the American people at the time. Because of these factors, I believe the decision to drop the bomb was not due to any one reason specifically, but was an amalgamation of different reasonings from different advisors coupled with the president's personal feelings on the matter.</dd>
<dd>I think it would be a great idea to expand on this in the context of what was going on internally in Japanese politics at the time. This could all be included in an article specifically detailing some of the more intricate parts of the negotations within the Japanese government that led to the decision to surrender. I think this might also shed greater light on the general circumstances that surrounded this period. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 05:42, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quote from Japan's longest day... Quoted same day of Soviet declaration of war but before actual soviet broadcast. "On August 8th, Togo advised the Emperor that Japan must accept the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation as soon as possible, whereupon the Emperor commanded his Foreign Minister to indicate to the Premier that, in view of the "new type" of weapon that had been used, Japan was now powerless to continue the war and must make every effort to terminate the war with the least possible delay. Japan must accept the inevitable. According to Marquis Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, His Majesty said that he considered his own personal safety secondary to the immediate termination of the war. The tragedy of Hiroshima, he insisted, must not be repeated." --71.11.155.156 13:14, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inaccurate information regarding Trinity</span></h2>
<p>Rnt20's edits of 5 May included this paragraph in which I found numerous pieces of information that were inaccurately portrayed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The destruction power of the atomic bomb was demonstrated to the world's press without taking any lives on July 16 1945, but the Japanese military took no notice. It was only when the US military bluffed the Japanese into thinking that Japanese cities could be destroyed at will that the surrender took place. In reality the US did not have any more atomic bombs at the time of the Japanese surrender (and it was over a year before material was available to build a new atomic bomb).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, the Trinity test was kept highly secret until after the detonation over Hiroshima. Locals in New Mexico who witnessed the test at the time were told that an ammunition dump had exploded. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/trinity/articles/part1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/trinity/articles/part1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Second, the implication here that the absolute and only reason for the Japanese surrender was a threat of all-out atomic attack is simply inaccurate. See some of the conversations above for more info. Third, the idea that the Trinity test was demonstrated before the world's press is interesting considering the only news correspondent who witnessed it was William L.

<p>There is also the problem that no press knew of the event in July 1945. It also implies no bombs would be available until 1946 when likely several would have been ready by the fall of 1945. I am not editing until I can find reputible sources for this information.</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's a pretty silly addition. The Trinity test was certainly kept secret. As for the postwar bomb supply.. Chuck Hansen has figures on this but I don't recall offhand. I believe they had enough plutonium cores to have another weapon by November 1945 and a couple up through 1946ish. "Over a year" is clearly false, though. That would mean they didn't have any weapons until after August 1946 which is clearly false since they tested two of them in July 1946 as part of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Crossroads_1783.html" title="Operation Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>!

I don't know offhand if that is accurate but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was, it feels about right.

<dl>
<dd>&#160; Truman knew that another bomb was not ready anyway. Marshall and Groves had delayed transport of critical bomb components from the United States to Tinian, making it impossible to ready a third bomb until about August 21. Groves and Marshall took this action because they believed two bombs would move the Japanese to capitulation, concurring with Stimson's policy that the bombs should be used only to end the war. Pacific commanders nevertheless transmitted recommendations on targets for the third weapon. General Farrell and Captain Parsons ... "expressly recommended" that the next bomb be dropped in the "region of Tokyo" to achieve maximum psychological effect. ... As for conventional weapons, Truman ordered that military operations continue "at present intensity," because of their "different nature and purpose."</dd>
<dd>... [Marshall] believed the two atomic bombs "have had a tremendous effect on the Japanese as far as capitulation is concerned," but Marshall doubted that further atomic bombing would influence any Japanese decision to end the war. Therefore, Marshall [wanted to reserve further bombs for tactical support of the invasion]. ... Seeman ... reported that at least seven bombs would be ready for use by October 31.</dd>
<dd>... At noon August 14, Truman ... remarked sadly that he now had no alternative but to order an atomic bomb dropped on Tokyo." It was only at 4:05 P.M. that Truman learned officially of Japan's decision to surrender.</dd>

<p>This is an interesting point. The Japanese may not have known how many bombs the Americans had in their arsenal, but one must not forget that the Japanese had other political pressure on their nation at the time. The Soviet Union had started their invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria just a month earlier. This definitely influenced their decision as well. This is speculation, but, it seems like the Japanese were caught in a vice. If they continued the war (I remember from a book by John Toland, Rising Sun, that stated that the Japanese were actually not daunted by the unlikely threat of more nuclear attacks. After all, they were now expecting it.) the Japanese would be attacked with either nuclear weapons, or, if not, by Soviet and American armies from all sides.</p>

<dd>I can confirm that the American bombers reported similar things. To my knowledge no color footage of the bombing was shot. There are a few color shots of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_test.html" title="Trinity test">Trinity test</a>, but it is hard to tell how the colors changed over time. The changing colors were likely from the ionization of different particles, or something along those lines. Most of the footage of nuclear tests later did not have such colors (in my opinion of them) except for the ones done in the upper atmosphere. However the ones done on the ground were not done over a city so I don't know how much that would have changed things; the other crucial difference may have been the bombs themselves -- by the time they were filming them in color their innards had changed fairly substantially. But this is just speculation on my part. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:31, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the weeks following the atomic attacks on Japan almost 60 years ago, and then for decades afterward, the United States engaged in airtight suppression of all film shot in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings. This included footage shot by U.S. military crews and Japanese newsreel teams. In addition, for many years all but a handful of newspaper photographs were seized or prohibited. The public did not see any of the newsreel footage for 25 years, and the U.S. military film remained hidden for nearly four decades. Six weeks ago, E&amp;P broke the story that articles written by famed Chicago Daily News war correspondent George Weller about the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki were finally published, in Japan, almost six decades after they had been spiked by U.S. officials. This drew national attention, but suppressing film footage shot in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was even more significant, as this country rushed into the nuclear age with its citizens having neither a true understanding of the effects of the bomb on human beings, nor why the atomic attacks drew condemnation around the world. The color U.S. military footage would remain hidden until the early 1980s, and has never been fully aired. It rests today at the National Archives in College Park, Md., in the form of 90,000 feet of raw footage labeled #342 USAF. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard%40lbrc.org_a87b.html" title="User:Richard@lbrc.org">Richard@lbrc.org</a> 13:52, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Supports before and after the bombings</span></h2>
<p>I think the article has a serious problem (forgive me if someone already pointed out) in that it does not distinguish motives behind dropping bombs before the bomings from historical interpretation of the effects. We probably want to organize the article into two broard sections: one for what was going before the event and one for the aftermath. (I am sure that that is the way every historian writes) For example, I don't know the truth (perhaps no one does), but one major argument in Japan I know is that in hindsight the bombings were unnecessary. (and some even go saying thus the US has to make apology and compensation in the same manner Germany did about holocaust). But this is <i>afterthought</i>, and we have to clearly distinguish this kind of rhetoric from opposing arguments made before the bomings. Those are completely two different kind of opposition. I will try to fix this problem if I have time and good sources, but I just thought I might pointed this out first. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 03:30, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strategic importance of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span></h2>
<p>The Hiroshima and Nagasaki sections start with dubious statements about the military importance of these cities. There were some homeland defense troops headquartered there, rationing was in effect just like in the rest of the world at that time, there were women, children and Korean conscripts there just like the rest of Japan, and there were factories there just like in any city. This does not add up to "great wartime importance". Anyone should see the obvious question: if they were so important, why were they left untouched during the many bombings of Japan in WWII? It's nice that someone left references in the Hiroshima case, but let's look at what they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>a photo of 5 Hiroshima students undergoing military training</li>
<li>reports by Sarah Skaer, Grade 8, and Ryan Sattler, Grade 7</li>
<li>a monument caption that says that Koreans died at Hiroshima</li>

Groves, June 29, 1946. You should fully expect this report to be heavily biased, and still, <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/abomb/mp05.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/abomb/mp05.htm" rel="nofollow">Chapter 5</a> says these criteria were used in target selection: (verbatim quote)
<ul>
<li><i>Since the atomic bomb was expected to produce its greatest amount of damage by primary blast effect, and next greatest by fires, the targets should contain a large percentage of closely-built frame buildings and other construction that would be most susceptible to damage by blast and fire.</i></li>
<li><i>The maximum blast effect of the bomb was calculated to extend over an area of approximately 1 mile in radius; therefore the selected targets should contain a densely built-up area of at least this size.</i></li>
<li><i>The selected targets should have a high military strategic value.</i></li>
<li><i>The first target should be relatively untouched by previous bombing, in order that the effect of a single atomic bomb could be determined.</i></li>

<dd>I actually agree on most of that. It should be rephrased at the very least, and most of those references are not worth a damn. It is enough to say that it did have some military significance and that it was (purposely) not subjected to firebombing (I'm fairly sure they chose not to firebomb a number of cities because they knew they would likely be using these weapons, but this can and should be sourced). We should as best as possible include the criteria used in selecting the cities <i>before</i> the bombing (not something Groves reported a year later), with references to better sources. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 05:32, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came across some interesting documents today on microfilm from the National Archives which go over the pros and cons of various targets from July 1945. One that I hadn't remembered seeing before, and isn't on this list, is that Hiroshima was a high priority in part because it had no POW camps, unlike the others (there was one a mile north of Nagasaki). Also, one of the reasons the cities weren't previously bombed is because Groves specifically ordered LeMay to "reserve" a number of cities as future targets, and would occasionally telegram him with things like "Add Kokura to your reserve list" and so forth (I found one of these telegrams as well). Of course, we can't reference these documents unless they are available to others to check with and are well cited (I don't think this would count as original research, as the source I got them from is very easily found for those with access to major libraries). I might upload a few of them to commons and we can link to them from here, perhaps. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:46, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was at Hiroshima earlier today and the peace memorial museum does have documents from the US National Archives about prohibiting certain cities from being bombed, so that the damage from the atomic bomb could be accurately measured. Also, I can confirm the statement that the US believed that there were no POW camps in Hiroshima, which is why it was one of the primary targets. Finally, the decision was made to drop the bomb as soon as weather permitted (visual being the most accurate targeting method at the time) and Hiroshima had clear skies on the morning of August 6th. A number of recon planes went to the targets ahead of the Enola Gay group and relayed the weather information. --Hao 2:48, 7 Aug 2005 (JST)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes and no. If the "radiation" in this case are heavy fission products, they can exist in a variety of vectors for some time (i.e. cesium which is absorbed by crops and plants). So they can last for a long time in certain ways (which is why a place like Chernobyl still has very high radiation levels 20 years after the accident). I don't know about Hiroshima's situation, though -- I don't think it is a problem, in part because it is an urban area. In any event, people have been living there for some time now since then. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 19:28, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There are two ways radioactivity is produced from an atomic blast. The first is due to fallout of the fission products or the nuclear material itself, ie, uranium or plutonium that contaminate the ground. (Similar ground contamination occurred as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident but on a much larger scale.) The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs exploded at 500 to 600 m of altitude, then formed huge fireballs that rose with ascending air currents. Subsequently, the material cooled down and started to fall with rain. Because of the wind, the rain did not fall directly on the hypocenter but rather in the northwest region (Koi, Takasu area) of Hiroshima and the eastern region (Nishiyama area) of Nagasaki.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another way radioactivity is produced is by neutron irradiation of soil or buildings. (Neutrons comprise 10% or less of A-bomb radiation; nonradioactive materials become radioactive after absorbing neutrons. In contrast, gamma rays--which comprise the majority of A-bomb radiation--do not cause ground materials to become radioactive.) However, most of the radioactivity decayed very quickly so that it now takes months to measure the radioactivity using highly sensitive equipment. Despite miniscule levels, these measurements are currently utilized to estimate neutron doses released from the bombs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In both cases, the residual radioactivity is far less than the dose received from background radiation; hence, there are no detectable effects on human health.</dd>

That begs some sort of explanation - not regarding the building's survival as that's covered already, but the fact people were able to visit a bank near Ground Zero and no drop dead from radiation (or maybe they did?). And while radiation after 60 years may be negligable, we know Hiroshima was being rebuilt very soon after the blast - certainly by 1949, and Hiroshima Mon Amour was made only about a decade later it and seemed the city was pretty much fully rebuilt. It's a topic you don't see addressed very often and I think it would be an interesting addition to the article; however I'm not familiar enough with the subject matter to make the addition myself. On a related note, I've never seen any real discussion of fallout. Were other areas of Japan affected by the fallout from H and N? Did any other countries report fallout? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:59, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Imbalanced arguments on justification</span></h2>
<p>A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) opinion article put it this way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Japanese army was expected to fight to the last man, as it had during the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Since the ratio of Japanese to American combat fatalities ran about four to one, a mainland invasion could have resulted in millions of Japanese deaths--and that's not counting civilians. The March 1945 Tokyo fire raid killed about 100,000; such raids would have intensified had the war dragged on. The collective toll from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings is estimated at between 110,000 and 200,000. <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not see this argument represented in the Wikipedia article. Specifically, the claim that</p>
<ol>
<li>dropping the two atomic bombs resulted in</li>
<li>substantially fewer Japanese military and civilian deaths</li>
</ol>
<p>compared to the alternative.</p>
<p>Please do not misunderstand. I am not suggesting that our article <b>agree</b> with the WSJ writer. Merely that the article should mention his POV. It's one I've heard frequently, especially from those who agree that the US was on the "right side" in the war. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:56, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Expected by pretty much everybody with experience fighting the Japanese, I should think. There hadn't been a case when they <i>hadn't</i> fought to (virtually) the last man, and often ending with a mass suicide. But the invasion of Kyushu was no longer the likely alternative to using the bomb:
<dl>
<dd>"Even with the full ration of caution that any historian should apply anytime he ventures comments on paths history did not take, in this instance it is now clear that the long-held belief that Operation Olympic loomed as a certainty is mistaken. Truman's reluctant endorsement of the Olympic invasion at a meeting in June 1945 was based in key part on the fact that the Joint Chiefs had presented it as their unanimous recommendation. ... But this evidence also shows that the demise of Olympic came not because it was deemed unnecessary, but because it had become unthinkable."<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/894mnyyl.asp?pg=2" class="external text" title="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/894mnyyl.asp?pg=2" rel="nofollow"><i>Why Truman Dropped the Bomb</i></a></dd>

<dd>To make the argument Ed's referring to, you need to make two points: That without the bombings, there would have had to be an invasion, and that the invasion, if it had occurred, would have cost many lives. I think "expected by pretty much everybody" is true as to the second point but not the first. There shouldn't be any passage in the article that assumes that the bombings averted an invasion. For example, Ed's phrase about the effect of the bombings "compared to the alternative" assumes that there was only one alternative. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 17:35, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"Stimson's crucial role in the use of the Atomic bombs against Japan began with Truman's accession. <b>The policies and actions that brought a Japanse surrender without an apocalypic battle in the homeland</b> are Stimson's legacy</i> - in short, the use of the Atomic bomb, which was urged by Stimson, prevented the invasion of Japan. (John Ray Skates, the Invasion of Japan, 236) The point is so obvious that the author does not even state it directly. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 01:59, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, to answer your 2nd question - because as I said above, not mentiong the impending invasion of Japan when talking about the use of the atomic bombs is a GLARING omission, almost as bad as the version of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> that didn't mention world war II in the introduction. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 02:01, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, no, this is what people are saying that the bombing prevented the invasion <i>after</i> World War II. I need an explicit statement as you claimed that states the bombing was going to be used to both (1) force the surrender and (2) avoid the invasion. Also for the second one, I don't think your analogy is right; as we had conflict, the links between the bombing, the surrender and the invasion are not necessarily clear. And I am saying that it would be sensitive for us to avoid the venture on this in intro.</p>
<p>I hate confrontation, but please pay attention to subtleties. The old intro says that the bombing was going to be used for the purpose of forcing the Japanese to surrender. In other words, it does not say it did force the surrender. I agree that, in retrospect, the surrender made the invasion unnecessary but there is a subtle but important difference between the stated reasons for the use of the bombing prior to the actual bombing and what happened afterward. And, in general, as it is a delicate issue why and how the Japanese surrendered, we should stay away from venturing in discussing this issue (Japan's surrender) on the intro of this article. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 02:07, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The intro is a good place to <b>mention the fact that</b> the bombings were controversial, because the bombings were one of the <b>most controversial</b> acts of the twentieth century. The two most often heard "evils" of the World War II era are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hitler's Nazi attempt to take over Europe and kill all its Jewish people</li>
<li>The American atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</li>
</ol>
<p>Almost everyone in the English speaking world condemns Hitler, but a <b>very strong</b> minority endorse his anti-Jewish actions: Holocaust deniers, anti-Semites. Most English speakers condemn the mass bombings of Japanese and German cities ('keep civilians out of it') as <b>unjustifiable for any reason</b>; the usual argument is that the end does not justify the means, mass killing is <b>absolutely bad</b>.</p>
<p>The upshot is that people simply refuse to consider, let alone permit mention of, any argument which disagrees with their absolutist condemnation. This hurts the article, because 50% or more of it is the <b>significance</b> of the bombings. Only about half of readers' concern is about the military planning, how the bombs were constructed and deployed, who pulled the launch trigger; or how many people were killed (then and later). The controversy is a major part of history.</p>
<p>Again, I am not saying that Wikipedia should endorse the victor's POV (or even <b>one</b> of the victorious sides POVs). But it should not <b>censor</b> a major POV by reducing it to a vague mention, which is hard to find without reading every word of the article. Views which many people disagree with should be <b>described fairly and accurately</b>. This is the essence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. Doing this enables those who disagree to know <b>why</b> the opposing side thinks the way they do, and to see precisely <b>where</b> they disagree with their opponents.</p>
<p>The point is not for Wikipedia to identify the 'correct' side, but to clarify what all the sides are. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 12:11, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Censorship?? No, no, the problem is, I think, to treat the bombings like abortion issue. There are of course controversies surrounding the use of the bombings. But we have to make very clear distinction between how the event takes place and how historians interpret the event. As I am saying repeatedly, the intro confuses the historical background of the bombing and historical interpretation. I am going to try to clarify this, though I am afraid my edits are simply not accepted here. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 00:18, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello all. The following was said in response to TAKU's editing (an admirable attempt to clarify the difference between past events and the historiographical trajectory from the time of the events to the present)&#160;: "In any event, you are way out of line with five reverts, claiming consensus when it is clearly you against five different editors. Knock it off. --Fastfission 02:31, 6 August 2005 (UTC)". My reaction: TAKU is the only Japanese editor, apparently, against "five different editors," who are not Japanese (I assume). My question: where are the JAPANESE resources, primary and secondary materials, data, etc. on the atomic bombings as events and as historiographical subject?? This Wiki entry for the atomic bombings seemingly draws one-hundred percent on Western/English-language sources (or English translations of Japanese sources, of which there are few). Does nobody see a problem with this? How can you have any sort of "consensus" on a subject such as the atomic bombings of JAPAN when all of your information comes from English sources and "five different [non-Japanese] editors"?? If none of you are voluble in Japanese, perhaps inviting some Japanese scholars, or even American scholars fluent in Japanese and researching this topic, to contribute would be a giant leap forward and toward this "consensus" you speak of. In short, the neglection of Japanese language resources (primary/secondary texts, people, etc.) by researchers, writers, scholars, etc. in writing the history of the atomic bombings of Japan is a perfidy in dire need of rectification. There are various factual inaccuracies in the present article alone. I'm looking forward to working with you all. Until then, cheers.</p>

<p>I was unaware that there was a dispute over the effect of the bombings.

<dl>
<dd>~ Sorry I didn't reply earlier. I haven't checked the article again and thought that revert too straightforward to give an explanation. Here are my reasons:
<ul>
<li>I do not think it was a significant turning point of World War II, like the entry of the US after Pearl Harbor. The allies were not about to lose the war up to the Hiroshima bombing. But then again this may be just my point of view, if you like, yet that's no reason to add yours.</li>
<li>"leading to sth" means "to have sth as a result". Japan's surrender followed the atomic bombings and the entry of the Soviets, but whether it were the bombings that led Japan to surrender or the entry of the Soviets or other reasons or both of them or whatever is definitly not unbiased — for example today Dominick Jenkins, a Greenpeace UK's disarmament campaigner and author of The Final Frontier: America, Science and Terror, wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1543754,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1543754,00.html" rel="nofollow">The bomb didn't win it</a>.</li>
<li>The following sentence about controversy concedes ... a controversty, but implies that it is controversial to use the bombing as "examples of American cruelty and ruthlessness as well as American practicality and humaneness." <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">NightBeAsT</a> 16:14, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<p>Raul, elsewhere you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>the Japanese surrendered because of the double-whammy of having the USSR declare war on them and the atomic bombs being dropped on them. This is not my personal opinion - this is pretty much the consensus of *everybody*.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So when we take this matter up next week, would you mind allowing the article intro to mention the bombings as <b>one</b> of the main causative factors leading to the Japanese surrender? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 16:44, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, Ed, I apologize if you were offended by my 'insane' remark - it wasn't meant as a personal attack, only to show my astonishment that a long time Wikipedian like yourself would write something like that which is (to me) so clearly non-neutral. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 05:10, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Not that we should <b>change</b> it. But it needs to be explained better. I was asked to make a tutorial (by Eloquence), but I never finished it and finally abandoned it. That was a big mistake. If I've learned anything from last week, it's that no man is an island. We have to pull together, with a clearly defined objective.

<dd>Because you have no idea what you are talking about. (A) Hiroshima was not a civilian town - it was the headquarters of the japanese second army, and a major center of munitions production. (B) The <i>"intentional bombing of civilian populations"</i> was ruled off limits by the League of Nations 1938 <i>Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing From the Air in Case of War</i> declaration, to which *neither* the US nor Japan were signatories. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 01:23, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>(A) This article is not about bombing Hiroshima alone but Hiroshima <b>and</b> Nagasaki. As for the apologetic claims that Nagasaki was a valid military target: do you know how many civilians versus non-civilians were killed in the bombing&#160;?</dd>

<dd>Seems to me this is about to escalate into something no-body wants. Ktoto, regarding your last sentence above, is it fair to say the holocaust was directed at non combatants but that many of the "civilians" who were killed by the nuclear bombs were combatants (because they were working in the munitions factories etc)? The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_War_9e23.html" title="Prisoner of War">Prisoner of War</a> article says <i>In the Pacific Theater, some of the harshest treatment of POWs were dealt by the Japanese. Prisoners held by Japanese armed forces were subject to brutal treatment, including forced labour, starvation rations, beatings for escape attempts, and were denied medical treatment.</i>. That article does not have a War Crimes category. Should it? I don't defend the nuclear bombing, but think we might be losing sight of the forest because of the trees.<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 02:24, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ktoto - you cannot make an edit, and then claim that others must have consensus to remove it. You seem to have things backwards. Furthermore, your claim that nagasaki was not a military target is demonstrably false - it had several munitions factories, and one of the largest shipyards in Japan. Furthermore, your claim that the US and Japan were bound by a league of nations resolution they were not parties to does not hold water - in general, nations that are not signatories to a particular resolution or treaty are not bound by it under international law; just because you say they should does not make it so. And lastly, claiming that because it was on the list of war crimes (which, as Christopherparham says above, already contains a lot of questoinable entries) may not be used to justify making a bad editing decision on this article. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 02:40, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Raul, you have now made three reverts, and therefore should not make anymore. Here is my position: if this is to be removed from the category, it must also be removed from <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes_list.html" title="War crimes list">war crimes list</a>, and the fire-bombing of Dresden should also be removed, and perhaps other articles must be involved as well. Consistency is my goal here. To make this change requires a consensus across many articles. Until such a consensus is reached, this article should stay in the category. Raul, please address these points before making another revert. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 02:49, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's probably a very NPOV demarkation for war crimes. Something should only be called a war crime if some international body is investigating it as a war crime. Still, I think there should be some classification for things which are not technically called war crimes, were not a violation of existing international laws, but are still considered by some to be war crimes. Raul considers such a category bad because it would open a floodgate for people to include too many alleged war crimes. But I imagine that someone who came to the war crimes article should be pointed at a selection of events which, while not techically war crimes, might still be considered such for some people. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 05:12, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no doubt that Japanese committed war crimes during WW2. But why is it important to pretend that the US did not&#160;? Clearly there were hospitals and other objects protected under international law in the both bombed cities. It's hard to believe that people who decided to nuke the towns were unaware that those will get destroyed too. And please, don't ask me to provide evidence that there were hospitals in Nagasaki. As I tried to explain above, the world has not seen such atrocities before the WW2. Obviously there were no specific treaties or laws to prevent the Holocaust or nuclear bombing which does not make them any lesser war crimes. <a href="../../../k/t/o/User%7EKtoto_a440.html" title="User:Ktoto">Ktoto</a> 02:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In WWII, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a> of cities was something that everybody did. There's nothing in that which distinguishes these two instances. Well before August 1945, they had accepted that in order to destroy a target they also had to destroy everything around it. Even the air forces that tried precision bombing eventually had to either give up bombing or give up precision; the technology of the day just wasn't up to it.</dd>

<dd>On Wikipedia, the term 'POV' denotes bias; e.g., that if you can read an article and know what the author's personal beliefs are, then the article is not a good one (wikipedia articles are supposed to be from a neutral point of view) There is <b>no consensus</b> among experts as to whether or not this was a war crime - it is in fact, a hotly debated topic. Some maintain it was a war crime, while others maintain it was not. Tagging the article in the war crimes category inherently takes sides in that dispute, and that's a violation of our neutrality policy. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 03:03, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One can bring about all the arguments that justify our use of the bombs: saving soldiers' lives, saving Japanese civilians from fire-bombing, and hey, they started it first. This deosn't change the likelihood that justifications for this kind of thing, valid or not, have a lot more strength when you've had the good sense to win the war in question.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misconceptions on term unconditional surrender and a "conditional" surrender</span></h2>
<p>I would like to take the time to point out some of my thoughts on the misconceptions on the use of the term unconditional surrender. The Potsdam Proclmation clearly calls for the "unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces" which was changed from the Cairo Declarations for the call of the unconditional surrender of Japan. Here's an exerpt from Kazutoshi Hando, The Pacific War Research Society, Japan's Longest Day (Tokyo: Kodansha International, Ltd., 1968).</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first man in the government to react positively to the San Francisco broadcast was the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shunichi Matsumoto. He advised Togo that Japan must accept the terms as stated, that to reject them would be the height of folly, and he had, in fact, already begun to compose a draft of the Japanese acceptance, to be sent to Japan's ministers in Switzerland and Sweden and from there to be conveyed to the enemy, when Togo came into the room where he was working.</dd>
<dd>"Wait," said the Foreign Minister, "it's not going to be as easy as that." His voice sounded immeasurably sad, as though he was speaking from some lonely height where he felt far from certain of being heard. "The Army will never accept the Proclamation as it stands."</dd>
<dd>But, Togo felt, the fact that the Allies had softened their first demand in the Cairo Declaration for "the unconditional surrender of Japan" to "the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces" suggested that more favorable terms, or at least a more favorable expression of the same terms, might be forthcoming, which the Army could accept and still save face. He conduded, therefore, that before replying, Japan ought to make one final effort to use Soviet "good offices.</dd>
<dd>[snip, further down the book]</dd>
<dd>At ten-thirty on the morning of July 27th the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War met to discuss the Potsdam Proclamation and the possibility of Soviet mediation. This Supreme War Council--or "inner Cabinet"--consisted of Japan's Big Six: the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of War, the Minister of the Navy, and the chiefs of the General Staffs of both the Army and the Navy. At the meeting Togo emphasized the importance of the shift from the unconditional surrender of Japan to the unconditional surrender of the armed forces and declared that he felt it would be "extremely impolitic" to reject the Proclamation. He was able, against considerable opposition, to persuade the Supreme Council to withhold the Japanese reply until after they had heard again from Moscow.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what I'm trying to say is that the allies didn't call for the unconditional surrender of Japan. The allies weakened their stance and merely asked for the army to lay down their weapons and give up. Eventually, the Japanese would surrender under these terms, I would ask people what would have been better terms(leave the army intact or with a conditional surrender??). I believe that the call for the unconditional surrender of the armed forces is one of the weakest forms of using the term unconditional surrender(well it would be weaker if you left off unconditional, but what would that condition be???)</p>
<p>I would like to also note Japan's response to mokusatsu the new terms which can be interpreted that they had no intention to surrender(atleast from an outsider's position). And I would like to note that Japan surrendered on the terms dictated in the Potsdam Proclamation, no change to the sentence containing the term unconditional surrender was ever merited. Moreover, I would like to talk about the fixation on a conditional surrender, there was no change in the terms of surrender. I just think the talk about the surrender with the fixation on "unconditional surrender" does not completely illustrate the situation right before the bombs were dropped(but does show the earlier stance). I would hope this web page would work to clear up some misconceptions: the "condition" of surrender, and the debate of the term "unconditional surrender"... If there is a statement about the call for unconditional surrender(and there is), I would hope that the webpage would atleast recognize that the terms changed with the Potsdam Proclamation(they weakened). If people want to find faults with the Potsdam Declaration, I would suggest looking at the war criminials clause. The Doves did not want to see the emperor harmed. A snip from America's response to Japan surrendering with a "condition".</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pacifism</span></h2>
<p>Regarding this "the postwar constitution is the reason for the pacifism, not the bomb". Of course, the postwar constitution adopted pacifism, but no doubt the experience of the bombing contributed to pacifism. For example, take from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/international/07hiroshima.html?" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/international/07hiroshima.html?" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> "Still, on the 60th anniversary of the world's first atomic bomb attack, some members of the aging and dwindling population of survivors expressed worries that Japan was shedding its postwar pacifism. The survivors, whose suffering had long made them Japan's most eloquent advocates for pacifism, said recent policy changes inside Japan had made them deeply pessimistic." You do agree that the intro should, if briefly, mention about pacifism and Japan's postwar nuclear policy. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 23:42, August 9, 2005 (UTC)<br />

<dd>I liked the wording better before you changed it. Your source does not even seem to call the bomb the root of Japan's pacifism. I would say that their defeat and the constitution has lead to Japan's pacifism(even more articles than article 9 or whatever contributes to Japan's pacifism). I don't care much for polls either. I would just lessen the wording of root cause and use a more vague terminology such as contributed significantly. Furthermore, the statement is an opinion and not a fact, so it seems a little too "definitive". --71.11.155.156 08:09, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An article by him at <a href="http://www.ncesa.org/html/hiroshima.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ncesa.org/html/hiroshima.html" rel="nofollow">NCSEA</a> makes some strong claims such as</p>

<dd><i>"Careful scholarly treatment of the records and manuscripts opened over the past few years has greatly enhanced our understanding of why the Truman administration used atomic weapons against Japan. Experts continue to disagree on some issues, but critical questions have been answered. The consensus among scholars is that the bomb was not needed to avoid an invasion of Japan and to end the war within a relatively short time. It is clear that alternatives to the bomb existed and that Truman and his advisers knew it."</i> (attributed to J. Samuel Walker)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this is the case then surely the Wikipedia article can be severely simplified. The claims are sufficiently bold, the language differing too much from expected style for me not to inquire on the veracity of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, his article claims that</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Similarly, a top-secret April 1946 War Department study, Use of Atomic Bomb on Japan, declassified during the 1970's but brought to broad public attention only in 1989, found that "the Japanese leaders had decided to surrender and were merely looking for sufficient pretext to convince the die-hard Army Group that Japan had lost the war and must capitulate to the Allies."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>conflicts with the Wikipedia article that states</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Japan, as a Constitutional Monarchy, could only enter into a peace agreement with the unanimous support of the Japanese cabinet, and this cabinet was dominated by militarists from the Japanese Imperial Army and the Japanese Imperial Navy, all of whom were initially opposed to any peace deal.</i></dd>

<p>Some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How accepted are the views of this historian?</li>
<li>How can the conflicting statements be amended?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll answer the moreover part...</dd>
<dd>I don't see the huge conflicting statements. Well the SWC/big-6 were dominated by militarists but the cabinet was not(well according to Butow, I have yet to read everything about the cabinet)[big-6 were split 3-3, always]. Notice the Japanese leaders trying to convince the Army group, that implies that the army group holds the power... The army and navy/other hawks were opposed to the surrender(and even the "condition") right up until the time the emperor spoke his will. The statement "all of whom were initially opposed to any peace deal" may be your problem, I believe that wording is referring to the "militarists" or "die-hard Army Group"... On second reading, the term peace deal is vague... The militarist would have probably agreed with some sort of cease-fire agreement, maybe... I would change that to "opposed to any form of surrendering", or something similiar... unless you interpret initially at an earlier date then I do... --71.11.155.156 18:04, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia-article states that militarists dominated the cabinet, but it is not clear if domination was from within the cabinet or as pressure from the outside. Particularly the part about <i>unanimous</i> implies domination from within, or at least those having a right to vote on the issue. I am actually more confused now than when I first asked the question. -- 85.164.76.75 10:09, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't know every point of view of the entire cabinet, so I can't say dominated in terms of numbers, but power, yes... The military fanatics were in the cabinet, and 3 of them were of the big-6/SWC. The cabinet did need a unanimous vote on the decision [to surrender] though. But I do believe the fanatical military leaders were the leaders with real power, they could veto any action that they did not like. Only the emperor's will made them change their point of view[well actually only vote for surrender with a "condition", a coup eventually happened]. I don't think they dominated in numbers, but they did always disagree on the terms, so nothing was done.

<p>MacArthur believed the dropping of the bombs to be "completely unnecessary from a military point of view.

<p>Um, were is this pg.775? The link only goes to page 32... and I can't find this quote anywere...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since I last looked at this article, some of the references have been changed from accurate embedded links to inaccurate footnotes. The first footnote after MacArthur is mentioned is to the <a href="http://www.learner.org/biographyofamerica/prog23/feature/" class="external text" title="http://www.learner.org/biographyofamerica/prog23/feature/" rel="nofollow">Learner.org</a> site, but I don't see anything there about MacArthur's attitude toward the bomb. The current statement in text is: "The highest-ranking officer in the Pacific Theater, General Douglas MacArthur, was not consulted beforehand, but said afterward that there was no military justification for the bombings." That statement is in fact supported by the previous footnote, the link to <a href="http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm" rel="nofollow">Doug Long's website</a>. The exact quotation given at the start of this thread ("completely unnecessary") isn't on those pages (that I noticed), but the substantive point that the bombings were unnecessary is what's in the verbatim MacArthur quotations. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:25, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"no military justification". As opposed to his own plans for invasion, of course: "In my opinion, there should not be the slightest thought of changing the OLYMPIC operation."</dd>
<dd>MacArthur's initial reaction was rather more self-centered: 'Theodore White ... interviewing General MacArthur in Manila, ... listened to the general, ... blame the Bomb as likely to end the days of heroic warfare. "Scholars and scientists" had stolen future wars from military professionals and made "men like me" obselete. There would be "no more wars" of the kind he knew, MacArthur mourned.'</dd>

<dd>Just a few years later, MacArthur was an advocate for dropping the bomb on North Korea/China to win the Korean War. I think he just wanted to take whatever action would get him the most fame and power. Also, "unnecessary" is a relative term. It is true that we could have eventually won the war without the bomb (with a massive land invasion costing hundreds of thousands of Allied lives and millions of Japanese lives), so in this sense it was "unnecessary". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 01:34, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I do agree with your observation on MacArthur. His view though was shared by other people like <a href="../../../e/i/s/Eisenhower.html" title="Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> who didn't have similar interests. The comment below quote a couple of American leaders of the time who objected to the bombing. I wonder whether wikipedians would object to including the quoted books on reference section. I will do so in future if the post doesn't trigger objections. <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=159590&amp;cid=13365575" class="external autonumber" title="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=159590&amp;cid=13365575" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../w/k/_/User%7EWk_muriithi_6a20.html" title="User:Wk muriithi">gathima</a> 04:02, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But the only American leader who objected to the bombing <i>at</i> the time is Eisenhower...maybe. To the best of my knowledge, the only contemporaneous record of Eisenhower's opinion was in 'a letter of July 12, 1945, to an old friend, Eisenhower confessed he had not the "slightest idea of what is going to happen in the Pacific." Eisenhower does not seem to have received Pacific-theater Ultra or Magic during this period.'--<i>Downfall</i>, p. 332.</dd>
<dd><i>After</i> the war, I see Navy guys arguing that if the Navy strategy of blockade &amp; bombardment had been followed, and Air Force guys arguing that if the air force strategy of conventional bombardment had been followed, or some people arguing that sitting back and letting the Russians invade, they would have won the war sooner or later. And they're all right. But a war which dragged on for months would have killed far more Chinese, and Japanese, and others, than the war which ended in mid-August--even without MacArthur's invasion.</dd>
