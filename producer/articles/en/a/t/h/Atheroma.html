<p>In <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathology.html" title="Pathology">pathology</a>, an <b>atheroma</b> (plural: atheromata) is an unhealthy (though typical for most humans) accumulation and swelling (-oma) with cells, or cell debris, which contain <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipids.html" title="Lipids">lipids</a> (cholesterol and fatty acids), calcium mineral and a variable amount of fibrous <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connective_tissue.html" title="Connective tissue">connective tissue</a> within the walls of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">arteries</a>. In the context of heart or artery matters, atheromata are commonly referred to as atheromatous <b>plaques</b>.</p>
<p>These anatomic lesions usually begin in later childhood, well before age 10, and progress over time. <a href="../../../v/e/i/Vein.html" title="Vein">Veins</a> do not develop atheromata, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in <a href="../../../b/y/p/Bypass_%28surgical%29.html" title="Bypass (surgical)">bypass</a> surgery. The accumulation (swelling) is always between the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endothelium.html" title="Endothelium">endothelium</a> lining and the smooth muscle wall central region (media) of the arterial tube. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatty_streaks.html" title="Fatty streaks">fatty streaks</a> by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells, i.e. <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adipose_cell.html" title="Adipose cell">adipose cells</a>, but of accumulations of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_blood_cells.html" title="White blood cells">white blood cells</a>, especially <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrophages.html" title="Macrophages">macrophages</a> that have taken up oxidixed low-density lipoprotein (LDL). After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the center to inner surface of each atherosclerotic plaque. Conversely, the outer, older portions of the plaque become more calcific, less metabolically active and more physically stiff over time.</p>
<p>Collectively, the process of atheroma development within an individual is called <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atherogenesis.html" title="Atherogenesis">atherogenesis</a> and the overall result of the disease process is termed <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atherosclerosis.html" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheroma.html" title="Edit section: Stages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stages</span></h2>
<p>In humans, atheroma usually begin in later childhood, about ages 5-9, as <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatty_streaks.html" title="Fatty streaks">fatty streaks</a>. These, and older, larger atheroma lesions have long been observed in autopsy examinations of people who have died for unrelated reasons; they are so common, more so with increasing age, they were long considered normal, even though clearly unhealthy.</p>
<p>More advanced atheroma develop multiple different internal <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_tissue.html" title="Biological tissue">tissue</a> characteristics within the same atheroma. By light <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microscopy.html" title="Microscopy">microscopy</a> visualization, pathologists have characterized as many as 10 different tissue subtypes within a single advanced atheroma. Generally, these range from collections of macrophage cells, always the initiating cells in the newest sections of atheroma, to more complex structures including living cells, cellular debris of cells which have died and extracelluar deposits of fibrous tissue &amp; calcified crystals, within the oldest, outermost portions of atheroma structures.</p>
<p>Atheroma typically progress silently for decades and remain undetected by most clinical diagnostic approaches, including <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_test.html" title="Cardiac stress test">cardiac stress testing</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">angiography</a>. Eventually, their presence is revealed by disastrous clinical events and permanent disability, such as <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrovascular_accident.html" title="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</a>, with the majority of people assuming they were healthy until finally proven otherwise by events. For some individuals, warning symptoms do occur before the onset of major debility or death, however these are the minority.</p>
<p>Historically, physicians, who are primarily trained to treat symptoms and avoid treatment before onset of clear enough symptoms and physical abnormalities, have just considered the process a normal part of ageing, even though unhealthy.</p>

<p>For most people the first clinical symptoms result from atheroma progression within the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_arteries.html" title="Coronary arteries">heart arteries</a>, most commonly resulting in a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5 mm down to invisible), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have been a difficult target organ to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally all mass applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_testing.html" title="Cardiac stress testing">cardiac stress testing</a>, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheroma.html" title="Edit section: Evolving Concepts and Understanding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evolving Concepts and Understanding</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_288a.html" title="First World">First World</a> countries, with improved <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_health.html" title="Public health">public health</a>, infection control and increasing life spans, atheroma processes have become an increasingly important problem and burden for society. Atheroma continue to be the number one underlying basis for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disability.html" title="Disability">disability</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>, despite a trend for gradual improvement since the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> (adjusted for patient age). Thus, increasing efforts towards better understanding, treating and preventing the problem are continuing to evolve.</p>
<p>In the mid-twentieth century, it was assumed (incorrectly) that atheromata simply expanded into the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Lumen (anatomy)">lumen</a> and produced <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenoses</a> as they grew, since the disease always developed between the inner <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endothelium.html" title="Endothelium">endothelial</a> lining and the muscular wall. This belief was based on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">angiographic</a> views of the blood column within <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">arteries</a> and a belief that the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smooth_muscle.html" title="Smooth muscle">smooth muscle</a> wall of an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">artery</a> (the thickest and strongest portion of the artery wall in a healthy artery) would not change in size and structure over time. This belief continued despite increasing contradicting evidence that this was an overly simplistic theory and did not explain many empirical observations. Most artists' illustrations of atheromata and the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atherosclerosis.html" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> process in 2004 still portray this concept, even though quite incorrect. By the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, careful <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathology.html" title="Pathology">pathology</a> work and research using <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intravascular_ultrasound.html" title="Intravascular ultrasound">intravascular ultrasound</a> (IVUS) showed clearly that this <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">angiographic</a> assumption was incorrect.</p>
<p>Since the early to mid 1990s, better research has led to a somewhat wider recognition that one of two changes typically occur in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">artery</a> wall structure as an atheroma develops and progresses: (a) wall thickening and external enlargement with associated <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> (blood flow opening) preservation until late in the process; or (b) wall thickening with both external and <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> enlargement. These processes both have survival value, as they reduce and hide some of the effects of the atheroma process and help prevent symptoms, for a time. However they also prevent detection of the disease process by most conventional diagnostic tests, (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_test.html" title="Cardiac stress test">cardiac stress tests</a> and angiography), until advanced stages.</p>
<p>According to United States data, 2004, for about 65% of men and 47% of women, the first <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptom.html" title="Symptom">symptom</a> of cardiovascular disease is <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> or sudden death (death within one hour of symptom onset.)</p>
<p>Most artery flow disrupting events occur at locations with less than 50% <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> narrowing. From clinical studies published in the late 1990s to <a href="../../../i/v/u/IVUS_29a6.html" title="IVUS">IVUS</a> (in-the-artery-ultrasound) to visualize disease status, the typical heart attack occurs at locations with about 20% stenosis (narrowing), prior to sudden lumen closure and resulting <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_test.html" title="Cardiac stress test">Cardiac stress testing</a>, traditionally the most commonly performed non-invasive testing method for blood flow limitations generally only detects <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> narrowing of ~75% or greater, although some physicians advocate that nuclear stress methods can sometimes detect as little as 50%.</p>

<p>Over time, atheroma usually progress in size and thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (the media) of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">artery</a> to stretch out, termed remodeling, typically just enough to compensate for their size such that the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber.html" title="Caliber">caliber</a> of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artery.html" title="Artery">artery</a> remains unchanged until typically over 40-50% of the artery wall cross sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue (see: Glagov, below).</p>
<p>If the muscular wall enlargement eventually fails to keep up with the enlargement of the atheroma volume, then the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> of the artery begins to narrow, commonly as a result of repeated ruptures of the covering tissues separating the atheroma from the blood stream. This becomes a more common event after decades of living, increasingly more common after people are over 40 years old.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endothelium.html" title="Endothelium">endothelium</a> (the cell monolayer on the inside of the vessel) and covering tissue, termed <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibrous_cap.html" title="Fibrous cap">fibrous cap</a>, separate atheroma from the blood in the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a>. If a rupture occurs of the endothelium and fibrous cap, then a platelet and clotting response over the rupture rapidly develops. Additionally, the rupture may result in a shower of debris. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platelet.html" title="Platelet">Platelet</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clot.html" title="Clot">clot</a> accumulation over the rupture may produce narrowing/closure of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> and tissue damage may occur due to either closure of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> and loss of blood flow beyond the ruptured atheroma and/or by occlusion of smaller downstream vessels by debris. See <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulnerable_plaque.html" title="Vulnerable plaque">vulnerable plaque</a>.</p>
<p>This is the principal mechanism of <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> or other related <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiovascular_disease.html" title="Cardiovascular disease">cardiovascular disease</a> problems. As research has shown, this process is not a result of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenosis</a>. Prior to the rupture, there may have been no <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumen.html" title="Lumen">lumen</a> narrowing, even aneurysmal enlargement, at the atheroma. On average, by clinical research using <a href="../../../i/v/u/IVUS_29a6.html" title="IVUS">IVUS</a>, there is a minor <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenosis</a>, about 20%, present over those unstable atheroma which rupture and result in major disability or death. Comparatively, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenoses</a> of about 75% are required to produce detectable abnormalities during <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_test.html" title="Cardiac stress test">cardiac stress tests</a>.</p>

<p>If the muscular wall enlargement is overdone over time, then a gross <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneurysm.html" title="Aneurysm">enlargement</a> of the artery results, usually over decades of living. This is a less common outcome. Atheroma within aneurysmal enlargement (vessel bulging) can also rupture and shower debris of atheroma and clot downstream. If the arterial <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneurysm.html" title="Aneurysm">enlargement</a> continues to 2 to 3 times the usual diameter, the walls often become weak enough that with just the stress of the pulse, a loss of wall integrity may occur leading to sudden <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemorrhage.html" title="Hemorrhage">hemorrhage</a> (bleeding), major symptoms and debility; often rapid death. The main stimulus for aneurysm formation is pressure atrophy of the structural support of the muscle layers. The main structural proteins are <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collagen.html" title="Collagen">collagen</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elastin.html" title="Elastin">elastin</a>. This causes thinning and the wall balloons allowing gross enlargement to occur, as is common in the abdominal region of the aorta.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheroma.html" title="Edit section: Evolution of Strategies and Changing Focus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evolution of Strategies and Changing Focus</span></h2>
<p>The sudden nature of the complications of pre-existing atheroma, <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulnerable_plaque.html" title="Vulnerable plaque">vulnerable plaque</a>, have led, since the 1950s, to the development of intensive care units and complex medical and surgical interventions. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">Angiography</a> and later <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_stress_testing.html" title="Cardiac stress testing">cardiac stress testing</a> was begun to either visualize or indirectly detect <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenosis</a>. Next came <a href="../../../b/y/p/Bypass_%28surgical%29.html" title="Bypass (surgical)">bypass</a> surgery, to plumb transplanted <a href="../../../v/e/i/Vein.html" title="Vein">veins</a>, sometimes <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arteries.html" title="Arteries">arteries</a>, around the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenoses</a> and more recently <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angioplasty.html" title="Angioplasty">angioplasty</a>, now including <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stent.html" title="Stent">stents</a>, most recently drug coated <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stent.html" title="Stent">stents</a>, to stretch the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenoses</a> more open.</p>
<p>Yet despite these medical advances, with success in reducing the symptoms of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angina.html" title="Angina">angina</a> and reduced <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_flow.html" title="Blood flow">blood flow</a>, atheroma rupture events remain the major problem and still sometimes result in sudden disability and death despite even the most rapid, massive and skilled medical and surgical intervention available anywhere today. According to some clinical trials, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery.html" title="Coronary artery bypass surgery">bypass surgery</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angioplasty.html" title="Angioplasty">angioplasty</a> procedures have had at best a minimal effect, if any, on improving overall survival. Typically mortality of by-pass operations is from 1-4%, of angioplasty about 1-1.5%.</p>
<p>Additionally, these vascular interventions are often done only after an individual is symptomatic, often already partially disabled, as a result of the disease. It is also clear that both angioplasty and by-pass interventions do not prevent future <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>.</p>
<p>The older methods for understanding atheroma, dating to before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, relied on autopsy data. Autopsy data has long shown initiation of <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatty_streaks.html" title="Fatty streaks">fatty streaks</a> in later childhood with slow asymptomatic progression over decades.</p>
<p>One way to see atheroma is the very invasive and costly <a href="../../../i/v/u/IVUS_29a6.html" title="IVUS">IVUS</a> ultrasound technology; it gives us the precise volume of the inside <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intima.html" title="Intima">intima</a> plus the central <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a> layers of about 2.5 cm of artery length. Infortunately, it gives no information about the structural strength of the artery. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">Angiography</a> does not visualize atheroma; it only makes the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_flow.html" title="Blood flow">blood flow</a> within <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_vessels.html" title="Blood vessels">blood vessels</a> visible. Alternative methods that are non or less physically invasive and less expensive per individual test have been used and are continuing to be developed, such as those using <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computed_tomography.html" title="Computed tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT; lead by the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron_Beam_Tomography_9d53.html" title="Electron Beam Tomography">Electron Beam Tomography</a> form, given its greater speed) and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_resonance_imaging.html" title="Magnetic resonance imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a>). The most promising since the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> has been EBT, detecting calcification within the atheroma before most individuals start having clinically recognized symptoms and debility. Interestinly, statin therapy (to lower cholesterol) does not slow the speed of calcification as determined by CT scan. Most visualization techniques are used in research, they are not widely available to most patients, have significant technical limitations, have not been widely accepted and generally are not covered by medical insurance carriers.</p>
<p>From human clinical trials, it has become increasingly evident that a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. However, this effort has been slow, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homocysteine.html" title="Homocysteine">homocysteine</a> and that reduce neck <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carotid.html" title="Carotid">carotid</a> artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.</p>
<p>Additionally, understanding what drives atheroma development is complex with multiple factors involved, only some of which, such as <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipoprotein.html" title="Lipoprotein">lipoproteins</a>, more importantly lipoprotein subclass analysis, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sugar.html" title="Blood sugar">blood sugar</a> levels and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> are best known and researched. More recently, some of the complex <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a> patterns that promote, or inhibit, the inherent <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflamation.html" title="Inflamation">inflammatory</a> macrophage triggering processes involved in atheroma progression are slowly being better elucidated in animal models of atherosclerosis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheroma.html" title="Edit section: Detection and Diagnosis Options">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Detection and Diagnosis Options</span></h2>
<p>Arterial wall fixation, staining and thin section: historically this has been the gold standard for detection and description of atheroma, though only done after at autopsy. With special stains and examination, micro calcifications can be detected, typically with smooth muscle cells of the arterial media near the fatty streaks within a year or two of fatty streaks forming.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/v/u/IVUS_29a6.html" title="IVUS">IVUS</a> is the current most sensitive method detecting and measuring more advanced atheroma within living individuals, though it is typically not used until decades after atheroma begin forming due to cost and body invasiveness.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/t/_/CT_Scan_e2c0.html" title="CT Scan">CT Scans</a> using state of the art higher resolution spiral, or the higher speed <a href="../../../e/b/t/EBT_a13e.html" title="EBT">EBT</a>, machines have been the most effective method for detecting calcification present in plaque. However, the atheroma have to be advanced enough to have relatively large areas of calcification within them to create large enough regions of ~130 <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hounsfield_scale.html" title="Hounsfield scale">Hounsfield units</a> which the CT scanner software can recognize as distinct from the other surrounding tissues. Typically, such regions start occurring within the heart arteries about 2-3 decades after atheroma start developing.</p>
<p>Arterial ultrasound, especially of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carotid.html" title="Carotid">carotid</a> arteries, with measurement of the thickness of the artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has used by some researchers since the mid 1990's to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenosis.html" title="Stenosis">stenosis</a>, a result of very advanced disease. More progression clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiography.html" title="Angiography">Angiography</a>, since the 1960's, has been the traditional way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advance atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity can be seen in most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrast_agent.html" title="Contrast agent">contrast agent</a> during angiograms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheroma.html" title="Edit section: Treatment Options">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Treatment Options</span></h2>
<p>Many approaches, including food choices, staying slender (especially in the abdominal area), aerobic exercise and many different supplements have been promoted as methods to reduce atheroma progression. For most people, changing their internal physiologic behaviors, mostly hidden within, from the usual ones which promote atheroma progression (i.e. high risk, meaning high event rates for symptomatic cardiovascular disease) to reduced risk, requires a combination of strategies, including taking several compounds, on a daily basis and indefinitely. More and more human treatment trials have been done and are ongoing which demonstrate improved outcome for those people using more complex and effective treatment regimens which change physiologic behavior patterns to more closely resemble those which humans more commonly exhibit in childhood at a time before <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatty_streaks.html" title="Fatty streaks">fatty streaks</a> begin forming. Calculated <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_density_lipoprotein.html" title="Low density lipoprotein">LDLipoprotein</a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholesterol.html" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a> levels at this time of life are usually in the 20 to 40 mg/dL range, far below what are usually considered "normal" adult concentrations.</p>
<p>The group of medications referred to as statins, originally discovered in 1972 by a Japanese researcher as a compound produced by certain strains of fungi, e.g. Aspergillus terreus, Monascus ruber and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monascus_purpureus.html" title="Monascus purpureus">Monascus purpureus</a>, have been the most successful single approach, with the lowest rates of undesirable side-effects, to reducing atherosclerotic disease events. However, current research evidence continues to support using a combination of several approaches, including: (a) food choices (such as consuming omega-3 containing fats), (b) abdominal fat reduction, (c) low normal blood glucose levels (<a href="../../../g/l/y/Glycosylated_hemoglobin.html" title="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</a>, also called <a href="../../../h/b/a/HbA1c_f0db.html" title="HbA1c">HbA1c</a>, values &lt; 5.0), (d) aerobic exercise and (e) micronutrient (multivitamin and magnesium) supplements to improve the odds of maintaining better health with absence of either symptoms or worse, catastrophic disease events.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statin.html" title="Statin">statin</a> approved in the United States but not in some other countries, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosuvastatin.html" title="Rosuvastatin">rosuvastatin</a>, showed regression of atherosclerotic plaque (in fact, a decrease in intima + media volume) in the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_arteries.html" title="Coronary arteries">coronary arteries</a> by <a href="../../../i/v/u/IVUS_29a6.html" title="IVUS">IVUS</a> evaluation<sup id="_ref-JAMA_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JAMA" title="">[1]</a></sup> in the observational <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/jama;295/13/1556.pdf?ijkey=Md42dlk7z9TzyL8&amp;keytype=finite" class="external text" title="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/jama;295/13/1556.pdf?ijkey=Md42dlk7z9TzyL8&amp;keytype=finite" rel="nofollow">ASTEROID</a> study. Page 8, shows an artery before and after about 2 years of 40 mg/day treatment; the relevant wall volume is reduced to about half by a decrease in the volume of atheroma -yet the area for blood flow (lumen) is slightly reduced. Rosuvastatin, marketed as <i>Crestor</i>, has not been tested for clinical benefit and Health Canada issued a "Dear doctor" warning about the dose used in this study that had no placebo group.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that no cholesterol-lowering strategy, including statin drugs, has shown to improve mortality in women, while the one study targeting over 70 year olds found no mortality benefit in either gender from statin treatment (the PROSPER) study; references in <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/173/10/1207-a" class="external text" title="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/173/10/1207-a" rel="nofollow">|2005 <i>CMAJ</i></a>.</p>
