<p>Running events held at a purpose-built athletics track.</p>
<p>Running tracks are composed of two straights connected by two semicircular turns. The iasdfnnermost part of the sdftrack has a circumference of 400 metres. sdf A number of concentric lanes are marked on the track (usually eight, but occasionally more or fewer). It is coated with a rubberised surface that allows sdfrunners equipped with appropriate footwear (usuallysdf fitted with metal spikes that dig into the rubber) to get good grip, and cushions the impact on joints.</p>
<p>There are many track running events, differing slightly for men and women. For men, the commonly-run events include the 100,200,400,800,1500, 5000 and 10,000 metres, and for women 100,200,400,800,1500,3000 and 5000 metres.</p>
<p>Events 400 metres and shorter are regarded as sprint events, and are run exclusively in individual lanes (except in indoor areans where the second lap of the 400 metres in run 'out of lane'), with competitors using starting blocks to rest against in an attempt to get the fastest start possible, and competitors run as fast as they can for the entire race. These events, particularly the 100 metres, are primarily tests of muscle power, anerobic energy systems, technique, and reaction times.</p>
<p>Events of between 800 and 3000 metres are classed as middle-distance events. After a slightly staggered start, runners converge to the inner lane of the track. Collisions between runners are common. Runners change their speed throughout the race (usually speeding up for a sprint on the last lap), and tend to run in packs. Tactics are very important in these events. Some runners are capable of maintaining very high speeds for short periods of time, so these runners prefer to stay in a pack running relatively slowly until close to the end of the race and then sprint to the finish line, where other runners may be able to main slightly lower speeds for much longer periods and start accelerating further from the finish in the hope of tiring their competitors. Still other runners (notably many from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>) like to vary their pace throughout the race in the hope of disrupting their competitors' rhythm.</p>
<p>The longest track events, the 5,000 and 10,000 metres, are almost mini-<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28sports%29.html" title="Marathon (sports)">marathons</a> in terms of athletic requirements and tactics, and indeed many marathon runners also race in these events.</p>
<p>Track running also includes the 110 and 400 metre hurdles events, where at intervals around the track wooden barriers (mounted so that if they are touched by a competitor, they will fall down easily and allow the runner to continue). Competitors leap over the hurdles as they complete their race, though there is no penalty for touching or knocking over a hurdle except for the disruption it causes to the hurdler's stride. Hurdles is a highly technical event rewarding runners who can manage their stride length and timing perfectly.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steeplechase.html" title="Steeplechase">steeplechase</a> is a 3000 metre (and thus middle-distance) event with with addition of five barriers at approximately 80 metre intervals around the track. These solid wooden flat-topped barriers cannot be knocked down, but competitors can use the top of them to leap off. It is also notable for adding a "water jump" in which the landing over the steeple is a shallow pool.</p>
<p>Track running events, particularly the 100 metre sprint, are regarded as the most prestigious events at the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympic_Games_b216.html" title="Summer Olympic Games">Summer Olympic Games</a>. Competitors from the United States, mainly of African descent, have dominated athletics competition for many years, but there is little interest from American spectators outside Olympic games. A professional circuit of events is held, mainly throughout Europe, and there are biannual World Championships.</p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's great to finally find a site that caters so exquisitely to my love of all things athletic. However, there is something that has been bothering me for some time. You see, I am a Dutch boy and was wondering how you call the material out of which running tracks are made. It is absolutely essential that I be fuirnished with this informatuion as soon as possible so get typing and hope to see you all in Holland in the near future,</dd>

<p>Some of the information above should be worked into an article but it should be a separate article. The article on track running should never have been made a redirect in the first place. I see there has already been a mini edit war about this - the articles were combined, then someone correctly separated them again, then someone else combined them again, evidently just trowing out the information in the track running article. If someone is going to take the time to work information about track running in, they should put it in a separate article, so others can add to the interesting subject of track running about which many books have been written. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluelion_ba19.html" title="User:Bluelion">Bluelion</a> 23:08, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The definition says this article is about "Athletics, also known as track and field or track and field athletics", I guess (English is not my primary language) this is one of those differences between English and American English. Americans, I note, use athletics with a much wider meaning.</dd>
<dd>The IAAF (Self-defined as governing body for the sport of Athletics) in their Constitution defines athletics as "Track and field, road running, race walking, cross country running and mountain running".</dd>
<dd>For international users current content is coherent with for example my English-Spanish dictionary which translates Athletics as Atletismo, and in Spanish atletismo is for sure what is defined by IAAF. <a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBauhaus_c55c.html" title="User:Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> 05:18, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was actually working from a British source though. I've always considered Olympics to be divided into three things – Swimming races, Athletic sompetition and Team Sports.

<p>I'm about to update the record table with the 7:53.63 steeplechase record from Saif Saaeed Shaheen, the record is awaiting ratification, as are Liu Xiang's 110 m hurdles and Yelena Isinbayeva's Pole Vault. So now is coherent, is also coherent with steeplechase article. Do you think this fact should be advised? or would it be confusing or even misleading for general user, or too long to explain it doesn't mean that there is any doubt about its legality. I will also add the decathlon female record. This case is more complicated, is the first world record to be ratified, as long as there is no better perfonce before the end of the year. <a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBauhaus_c55c.html" title="User:Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> 05:56, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why was this page moved.</p>
<p>It seems unneccesary. Even if a seperate page is to be demanded for the American definition of Athletics, it should be put at Athletics (American usage) and linked to from the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> article.</p>
<p>If no response is made, or a new article/disambiguation placed at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a>, I will move it back.</p>
<p>If a new article is placed in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> describing American usage, I will combat its placement there.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 00:20, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Move it back. I don't think that somebody wanted an article called "Athletics (American Usage)"; its just that in America (Canada is much like the United States in this, I think, but there may be some differences) this normally is called by the term "Track and Field" rather than, or as an adjective modifying, "Athletics." So redirect "Track and Field" to "Athletics" as it has been done, there's no reason to screw up the name of this article. Whoever did the changing didn't even have the courtesy to fix it so we don't get a double-redirect from Track and field. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 00:32, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral:</b> Considering the Canadian and American usage of the words <i>athletics</i> and <i>athletic</i> is more of an ubiquitous definition over the entire world of sporting achievement and physical competition, isn't it best to make <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> an article discussing the comprehensive usage used by most, if not all, of the 293,027,571 Americans and 32,507,874 Canadians, and then reference and link to the other article (Athletics (British usage)) which covers a limited definition used by 60,270,708 Britons? However, I do notice that the proposal derived from my question is somewhat covered in the article <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">Sport</a> and its related topics. But heck, if the Canadians (part of the British commonwealth) use "athletic" to describe their league for American football (which is overestimating their talents quite significantly) it does chip away at the British supremacy over the definition. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 15:58, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Further, the greek nouns αθλοσ (meaning <i>a contest</i>) and αθλετεσ (meaning <i>contender/contestant</i>) and the infinitive verb αθλειν (meaning <i>to contend</i>) does not limit its usage to track and field events (though many of the events of the original Olympic games, save wrestling, became the British <i>Athletics</i> and the American <i>Track and Field</i>). I would support this move if it was established that in general the denotations and connotations for the rest of the world (English-speaking and non-English speaking) gave added strength to the Bsdffffffffffritish concept and that there were some statement on the top of the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> page saying to the effect that "this page discusses (what would then be established as) the traditional definition, for more information on other forms of sporting and physical competition see <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">Sport</a>" or something on that order.

I'm not sure if there are already separate pages for all/any of them, but I certainly think a mention of some of the top level events would be good, such as the World Championships, some regional Championships, World Cup, Grand Prix and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_League_e7b5.html" title="Golden League">Golden League</a> meetings as well as mentionaing National Championships/other domestic meetings and the Olympics. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 22:08, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if the event articles could have better names. Within the domain of athletics, people know what <i>100 metres</i> means. However, outside athletics, it could mean anything that has that distance. I took a look at the IAAF site and some others. They are also within the domain of athletics and are sometimes casual in their usage. I did notice that they used words like <i>event</i>, <i>road race</i>, <i>track race</i>. So what I was thinking is whether <i>100 metres</i> should be changed to <i>100 metres track race</i> or something like that.</p>
<p>Some of the articles are a bit more specific. For example, by including the term <i>relay</i>, although I think that is also somewhat of an athletes abbreviation and it should say <i>relay race</i>.</p>
<p>We are also inconsistent in using symbolic forms of units for some articles (e.g. <a href="../../../4/_/x/4_x_100_m_relay.html" title="4 x 100 m relay">4 x 100 m relay</a>) and complete form for others (e.g. <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_metres.html" title="100 metres">100 metres</a>). I think we should use the complete form throughout.</p>
<p>When you add all the events like high jump, hurdles, walking races, road races, track races the naming issue gets a little more complicated. I don't have a coherent solution but I wondered if it was worth discussing.

This seems like a premature move since most countries call 'track and field' athletics, as do the Olympic games. The governing body of the sport is called the <i>International Association of <b>Athletics</b> Federations</i> (IAAF) and call their World championship the "World Championships in <b>Athletics</b>".

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I'm not a native English speaker (although I consider myself fairly competent), but <b>this is the first time I ever hear about the term "Track and Field"</b>. Take this as a contribution to the "6 billion people" argument – the world outside US&amp;Ca will readily recognize "Athletics" (which is the term used by IAAF) while "Track and Field" looks odd to my ears, to put it mildly. I'm aware that this may sound as an argument out of ignorance, but since "readily recognized by the English-speaking word" point is raised, I'd like to throw my 2c in.

<li>It is still a weak example. It is a sub page of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/athletics/default.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/athletics/default.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC athletics</a>, a news in brief type section. The rest of the articles in the section are ONLY about 'track and field' events. You are not going to convince anyone that track and field is used in the UK with the kind of evidence you are presenting. I wouldn't flog that dead horse if I were you. The most valid argument you can make is the one you have started to outline below. I remain unconvinced but open minded. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 04:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't doubt for a second that "athletics" is the <i>primary</i> term used in Commonwealth English, but I would guess that most native English speakers outside of the US and Canada know what "track and field" is. I suppose it's the opposite of "pants" and "trousers" -- North Americans primarily use the word "pants," but they understand the word "trousers." -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>As explained below, "track and field" is nearly universally understood in the English-speaking world to refer to this sport. On the other hand, only <b><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html#Geographic_distribution" title="English language">27%</a></b> of native English speakers (those from outside the US or Canada) speak a dialect that uses the word "athletics" in this sense. North American English does not have a privileged position in Wikipedia, but if you have one term common to both North American and "Commonwealth" English, and another term unique to Commonwealth English, it makes sense to use the common term. If by "most countries" you are refering to countries that speak other languages, that is irrelevant. This is the English-language encylopedia, so the fact that the sport is called "athletismo" in Spanish or "atletika" in Czech has no bearing on our discussion.
<ul>
<li>So en wikipedia does not account for readers that use English as a second language? Or who are familiar with similar usage, as it is the same in their own language? I have not heard that argument before, are you sure this is in the guidelines? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 04:42, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Certainly people who speak English as a second language count. They probably are more likely to speak British English than are native speakers, so perhaps the world distribution of English speakers is closer to 50/50. Neither North American nor British English has a privileged status here. But because this is the English Wikipedia, the key should be what is best understood by English speakers -- not what the equivalent word is in Romanian or Portuguese. This has come up on articles dealing with the United States; Spanish speakers have demanded the word "American" not be used to mean "U.S. national," since the word "americano" in Spanish refers to anyone who lives in North or South America. By the way, the 27% figure refers to native speakers who are not from the US or Canada. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:55, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understood the intent but missed that Canada was added to the 67% from the US. I understand the language guidelines in wikipedia, but such a large move deserves real discussion. I was not involved in the discussion that occured previously, this has been a stable page for as long as i have edited here.

<li>The name of the IAAF should not trump the fact above. The world governing body of soccer is the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, but the name of the article on the sport is <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a>, not "association football." At the same time, you have organizations like the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">National Collegiate Athletic Associations</a> of the US and the Philippines and the Canadian Colleges Athletics Association, which use the word to mean sports in general. So the "official" definition of "athletics" depends on which organization is using it. The proper thing to do in such a case on Wikipedia is to use a disambiguation page. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would someone already up to speed be able to provide a brief explanation/reminder of how "athletics" and "track and field" may be interpreted differently? &#160;I'd then feel more able to chip in.

<li>In American English, the word "athletics" virtually always means "sports in general." The use of the word "athletics" to mean "track and field" is all but unknown in American English. In British English, "athletics" and "track and field" are synonyms. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think i would go with <b>Track and field</b> or <b>Track and field athletics</b>. For simplicity probably the first would make sense. The precedent would be <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_Field_News_d7d2.html" title="Track and Field News">Track and Field News</a> rather than <b>Track and Field Athletics News</b>.

<dd>I'm confused.

Which do you want? all such moves should have a vote. certainly one such as this which is likely to have opposition. You will note the page says "<i>Discussion to find consensus is encouraged for page moves requested on this page.

<dd>OK, here's a recap. I proposed a move from <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">Track and field</a>, following the procedures on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. Only David D. responded. I then did an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> to attract more comment, after which David Kernow responded. We all agreed a move would be proper. I then tried to move the page to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">Track and field</a>, but could not, because there's already an article there (a redirect to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a>). So I did another <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">requested move</a> to attract administrator attention. Between then and now, Usgnus suggested <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics (track and field)</a>. David D. then moved the page to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics (track and field)</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 22:15, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>[edit conlifct] Good recap. Sorry i had not realised you had put in a formal request for a page move other wise i would not have initiated the bold move without more discussion. Do we have a consensus on <b>Athletics (track and field)</b>? Or is there more discussion required. As i said previously, the pipe link is the real issue here since an article is likely to say <i><b>athletics</b></i> or <i><b>track and field</b></i>. i wonder how many objections there will be if all references to athletics are changed to track and field? i think this could be problematic, so many of those links will have to be pipe linked to track and field anyway. Consequently i think the bracketed <i><b>athletics (track and field)</b></i> is acceptable. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 22:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you saying you have a bias? Or he is accusing you of having a bias? If you have such a bias, are you proposing that the using the page name <b>athletics</b> as a disambiguation page is wrong because of this bias, despite the arguments that have been made here for such a postion? Or is your position based on the fact that you think the arguments make no sense?</dd>
<dd>What are your thoughts on the football (soccer) page? If you have a bias, you are probably uncomfortable with that page too, yet it seems to be accepted as a good compromise. Why should that precedent not be used as a guideline in this case? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 15:27, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am saying that JackLumber's vote on this page only exists because he followed me here. I have said numerous times the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> should be at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_football.html" title="Association football">Association football</a>.

<li><b>Support</b>, this open up the athletics page for the disambiguation page. it has the advantage of maintaining the athletics name as well as clarifying that it is referring to (track and field).

I would however, if pushed really far, give a preference to Athletics (Track and field) over either of the other two suggestions for a move, but my primary vote would be with no change at all. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 17:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sure eyes are rolling at me for not embracing this new proposal. I do agree <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics (track and field)</a> would be better than <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a>. However, I still think the best idea would be simply <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">Track and field</a>, since I am under the impression that <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> was meant to be a unique case. Also, because <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">track and field</a>, if not 100% universal, is unambiguous, I believe it would be better to favor that term over "athletics" throughout the article. A sentence like, "Athletics was the original event at the first Olympics" is confusing to an American eye, although I'm sure any people reading this article could figure out what's meant if they read the lead paragraph first. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree "Athletics" is unacceptable. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field_athletics.html" title="Track and field athletics">Track and field athletics</a> seems far more natural to me than messing about with parentheses, and far better than the blatant Americanism of "Track and field", which is just an abbreviation of this. Americans often further abbreviate it to "Track" when appropriate (though not "field" AFAIK). Personally I would much rather "football (soccer)" was at "Association football". Pipe tricks are not a motivation for article names: do not let the technology influence the the content. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestynes_50e7.html" title="User:Joestynes">jnestorius</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoestynes_bba0.html" title="User talk:Joestynes">talk</a>)</sup> 09:50, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can support <b>track and field athletics</b> too. The argument that swayed me was that <b>athletics</b> should be a disambiguation page. The specific wording of the new page is less important too me.

<li>I voted for both options 2 and 3 as I don't mind which is used, so long as a consensus found (and the opening sentence of the renamed article amended accordingly).

<li>Not entirely sure the move is needed at all, but I'd support a move to "Track and field athletics". "Athletics (track and field)" is, yes, parallel with "football (soccer)" but that's an ugly case to want to follow -- in general if the thing in parens isn't a category but is instead a synonym, something is wrong with using parens. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think a move is needed, but if one is made then I'd prefer <b>Athletics (track and field)</b>. 'Track and field athletics' doesn't sound right and doesn't work well for me. I've never heard it called 'Track and field athletics', only as either 'Athletics' or 'Track and field'. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">Axman</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a>) 10:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It appears clear to me that "Athletics (track and field)" is clearly the most-preferred option, although we have yet to reach a consensus. So where do we go from here? -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 22:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since when has <b>strong</b> counted as an extra half vote? In five years I've never seen a vote count for more than 1 before. If this is the case here then change my votes to strong <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 04:20, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where above does it say that strong oppose gets an extra half point? Read it carefully, you'll see that oppose and strong oppose are given equal weight.

<p>So far, the only person who has had a strong objection to making <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">Athletics</a> a disambiguation page has been Jooler, who, judging from the userboxes on his userpage, appears to have something against American English. He is, of course, entitled to his opinion. But if we, for the sake of argument, disregard his objection, the general mood seems to be that making this page a disambiguation is acceptable. Evil Eye and Duja like the status quo but apparently can live with moving the content to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics (track and field)</a>. The only real question, in my eyes, is whether the content should be moved to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics (track and field)</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field_athletics.html" title="Track and field athletics">Track and field athletics</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry but we cannot for the moment disregard my objection. My objection counts just as much as any other person's views thank you very much. You've basically gone about this all wrong. You should have deiced what you wanted ot move it to than then made a proposal and not made it multiple choice so that voting becomes unclear. This has ended up the a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> election with no clear winner. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 00:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Athletics (track and field)" seems a clear front-runner at present...? &#160;Since "athletics" seems to have (at least) two established meanings, the disambiugation "(track and field)" seems apposite (and in Wikipedia's style)...? &#160;Regards, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> 00:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jooler, there is no requirement that a Move Request be presented as a single option versus the status quo.

<dd>It's far from being an automatic process, each link has to be checked, and disambiguated to the correct link. Some will be directed towards the track and field article, others to Sports, others to the Oakland A's. So humans need to be involved.
