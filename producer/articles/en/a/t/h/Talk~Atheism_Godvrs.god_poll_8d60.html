I will attempt to place the divergent opinions here as clearly as possible. If you don't like how I arrange it, discuss that here:</p>

<p>"Belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in a personal God as creator and ruler of the world.", I may have to change my vote&#160;;) Have you reviewed it? IMO it does not accurately express the diverging opinion (removing "God"). If that was the usage on the atheism page, I would have agreed to it long ago.... <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I review the stuff before I insert it here.&#160;:) "<i>Belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in a personal God</i>" places the Monotheistic, personal entity called "God" by the adherents of such doctrines in the category of "a god or gods". "God" is a special instance of the class "a god or gods", but the option you propose below says that "God" and "a god or gods" are separate. - <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 05:14, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not real sure I understand that. I will say again, the usage cited <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theism" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theism" rel="nofollow">here</a> is perfectly acceptable. The only refernce source I diagree with is encarta. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 06:17, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also object to the use of "will" in either proposal (as in <b>will</b> use lower case "g"'s), as it is overly contentious. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 05:06, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see any use of "will" in that sense below. (only "should" and "it is useful to"), but go ahead and change it if you feel that the present wording can be improved. - <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 05:16, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only objection that comes to mind at the moment is that "refers" shouldn't be apostrophized in the first option.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:44, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's with this new option suddenly appearing, without any comment or even an indication in the edit summaries? As far as I can tell, it's not really relevant to the issue at hand (whether God should be used <i>here</i>, in the atheism article), and overlaps somewhat with one of the existing options besides. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:00, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree, and request suggestions for new poll options. All voters from the previous poll can (and will) be contacted once the new poll is designed. Too many changes occured thruout. For example, after snoyes edits to the options, I can't say I entirely disagree with the alternative presented (to simplify, I agree w dictionary.com's wording). If thats really the opposition view, I see no need for a poll, and am rather inclined to take the opportunity to agree on a concensus. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 01:54, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

A large part of the problem is that many who adhere to a religion can't believe that atheists fail to see their particular god as being special. Atheists do not not believe in your god, we do not believe in any god, so favouring one god with an uppercase is contrary to the subject of the article.Retaining lowercase 'g' is just like people quite correctly changing my Br.

So, will we say "Christians believe that their god, God, does X" or "Christians believe that God does X" (with perhaps an intro explaining who this "God" is)? I much prefer the latter. I trust no Muslim would want the sentence "Muslims believe that their god Allah does X", but would prefer a brief intro explaining who Allah is, followed by sentences like "Muslims believe that Allah does X".</li>

<p>"God, as a concept, is more than just one version of it" That sums up my opinion pretty well. What makes you think God refers only to a christian diety? Christains use "Jehova" and "YHWH" among other names. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 06:08, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well clearly not everyone reads your preferred phrasing in such a light. As I noted, God (with capital G) is an overloaded word, it has multiple meanings. Why risk misunderstanding when there is an alternative that doesn't have such risks? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">ShaneKing</a> 06:36, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>thats exactly my point. Failure to use this "loaded" word, with ALL of its multiple meanings ensures misunderstanding (and is a misuse of the term "atheism"). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 06:40, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Erm, I haven't voted because I'm a bit confused. The wording on the poll question sort of seems to converge in that I could vote yes for both, and some of the responses seem to suggest the same. How is it different to say that <b>G</b>od means the one Christian god and <b>g</b>od means any other god or gods?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue is about whether "God" should be used explicitly in the article on atheism, specifically, or whether "a god or gods" should be used with God being covered implicitly as one member of that classification. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:40, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You make a very good point.

<dd>There _is_ no Buddhist God, however. Buddhist deities are something else entirely. For that matter, so are most if not all Shinto Kami and (I think) any Taoist entities.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's the rub, eh? As far as I'm aware, God with a capital G refers to the Christian god, and not any of those other ones (well, the gods of Islam and Judaism too, in some circumstances).

<dd>Imagine if the wording were changed from ""The literal meaning of the term is therefore <i>without God</i>" to "The literal meaning of the term is therefore <i>without <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a></i>" or "The literal meaning of the term is therefore <i>without <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetragrammaton.html" title="Tetragrammaton">YHWH</a></i>" -- the problem with capital-G God would become readily apparent, as all three terms share a referent. (Lowercase-g "god" is also the correct translation of the Greek θεος; capital-G is usually called "kyrios" in the Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, when the name isn't left untranslated.) <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;Jones</a> 08:58, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, I think the three monotheistic religions believe in the same God, they just have different interpretations of what has been said. If I remember correctly, the Muslims believe that the Kuran is just a continuation of the Christian and Jewish holy texts (just a more complete version or some such). <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 15:24, Feb 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are entirely correct -- what I meant by "all three terms share a referent" was, YHWH, Allah, and capital-G God are different names for the same deity. I meant to demonstrate how ludicrous the introduction to the article would appear if one of the other names were used instead of capital-G God. ---<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;Jones</a> 15:40, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand the difference between the second and third options. The sources cited in the second option seem to be consistent with the principle stated in the third option. I would have thought a capital letter is used wherever the word is grammatically a proper noun. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 05:42, Feb 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its a very subtle difference isn't it. What you describe is the second option. It states that whenever you refer to an anthropomorphic god (that is a personal god, one with human-like characteristics, one that you can relate to through human like interactions like talking to him (prayer), listening to him (divination), or believe that you are created in his image), then proper grammar requires that we capitalize the name of this individual. Examples would include Thor (Norse), Allah (Muslem), Zeus (Roman), God (Christian), Kristna (Hindu), YHWH (Hebrew). But many religions have a non-personal concept of god (Buddhist, Shintu, ect). In these cases, no capitalization should be applied. When talking about the concept of godliness in general, or about the class of all gods, use the most general form, ie., no capitalization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is subtly different from the third option that says that all references to specific gods should be capitalized, whether they are a personal pronoun or not.<a href="../../../m/y/d/User%7EMydogategodshat_753f.html" title="User:Mydogategodshat">mydogategodshat</a> 06:47, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are lots of suns, and at the same time the Sun is the center of the the Earth's planetary system (see <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> and its capitalization). This is the usual capitalization system which should be used here as well (as WP does neither assume nor deny the existence of one or several deities).

<p>I think the main problem Sam's having is based on his assertion "God refers to a monotheistic (not necessarily the abrahamic) deity, who is distinct from, and not included in, the words god and gods." During the month of arguments on talk:atheism he said at several points that he didn't think God was a god. I'm not really sure what he thinks God is if not a god, but I guess it's a bigger issue for him than simply one of grammar. I do agree that this poll is silly considering how clear the consensus is, but such is Wikipedia.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:25, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A perfect example of the painful pointlessness in attempting to communicate with you. Concensus is about agreement on something, not disagreement. If you think everyone who voted "against me" was in concensus, I simply don't know how to respond to such wackyness. To be frank, the primary lack of concensus appears to be in regards to the options themselves, and the ways in which they were altered after the start of the poll. As I mentioned to snoyes, after they altered the (at that time 2nd, now 3rd) option, I could have agreed w half of it (the part refering to dictionary.com). Anyways this is a mess, and I find your inability to understand that excellent cause for our upcoming mediation (as if there were any prior lack&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 20:36, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I simply chose that option to be sure that we don't start changing other articles to read things like "Christians believe the Bible is the word of god" instead of "word of God". I would humbly suggest to Sam that almost all of us on that final option would say that an atheist disbelieves in deities in general, hence use lowercase "g" for the general deity.

<p>I would maybe agree to something like that that didn't involve the definitions above, but rather created 2 new ones, which a concensus could be agreed opon. I get the impression that if we were to honestly portray the options, we might not need the poll, and might find our concensus forthwith. I have said repeatedly that my requests simply involve compatability w basic sources of info, like Dictionary.com. If you use the version they have, and consistantly, I (and I would assume most everybody else, from what I see above) would have concensus.

<dd>Why two new ones? 32 of 36 voters preferred one of two options above. In a run-off election, when two candidates receive above 85% of the vote, I know of no country or locality that assumes, "well, we need to find two totally new candidates then...obviously the electorate isn't settled." We're settled on one of two options. This isn't a personality debate- -- I've never had a disagreement with you, Sam. I honestly think the two popular options represent what this community is wanting to choose between, that one of them will be good for the article, and that the sooner this is done with, the better. Let's put up the pool with the 3rd and 4th options and see if consensus develops. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 19:18, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are essentially the same, the only difference is that the last one clarifies that "God" will be used to refer to the specific monotheistic god. - <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 19:28, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I prefer to avoid edit wars, or I would have deleted that a <b>long</b> time ago. But given tannis history w me, I didn't think it was worth the confrontation. Anyways, its a complete joke and fraud to claim the 3rd and fourth catagories somehow agree. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:24, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I count 36 votes (3, 1, 22, and 10) with 32 for the final two options. Did I miss someone? Didn't intend to, anyhow. And Sam? Wikipedia <b>has</b> editors. We're them. And if you want an expert, well, I don't know who's expert in deciding how to refer to God. I would offer that, as someone possessing a B.A. in English and 2 years of graduate work in religious history, I am not unqualified to offer an opinion -- I might even resent being treated as someone who doesn't understand the issue, although I doubt you meant any offense. I am sure we could find many others with more expertise, but how much do we need for this remarkably small matter? Shall we contact John Dominic Crossan? The OED editors? I think we have enough expertise in the people here to handle this. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 19:27, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC) P.S. Tannin is in error, I think. I agree with you: therefore there is nothing to do but hold a run-off election between the options. Glad we're seeing things from the same side.</dd>

<dd>You skills both intrigue and suprise me. Do you sincerely think it is honest to use the lower case G in refering to God, when all sources of reference (with the sole exception of Encarta, a source I personally despise) do not? Why must wiki take this stand, and to what end? I find it a fearsom slap to the face for both our theistic, and our un-opinionated readers, and a complete parody of NPOV. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 21:46, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, my opinion is clearly to reach concensus regarding new options, not to hold a run off.

<p>This whole thing is foolish. The term "God" (big g) refers to any conceived monotheistic god such as the Creator. The term "god" is a more general term, which may or may not include the specific Big G fella.</p>
<p>Atheists insist on little g for the Abrahamic God, because they want to ridicule the idea of a Creator. And they have every right to their disdain and desire to ridicule. But this is an encyclopedia, not a debating ground. Moreover, it is an English-language encyclopedia, so we should follow established usage.</p>
<p>Say that <i>Atheists reject the concept of monotheism, including the concept of a monotheistic creator.</i> And avoid mentioning "God" except in quotations attributed to advocates.</p>
<p>If some writer wants to say <i>god does not exists</i> a la e.e. cummings, by all means quote their lowercase usage. If we can find some atheist who says that <i>God does not exists</i>, quote him too.</p>
<p>Why make such a big deal?</p>
<p>Are you hoping that Wikipedia will take a stand endorsing the idea that God does not exist? Or that God does exist? I thought we agreed years ago not to fight over this. Sheesh. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 22:00, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ed, I don't think you see anybody here arguing that we should call the monotheistic deity "god" (with lower-case 'g'). The argument is whether "god and/or gods encompasses all spiritual entities rejected by atheists", including 'God'. There are hence people who in the name of logic want to call 'God' "a god". Others simply refute this usage, saying that 'God' is somehow special, and doesn't fall into the category of "a god or gods". - <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 22:26, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quite right, I am <i>not</i> advocating the usage of god-with-a-small-g as a way to "ridicule the idea of a Creator." When I want to talk about the Abrahamic God specifically I use the capital G, since for better or for worse that's the name it's known by. When I say "I don't believe in god" I am not referring specifically to the one named God, I am referring to <i>any</i> god, including but not limited to the one named God (it's actually a somewhat badly phrased statement even so, though; it's similar to saying "I don't believe in unicorn." It should properly be either "I don't believe in gods" or "I don't believe in any god."). Furthermore, it's not just monotheism that's covered, it's all types of theism. I'm not taking a position on whether God actually exists by saying any of this, mind you, I'm taking a position on what atheism means. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:46, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>Eureka</b></i>. I think you may have finially figured out what the problem is. The way you have defined atheism, it fails to reject the One God Who Is All. Ergo, the article is <a href="../../../b/s/_/BS_9a23.html" title="BS">BS</a>, leaving most theist's to be defined as atheists by your corny definition. Its exactly this kind of anti-intellectual bunk that I am fighting with in so many places on the wiki. There <b>IS</b> objective truth, dammit!

<dd>Not really Eureka, in that I have no idea what you're talking about and there seem to be some huge problems still left to resolve. If this "One God Who Is All" isn't a god then why do you think atheism has anything to do with whether people believe in it or not? Why should it be mentioned at all in this article? As far as I can tell you might as well be talking about whether atheists believe in Sasquatch or in string theory (ie, other non-god things that atheism also <i>has nothing to do with</i>). How do you know that there is objective truth, and that this thing you're talking about is one of the things that's objectively true (as I'm assuming you would claim)? On top of it all your use of the name "God" to label this thing you are talking about remains quite confusingly nonstandard, it usually refers to the Abrahamic God. Is there no other name you can use? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:05, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
