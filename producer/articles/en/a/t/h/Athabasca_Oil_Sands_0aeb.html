The Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Athabasca Oil Sands</b> are a large deposit of oil-rich <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitumen.html" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a> located in northern <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. These <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_sands.html" title="Oil sands">oil sands</a> consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi-solid form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest of three oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_River_%28Canada%29_2779.html" title="Peace River (Canada)">Peace River</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Lake_8f16.html" title="Cold Lake">Cold Lake</a> deposits. Together, these oil sand deposits cover about 141&#160;000 km² of sparsely populated <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boreal_forest.html" title="Boreal forest">boreal forest</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskeg.html" title="Muskeg">muskeg</a> (peat <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogs.html" title="Bogs">bogs</a>). The Athabasca oil sands are named after the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athabasca_River_3ff2.html" title="Athabasca River">Athabasca River</a> which cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed on the river banks. Historically, the bitumen was used by the indigenous <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cree.html" title="Cree">Cree</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dene.html" title="Dene">Dene</a> <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada_caad.html" title="Aboriginal peoples in Canada">Aboriginal peoples</a> to waterproof their canoes. The oil deposits are located within the boundaries of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_8.html" title="Treaty 8">Treaty 8</a>, and several <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Nations_0096.html" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> of the area are involved with the sands. The oil sands were first seen by Europeans in 1788.</p>
<p>The key characteristic of the Athabasca deposit is that it is the only one shallow enough to be suitable for <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_mining.html" title="Surface mining">surface mining</a>. About 10% of the Athabasca oil sands are covered by less than 75 metres (250 feet) of overburden. The mineable area as defined by the Alberta government covers 37 contiguous townships (about 3400 square kilometres or 1300 square miles) north of the city of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_McMurray_1ea0.html" title="Fort McMurray">Fort McMurray</a>. The overburden consists of 1 to 3 metres of water-logged <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskeg.html" title="Muskeg">muskeg</a> on top of 0 to 75 metres of clay and barren sand, while the underlying oil sands are typically 40 to 60 metres thick and sit on top of relatively flat limestone rock. As a result of the easy accessibility, the world's first oil sands mine was started by Great Canadian Oil Sands (now <a href="../../../s/u/n/Suncor.html" title="Suncor">Suncor</a>) back in 1967. The <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syncrude.html" title="Syncrude">Syncrude</a> mine (the biggest mine in the world) followed in 1978, and the Albian Sands mine (operated by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Canada_cced.html" title="Shell Canada">Shell Canada</a>) in 2003. All three of these mines are associated with bitumen <a href="../../../u/p/g/Upgrader.html" title="Upgrader">upgraders</a> that convert the unusable bitumen into <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthetic_crude.html" title="Synthetic crude">synthetic crude</a> oil for shipment to <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refineries.html" title="Refineries">refineries</a> in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>The Athabasca oil sands are primarily located in and around the city of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_McMurray%2C_Alberta_4bb4.html" title="Fort McMurray, Alberta">Fort McMurray</a> which was still, in the late 1950s, primarily a wilderness outpost of a few hundred people whose main economic activities included fur trapping and salt mining. Since the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_crisis.html" title="Energy crisis">energy crisis</a> of the 1970s, Fort McMurray has been transformed into a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomtown.html" title="Boomtown">boomtown</a> of 80,000 people struggling to provide services and housing for migrant workers, many of them from Eastern Canada, especially <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Athabasca_Oil_Sands_0aeb.html" title="Edit section: Estimated oil reserves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Estimated oil reserves</span></h2>
<p>Alberta Government calculates that about 28 billion cubic metres (174 billion barrels) of crude bitumen are economically recoverable from the three Alberta oil sands areas at current prices using current technology. This is equivalent to about 10% of the estimated 1,700 and 2,500 billion barrels of bitumen in place. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Alberta estimates that the Athabasca deposits alone contain 5.6 billion cubic metres (35 billion barrels) of surface mineable bitumen and 15.6 billion cubic metres (98 billion barrels) of bitumen recoverable by <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-situ.html" title="In-situ">in-situ</a> methods. These estimates of Canada's <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_reserves.html" title="Oil reserves">oil reserves</a> caused some astonishment when they were first published but are now largely accepted by the international community. This volume places Canadian proven oil reserves second in the world behind those of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>
<p>The method of calculating economically recoverable reserves that produced these estimates was adopted because conventional methods of accounting for reserves gave increasingly meaningless numbers. They made it appear that Alberta was running out of oil at a time when rapid increases in oil sands production were more than offsetting declines in conventional oil, and in fact most of Alberta's oil production is now <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-conventional_oil.html" title="Non-conventional oil">non-conventional oil</a>. Conventional estimates of <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_reserves.html" title="Oil reserves">oil reserves</a> are really calculations of the geological risk of drilling for oil, but in the oil sands there is very little geological risk because they outcrop on the surface and are extremely easy to find. One risk is economic risk of low oil prices and with the <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_price_increases_of_2004-2006.html" title="Oil price increases of 2004-2006">oil price increases of 2004-2006</a>, this economic risk evaporated.</p>
<p>The Alberta estimates in some ways are extremely conservative, since they assume a recovery rate of around 20% of bitumen in place, whereas oil companies using the new <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_assisted_gravity_drainage.html" title="Steam assisted gravity drainage">steam assisted gravity drainage</a> method of extracting bitumen report that they can recover over 60% with little effort. These much higher recovery rates probably mean that the ultimate production could be several times as high as the already very large government estimates.</p>
<p>At current rates of production, the Athabasca oil sands reserves would last over 400 years. However, they are unlikely to stay that way given the current supply shortage in the world. Assuming that Alberta quadrupled its production of oil, exporting most of it to the United States, the oil sands would last over 100 years. If production increased to the same level as Saudi Arabia, 10 million barrels per day, the life of the resource would be cut to a bit over 40 years. However, it is extremely unlikely that production could be increased to those levels without a huge influx of immigrant workers into northern Alberta. While Alberta will probably be a major player on the world oil market for the next century, it is not expected to replace the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> as the main source of American, European and Asian supply.</p>

However, while the Orinoco deposits are less viscous and more easily produced using conventional techniques (the Venezuelan government prefers to call them "extra-heavy oil"), they are too deep to access by surface mining.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Athabasca_Oil_Sands_0aeb.html" title="Edit section: Economics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Economics</span></h2>
<p>Despite the large reserves, the cost of extracting the oil from the sand has historically made production of the oil sands unprofitable - the cost of selling the extracted crude would not cover the direct costs of recovery; labour to mine the sands and fuel to extract the crude.</p>
<p>In mid-2006, the National Energy Board of Canada estimated the operating cost of a new mining operation in the Athabasca oil sands to be $9 to $12 per barrel, while the cost of an in-situ SAGD operation (using dual horizontal wells) would be $10 to $14 per barrel. This compares to operating costs for conventional oil wells which can range from less than $1 per barrel in Iraq and Saudi Arabia to $6 and up in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In addition, the capital cost of the equipment, such as the huge machines required to mine the sands and the dump trucks used to haul it to processing make capital costs a major consideration in starting production. The NEB estimates that capital costs raise the total cost of production to $18 to $20 per barrel for a new mining operation and $18 to $22 per barrel for a SAGD operation. This does not include the cost of upgrading the crude bitumen to synthetic crude oil, which makes the final costs $36 to $40 per barrel for a new mining operation.</p>
<p>Therefore, although high crude prices make the cost of production very attractive, sudden drops in price leaves producers unable to recover their enormous capital costs - although the companies are well financed and can tolerate long periods of low prices since the capital has already been spent and they can almost always cover incremental operating costs.</p>
<p>However, the development of commercial production is made easier by the fact that exploration costs are virtually nil. Such costs are a major factor when assessing the economics of drilling in a traditional oil field. The location of the oil deposits in the tar sands are well known and an estimate of recovery costs can usually be made easily. Most important, the oil sands are in a politically stable area - there is not another region in the world with energy deposits of this magnitude where it would be less likely that these expensive installations would be <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expropriation.html" title="Expropriation">confiscated</a> by a hostile national government, or be endangered by a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_price_increases_of_2004-2006.html" title="Oil price increases of 2004-2006">Oil price increases of 2004-2006</a>, the economics of oil sands have improved dramatically. At a world price of $50 per barrel, the NEB estimates an integrated mining operation would make a rate return of 16 to 23 percent, while a SAGD operation would return 16 to 27 percent. Prices in 2006 have been considerably higher than that. As a result, capital expenditures in the oil sands announced for the period 2006 to 2015 exceed $100 billion, which is twice the amount projected as recently as 2004. However, due to an acute labour shortage which has developed in Alberta, it is not likely that all these projects can be completed.</p>
<p>At present the area around <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_McMurray%2C_Alberta_4bb4.html" title="Fort McMurray, Alberta">Fort McMurray, Alberta</a>, has seen the most effect from the increased activity in the oil sands. However, although jobs are plentiful, housing is in short supply and expensive. People seeking work often arrive in the area without arranging accommodation, driving up the price of temporary accommodation. The area is isolated, with only a two-lane road connecting it to the rest of the province, and there is pressure on the government of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> to improve road links as well as hospitals and other infrastructure. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of companies to move as much of the construction work as possible out of the Fort McMurray area, and even out of Alberta, the shortage of skilled workers is spreading to the rest of the province. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Even without the oil sands, the Alberta economy would be very strong, but development of the oil sands has resulted in the strongest period of economic growth ever recorded by a Canadian province and driven Alberta's unemployment rates to the lowest levels in history. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European <a href="../../../f/u/r/Fur_trade.html" title="Fur trade">fur traders</a> in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cree.html" title="Cree">Cree</a> trader, brought a sample of the oil sands to the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company_f47f.html" title="Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> post at <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill%2C_Manitoba_aea5.html" title="Churchill, Manitoba">Fort Churchill</a>. In 1778, fur trader <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pond_a983.html" title="Peter Pond">Peter Pond</a> became the first white man to see the outcroppings along the Athabasca River and he noted that the native people used it to waterproof their <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canoe.html" title="Canoe">canoes</a>. In 1883, C. Hoffman of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geological_Survey_of_Canada_bc37.html" title="Geological Survey of Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a> tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water, and reported that it separated readily. However, it was nearly a century before extracting it became commercially viable. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Karl_Clark_6834.html" title="Dr. Karl Clark">Dr. Karl Clark</a> of the University of Alberta, perfected a steam separation process for the tar sands in 1926.</p>
<p>Commercial production of oil from the Athabasca oil sands began in 1967, when <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunoco.html" title="Sunoco">Great Canadian Oil Sands</a> (now Suncor) opened its first mine, producing 30,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude oil. Development was inhibited by declining world oil prices, and the second mine, operated by the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syncrude.html" title="Syncrude">Syncrude</a> consortium, did not begin operating until 1978, after the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_oil_crisis.html" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> sparked investor interest. However, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_of_oil.html" title="Price of oil">price of oil</a> subsided afterwards, and although the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_energy_crisis.html" title="1979 energy crisis">1979 energy crisis</a> caused oil prices to peak again, introduction of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Energy_Program_7e10.html" title="National Energy Program">National Energy Program</a> by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> caused the oil companies and the Alberta government under Premier <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lougheed_f179.html" title="Peter Lougheed">Peter Lougheed</a> to pull the plug on new developments. Once more, prices declined to very low levels, causing considerable retrenchment in the oil industry, and the third mine, operated by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Canada_cced.html" title="Shell Canada">Shell Canada</a>, did not begin operating until 2003. However, with <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_price_increases_of_2004-2006.html" title="Oil price increases of 2004-2006">Oil price increases of 2004-2006</a>, the existing mines have been greatly expanded and new ones are being planned.</p>
<p>According to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, production of crude bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands was as follows:</p>

<p>This was despite a major fire at the Suncor operation, a major turnaround at Syncrude, and operational problems at the Shell operation. Combined oil production in all three Alberta oil sands areas was 169,100 m3/day or 1,065,000 barrels per day</p>
<p>With planned projects coming on stream, by 2010 oil sands production is projected to reach 2 million barrels per day or about two thirds of Canadian production. By 2015 Canadian oil production may reach 4 million barrels per day, of which only 15% will be conventional crude oil. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Association_of_Petroleum_Producers_f20f.html" title="Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</a> predicts that by 2020 Canadian oil production will reach 4.8 million barrels per day, of which only about 10% will be conventional light or medium crude oil, and most of the rest will be crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil from the Athabasca oil sands.</p>

<p>See main article on <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_sands.html#Extraction_process" title="Oil sands">Oil sands extraction</a></p>
<p>The original process of extraction used at the oil sands was developed by Dr. Karl Clark, working with the Research Council of Alberta in the 1920s.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Historically (since the 1960s), the oil sands have been mined in huge open pit mines and extracted from the sand by variations of the Clark water-based extraction process, which separates aerated bitumen from the other oil sand components in gravity settling vessels. More recently, new in-situ methods have been developed to extract bitumen from deep deposits by injecting steam to heat the sands and reduce the bitumen viscosity so that it can be pumped out like conventional crude oil.</p>
<p>The standard extraction process also requires huge amounts of natural gas. Currently, the oil sands industry uses about 4% percent of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin natural gas production. By 2015, this may increase by a factor of 2.5 times.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the National Energy Board, it requires about 0.4 million cubic feet of natural gas to produce one barrel of synthetic crude oil, which is the energy equivalent of 6 million cubic feet of gas, so the process produces a substantial net gain in energy. That being the case, it is likely that in the short term exports of natural gas to the United States will be reduced to provide fuel to the oil sands plants. In the long term, however, oil upgraders will likely turn to bitumen <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasification.html" title="Gasification">gasification</a> to generate their own fuel. In much the same way the bitumen can be converted into synthetic crude oil, it can also be converted to synthetic natural gas.</p>
<p>In-situ extraction on a commercial scale is just beginning. A project nearing completion, the Long Lake Project<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>, is designed to provide its own fuel, by on-site cracking of the bitumen mined.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> It is supposed to start extracting bitumen in 2006, and "upgrading" of bitumen to liquid oil in 2007, producing 60,000 bbl/day of usable oil. If it works, the natural gas problem becomes less of an issue and the problem of disposing of tailings disappears.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Athabasca_Oil_Sands_0aeb.html" title="Edit section: Environmental impacts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental impacts</span></h2>
<p>Critics contend that government and indstry measures taken to minimize environmental and health risks posed by large-scale mining operations are inadequate, potentially causing damage to archaeological sites and natural resources.</p>
<p>The open-pit mining of the Athabasca oils sands destroys the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiga.html" title="Taiga">boreal forest</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bog.html" title="Bog">bogs</a>, the rivers as well as the natural landscape. The Alberta mining industry believes that the boreal forest will eventually colonize the reclaimed lands, yet 30 years after the opening of the first open pit mine in the region no land is considered by the Alberta Government as having been "restored."</p>
<p>Furthermore, for every barrel of synthetic oil produced in Alberta, more than 80 kg of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_gas.html" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> are released into the atmosphere and between 2 and 4 barrels of waste water are dumped into <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tailing_ponds.html" title="Tailing ponds">tailing ponds</a> that have flooded about 50 km² of forest and bogs. The forecast growth in synthetic oil production in Alberta also threatens Canada's international commitments. In ratifying the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_Protocol_1811.html" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, Canada agreed to reduce, by 2012, its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% with respect to [1990]. In 2002, Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions had increased by 24% since 1990.</p>
<p>However, Canada is also source of greenhouse gases in the global context, producing a significant percentage of world emissions of carbon dioxide. The United States, which has not signed the Kyoto Protocol, is the world's largest emitter at a fluctuating 25% of the total. China is the second largest emitter at 15%, but as a developing country is exempt from controls. China uses energy very inefficiently, requiring 4.3 times as much energy per unit of GDP as America, and uses mostly coal. Its economy has been growing rapidly, and as a result the International Energy Agency expects it to exceed the U.S. as the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide as early as 2010. Other developing countries in Asia and Africa have also been increasing their emissions rapidly, and most European countries have missed their reduction targets. Against this background, Canada's developments in the oil sands must not be underestimated and in view of recent IPCC reports each activity must be rigorously studied for its impact on climate change.</p>
