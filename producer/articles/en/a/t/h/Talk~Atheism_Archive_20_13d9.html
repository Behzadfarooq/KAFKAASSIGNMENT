<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism and Science</span></h2>
<p>I am in the sciences, and it is rare to find anyone so dogmatic to proclaim faith in Atheism. Agnosticism is common, but so is theism. The Nature reference is a red herring--the survey asked scientists if they believed in "a God in intellectual and affective communication with humankind", which would imply that God frequently changes physical laws to answer the prayers of all of humankind. "Intellectual" implies dialogue, "affective" means direct cause-result, and "humankind" (rather than "sometimes") means frequently. A large number of Christians would express disbelief to this! Note that one's disbelief in God's "intellectual and affective communication with humankind" does not preclude even overt miracles. This poll was taken in typical "push-poll" fashion, asking if God often intervenes before asking if God grants personal immortality.</p>
<p>It looks like this article has been hijacked by the militant atheists, which is a shame. The atheists efforts to ride in on the coattails of science has led to all sorts of abominations. Take in point evolution--evolution IS NOT A FACT, nor is ANY scientific theory. Even Newton's Physics is NOT A FACT (in fact, it's wrong--but it's usually close enough). You can't directly prove anything about the real world. The atheists who promote evolution as fact are doing at least as much of a disservice to science as the creationists, except that (1) a student taught creationism as theory is still allowed to question his scientific beliefs (that is, to think critically) and (2) many creationism stress Divine Creation as what happened but accept evolution as a useful predictive theory--these creationists do not conflict with science, they conflict with Atheists. I view the creationists as a distraction to science (which is a negative role), but the militant Atheists are a downright hindrance to scientific progress.</p>
<p>I tried to make some quick edits to fix the bias, but they are imperfect.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">categorization in "philosophy of religion"</span></h2>
<p>Adraeus just took this article out of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilosophy_of_religion_d863.html" title="Category:Philosophy of religion">Category:Philosophy of religion</a> with the reasoning "religion isn't a component of theism or atheism." I disagree, at least to the effect that I think this article should be categorized as such; atheism is IMO quite closely linked to religion in subject matter; there are references to and discussions of religious matters scattered all throughout this article. In addition, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_religion.html" title="Philosophy of religion">philosophy of religion</a> says that one of the two main questions that philosophy of religion is meant to address is "Do we have any good reason to think that God exists, or to think that God does not exist?". Finally, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Category%7EAtheism_ba7a.html" title="Category:Atheism">Category:Atheism</a> is already a subcategory of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Category%7EReligion_d8e0.html" title="Category:Religion">Category:Religion</a>, so the connection between the two is already established. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:57, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Has anyone <i>ever</i> told you that it is <i>extremely rude</i> to speak of someone in the third person when they're directly accessible? Since <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilosophy_of_religion_d863.html" title="Category:Philosophy of religion">Category:Philosophy of religion</a> is a subcategory of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilosophy_87d4.html" title="Category:Philosophy">Category:Philosophy</a>, which covers all the bases, I don't see why you object. On the other hand, atheism neither concerns "the rational study of the meaning and justification of fundamental religious claims" (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_science.html" title="Philosophy of science">philosophy of science</a>) or "the critical study of the most fundamental questions that humankind has been able to ask" (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>). In the non-academic use of the term <i>philosophy</i>, <i>strong atheism</i> sometimes involves a way of living without gods, the supernatural, etc., but <i>weak atheism</i> and <i>atheism</i> in general do not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To be without god-beliefs does not necessitate being without religion. Religion and theism are not mutually inclusive or exclusive. So, an atheist is not required to be without or against religion to be without or against theistic beliefs just as a theist is not required to be with or for religion to be with or for theistic beliefs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, religion is not a component of theism or atheism. (A <i>component</i> is a required part.) <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 06:34, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As for whether atheism really belongs there, I'm not saying that atheism is <i>solely</i> about religion, just that it intersects with that subject enough to be categorized there. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:30, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm afraid that I have no idea what all thia talk about components is about. Atheism is one of the central concerns of the philosophy of religion (moreover, the philosophy of religion is the <i>only</i> area of philosophy that discusses it); as a philosopher of religion myself, I'm astonished that anyone should argue otherwise. This isn't a matter of opinion, or something open to argument; it's a simple documented fact. I'll replace the category. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:13, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Mel that the article should be in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilosophy_of_religion_d863.html" title="Category:Philosophy of religion">Category:Philosophy of religion</a>, one of the main topics of which is the existence or non-existence of God or gods.

<p>We're talking about "components" purely because of a comment Adraeus made while making the change, which is is mild danger of being conflated with the logic of the change per se. (If A. will forgive my extreme rudeness in making a 3rd person reference.) I agree with the above two editors: it's related to philosophy of religion, it goes directly to one of the main concerns of PoR, of all the branches of philosophy, that's the one it's most closely related to. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a></p>
<p>I agree that atheism is <i>related</i> to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_religion.html" title="Philosophy of religion">philosophy of religion</a>, but atheism is not a philosophy of religion except where <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">strong atheism</a> may concern.

<dd>Changing the core definition of <i>atheism</i> is intolerable. Through extensive discussion, the dominant and active editors of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> have developed an extremely accurate introduction to atheism using extremely precise wording. <i>Condition</i> is defined as "a mode of being or form of existence of a person or thing", such as the <i>human condition</i> or "the condition of being human". A <i>condition</i> is merely a state of being, which may be dependent on various factors. A <i>condition of being</i>, however, is a thing's natural state of existence. <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developmental_psychology.html" title="Developmental psychology">Developmental psychology</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_science.html" title="Cognitive science">cognitive sciences</a> have scientifically suggested that humans are born without awareness of deities, and therefore, without belief in deities (atheism). Consequently, the condition of being an atheist (i.e., a person without theistic beliefs) is inherent to the condition of being an Earth-born human. For theists who posit that humans are born aware of deities, which is unlikely, the term <i>condition</i> allows application of its alternative definition "an assumption on which rests the validity or effect of something else" thus neutralizing any claim of POV regarding the core definition of <i>atheism</i>. Moreover, any claim of ill-meaning regarding the term <i>condition</i> is also neutralized considering that the term <i>condition</i> is not attributed with any disease-related definition, which also means that such claims are founded on an ignorance of terminology and the common usage of terms. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 11:22, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>you know, I actually agree Adraeus' version is slightly superior. But I still wish the haggling could be conducted with slightly less hysteria. And, of course, the sweat and tears could go into actually expanding miserable stub articles. ah, and I don't think an arcticle of such a scope should be protected over a squabble over "concept" vs. "condition". <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:33, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Trying to get the page protected over a couple of minor edits is hysterical, I agree.</dd>
<dd>I had thought that there wasn't much to choose between the two versions, but Adraeus' explanation has pushed me towards the word 'state'. He seems to be claiming that we should state as a fact that atheism is the natural human condition; I believe that it is, but there's certainly no 'scientific proof', as he puts it. Moreover, his argument applies at best only to weak atheism, and leaves out of account all those who came to the state of atheism after the atate of religious belief.</dd>
<dd>The anon who sparked this off is obviously a non-native speaker, and misunderstood the term 'condition', but that's surely no reason to refuse to think about the issue that he raised. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:05, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"weak atheism" is a joke. I think we only keep it to humour people, so that the real article can be edited in peace.

<dd>"Weak atheism" is not a "joke" since it has been well-documented by various philosophers throughout history. "Strong atheists" may view "weak atheism" as a "joke", which we mention in the article, however, editing the article to suit only strong atheism is POV. "Condition of being" applies to both weak atheists and strong atheists. Strong atheists simply add the assertion that deities do not exist. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 22:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, one could use 'weak atheism' to describe the situation of someone who has simply never thought about or conceived of anything like a god, and 'strong atheism' to erefer to those who have thought about it, and rejected it. In that sense, at least, I'd say that we're all born (weak) atheists. Some thinkers have denied this, though (Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza, for example), and science is unable to settle the matter. I'd argue against the existence of innate ideas, but this article surely isn't the place for such a discussion. perhaps a brief mention of it should be included (if it isn't already; I can't remember off-hand). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:53, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>'State' works for me, though I have to say I'd have to get out of bed on a very bad side to get too grumpy about "condition" or "concept", either. (Via the headboard, perhaps?) I'm also unimpressed by the request for page protection, not to say the tone of certain recent comments. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 16:19, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Mel's new first sentence is an improvement -- not mainly because of the substitution of 'state' for 'condition', but because of the improved parallellism in the syntax. I don't like either 'state' or 'condition', although if I had to pick, I have a slight preference for 'state'. But this is my strong atheism talking -- which views the 'weak atheist' definition of "atheism" as a state or condition as confused. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:05, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a somewhat tangential comment, but just to put in a word for weak atheists: Positivists would generally be classified thus, but have a plenty sophisticated justification for their position, certainly not necessarily less so that the "strongs". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:10, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That may be true, but positivists would not define themselves as "weak atheists" -- that is, as being in the "state" of being without a belief in God. They take a position, which is that religious language is meaningless. Defining the "absence" of a position on a topic as one of the possible positions seems to me to be nonsensical, but there you are. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:00, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adraeus has, without explanation (except for a nomic and opaque reference to the 'fallacy of either/or'), changed the summary so as to remove the syntactical symmetry that I'd added (and which BM had remarked upon approvingly), and to change the grammatical 'any deity' to the ungrammatical 'any deities'. I've reverted to my version; perhaps he'll explain his thinking here before changing it again. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 23:31, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, first, I haven't reverted every edit you've made, nor anything like it. Secondly, your accusation of bigotry is vague and groundless. Thirdly, it's generally considered polite (if not actually required by the rules) to let someone know of a move like this on their Talk page, even if it is as frivolous as this one. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:26, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adraeus, in all probability your request will just be turned down. Not because "Mel Etitis is popular while you are not", but because you didn't even go through RfC stage. The arbcom has more urgent tasks than to caucus over the injustice of replacing 'condition' with 'state'. Have a look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_universe_does_not_revolve_around_you_4288.html" title="Wikipedia:The universe does not revolve around you">Wikipedia:The universe does not revolve around you</a> (and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MPOV" class="extiw" title="m:MPOV">m:MPOV</a>). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:05, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Seeking arbitration is a process. That means going through the appropriate phases of the process, which includes RfC. I'm preparing for RfC. By the way, you completely misunderstand the reasons for my intent to seek arbitration. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> has been strongly against me and all significant edits I've made since his/her appearance as an editor in this article, and each comment made by him/her regarding my contributions and I is a blatant violation of Wikipedia policy against <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> comments. For instance, <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> described a recent revert of mine as "hysteria". If you were actually concerned with analyzing assertions of frivolousness, you'd be delighted by more examples of <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a>'s antagonistic behavior simply by looking up.

<dd>I think Sam meant libel here, not slander. Either way, Aaarrrggh is right. The archives of Talk:Atheism are a testament to Sam's 11 months of POV obstructionism here. Considering the disruption he caused and the number of new editors here now, Aaarrrggh's comment was necessary in that there is a well founded public interest in this specific information being widely known to save us from falling into the same deadlock caused by one tractable POV. And Aaarrrggh is also right in pointing out that <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander.html#Truth" title="Slander">truth is an affirmative defense</a> against charges of slander. So since Sam's history in the archives of Talk:Atheism proves that his statement was based on fact, Sam's claim of defamation is groundless. That they are indeed facts also establishes that Aaarrrggh was only right to caution Sam.</dd>

We learned painfully the last time how to deal with biased or obstructionist editors, this time we're better prepared. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 20:39, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> deserves a chance to participate (and cooperate) in the development of this article regardless of his worldview. (His previous defensive behavior, I think, certainly wasn't as negative as <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a>' current antagonism...) With this article being recently and strictly managed by atheists, we've run into a more difficult problem that concerns the irrational and abusively biased declaration by explicit atheists that <i>implicit atheism doesn't exist</i>, <i>is a "joke"</i> (thank the local admin, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a>, for that <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> insult to us implicit atheists), or that <i>implicit atheism isn't a form of atheism at all</i> (credits: <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>). Quite simply, this discussion requires a third-party non-atheist viewpoint no matter how twisted, shallow, incompetent, ignorant, and/or incorrect some editors may perceive it. Third-party input is useful for allowing reasonable editors to see an issue from another angle not considered. (Sorry, Sam, if any of that was offensive. Offense not intended.) <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 21:43, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few of us have been quite open all along about being strong atheists, and even with one more strong atheist in the editing crew (namely, Mel), I reckon we are still in the minority here. Whatever we might opine about weak atheism on this Talk page, nobody is arguing that it is not currently a common definition of atheism and doesn't belong in the article. And I don't think Mel substitituting "state" for "condition" and cleaning up the syntax of the first sentence a little can really be construed as the strong atheists suddenly on a rampage, Adraeus, old bean. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:33, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He even stated explicitly that (and I quote), " And third, the bias against me from those lacking rigour is so extreme that there is no way in hell they are going to be convinced by anything I say. I could predict next weekÍs stock prices, and they'd still do nothing other than <b>vomit forth the bile that has earned godlessness its infamy.</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Atheism/Archive_18" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Atheism/Archive_18" rel="nofollow">1</a>]" In the same archive, you also make your own intentions regarding this article very clear: "I am in the habit of being bold, and I don't intend to change that. If you like some of my edits, reinsert them. I'll do just as I said, and come back someday when my improvements might not be reverted out of hand, and opposed by consensus." Translation: I am going to wait in the wings until I think I stand a chance of getting my POV edits into the article unedited.</dd>

<dd>As I've said, if he comes here and edits productively I don't have a problem, but this particular user has such a history of (attempted) POV bullying that anyone familiar with his previous efforts on this article will naturally be somewhat alarmed that he is back here again - especially after he basically told us some time ago he was going to come back and carry on as per usual when he believed he stood a greater chance of having his edits accepted.

Your recourse is not to make Sam the target of your ire on the Talk page of every article where you happen to end up with him as a co-editor. That simply lowers the tone of the discussion on the Talk pages. You only put yourself in the wrong by being uncivil and by engaging in personal attacks. If you feel compelled to do something about Sam, go to the Arbitration Committee and make the case that he should be banned. However, before doing so, consider that your own lack of civility and personal attacks will distract attention from whatever points you are trying to make and the Arb Comm is apt to simply wash its hands of the matter -- or to discipline everybody involved. Speaking personally, while I find Sam's editing behaviour a bit exasperating at times, I have not found him hard to work with. He generally returns politeness with the same, which I find is often true of people. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:52, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>prevalent</i> is a stronger term than <i>widespread</i>, which is again stronger than <i>common</i>. Atheism is certainly not "prevalent" in all cultures, it is not even <i>common</i> in all cultures, it is arguably <i>in existence</i> in all cultures, but even that is a strong claim, it took me a long time to find anything like an atheist from the European Middle Ages (c.f. the Löffler case in the history section). Anybody who claims that "atheism was prevalent in the Middle Ages" (which would be a corollary of "in all cultures"), is simply bullshitting you. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:25, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>With regard to scientists, reference is given to at least one study in the article, and I gave another reference (<a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_Archive_19_664f.html#Scientists" title="Talk:Atheism/Archive 19">Talk:Atheism/Archive 19#Scientists</a>). 'Rationalist' and 'humanist' aren't defined by atheism (and many religious philosophers (as opposed to philosophers of religion) and Christian Humanists would be surprised to be told that they were). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:30, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes, but we cannot lump them together like that.
<ul>
<li>the study shows a narrow majority of atheists among early 20th c. natural scientists.</li>
<li>Humanism is indeed not defined by atheism, atheism may rather be considered a logical continuation of humanism (since humanism focuses on humans <i>instead</i> of on God. As soon as humans are more important than God, it is only a small step towards atheism. Arguably, Christianity is humanist theism, since it really boils down to God becoming human, which psychologists have long identified as a rationalization of the inverse desire of humans to become God). I have no idea how we are supposed to come up with a percentage of early 20th c. atheist humanists, short of unearthing a poll where people were asked "are you a humanist? are you an atheist?".</li>
<li>Rationalists, moreover, are necessarily atheists. You cannot be a rationalist and at the same time rely on a concept <i>defined</i> by its transcendence of rationality.</li>

<p>But many believers <i>don't</i> hold that the concept of god is defined by its transcendence of rationality. I don't just mean Thomists, though they're obviously significant, but it's the official position of the Catholic Church, and has been held by the majority of philosophers of religion, from Augustine (and before, in fact) to Swinburne, van Inwagen, Plantinga, Adams, Stump, <i>et al.</i> The retreat to a notion of faith based in irrationality is relatively recent as a mainstream phenomenon. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:54, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>ok, this is rather subtle now. afaik, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomism.html" title="Thomism">Thomism</a> holds that the necessity of <i>existence</i> of God is provable rationally, but I suppose the proof heavily relies on the point of rationality itself having been created by God. This doesn't imply that God does not transcend rationality, indeed, if he didn't, God would just be a Turing machine. So, similarly to infinite regression, which is a valid proof without actually performing an infinite number of regressions, Thomists hold that God's existence can be proven rationally, without claiming that they could in principle implement a complete model of God. The question is, is a rationalist somebody who believes that existence presupposes rational cause, or is a rationalist merely someone who thinks that it is useful to make rational arguments now and again? Are we talking about weak and strong rationalism here (*rolleyes*)&#160;?</dd>
<dd>All this is beside the point really, since we're really just looking for an attribution of the statement in question. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:02, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>There are dozens of ways of rationally proving God, personal revelation being the most obvious. See <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God_0cb5.html" title="Arguments for the existence of God">Arguments for the existence of God</a>. There is nothing about rationalism that excludes theism. What about pantheism for crissakes, if you define God as existence, you can rationally prove existence, can't you?

<dd>Personal revelation doesn't count as proof of god; first, for all sorts of reasons that this isn't the place to into, concerning the nature of private experience, etc., but secondly because proof is here used with regard to the third person. <i>x'</i>s claim to have personally experienced god shouldn't convince <i>y</i> of anything. the question isn't whether any of the arguments <i>works</i>, but whether it's a matter for rational argument at all. the history of theology and philosophy says yes. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:10, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hm, I am not sure you are really on top of this conversation. Logically, the statement you have just removed is the more meaningful the more ways there are, as you claim, of "proving" God rationally. So, are you saying we remove it because it is not meaningful, since all rationalists are atheists anyway, or are we removing it because there were actually more theist than atheist rationalists? Can we also just wait with the edit warring for a minute until we have sorted this out here? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:11, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li>I'm simply saying that being a rationalist doesn't imply being an atheist (aside from anything else, one can be a rationalist and wrong); thus the claim that most rationalists are atheists isn't tautologous, as was claimed.</li>
<li>I replaced the sentence simply because it was still under discussion, and I thought it better to finish talking before acting.</li>
<li>The fact that it's in the article, explained at greater length, surely doesn't preclude it from appearing in the summary; rather the reverse, if anything. Isn't the summary supposed, in part, to summarise what comes later? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:29, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The intro doesn't say that rationalism or humanism necessitate atheism; it says that atheism is the dominant position among rationalists and humanists. I am confident that this is true. However, I'm in favor of removing rationalists and humanists unless someone can produce surveys or polls of "rationalists" or "humanists" similar to those we have cited in the article and on the Talk page concerning "scientists". If such polls were done, I don't have much doubt as to the outcome, notwithstanding the odd Catholic humanist, Thomist, pantheist, or Deist here or there. But I don't know how we would prove this. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 10:51, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>I yield to this point, but note the intro to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">Rationalism</a>: yes, it's not identical with, or a subset of atheism, but it's a related stance, so that it is no marvel that most rationalists should be atheists.</li>
<li>I think it would be best to find a compromise. Right now, the intro addresses scientists, rationalists and humanists. Only the "scientists" claim is backed up by the article. I readily believe that percentage among the remaining groups is even higher, but if it's in the intro, it should be elaborated upon in the article.</li>
<li>again, granted for "scientists", not the case for rationalists or humanists.</li>
</ol>
<p>it's a small thing, either remove the rationalists/humanists from the intro, or mention them in the article. I have no problem with the statement, I am "arguing for the enemy", acknowledging that it is not backed up water-tightly. Edit conflict, agree with BM. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:57, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Fair enough; I'll Google, and contact a couple of Humanist organisations to see if they can provide citations. In line with Wikipedia guidance on NPoV, though — is there anyone who genuinely questions the claim that most rationalists and humanists are atheists? If so, on what grounds? I mean, it's easy to question anything for the sake of disruption, but is there any ground for such questioning here?

<dd>arguing from a theist pov, I wouldn't contest it as being incorrect, but as being suggestive of "everybody with any sense was an atheist" while being carefully crafted to include the specific groups with atheist leanings. again, I would advocate a compromise wording, such as "widespread among...". <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:29, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'd be fine w that. The problem w all this is that "rationalist" and "humanist" are terms which <i>can</i> apply to people and concepts which may not be readilly identified with them. Wouldn't any charity be humanist? Wouldn't any sensible, logical position be rationalist? I agree that the overwhelming % of people who self identify w these labels are at least weak atheists. Scientists I reject, and if you look into it there is no good evidence that the amazingly broad international community of "scientists" is atheistic to any l;arge degree.

<p>I originally started this section asking about the last sentence of the intro, the claim of prevalance of atheism among scientists, humanists, and rationalists. Someone then mentioned a source for the claim about early 20th-century scientists. (Although I was not able to find it.) As for humanists and rationalists, we seem to be in stark disagreement about the very nature of the statement. I propose that we take rationalists and humanists out of the statement, because it's a little odd to lump a group defined by philosophical positions along with a group defined by an occupation, in expressing a statistic; and because there's no source, and certainly no semblence of agreement. I also propose that the statement be moved into the main article, under the statistics section, with a documented source. Does anyone have a reason not to do these things? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelScarano_58ed.html" title="User:SamuelScarano">SamuelScarano</a> 00:37, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also think the humanists and rationalists statement is a bit odd, given that rationalists are more or less defined by their aetheism (not entirely, of course), and humanists similarly (again, not entirely).

<dd>I've heard similar reports. I think there was a study showing increase of theistic belief in Switzerland, some 79% say they believe in God. The point is that the people responsible for this increase believe in whatever they chose. It has finally become acceptable to build your own religion as you go along. An appalling number of people who self-describe as Christians <i>also</i> claim to believe in reincarnation, unaware, or uninterested in the fact that reincarnation would completely defeat the point of Christianity. It's all about a fuzzy feeling you get when you think of "God" when you feel bad, but the big change is that people actually think it is okay that this should be all religion is about. I'll see if I can dig up some numbers. If we're so much into showing how atheism gained ground during the 20th century, it's only fair to show how it seems to be losing some, recently. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 17:31, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>The article states that Antony Flew has "embraced the intelligent design concept of scholars such as William Dembski". I don't think there's any truth to this because 1) I'm in constant contact with a professional philosopher who is a close friend of Flew's, and 2) Antony Flew believes in Aristotle's God which is quite different from the Christian God and from Dembski's "intelligent design" — Flew is still an atheist, although theists like to spin a different tale because they (i.e., those who spin these tales) are practically ignorant of any more philosophy than what they can see. Flew was initially impressed with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Swinburne_28fa.html" title="Richard Swinburne">Richard Swinburne</a>'s cosmological fine tuning argument, and Tony worried about hellfire for a few years, but he recently confessed in private that he believed only in Aristotle's God who had no interest in or even knowledge of the sublunary sphere. Aristotle thought that there are some things of which it is more perfect to be ignorant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of factual errors in that article aside from misinformation about Flew. For instance, there is no central authority on atheism.

"We must follow the argument wherever it leads," he said. "I've never thought I knew that there was no God. I merely thought there is no sufficient reason that there is."</dd>

<dd>Scientific evidence also now leads him to believe in an disinterested god like that which Aristotle or Thomas Jefferson spoke of, he said. Yet, when asked whether or not he has kept up with the most recent science and theology, Flew responded: "Certainly not."</dd>

<dd>I think the most we can say with any certainty of Flew at this time is that he may be a little muddled --or at eighty-something, dotty. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 23:11, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Characterizing a "change of mind" as "muddled", "dotty", or "flip-flopping" is hardly reasonable. Kerry was criticized throughout his campaign for demonstrating he is capable of learning and adapting to evidence new to his knowledge of things. I can't respect those latter comments about Flew's mental health, Felonious. More to the point, Richard Carrier's opinions on atheism (and theism) and on Tony are woefully inadequate of objectivity to be considered scientific (i.e. informed), or even aspiring to that degree of strength.</dd>

<dd>Richard Carrier writes, "Flew has thus abandoned the very standards of inquiry that led the rest of us to atheism."
<dl>
<dd>To that I reply, "Neither inquiry nor standards of inquiry led me to atheism. I was born without theistic beliefs and have since remained without theistic beliefs. I do not follow. I lead."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Carrier also writes, "It would seem the only way to God is to jettison responsible scholarship."
<dl>
<dd>How biased, although unsurprising considering that Carrier is a "positive" atheist, that he would claim that all theists are unscholarly. Interestingly, a history of philosophy and science would reveal many theistic scholars that have made enormous contributions to their respective fields of study. In fact, I think, the term "scholar" was originally reserved for holy scribes and other "men of God". <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 00:32, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
