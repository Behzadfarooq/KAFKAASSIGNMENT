<p>He's fifteen. SEED ends on 9/27/71. He was born on 10/29/55. As far as I can tell, that would make him fifteen despite official sources liking to round ages up in the series. Calaschysm 12:21, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He's supposed to be older than Kira and Cagalli, and if he was born on the 29 of October and they were born in May, then one must assume that he was born in 54 C.E. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.130.html" title="User:64.12.116.130">64.12.116.130</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.130.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.130_2629.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.130">contribs</a>) 13:53, 15 May 2006 UTC.</small></p>

<p>Sorry, it's just that I've been led to believe that Athrun is older than Kira and Cagalli, and if they were born in May C.E. 55, then Athrun must have been born on October 29 C.E. 54, which would make him 16 in Gundam Seed and 18 in Gundam Seed Destiny.</p>
<p>He ACTS older than the two of them, that doesn't make him older in actual age. Please stop messing with this section unless you can provide a good, verifiable source for your info. --71.12.221.109 03:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The CE character articles have been getting messy lately, especially this one. Look at the size of quotes, notable dialogue and trivia. I say a cut down is in order. Specifically, who is it who's deciding this is 'notable dialogue' for this and other entries? --HellCat86 21:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I concur, some of this stuff (like Athrun saying his launch phrase with Dearka, Kira, Cagalli, and Mu was not at all special, I wasn't exactly moved by his threats to bring the disabled Kira back to his carrier either) just isn't memorable or is not worth mentioning. Hence why I removed the examples I cited. --71.12.221.109 02:46, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be honest, alot of these edits seem to be coming from someone who seems to want to push certain pairings. Over on the Miriallia entry, someone kept adding what was basically a generic bit of dialogue where Miriallia wishes Dearka good luck. Specifically for Athrun, I don't think every dramatic scene needs to be quoted. Something like the scene where he admits he 'killed' Kira should, since that's important. It's where he spells out his motives and where Cagalli gives him the words that start changing his mind. --HellCat86 08:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, done some more clean up. A few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destiny officially retconned that the ZAFT special forces were always called FAITH, so I've edited that piece of trivia to better reflect that.</li>
<li>Again, this is a general problem with the CE entries- voice actor trivia. The fact is, there are several big name anime VAs in Japan who will often work togethor. At the moment it feels like people are trying to make any occassion of that happening in SEED/Destiny look like some inside joke when it's probably just coincidence. I've kept the current mentions since they seemed relevant but I think this is starting to venture into trivia better mentioned in the entries for the actual actors themselves, not the pages of characters they've voiced. --HellCat86 02:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Edited to make verb tenses more consistant. Do we need this much detail on some of the battles and do we need the trivia at all?</p>
<p>Deleting most if not all of the trivia wouldn't bother me. A lot of the CE character trivia is really pointless and/or opinion. Calaschysm 03:42, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, went to work on the trivia. Axed the bit on love interests pointing pistols at each other - there's too many examples of major cast members pointing pistols at each other for this to mean anything. Also axed references to voice actors appearing together in other shows. If it needs to be listed, it should be under the appropriate VA's, not here. Axed the reference to the Libyan city, Al Athrun; there's no evidence that the city, if it exists, has anything to do with the character's name. The trivia related to the Infinite Justice mobile suit belongs on that page, not this. Most of the rest should probably be melded into the rest of the atricle or axed.</li>

<p>Can someone confirm that the sketches in the intro section are NOT done by Ogasawara Tomofumi? He's the only illustrator credited in the novel; there is no mention of Hirai Hisashi. --Yezhanquan</p>
<ul>
<li>I looked at the my copy of the second novel before I made the change. Basically, the character art at the start of the book is from model sheets Hirai did. The actual full page art seen in the rest of the book is by Tomofumi --HellCat86 03:26, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Until we are told or shown otherwise as of <b>Final Plus</b> Meyrin is still a <i>possible</i> love interest. I see no reason why people keep editing her out as that. If you have solid evidence that she is not a possible love interest, please show it. Otherwise I think it should stay as it is.</p>
<p>I will also support this claim based off facts rather than other users personal beliefs as there is no solid evidence yet as to why Meyrin <b>isn't</b> Athruns love interest. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 21:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although some people think Athrun and Meyrin could be a couple,most likely Athrun thinks their relationship as just friends because he did not show any signs of love affection to Meyrin and he still loves Cagalli.</p>
<p>Some people think it should be Athrun and Cagalli others think it should be Athrun and Meyrin.We don't know who Athrun will end up with,maybe the recently annonced movie will tell us. One question:Which relationship is more reasonable?Athrun and Cagalli or Athrun and Meyrin?</p>
<p>Most likely you don't know what Athrun thinks. We aren't debating that. Again, this isn't about what you personally feel, but what is shown in the anime. That is Athrun and Cagalli parting ways, and Athrun and Meyrin <b>walking away together at the end of the last canon piece of anime in the timeline</b>. That makes her a <b>possible</b> love interest. As for more reasonable at this point, that would be Athrun and Meyrin since it's the last thing shown to us. Though there is nothing declaring Athrun's love for either girl, so it should stay as it is. Hiatus and possible one-sided. The other notes (on her side) are not needed. It's obvious what one sided means.</p>
<p>I happen to agree with this comment as it is also the goal that I am striving for since I am getting tired of this endless conflict debate and had the invisible note added to help reduce the conflict as much as possible. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 23:54, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One other thing is if there is ever a discussion to decide if this is canon or not to the official storyline then I will participate in that as well. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 23:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>hhmmmmm...i guess you could be right,but we will have to see what will happen.</p>
<p>I agree. Though it still gets edited out and the same with the Cagalli portion as well. It's fine as it is, possible on her side is fine as well.</p>
<p>Not to you, but there is also no reason to be nit picky about details either (walking behind versus accompanying) unless you are going to go back and mention the placement of every pair in relation to how they walked.</p>
<p><br />
We have to keep this as neutral as possible,so there should be no one the sides of asucaga or asumey</p>

Morosawa (Fukuda's wife) said in her interview that Meyrin wasn't that one who can sweeten, comfort or heal Athrun, in the actual April 2006 Animage magazine. Meyrin was in GSD because Morosawa said she didn't want GSD to be over-crowded with strong-type females. She also said that Athrun doesn't have any romantic feelings for Meyrin, and that he is not a changeable man, which means he still holds strong love to Cagalli. The ending of GSD was the beginning of Athrun and Cagalli's relationship, therefore Morosawa did not intentionally tear them apart or break them up. So AthrunxCagalli fans, get your hopes high&#160;! Veeh4anime 10:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have heard a variety of claims about what Ms. Morosawa and/or Mr. Fukuda have said in various alleged interviews. The closest to evidence I've found is Google caches of alleged translations of unknown accuracy that link to supposed orginal sites that no longer exist. Some of those claims were interpreted as Ms. Morisawa favoring a match with Meyrin and discounting that there was ever anything between Athrun and Cagalli, which led to vocal vilification of Ms. Morisawa by some fans. Have you got any linkage that will help neutral observers separate your comments and opinions from the article's content and help them assess the accuracy of the translation of Ms. Morisawa's remarks? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward321_0e26.html" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> 05:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
