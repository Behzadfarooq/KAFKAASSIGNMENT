Use of a <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_symbol.html" title="No symbol">no symbol</a> typically indicates opposition to or intolerance for something, not mere <i>absence</i> or <i>rejection</i> of it, which is how most atheists prefer to characterize their views.

<p>Silence, I see you revised my edit. You seem to be confusing Atheism with Agnosticism or possibly some flavor of New Age philosophy.</p>
<p>What makes you think that an Atheist can be religious, much less "spiritual"&#160;? They are nowhere similar. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeC_3d6e.html" title="User:GeorgeC">GeorgeC</a> 00:17, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Religion is about a community of people who believe in a common idea, and who come together to strengthen and discuss their beliefs. It doesn't necessarily have to deal with a spiritual belief. Likewise, it is possible for one to not believe in an almighty god(s), but still believe that there is an afterlife, or that there are higher states that people can achieve in life or death. I don't agree with them, though, but they're free to believe what they want. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-04-1 00:33</small></li>

<li><i>"They are nowhere similar."</i> - Neither is having blond hair and being a vegetarian, yet there are vegetarians who have blond hair.

<li><i>"It doesn't necessarily have to deal with a spiritual belief."</i> - Bullshit. There's your New Age philosophy, GeorgeC; you missed your mark dramatically.</li>
<li><i>"it is possible for one to not believe in an almighty god(s), but still believe that there is an afterlife, or that there are higher states that people can achieve in life or death."</i> - That's more sensible.

<li>I get the point. I think you're wrong. What you described is <i>not</i> Atheism. You're using strawman arguments.

<li>Very much so, Brian; GeorgeC couldn't be more wrong, and only <i>he</i> has thus far used strawmen here (by incorrectly characterizing the correct definitions of atheism as "New Age", when they're just the opposite). Clearly there is a Western-centric bias confusing his understanding of the broader meaning of "atheism"; there is a rich and long-standing atheistic tradition in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, for example (though there are certainly also theistic Buddhists; <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_religion.html" title="Eastern religion">Eastern religions</a> tend to be less black-and-white on such issues), and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animism.html" title="Animism">animistic</a> <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a> reverence is certainly not inherently theistic, by any but the loosest and least meaningful uses of the terms <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deity</a></i>. Either you have a remarkable lack of cultural awareness, or you are using an unsustainably obscure definition of <i>atheism</i>. Your shocking disrespect for any but <i>your</i> definition of atheism is completely unacceptable; atheism is a heavily disputed and nuanced term, and <i>all</i> common definitions for it must be permitted for the use of Wikipedians in this category, not just the specific one you personally happen to favor. Not every person with spiritual, mystical, or religious beliefs has a theocentric, or even theistic at all, world-view; that's not New Age nonsense (which I despise), that's just a fact. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:41, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have no disrespect for other definitions of Atheism or what other people think it is. It's my opinion that one cannot be either spiritual or religious and an Atheist at the same time. I define Atheism as: "lack of belief in the existence of omnipotent, omniscient deities and the rejection of unsupported claims of such." "Cultural awareness" is irrelevant. However, I will concede that Buddhism (and possibly Animism) fits the model of Atheism. The "supernatural" is a catch-all phrase; sheer speculation concerning events for which there is no scientific explanation. And just as you accuse Atheism as being a "heavily disputed and nuanced term," the same can also be said, even more so, of "spiritualism." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeC_3d6e.html" title="User:GeorgeC">GeorgeC</a> 09:00, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>"It's my opinion that one cannot be either spiritual or religious and an Atheist at the same time."</i> - And I'm sure that you aren't alone in that opinion, but since you're in the minority, you shouldn't expect this category to conform to your views—especially when you haven't substantiated them with evidence, reasoning, references, etc. so we can discern its reliability.</li>
<li><i>"The 'supernatural' is a catch-all phrase; sheer speculation concerning events for which there is no scientific explanation."</i> - Sort of. Almost. Not quite. Not all speculation is supernatural, and, as can be shown by modern belief in the supernatural, a <i>huge</i>, <i>massive</i> supply of supernatural beliefs persist and flourish even where there <i>are</i> scientific explanations. You'll have to dig a bit deeper for a more accurate definition of "supernatural". It has more to do with belief in the existence of forces beyond the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_world.html" title="Natural world">natural world</a> (which is a contradiction in terms, of course) than with whether or not the beliefs are scientifically verified or verifiable.</li>
<li><i>"the same can also be said, even more so, of 'spiritualism.'"</i> - I agree entirely. Why do you think that <a href="../../../s/p/i/Category%7ESpiritual_Wikipedians_fcc8.html" title="Category:Spiritual Wikipedians">Category:Spiritual Wikipedians</a> is even more vague and general than this category? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>GeorgeC, while that is your opinion, you have not backed it up with reliable sources, nor could you ever, I suspect. I don't understand the need to state your belief, either. Wikipedia is not supposed to be written based on the opinions of its members, but on the opinions of reliable sources. So, even stating your religious belief/non-belief on a talk page (unless it's the User talk page) shows a failure at neutrally conveying the opinions of reliable sources. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-04-3 18:21</small>

<dd>A sub-category for non-spiritual atheists is unnecessary for the same reason that a sub-category for spiritual atheists is. Spiritual atheists should simply put themselves in both <a href="../../../a/t/h/Category%7EAtheist_Wikipedians_c5f1.html" title="Category:Atheist Wikipedians">Category:Atheist Wikipedians</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Category%7ESpiritual_Wikipedians_fcc8.html" title="Category:Spiritual Wikipedians">Category:Spiritual Wikipedians</a>; in the same way, non-spiritual atheists should simply put themselves in both <a href="../../../a/t/h/Category%7EAtheist_Wikipedians_c5f1.html" title="Category:Atheist Wikipedians">Category:Atheist Wikipedians</a> and make a new category, Category:Non-spiritual Wikipedians. An alternative, if your main intent is to show that you reject all forms of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> more so than that you reject <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a> alone, is to make a subcategory of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_by_philosophy_ffd8.html" title="Category:Wikipedians by philosophy">Category:Wikipedians by philosophy</a> for Category:Naturalist Wikipedians, since naturalism is the philosophy that the supernatural does not exist, which includes both deities and other religious entities (like the soul). On the other hand, if you want to show that you are non-religious, we already have a category for that (though it doesn't necessarily preclude being spiritual): <a href="../../../i/r/r/Category%7EIrreligious_Wikipedians_c090.html" title="Category:Irreligious Wikipedians">Category:Irreligious Wikipedians</a>.</dd>
<dd>Also, Philo's userbox has absolutely nothing to do with Xiner's request. Xiner requested a userbox for non-spiritual, non-religious people. He did not request a userbox for people who are certain that God does not exist; you can be a strong atheist and still be religious (heck, if you're talking about the Christian God, you could still be a Jew or Hindu or Scientologist while being a strong atheist!), and you can certainly still be a strong atheist while still being spiritual (see <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Harris_%28author%29_3eaa.html" title="Sam Harris (author)">Sam Harris (author)</a>, for example).</dd>
<dd>Also, you might want to keep in mind, Philo, most strong atheists would consider your userbox to be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> of their views. Most strong atheists do not claim that deities are <i>impossible</i>, only that they are unlikely enough to warrant positive disbelief (rather than merely the absence of belief). I would advise renaming the userbox from "strong atheist" to "closed atheist" or "gnostic atheist", since those are more accepted terms for denoting people who reject even the possibility of being wrong; a "strong atheist" is someone who believes that no God exists, not necessarily someone who believes that no God <i>can</i> exist. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Huh? What's that got to do with atheism? If anything it seems like a deeply theist image to me. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 14:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many atheists do use that as a symbol, I've seen them do so. I think the message is "this image shows the Universe as vast and fascinating on its own without God" as the image does not contain a representation of God. (Unless you take the Pantheistic or Panentheist position that the Universe is God or is a conscious being equivalent to God or is just inherently a representation of God) Not being an atheist myself I don't really get that, I mean an image of a beautiful unoccupied house doesn't mean houses are better off without people or that no one owns it or whatever, but I've seen it.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>This category has itself as a subcategory. I think that this should be changed. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPropower_3a16.html" title="User:Propower">Propower</a> 06:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
