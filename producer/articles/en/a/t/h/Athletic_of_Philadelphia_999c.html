<p>Philadelphia "had been a baseball town from the earliest days of the game", fielding amateur teams since at least the early 1830s. In 1860 James N. Kerns formed a club, simply named "Athletic Base Ball Club", that soon dominated amateur play in the area (Jordan 1999). <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper%27s_Weekly_489d.html" title="Harper's Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a> chronicled a match between Athletic and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Atlantics_c78f.html" title="Brooklyn Atlantics">Atlantic of Brooklyn</a> for the baseball championship in 1866. A famous Harper's illustration shows the Athletic players in uniforms with the familiar Old English "A" on front.</p>

<p>The simply named <b>Athletic Base Ball Club</b> was established in 1860. When newspapers developed stand-alone game scores and league standings, the club was termed <i>Athletic</i> (<i>Base Ball Club</i> being dropped in any case). In prose the team was commonly called <i>the Athletics</i>, plural, and later generations have usually called both club and team the "Philadelphia Athletics". <i>Athletic of Philadelphia</i> is a compromise that contemporary readers would understand as an abbreviation for something like <i>Athletic Base Ball Club, of Philadelphia</i> in distinction from clubs of the same name in other cities.</p>

<p>Athletic turned professional in the late 1860s and helped establish the first league, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players_3eed.html" title="National Association of Professional Base Ball Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a> (NA), which began play in 1871. It played home games at <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Street_Grounds_662b.html" title="Jefferson Street Grounds">Jefferson Street Grounds</a> at least until expulsion from the major leagues in 1876.</p>
<p>The Athletics were one of the successful National Association teams, winning the first pennant with a record of 21 wins and 7 losses (.750), two games ahead of the Boston Red Stockings and Chicago White Stockings.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> While Boston dominated the NA, winning the other four pennants, Athletic and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mutuals_1744.html" title="New York Mutuals">Mutual (of New York)</a> also fielded teams every year, Athletic winning a few more games overall but never challenging Boston.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dick McBride served as regular pitcher for more than a decade and as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> throughout the NA seasons, which gets him <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager_%28baseball%29.html" title="Manager (baseball)">manager</a> credit today.

<p>During the summer of 1875, Chicago moved decisively to improve its team by recruiting six western stars then playing in Boston and Philadelphia. Four Red Stockings and Anson would play for Chicago in 1876, Ezra Sutton remaining in Philadelphia for the Athletics final season.</p>
<p>Chicago's <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hulbert_a92b.html" title="William Hulbert">William Hulbert</a>, assisted by player <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Spalding_3aab.html" title="Albert Spalding">Albert Spalding</a> and sportwriter Lewis Meacham, moved at the same time to organize a new league. Hulbert recruited first St. Louis (NA), then two independent clubs from Louisville (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville_Grays_10df.html" title="Louisville Grays">Grays</a>) and Cincinnati, and finally four eastern clubs: Athletic, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mutuals_1744.html" title="New York Mutuals">Mutual</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartford_Dark_Blues_82b5.html" title="Hartford Dark Blues">Hartford</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Boston</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After fifteen years as a strong and stable club, Athletic fared poorly in the new <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs</a>, finishing seventh with 14 wins in 60 games, 38 wins behind Chicago. Near the end, the financially-troubled team refused to make a western road trip, shutting down with 35 games played at home, 25 away.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Mutual of New York also refused, owing the western teams nine home games. Both clubs were expelled from the National League, which simply contracted from eight to six for the 1877 season.</p>

Another strong batter on the team was third baseman <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levi_Meyerle_8cac.html" title="Levi Meyerle">Levi Meyerle</a>, who hit .340.

<p>Source for season records: Wright (2000) has published records for dozens of NABBP teams each season, relying on a mix of game and season records in contemporary newspapers and guides. Dozens of leading clubs by number of matches are included, as are many others. The records do not consistently cover either all games played or all championship matches between NABBP members.</p>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> But the race was much closer. The primary official criterion was neither games nor winning percentage but wins and the three clubs finished in the order given with 21, 20, and 19 wins. The final game played, Chicago at Athletic, was decisive only because the Athletics won it --and by a particular treatment of forfeit games.</li>
<li id="_note-1"><b><a href="#_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> Except for Mutual in 1874, shorter lived clubs finished second. Judged by winning percentage, a later criterion, Athletic in 1875 achieved the sixth best season in NA history behind only the five pennant winners. But the criterion was wins, an incentive for clubs to complete their series. In the five NA seasons Athletic ranked 6-4-6-6-3 in games played, 1-4-5-3-3 in wins. --And the club ranked terminally 7 in games played for 1876.</li>
<li id="_note-2"><b><a href="#_ref-2" title="">^</a></b> Three NA clubs still in business were excluded: Philadelphia (White Stockings or Phillies), Atlantic (of Brooklyn), and Elm City (of New Haven). The Athletics and Mutuals were selected rather than the Phillies and Atlantics, as the NL granted exclusive territories to all member clubs. New Haven was too small a city and the club had declined to travel West in 1875, playing only three home games apiece with Chicago and St. Louis. One wonders whether other criteria would have been imposed to support the neat eight clubs, four West and four East, but that is for thought experiments.</li>
<li id="_note-3"><b><a href="#_ref-3" title="">^</a></b> Athletic "owed" each of the four western teams two games at its home ballpark, having played only three each. It played only three games in New York, and Mutual played only four in Philadelphia, another symptom of mutual athletic decline. But the League would not have expelled two clubs for shirking on their visits to each other.</li>
