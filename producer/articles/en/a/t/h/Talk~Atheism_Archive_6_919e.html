<dd>Avowed atheists were few and far between at the time when burnings, hangings torture, etc. were carried out. However for an example of someone who, while probably not an atheist, was hanged for statements which implied disbelief in Scripture see the case of Thomas Aitkenhead. This makes you realise why atheists, by-and-large, tended to keep their opinions to themselves before the scientific revolution made their views more acceptable, believing, no doubt, that discretion was the better part of valour. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<p>Your comment interests me, but I don't see you saying that this passage can be verified. Indeed, I don't hear you disagreeing with me that their essentially <b>were no</b> atheists at that time. IMO Neitzche was the father of atheism, along w others in the 19th century (deism was a yet another culprit). I would like to have the origins of atheism explored in this article, a section relating to criticism, and really an over all fleshing out of this article (I think I'll focus on my strength, helping provide the criticism section). With so many of you guys around, I would think you'd have more to say about your faith (or lack thereof&#160;;). How about mentions of atheist charitable organizations, or think tanks, or whatever it is you guys do as a ... group? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 05:43, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt that the passage can be directly verified. The reasons being that the majority of atheists, myself included, will quite happily pretend to be devout believers if it keeps us out of jail, off the rack, etc. Thus atheist lack of interest in God tends to protect us by making us invisible. But the maltreatment of heretics, who can't generally hide to the same extent, because they care too much about God and their beliefs, clearly shows how severely even non-believers in minor points of doctrine were punished for their beliefs. That can certainly be verified. It's difficult to imagine that someone who did not believe in a major point of doctrine like the existence of God would be treated more leniently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt that many atheists have read Neitsche so I'm not sure why you think of him as the father of atheism. Most of us have probably come to our own conclusions without any help from mad, misunderstood Germans and as for us as a group -- well -- er -- probably most of us don't care enough to form a group. Of course as always there are exceptions, and no doubt that's why various Rational Humanist and Secular Humanist groups have been formed. If you're looking for atheist think tanks, you should be able to find rightwing and leftwing flavours since I suppose both Objectivist and Socialist think tanks should count.</dd>

<dd>well, I ment in terms of a founding father, but then I had no idea there were atheists so long before him, in the 1600's and so forth as Snoyes links show. Anyways, he should be mentioned here, as his "God is dead" statement certainly influenced modern atheistic thought (if not inspiring all of atheism, as I had previously suspected). p.s. I would be quite happy to see you help in fleshing this article out! <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:32, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not true at all. Nietzsche says it more than once in "The Gay Science." Book III, 108 says "New Struggles. After Buddha was dead people showed his shadow for centuries afterwards in a cave - an immense frightful shadow. God is dead: but as the human race is constituted, there will perhaps be caves for millenniums yet, in which people will show his shadow. And we - we have still to overcome his shadow!" 125 is probably the more common citation, where the madman is speaking: "God is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him! ... Is not the magnitude of this deed too great for us? Shall we not ourselves have to become Gods, merely to seem worthy of it? There never was a greater event - and on account of it, all who are born after us belong to a higher history than any history hitherto!" <a href="http://www.publicappeal.org/library/nietzsche/Nietzsche_the_gay_science/the_gay_science.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.publicappeal.org/library/nietzsche/Nietzsche_the_gay_science/the_gay_science.htm" rel="nofollow">Source</a> The idea is that the shared belief in god was fading, and that something was needed to replace it; Nietzsche sought to do just that. I really have no idea where your purported quote comes from, but I could find nothing of it online, and I wonder what your motive might be in listing it here. My guess would be that it has something to do with your faith, but such speculation is not fair to you, just as your erroneous quote is unfair to Nietzsche and those interested in learning about his philosophies. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavin_1d1a.html" title="User:Davin">Davin</a> 22:34, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yup, atheism has been around longer than Buddhism, Christianity or Islam. Some of the Greek philosophers were atheist in 300BC and before, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagoras.html" title="Diagoras">Diagoras</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">Democritus</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaxagoras.html" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> to name but three.

<p>Capital-g god is impermissible, period. I am astonished at the disingenuity of claiming that this is not a reference to a specific deity - and one whose worshippers currently exhibit a great deal of intolerance towards atheists in the Western world.</p>
<p>The only objector in evidence to the distinguishing of strong vs weak atheism is one particular person who has been going to great lengths to edit this article so as to marginalize atheism and atheists, and to shove their particular brand of theism down throats.</p>
<p>For persecution of atheists, see the murder of Aitkenhead. For a modern example, look at the treatment <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair_b35f.html" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a> got.</p>

<p>Um.. he wasn't atheist. And she was protested against and so forth... where are these burnings at the stake, or other such fearful persecutions? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 05:54, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't find much on this aitkenhead at all. And by US legal terms, since his death was legally carried out it wasn't murder. That was the law at that time and place. I thought you atheists were moral/cultural relativists? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 05:59, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I thought that you believers in God were Muslims. Looks like we were both wrong&#160;:-) For information on Aitkenhead's case see <i>How the Scots Invented the Modern World</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-609-80999-7</a>). As for Burnings at the Stake, they were legally carried out too. So they weren't murder either by US legal standards, merely legal penalties for crimes. Most people would still think of them as persecution though. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<p>Calvin's Geneva was indeed rather repressive. It is true that Calvin and his followers burned far more theists that had rather different views from theirs than they did atheists. But they certainly did persecute atheists:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Calvin strongly squelched religious objections, too. The magistrates executed Jacques Gruet in 1547 for blasphemy and atheism. Gruet owned "immoral books" and often showed indiscretion in his speech. He often expressed his opinions openlyj and often criticized Calvin and the magistrates. Pierre Amio refused to attend church or adopt prevailing standards of dress. Calvin imprisoned him for his rebellion.</i>" <a href="http://www.christianchronicler.com/history1/reform_in_french_switzerland.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianchronicler.com/history1/reform_in_french_switzerland.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (section 3)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Two manuscripts by John Calvin bear witness to the dramatic story of the Protestant Reform in the State of Geneva during the 16th century. In one of them, Calvin justifies, eloquently and at considerable length, the first death sentence that he ordered and obtained in 1547 for Jacques Gruet, the author of a famous breviary of atheism Des trois imposteurs (estimated 50, 000/80, 000 euros). No autograph manuscript by Calvin of such importance has been sold at auction in the last 25 years.</i>" <a href="http://www.shareholder.com/bid/news/20030603-110529.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shareholder.com/bid/news/20030603-110529.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (section: "John Calvin")</dd>

<p>So not only did atheists exist, but they were persecuted even by reformers like Calvin. - <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 06:17, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is littered with capital-G God references again! Didn't we just come to a compromise agreement a few hours ago to use "deity" instead of "god" so the issue wouldn't be a problem any more?

<dd>Not even slightly good enough. After weeks of arguing against using capital-G god, we finally come to some semblance of an agreement on a compromise, and then you immediately go and blank the talk: page off to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_Archive_5_a75b.html" title="Talk:Atheism/Archive 5">Archive 5: January 2004</a> and stick capital-G God all over the article again.

<p>Your opposition to citation ... angers me. If you cannot accept the facts when they are presented to you (rant deleted by author) you are incapable of editing an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 03:24, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not an opposition to citation, but rather to the format. External links should go in the external links section, by and large, and when there's a term within the article itself that needs clarification you should link to a Wikipedia article to do that. How many other Wikipedia articles are there that have external dictionary links in their definition? Anyway, your citations are not particularly good, especially not in terms of supporting your particular argument here. For example, take a look at your theism definition link <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theism" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theism" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>; the very first line is "Belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in a personal God as creator and ruler of the world." Doesn't that contradict your previous assertions that God is not a god?

<p>The normal thing to do in situations like this is to try to find a compromise. For example: We can use the capitalized <i>God</i> in quotations and the lower case <i>god</i> in our text. We can elaborate on the problem by phrasing it differently, e.g. "one absolute God, a god, or many gods". We can try to substitute the remaining God/god uses with a different term. Please experiment with these solutions, and try to accommodate each other's viewpoint. If you both leave this article, I will simply remove the NPOV dispute header as I consider this a minor issue.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">‚ÄîEloquence</a> 08:20, Jan 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of those sound like good options to me.

<p>Yes, the same soloution should be applied consistantly thruout. And I am VERY dubious of either Bryan or myself making necessary changes, but I guess we'll see.

<p>I came here by following the link on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia: requests for comment</a> asking for comments on capitalization of god. There was no date, so forgive me if this has been dealt with already.</p>
<p>I looked over the archives and have this to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Greek word <i>theos</i> does, as someone posted, mean a god (any god). However, <i>O Theos</i> (<i>o</i> means something like "the" or "he") means God (the god of Christianity).</li>
<li>god, uncapitalised, means any god -- the god of the wind, the god of fire, etc. God, capitalised, refers to the Christian god.</li>
<li>When trying to decide a definition for atheism, it's useful to look up its opposite: theism. Merriam Webster defines theism as</li>
</ul>
<p>"belief in the existence of a god or gods; specifically&#160;: belief in the existence of one God viewed as the creative source of man and the world who transcends yet is immanent in the world." Interstingly, it defines atheism as "1 archaic&#160;: UNGODLINESS, WICKEDNESS 2 a&#160;: a disbelief in the existence of deity b&#160;: the doctrine that there is no deity."</p>
<ul>
<li>really, the definition of atheist seems to rely on context. In discussions of Christianity, to profess atheism is to deny belief in God. Generally, to be an atheist is to not believe in gods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dunno if that helps or says anything new...</p>

<p><i>Santa Claus</i> would be capitalized even though it describes a fictional character. Of course the spanish (latin?) <i>santa</i> would not be capitalized unless used in the context of a proper name of a real or imagined person. The name of the Christian deity would be capitalized because they believe in the personal agency of their god. Christians beleive there is only one god, and they call him God. To write about <i>the one God</i> would be to affirm the Christian belief that their God is the only god, unless in the context of saying <i>the one God of Christian faith.</i> There is an abundance of ways around this conflict, including use of the term "deity" (already done) and coupling reference to Christian faith with any reference to the proper noun <i>God</i>. If parties can't work this out along those lines, maybe I'll come back and sort through the article's references to dieties, but i'd rather not need to bother.

<dd>I placed a link to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalek.html" title="Amalek">amalek</a> in this regard, to express the severity of sentiment against atheism, and some explanation/articulation of it. This was roundly disaproved of, and so I have since refrained from seeking sources citing persons objecting to atheism, but rather focus on promoting factual accuracy (which has gone profoundly badly as anyone with time or interest can easilly asess. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 02:59, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I replaced the link to Amalek with a reference to II Thessalonians in the Bible, which talks about destruction of those who persecute Christians. Actually this isn't strictly a denunciation of unbelievers, but it was the best I could find. The story of Amalek in the Bible (the way you had it worded) is not given in any sense as a denunciation of an unbeliever, although Jewish commentators have interpreted it that way. Thus it was factually incorrect to state that the story of Amalek in the Bible was an example of the Scripture of a particular faith denouncing an unbeliever. (The Jewish Rabbi writings might contain such denunciations, but the Scripture itself does not. Amalek isn't even identified as an unbeliever, per se. As a person, he's barely mentioned at all; most of what the Bible says about Amalek is about the nation of Amalek descended from him, and they are condemned because of actions they took as a nation, not because of the actions of Amalek.) It's actually surprisingly difficult to find a "denunciation of unbelievers" in Scripture; I'd like to find a better example than the one I used, but I can't think of one yet.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relationship between communism and atheism</span></h2>
<p>I feel that the relationship you made between communism and atheism is related to the cultural and historial context of the U.S.A. during the 20th century. I think it was built by several presidents that both rejected communism and held strong theistic beliefs, and it is (at least partially) artificial. I think you should look at this issue in a more international perspective, atheism existed long before communism and trascends it. It is like filling half of the roman catholicism article with references to facism.

<dd>I disagree. One of the prime tenants of Communism is that there is no authority higher than that of The State.

Certainly your statement is true in America, perhaps even in a good portion of the Western world, but I disagree that it is true everywhere. Regardless, is it the point of Wikipedia articles to attract all reasonable keywords, or is it the point to explain a specifically selected concept? <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 00:21, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am aware that this has been a difficult issue for the authors, and one you may have hoped had been laid to rest. At one stage I supported the use of ‚Äúdeities‚Äù. But the effect of adopting ‚Äúdeities‚Äù has been to assign the article to cybernetic limbo.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 19:24, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, the only reason I suggested switching to "deities" in the first place was because I thought it might end the edit war without leaving the article in a state where it was actually misleading; suboptimal, but acceptable for the short term. Not sure how to go about improving things from here, at least not without reigniting the edit war. Maybe tinkering will become less risky once that 3-revert rule is finally enacted. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:51, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Be wary of falsifying information in the midst of your tinkering, young jedi&#160;;) The "god" denied by every atheist I know is the one true <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, not some Zeus or other such lesser <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 02:55, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps this is because your own background is so strongly associated with that particular god? After all, you admit your only sample group is the athiests that <i>you</i> know. It's not clear to me that you have done any sort of assessment of athiests around the world. Certainly atheists in India are known for not believing in Krishna, and atheists in Egypt are known for not believing in Allah, etc. Fact is, though, even those athiests whom you define in the terms of your own religious beliefs do also reject the existence of any other alleged deity you can reference. (In fact, it seems clear to me, that you would agree with athiests on the status of 99% of the world's declared deities -- all except for one!) <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 00:21, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're only referring to a <i>subset</i> of atheists with this description. This is the exact same dispute that we've had from the very beginning. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:25, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your right, and thats the prob. w specifying any one diety. But if you want to get alot of links (like banno seems to want) you'll have to focus on that subset (IMO the clear majority) of atheists. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 05:10, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And now we're right back to the issue of whether "god" with a small G refers to <i>all</i> the things atheists lack belief in rather than one specific subset, as discussed on <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_Godvrs.god_poll_8d60.html" title="Talk:Atheism/Godvrs.god poll">Talk:Atheism/Godvrs.god poll</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:14, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you know my view, and that of those that agree with me, that the wiki should be compatible w other reference sources on this issue, and must be scrupulously accurate in its usage of capitalization on this most controversial of all issues, the matter of God. As banno himself has said, it isn't Zeus most atheists are focusing their denial on&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 05:20, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I have repeatedly tried to explain to you in the past atheism does not necessarily require <i>denial</i>. And Zeus is significant because someone who believed in Zeus wouldn't be an atheist.

<dd>It just occurred to me to actually reread the article and do an actual count. "God" appears 8 times, "god" appears 6 times, "deity" appears 8 times, and "deities" appears 1 time. Perhaps the akward wording isn't as bad as I'd feared, I can't find anything to point to and say "this sounds rough due to poor word choice" right now. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:36, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for providing the word counts. Are you guys aware that this article was featured in Metawiki&#160;? It had the honor of being featured as an article that undergo one of the <b>lamest edit wars ever</b>.

<dd>Yes. For example, one possible way you could have "a disbelief in all deities" would be to not believe ANYTHING. Some times when we say "I do not believe that" other people say, "Oh, you dont believe ANYTHING [that I tell you]!"</dd>

<dd>It seems that saying "disbelief in alll deities" would mean dieties are the ONLY things that you are sure do not exist. You are willing to entertain the possible existence of anything else, just not dieties. Saying "alll" prevents the possible reply "you dont believe anything."</dd>

<dd>But this is more restrictive than what atheism actually implies. Why can't an atheist disbelieve dieties, and <i>also</i> disbelieve unicorns, or Sasquatch, or flying saucers?

<dd>No, <i>athiesm</i> only refers to disbelief in deities. It does not refer to a disbelief in anything else. (Well... I was under the impression it also included disbelief in any cosmic forces, personified or otherwise [e.g. astrology], but that doesn't seem to be represented.) It is irrelevant to have to state, for example, that atheists do not believe in deities but <i>may</i> believe in unicorns, aliens, supply-side economics, etc. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 00:28, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that was my point. "Disbelief in all and only all deities" is not a correct definition of atheism specifically <i>because</i> it brings non-deities into the picture as well, when non-deities are actually irrelevant to atheism. Atheists don't have to disbelieve "only all deities." <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:36, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>New animals are still found on Earth, so it might make sense to wait and see if Sasquatch is found. There might be reasons why aliens try to hide from us and can do so because of advanced technology. It would not be very hard to use genetic engineering to make a unicorn. Anyhow, I think the real point is that some people may feel that deities are among the set of things least likely to exist and such atheists may prefer a stronger version of atheism that makes this clear. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 05:36, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
