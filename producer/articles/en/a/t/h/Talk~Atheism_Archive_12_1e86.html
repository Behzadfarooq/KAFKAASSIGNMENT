<dd>Knowing the history of this article and Talk page, <b>literally no progress in 10 months</b> due to obstructionism of one form or another, I can see why Adraeus proposes this method.

<dd>Shane: There is no "wiki model"; currently, our efforts are not organized and are thus ineffective at producing results. This article has suffered a failed dispute resolution, a failed attempt to acquire arbitration, and an indefinite protected status. Now is time to try something new, more professional, and more focused. By the way, research <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> because your "wiki model" is certainly not evolutionary. Also, research the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterfall_model.html" title="Waterfall model">waterfall model</a>, which is consistently used in product development successfully. I should know since providing <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branding.html" title="Branding">strategic branding</a> solutions is my business.

<dd>In my opinion, looking at the edit history, that's due to people getting into edit wars (sometimes over what really amounts to next to nothing) far too often. I think the only way to counter that is to be more, not less, liberal in assuming good faith, and letting things develop wiki style. Instead of edit warring when something disagreeable to someone appears on the page, how about we take a policy of leaving it alone for a while and seeing how it plays out in the long run?</dd>

<dd>Putting the emotional and distinctly unsavory tone aside for a moment. If you want to change the Wikipedia MO I suspect you would have a better chance motivating for this at a Meta level or possibly starting a proof of concept afresh with another article on a different topic rather than doing so on an existing article in the middle of a dispute. Your model requires a collaborative team and an appointed or de-facto co-ordinator. Such a model has been used to develop the topic of Buddhism in Wikipedia but not with the detailed Project plan approach that you propose which I think simply unrealistic. Regardless I for one would not accept you as the co-ordinator or project manager, simply because of your confrontational tone--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 08:14, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia M.O.? M.O.? What M.O.? There is no M.O. Your critique is unsubstantiated; thus, irrelevant. You believe that projects shouldn't be organized. Without organization, <b>nothing will result from this discussion.</b> FeloniousMonk made the problem clear, there has been <b>literally no progress in 10 months</b>. Now is time for a change in the way we're working. I realize that you disdain change and label anything you don't like unrealistic but let's set aside your petty grievances and finish the article collaboratively. If not, then the article will remain protected for as long as there exists dispute on this page.</dd>

<dd>Adreus, I do indeed percieive your tone to be unecessarily abrassive simply because that's how it was written and as long as you keep it up I will keep pointing it out to you until you tap back and are a tad more civil in your interraction. Your tone is to me and dare I say others a barrier to communication and militates against 'good faith'. A little civility even in disagreement helps folks get along and consensus is more likely, more this is Wiki policy to which we are all subject.</dd>

<dd>Re The achievement in the last 10 Months it has simply been a blocking exercise preventing POV Theists such as Sam Spade imposing their agenda and bias on the article. Re Wiki MO you are right there is no hard and fast MO it's a development by chaos model, that is the MO! Your comment that "I realise you distain change" is a massive generalisation completely without any kind of support. As for your charge that I label anything I donâ€™t like as "unrealistic", again your charge was a massive generalisation easy given the lie by scrolling back and reading what I've written. The unrealistic comment was simply a considered view on a specific issue and was made as such, nothing more and this view is as legitimate as yours. Please take a little more care with your debating technique specifically your use of unfounded generalisation and sweeping statements, this sort of thing is more than abrasive itâ€™s not intellectually honest --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 09:03, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, Sam Spade has not been this article's primary troubles.</li>
<li>This article's primary troubles are caused by those whom rely on subjective and fanciful ideas about atheism and ignore academic research.</li>
<li>I certainly did not suppose a "massive" and "unfounded generalization" and I did not write any "intellectually dishonest and more-than-abrasive sweeping statements." Your opposition to change is readily apparent to anyone with a clear mind whom cares to look.</li>
<li>Explain how the proposed structure for <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>'s collaborative methodology is "unrealistic." Explain. <i>EXPLAIN</i>. If you continue to dance around your responsibility to provide evidence to support your opposition and if you continue to lecture me regarding policy and how you think I should write, I'll merely deem your opinions unworthy of my consideration. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:32, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>No I will not "EXPLAIN" futher than I have done thus far because I am not your subordinate and I do not appreciate the command imperative (this point has been made before by Jwrosenzweig) secondly the lofty tone in "I'll merely deem you opinions unworthy of my consideration" is absolutely fine by me.....feel free go for it.

<dd>Adraeus Your confrontational, highly abrasive style has been explicitly commented on by 3 here so far, it was initially pointed out to you extremely politely by Jwrosensweig. He bent over backwards to do this in a way that gave your ego ample consideration. I started off pointing it out gently and directly after this when you carried on with the abrasive style. Now it seems you are becoming more rather than less confrontational and are seemingly letting your emotions get the better of you and upping the ante rather than gently taking on board the message and adjusting your style in subsequent messages to be a tad more considerate and civil to others. This is all of course taking us off the issue in question even though it seems on the subject matter - the definition of 'atheism' you and I are in broad agreement. I for one would much appreciate it if you were more civil in your style this would I posit greatly help in generating a productive and co-operative atmosphere. You can of course respond to this message by further upping the ante and come back 'belching fire'. Before you do please give thought if this is a good use of time or will help. If you do come back 'belching fire' as per Wikipedia policy of asking for help, by way of pre-emption I humbly request that others, even if they disagree with me on the subject matter of the description of atheism to support me here on the specific matter of Adraeus' abrasive tone. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 11:28, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Instead of posting irrelevant and factually ignorant opinions, can you try to be constructive? Why do you feel the chaotic so-called "hit-and-run"-wiki-approach is better than an organized system designed for intense focus and efficiency?

<dd>Adraeus, My you really do have a notably abrasive tone! This barrier to communication aside, the chaotic hit and run approach is how Wikipedia has been built thus far and its done pretty well. I do take issue with some of the policy and aim to motivate at a Meta level. Remember most folks here are doing this for interest and fun and many valuable and knowledgeable contributors would not want to be marshaled thus. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 08:34, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I take issue with your confrontational style. I'm not the only one asking you to tone it down here. I don't think we can make progress unless we try to build common ground rather than being in each other's face. I really don't think calling other people ignorant is helping that. As Nick states, wikipedia has worked thus far based on the chaotic model. It may seem counter intuitive, but it's worked remarkably well. I see no reason to abandon that model, in fact as I've already stated I think this page's failure to move forward is mostly due to not following the ideals closely enough.</dd>

<dd>What <i>debate</i>, Noisy? Thus far, we've achieved <i>nothing</i>--a neverending discussion of the same topics of weeks and months ago--ten months of riding a Merry-Go-Round. Debate? Certainly not. I proposed a process that would facilitate collaboration at the highest level of efficiency with the goal of producing a article worthy of being featured. I received brash and hasty criticism complete with factual errors and logically fallacious claims. I'm definitely not the problem. I left for a week and still nothing was accomplished. You are at a dead-end and you don't realize it yet. Now is time to turn back and try another route, not attack members of the group because you can't find a way through the granite wall in front of you. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 21:31, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reset the tabs because it's really getting painful to read. Plus I haven't been here as long as other people have, so I hope that I don't get any false impressions. I will make several conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What has happened is Adreus has proposed a new model for this article in order to get it out of it's stagnation. This has resulted in large amounts of objection from other members, and inflamed into an argument of it's own: <b>Is a Waterfall Model more suitable than a Chaos Model</b>? Both sides have produced many arguments, although:</li>
<li>Adreus has given other members the impression that he is too abrasive. This has diluted the argument with many comments that he ought to <i>cool down</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe these are the two main arguments that have stemmed in this <b>Comments</b> section. It's really not a comments section, it's more of an argument for Adreus's waterfall approach. What have both sides produced?</p>
<p><b>Pro-Waterfall</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos hasn't worked for this article, this is a new approach</li>
<li>Lack of organization from Chaos is main reason for failure, therefore Waterfall is the correct way to reapproach problem</li>
<li>Waterfall has worked in many external environments</li>
<li>Main reason for opposition is resistance to change</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pro-Chaos</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos actually <b>will</b> work if we let it run long enough.</li>
<li>Main problem is the POV Theists, not organization</li>
<li>Chaos has worked for rest of Wikipedia (including other controversial topics), so why not here?</li>
<li>Follow Wikipedia MO guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>And one Pro-Chaos reason that really isn't a reason, <i>Adreus is too abrasive</i>. Such a recurring theme. I think everyone is too abrasive, but I'm not going to say that because then I'd get flamed or something.</p>
<p>I think we're arguing about the wrong things. Both sides agree that the indefinite block is unacceptable. Adreus has presented us a way to unblock Atheism and get it working again. If this proposal is unacceptable, then let us find another proposal: Unblock Atheism and let it run its natural course. Do not argue against Adreus' proposal, argue for your proposal.</p>
<p>I am so going to get flamed for this attempt at diplomacy. Oh well.&#160;:-) Have a nice day. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a> 20:22, Nov 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that there are many "models" for the evolution of wiki articles and for the resolution of a dispute.</dd>
<dd>However, the "model" of this article seems to be that one person (Adreus) and a sysop have combined, using the sysop's power to mark the article as "protected", to take control of an article, and to dictate the terms on which the article will evolve.</dd>
<dd>The freeze needs to come off immediately, and the procedures for editing this article need to revert to Wikipedia norms. Who is the article being "protected" from? <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:03, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most recent protection comes of a dispute on whether or not a "Controversial" header versus an "Attention" and "POV + Factuality Dispute" header was appropriate (basically a petty revert war). Somehow, I don't think that was the real dispute. I'm looking into the other page changes right now. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a> 18:33, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Implicit Atheism</span></h2>
<p>I just noticed that some asshole had deleted the title of a comment section that I started earlier on this talk page called "Implicit Atheism." I'm assuming that person's POV conflicted with the term implicit atheism and he/she wanted to remove it from the table of contents so that people wouldn't notice it. Being that there is a large new thread on babies without a single mention of the term "implicit atheism," I'm a bit peeved.</p>
<p>It was deleted by somebody with IP address "198.54.202.115". Here is the diff of the vandalism: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AAtheism&amp;diff=7135667&amp;oldid=7134969" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AAtheism&amp;diff=7135667&amp;oldid=7134969" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>Not conclusive but compelling. If I did do this it was by accident and I have no idea of how it occurred, no content was removed only a title and if anything this mitigates against my position which should tend to support the fact that there was no ill will. The reason it is not conclusive is that I do have a dynamically allocated IP address so it will tend to be different every time I bounce my DSL modem and somebody else could have picked up the same IP address at the same exchange. I donâ€™t know how Roy Blumenthal was dragged into this, that most certainly is not me.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 17:38, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>20040302 thought that it was b/c someone with your IP edited the wikipedia article on (Most likely you). I have no reason to believe that you removed the implicit atheism title on purpose. You have shown no motivation for that, so it seems reasonable to assume that it was an accident. No hard feelings. In the future I would suggest posting only while logged on. That would help avoid confusions like these. <a href="../../../u/v/w/User%7EUVwarning_2342.html" title="User:UVwarning">UVwarning</a> 18:34, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the important info copied (this is from alt.atheism FAQ):</p>
<p><b>Notes:*On Weak Atheism</b><br />
"This is often understood as simply lacking the belief in the existence of gods. But it is different from implicit atheism in the respect that the weak atheist calls him- or herself an atheist. The weak atheist does have an attitude towards theism, namely a sceptical one: he or she questions the validity and possibility of theistic claims."</p>
<p><b>Various types of atheism.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Atheist:</b> one who lacks belief in the existence of gods</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b>Implicit atheist:</b> one who hasn't heard of theism</li>
<li><b>Explicit atheist:</b> one who knows that he is an atheist
<ol>
<li><b>Weak (or negative) atheist:</b> one who is sceptical about the belief in gods.</li>
<li><b>Strong (or positive) atheist:</b> one who actively rejects the existence of gods. <a href="../../../u/v/w/User%7EUVwarning_2342.html" title="User:UVwarning">UVwarning</a> 00:53, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's an important point, plenty of folks who fall within the well supported broad definition of negative or weak atheism would avidly deny this and would not choose to use the term to describe themselves. This is a common phenomenon the fact that an individual does not like a term does not of itself mean it is not an accurate and appropriate term. If the definition can be supported (and the broad definition of atheism has been well supported in these here parts) and one falls within the ambit of that definition then it is applicable whether one likes it or not. Plenty who describe themselves as agnostic and pointedly avoid using the term atheist to self describe are in fact weak atheists, hell plenty of self declared agnostics make it as strong or positive atheists. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 10:57, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. Agnosticism is a positive assertion, whereas implicit atheism is an absence of a particular belief. In fact, agnosticism isn't even on the same axis as atheism/theism. Whereas "atheism" and "theism" describe the presence or absence of the belief in the existence of gods, "agnosticism" is a completely different subject (i.e. whether it's possible to know). --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 22:41, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to add one point. The major school of atheism that existed in India was Carvaka.

<dd>Re Ad hominem, the ad hominem was specifically bringing into question your ability to be dispassionate on the topic of atheism, given your track record. An ad hominem isn't always a fallacy if the point raised is germane to the issue in question as is clear in this case. If your definition is skewed you are not best placed to make a call if something could be considered atheistic or not.</dd>

<dd>Re Jainism being athistic.

<li>From the India Tourist Portal "Jainism did not spread much outside India. Instead it continued to thrive in west India and has left a large amount of architectural heritage. As it was a small minority group it followed Buddhism and Hinduism in its architectural style, but in the 11 -15th century it developed remarkably in west India. As Jainism was a religion opposing Brahmanism, it was originally atheistic religion. It is not Gods but 24 Saviours called Tirthankaras that are worshiped in the temples. It is said that the 24th and the last Tirthankara was Mahavira."<a href="http://www.indiatourismportal.com/architecture/jainism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiatourismportal.com/architecture/jainism.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</li>

<dd>That does make sense <i>A-theism as inâ€“ without god, just like a-moral â€“ without morals, a-symmetrical. without symmetry. In this vein if Jainismâ€™s teachings have no deity it is a-theistic</i>. As that, I would be willing to accept the broad definition of Atheism. Which would make me one. However, if you call me a "weak" or "negative" atheist, I will call you immature and biggoted.

<dd>I know plenty of atheists who self-identify as "weak" (although I would say the term "skeptical" is probably a better alternative). Hell, if asked, I'd be as likely as not to call myself a weak atheist, though that does require some explanation that simply saying atheist does not. Nonetheless, I do not view the term as derogatory in the slightest. SS451

<dd>I myself am an example of such an atheist. While I agree that the label is not ideal, in that it seems likely to give rise to misleading first impressions, I know of no other term that is both as specific and as widespread as that one to describe my view. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:17, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sunborn no slight was intended to anyone who holds passive atheistic views, including yourself if indeed you do. I'm sorry if you took it as such. The 'weak' and 'negative' does not mean the individual is 'weak' or 'negative' it is simply a qualifier on their atheism. The term 'atheist' is also when used neat seen by many as a pejorative, it is no doubt a loaded word to many. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 06:49, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

No pejorative is implied by the term 'weak atheism', firstly I for one did not use it to describe you either directly or by implication, the attachement to it is yours and yours alone. Secondly the term 'weak atheist' is not a term that one could reasonably describe as "less than any other," and from a value point of view I have not implied or suggested or nor do I tacitly hold the view that the term "Strong Atheist" has any more intrinsic value or merit than the term "passive" or "weak" atheist. The term pertains to the respective views on atheism, it is a techical term and is in no way a value judgement. I humbly suggest that you are getting hung up on the terms 'weak' and 'strong' based upon their day to day usage and imposing on yourself a completely unnecessary <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">Equivocation</a>.

<dd>I cant say I know that much of Judaism other than it is one of the 4 best known 'brands' of monotheism along with hundreds of sects of Christianity, 2 major sects of Islam and of course Sikhism. It is my observation that there it is particularly noticeable that in the real World Judaism seems to be as much about cultural identity as religious dogma. There seems to be a phenomenon of the atheistic Jew or secular cultural Jew (for those that find the Word atheist hard to swallow). That is to say those born of Jewish parents who still identify culturally with the Jewish Diaspora, indeed I understand that Israel - created as a Jewish state, has a higher proportion of atheists than most courtiers (but I donâ€™t have the numbers to hand). I could discuss why this â€˜culturally Jewish but atheistâ€™ phenomenon is so noticable, but this is not a discussion board......On the point visa vis atheism it thus seems reasonable to include a section on Jewish atheism and I for one wouldnâ€™t resist it.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 17:00, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I was born of Jewish parents; I light the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menorah.html" title="Menorah">menorah</a> every <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanukah.html" title="Chanukah">Chanukah</a>; I eat <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knish.html" title="Knish">knishes</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Challah.html" title="Challah">challah</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latke.html" title="Latke">latkes</a>, and <a href="../../../k/u/g/Kugel.html" title="Kugel">kugels</a>; I can read <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and I know some words of <a href="../../../y/i/d/Yiddish.html" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> (though my grandmother is more fluent); I was <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Mitzvah_f3e9.html" title="Bar Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvahed</a>; I wear a <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarmulke.html" title="Yarmulke">yarmulke</a> for special occasions; and I intend to get married and have a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_wedding.html" title="Jewish wedding">Jewish wedding</a> when the time is right. How can you say that Jewish atheists can't exist? Would you somehow try to contend that I am not Jewish? I refer you to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist Judaism</a> and/or <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a> (though I haven't checked out these articles for POV). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 15:42, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Language in society isn't defined by a single person or even just a small group of people, the language representative of the entire society and how they use the word. Even if a group of people feel that a word is using incorrectly, if it generally accepted, then it is the language.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Short Definition versus Long Definition</span></h2>
<p>After looking at the page history, I realized that one of the primary disputes was which definition was more appropriate, the short, one sentence one, or the long paragraph one. Let's compromise.</p>
<p><i>Atheism'</i> is the condition of lacking <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theistic</a> belief.</p>
<p>However, <b>Add longer definition here, going over all the extra things.</b> <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a> 18:37, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And just what is this "longer definition"? I reject modification of the single-lined and generally applicable definition of atheism as a condition of being. A "longer definition" is located below it which further evaluates the topic with clarity. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 15:27, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
