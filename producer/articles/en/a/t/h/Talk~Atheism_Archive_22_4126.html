<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relationship to definition of god</span></h2>
<p>The meaning of "atheism" depends on the meaning of "god" to some degree. Self definition as an atheist is denying some specific concept of god and not every possible concept of god. Example, many atheists today would accept that they are not disbelievers in "the universe", which is one possible concept of god. Also, in defining someone else as an atheist one is saying their beliefs do not include what I conceive of as qualifying as a god. Example, Christians were considered atheists by many when the religion was young. It is often the case with a new belief that its followers and teachings are labeled more for what they don't believe than for what they do believe. Context matters. 4.250.198.191 00:12, 11 Apr 2005</p>

<dd>He makes a very good point. For example few atheists concieve of, much less disbelieve my God.

<dd>The first point the anon makes doesn't stand up. Of course atheists don't disbelieve in the existence of the universe, they just don't believe that it's god (just as most atheists don't disbelieve in the existence of Jesus, but again, they deny that he was divine). Much of what's in the passage is in any case covered elsewhere in the article. It's just a rather poorly written personal essaylet by someone who hasn't read the rest of the article very carefully. I agree with Adraeus in taking it out. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:15, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thing is, you don't really understand what god means. A god is a supernatural being. If you call red "green", that doesn't change the fact that it is red, it simply changes what we call it. If you renamed the universe "god", then you'd have to reject reality to reject it. However, that is not what god is usually taken to mean, and it is like using the word "evil" instead of Christian; even if you mean the same thing by it, its not the usual context of the word. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 13:13, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, I'm not sure that you are right about the nature of the God that strong atheists typically reject. I am sure it runs the gamut from anthropomorphic God-in-the-sky, to the Deist Creator-God, to the pantheist God that you worship. In my experience, strong atheists are quite sophisticated in their knowledge of religion and philosophy, and know about a variety of possible conceptions of God, rejecting all of them. This is only my personal experience, and I wouldn't make generalizations from it in the absence of data. However, you shouldn't either. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:39, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>our definition of atheism relies on the <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deity</a> article, which in turn defines a deity as essentially <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a>. Atheists according to this reject the supernatural. I don't know if there are atheist spiritists, but they are in fringe territory since it is almost impossible to separate <i>deity</i> from <i>spirit</i>, historically. Calling the Universe "God", to the atheist, is just silly terminology, since it's already called "the Universe", and since it is not supernatural at all, but rather the sum of everything natural. Atheists would also reject anything "outside" the Universe as an oxymoron. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 20:55, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I don't think your last comment, dab, is always true. For instance, not all atheists would reject Star Trek-space travel as oxymoronic, and there are certainly some theoretical astrophysicists who would disagree with the idea that there exists only a single "Universe". Rationally, to claim there is only a single "Universe" — directly or indirectly — is premature considering our exploration of time/space is so limited. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 23:17, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>of course with "Universe" I do not mean "known Universe", but <i>universum</i>, i.e. "all" by definition. As long as hyperspace is describable with natural laws, there is no reason to call it "supernatural". With 'spiritist' I mean, belief in (disembodied) spirits. Polytheistic gods are not different in essence from disembodied spirits, so I believe it would be misleading to call an occultist without belief in a single God an atheist. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 05:47, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>It sounds, then, as though you're lumping dualists in with what you mean by 'spiritist', in which case I have to disagree; there are many atheists who are dualists (I'm one of them), just as there have been many theists who are physicalists. Moreover polytheists gods <i>are</i> different from mere dismbodied spirits (for a start, of course, they needn't be disembodied), and polytheistic religions generally make clear distinctions between the two. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:44, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>wait a minute, by "dualist" do you mean Zoroastrian/Gnostic-style belief in two deities? Then you are clearly outside our present definition. An atheist needs to reject both monotheism and polytheism (including the special cases of Henotheism and Dualism). We say that an atheist rejects theistic beliefs. Theistic beliefs are belief in deities, and deities we define as supernatural. A "physicalist theist" believes that there are powerful but natural beings (such as aliens)? Not a theist, then. Polytheistic gods may be embodied, they need not even be immortal (<i>megas Pan tethneken</i>), but they need to be supernatural in some way, otherwise they are just an elite (human, alien, elvish or what have you), but not gods. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:02, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
<dd>I realize, belatedly, that you mean the "other" dualism, belief in an otherworld. You need then to decide that both worlds are really on a par, and their conjunction may be considered the "Universe", or, if you assume a hierarchy, one of these worlds as "natural", and the other as "super-natural", and if you furthermore assume that the supernatural world contains "entities" (excluding the boundary case of an "empty otherworld", probably applicable to Buddhism), you are, by our definition, a theist. It sounds like you may be a polytheist after all, Mel. (I am myself uncertain whether to classify myself as a polytheist with atheistic leanings, or vice versa, or a naturalist with a taste for philosophical monotheism, hell I don't know. Luckily, nobody cares&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:05, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Dualism is a heavily overloaded term. I think Mel is probably labelling himself a dualist in the Cartesian sense. In the philosophy of mind, a materialist considers that there is only the material world, and that "minds" as separate entities do not exist. A dualist asserts the existence of "minds" and "mental" objects as separate from material "bodies". This gives rise to the famous "mind-body problem": what is the nature of the interaction between "minds" and "bodies"? Probably most atheists who have considered the problem are materialists, but I don't think an atheist is obliged to adopt any particular view regarding the mind-body problem. The world of "minds" and "mental" objects need not be identified with the "supernatural". Christians with their notion of persistent, ghost-like "souls" that go to "Heaven" to be with "God", etc, seem to conflate the two, though --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:55, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>as long as you assume the "mind" space operates strictly causal, you remain a materialist, the mind-body problem is reduced to the question of interaction between two weakly coupled, but entirely 'natural' subspaces. As soon as you assume the 'mind' space is somehow exempt from cause and effect, you are in 'spiritist' and/or 'theist' territory. Early polytheism is <i>not</i> clearly separable from spiritism / animism / ancestor worship. If you believe in ghosts and (non-material/non-causal) souls, but not God, you may classify yourself among early polytheists, typologically. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:13, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>'s right about my position (sorry, I didn't make myself clear; it's because in philosophy 'dualist' is rarely used to refer to anything else but mind–body dualism).</dd>
<dd>It's wrong to say that because the mind is causally related to the body therefore it's material; that makes an assumption which is either question-begging or ungrounded (or both). Moreover, those who hold that mind doesn't have effects on body (such as epiphenomenalists) <i>are</i> usually materialists. And I don't see how believing in non-causal minds would bring one in to polytheism... what's the connection? You seem to be simply identifying such a position with polytheism by definition, but that's not really on (and certainly lies outside normal definitions of the term). But this isn't the place to debate such a complex and difficult issue. I avoid the articles related to such matters, but I'd be happy to discuss it by e-mail, or on my Talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:34, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree this should be taken to <a href="../../../d/e/i/Talk%7EDeity_b054.html" title="Talk:Deity">Talk:deity</a>. We seem to agree that atheism means "absence or rejection of belief in deities", so what we should argue about is how to define deity, otherwise our definition on atheism is worthless. 'materialist' doesn't mean 'belief that the world consists of little hard polyhedrons' anymore. It means belief that there is a set of abstract natural laws that have no exceptions and are fully consistent. Whether these operate in 'mind' or in 'body' space is irrelevant. But I agree to terminate this discussion at this point, since it will not lead to modifications of the present article. See you on Talk:deity sometime, maybe? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:44, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Some atheists reject the undefined or unprovable or nonobjective object others claim to hold in awe, worship, and/or pray to as it is not rightfully called god in their view. So their rejection is not so much a rejection of the object they call god as it is a rejection that what they call god is rightfully called god. Other atheists claim to reject objective proveable or anthropormorphic gods while reserving judgement for objects they lack evidence for or believe in but call by another name (laws of physics - I don't stop believing in them just cause you want to call them god). 4.250.27.212 23:44, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>if you call the laws of physics "God" you're just fooling with semantics. You can also call them "Zebra" without having an effect on Zoology. Participation in religious rites you don't believe in obviously doesn't keep you from being an atheist. There may be a strong ethical code not to deny your position among some atheists, but for others it may be just as acceptable to participate in any religious behaviour whatsoever, since they don't think it matters in the least. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:19, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>you both have a point. Pantheism is often virtually indistinguishable from atheism (I rediscovered that on <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brethren_of_the_Free_Spirit_471d.html" title="Brethren of the Free Spirit">Brethren of the Free Spirit</a>, yesterday.) Maybe it really does boil down to a matter of terminology. As long as we have the "supernatural" in the definition of deity, the laws of nature do not qualify as (part of) a deity. But I am not so sure anymore the "supernatural" (whatever that means) is really a prerequisite&#160;:o\ If Emperors can be divine, it seems that simply accumulating enough "mana" (which may be a perfectly natural substance) makes you a deity. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:01, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>The term <i>supernatural</i> is actually a reference to a <i>belief in the supernatural</i>. That is, to designate something as "supernatural", one must believe in the supernatural. <i>... "supernatural" is a null phrase, being self-contradictory, in that if something exists, it is "natural" and must conform to the "natural laws" of the Universe in which it exists. From this it follows that something "unnatural" cannot exist except as imaginary items, and that this must necessarily include instances of the so called "supernatural". As the consensus model of our Baryonic Universe precludes most of the attributes which people would claim are required for gods, and as no evidence or necessity for such beings appear to exist, ... gods [are] less likely than tooth-fairies.</i> — Hermit. <a href="http://www.churchofvirus.org/bbs/index.php?board=31;action=display;threadid=29351" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.churchofvirus.org/bbs/index.php?board=31;action=display;threadid=29351" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>Adding to that, the definition of <i>supernatural</i> in some contexts may simply be "of or relating to scientifically inexplained phenomena".

<dd>no. I would not consider something that is self-contradictory a belief, because it is not even a statement. If we <i>define</i> deities as "supernatural", you can not at the same time <i>reject</i> the concept of supernatural and <i>accept</i> the concept of deity. It's not about true or untrue, it's about <i>consistency</i> <s>(come on, this is straightforward). You claim the concept of '<a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a>' is self-contradictory in itself, but I do not accept that. Nor is <i>credo quia absurdum</i> - it is the position that there are (whatever <i>are</i> means, here) things unaccessible to any human notion of causality or consequence. This is not self-contradictory in itself, although it is of course unverifiable. It only becomes that if you at the same time accept and reject this position.</s> <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:37, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I still can't derive reason from your reply, and I don't want to reply as if I know what you are talking about; otherwise, we'll get off-topic. I think you are somehow misreading what I wrote about beliefs and the oxymoronic nature of "supernatural", or you simply have not given that which I wrote enough consideration. Excluding the "no", your first claim doesn't make any sense. Your second claim ignores mental illness, delusion, and self-deception. And your third claim seems to state that beliefs require consistency. (Beliefs are not bound by reason, logic, and consistency. Beliefs can be in whatever-whenever regardless of logical ridiculousness. See also: <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> <a href="http://www.talkatheism.org/node/4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkatheism.org/node/4" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.metavirus.net/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=76" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metavirus.net/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=76" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) Further clarification of the quotes above, too, seems unneeded and extremely difficult.

<dd>well, it seems you just disagree with me then. You link to the same (atheist) text by one Chad Docterman, twice. If we talk about that, we'll get sidetracked, but I don't think it would raise any scholastic eyebrows. I don't think we'll get any further if you expect me to ponder the intricacies of your implications, while you are at liberty to dismiss my statements as 'making no sense'. Maybe you should give it some more consideration. Yes, I assert that a belief that can be stated is necessarily consistent. Just because some atheists say the concept of God is not consistent doesn't make it so. A mystic may want to express the ineffability of his experience with self-contradictions, but that is outside the concept of "belief". A belief implies a statement, e.g. "The Holy Spirit emanates from the Son". You say that, and then you say "this, I believe". This belief makes sense assuming you grant that "Holy Spirit", "to emanate" and "the Son" are meaningful concepts. If you do (of course you don't, but assuming), the statement may be true or untrue, but it is not self-contradictory. "<a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Linear, singularity and trinity equate to evil math within Nature's Cubic Creation.</a>" or "green ideas sleep furiously" or "the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe" are not statements, and therefore they cannot be believed or disbelieved. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:23, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Beliefs do not require verbal admissions of holding. Beliefs can be demonstrated by behavior and "knowledge" of other subjects. Beliefs are not required to make sense to be held true. Beliefs are not required to be falsifiable. Beliefs can regard <i>anything</i> regardless of logical ridiculousness. Belief allows us to deceive ourselves. Belief is irrational. "God is and God isn't." That doesn't make sense? How can God be and God not be? Right. That's a logical error; however, belief doesn't require logic to be held true. Simply because there's a flaw in a belief doesn't necessitate a belief to be false. A belief can never be false to a believer. A belief can always be held true. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 18:26, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"the practical application of these worldviews to religious thought remains atheistic" So what is the "practical application" of atheism? A behavior section would be useful.

<p>I don't really follow. In many respects, Buddhists (to particularise) don't act like atheists; and how does this relate to "religious thought"? I'm inclined to rewrite this as saying that deities and worship thereof isn't required by Buddhism, and would be seen by almost all adherents as subsidiary to its fundamentals, or some such form of words. (Am vaguer about the role of deities in Taoism.)

<dd>I substantially rewrote the Buddhist/Taoist section. Asserting that early Buddhist texts assume an atheistic standpoint is factually wrong; the earliest texts that we have available include Vedic deities, supernatural powers, and visits to and from heaven. What distinguishes Buddhism is not its rejection of the reality of deities, but rather its assertion that deities are bound by the same rules as humans and other beings, and are not necesary to the ultimate salvific goal (Nirvana). Claiming that supernatural elements are later additions is usually based on circular logic: we know that the early teachings denied the supernatural because the supernatural parts are later additions, and we known the supernatural parts are later additions because the early teachings denied the supernatural. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 03:44, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I asked "where do we go from here?" BM refers me to "paragraph concerning definitions of God in the Types of Atheism section" which is a good place to start. The last sentence "Most (though not necessarily all) atheists who deny the existence of deities as supernatural beings would probably also deny this and similar conceptions of God, or consider them to be incomprehensible." While without doubt perfect in every way (just my sense of humor, I figure I'm just gonna get shot down again, so I might as well make light of it) I feel it doesn't adequately cover "Maybe it really does boil down to a matter of terminology." (by dab (ᛏ) 07:01, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC) in the previous section). Evidence to date indicates you won't like my choice of words in dealing with this, so perhaps someone with more karma (slashdot useage) here can help out.</p>
<p>That would be a good start. Where I'm going with all this is:</p>
<p>To what extent is this about disagreements about the results of experiments (I call that reality) versus words used to communicate and model reality versus our emotions and choices in response to reality. Does praying for rain work? Do we call whatever is most powerful God? Do we stand in awe before life or do we investigate and conquor it? Three ways of being an atheist. Three ways of NOT being an atheist. People can and do mix and match. 4.250.198.65 23:45, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism</span></h2>
<p>‘Atheism’ means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God. I shall here assume that the God in question is that of a sophisticated monotheism. The tribal gods of the early inhabitants of Palestine are of little or no philosophical interest. They were essentiallly finite beings, and the god of one tribe or collection of tribes was regarded as good in that it enabled victory in war against tribes with less powerful gods. Similarly the Greek and Roman gods were more like mythical heroes and heroines than like the omnipotent, omniscient and good God postulated in mediaeval and modern philosophy. As the Romans used the word, ‘atheist’ could be used to refer to theists of another religion, notably the Christians, and so merely to signify disbelief in their own mythical heroes.</p>
<p>The word ‘theism’ exhibits family resemblance in another direction. For example should a pantheist call herself an atheist? Or again should belief in Plato's Form of the Good or in John Leslie's idea of God as an abstract principle that brings value into existence count as theism (Leslie 1979)? Let us consider pantheism.</p>
<p>At its simplest, pantheism can be ontologically indistinguishable from atheism. Such a pantheism would be belief in nothing beyond the physical universe, but associated with emotions of wonder and awe similar to those that we find in religious belief. I shall not consider this as theism. Probably the theologian Paul Tillich was a pantheist in little more than this minimal sense and his characterising God as the ground of being has no clear meaning. The unanswerable question ‘Why is there anything at all?’ may give us mystical or at any rate dizzy feelings but such feelings do not differentiate the pantheist from the atheist. However there are stronger forms of pantheism which do differentiate the pantheist from the atheist (Levine, 1994). For example the pantheist may think that the universe as a whole has strongly emergent and also mind-like qualities. Not emergent merely in the weak sense that a radio receiver's ability to receive signals from distant stations might be said to be emergent because it is not a mere jumble of components (Smart 1981). The components have to be wired together in a certain way, and indeed the workings of the individual compunents can be explained by the laws of physics. Contrast this with a concept of emergence that I shall call ‘strong emergence’. C. D. Broad in his Scientific Thought (Broad 1923) held that the chemical properties of common salt could not even in principle be deduced from those of sodium and chlorine separately, at the very time at which the quantum theory of the chemical bond was beginning to be developed. Though the mind has seemed to some to be strongly emergent from its physical basis, it can be argued that developments in the philosophy of mind, cognitive science and neuroscience favour weak emergence only.</p>
<p>One strong form of pantheism ascribes mental properties to the cosmos. If the weak sense of emergence was adopted we would be faced with the question of whether the universe looks like a giant brain. Patently it does not. Samuel Alexander asserted, rather than argued, that mentality strongly emerged from space-time, and then that at some future time there will emerge a new and at present hardly imaginable level which he called ‘deity’ (Alexander 1927). It is hard to tell whether such an implausible metaphysics should be classified as as pantheism or as theism. Certainly such a deity would not be the infinite creator God of orthodox theism. A. N. Whitehead, too, had a theory of an emergent deity, though with affinities to Platonism, which he saw as the realm of potentiality and thus connected the atemporal with the contingent temporal deity (Whitehead 1929). Such views will not deliver, however implausibly, more than a finite deity, not the God of core theism. God would be just one more thing in the universe, however awesome and admirable.</p>
<p>The weak form of pantheism accepts that the physical universe is all and eschews strong emergence. Sometimes the weak form of panthism is rhetorically disguised as theism, with God characterised as ‘absolute depth’ or some equally baffling expression, as by Paul Tillich. At any rate, whether or not we accept pantheism as a sort of theism, what we mean by ‘atheism’ will vary according to what in the dialectical situation we count as theism. 4.250.33.72 00:47, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

The removed text would have been redundant if the information regarding "atheists who refrain from identification with atheism for various reasons" had not been removed from the <i>Types of atheism</i> section. To that extent, if there's something useful to be gained from the anonymous user's edit, that is the re-inclusion of information regarding non-identifying atheists. (My dad, for instance, is an atheist by definition; however, he refuses to identify as an atheist due to the stigma attached to what is generally perceived as representative of atheism and its adherents.

<li>You seem to be saying that, because one can't include every reason (and I frankly doubt that there are many), one should include none.

<p>Ah, your usual pleasant tone. I'll leave the courtesy issue, as it's clearly not getting through. On the central issue, even leaving aside the fact that most of your 'examples' seem to have nothing to do with the case at all, you're conflating two distinct matters: not wanting publicly to admit being an atheist while believing oneself to be one, and not believing oneself to be an atheist even though one's (lack of) beliefs meet the normal criteria. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:03, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not conflating issues. I'm showing you another way to think. "I am (not) an atheist because... &lt;insert reason&gt;." An epistemological reason is a <i>reason</i>. Insert it. Now I'm going to refer to policy. Wikipedia policy suggests that editors do not write what people believe; instead, Wikipedia policy suggests that editors write <i>about</i> what people believe from a NPOV. Editors should also avoid gender-specific terms wherever possible. The removed copyvio text violates both suggestions.</dd>
<dd>There's actually three distinct issues: avoiding admission of atheism for whatever reason while recognizing satisfaction of the criteria for definition as an atheist, avoiding admission of atheism and believing to be something else while satisfying the criteria for definition as an atheist, and avoiding admission of atheism and satisfying the criteria for definition as an atheist while believing to be not an atheist. (By the way, would you please be nice and explain the removed copyvio text using Occam's Razor. I'm having difficulty understanding what exactly the quote is describing, but that may be due to the passage's lack of specificity.) <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 05:21, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't really follow most of this. The first comment is obscure and vague. The reference to writing about what people believe rather than writing what they believe is clear, but doesn't apply to the passage in question. The business about gender is minor, and not a reason for deletion.</p>
<p>The English in your second paragraph goes a bit haywire, and perhaps that's why the distinction between the last two is unclear.

<dd>Occam's Razor can be applied to anything, but it isn't always useful. Many people mistakenly invoke the principle because something is complex. Essentially, Occam's Razor is basically the idea that the simplest theory which fits all the facts available is most likely to be the correct one. Invoking Occam's Razor in relation to text is not really valid; text may be verbose and far from straightforward, but text is not a theory. Stating things clearly and concisely in as few words as possible is certainly good writing technique, but it has nothing to do with Occam's Razor. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 01:26, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The subject of these comments is very clearly first drafts of <i>articles</i>. Having said that, you've also stumbled into an article that has been the subject of hot debate, and you added a copyright-violating passage which, frankly, wasn't well-written. I agree that Adraeus acted too hastily, and somewhat aggressively, but that's the way he does everything. It's difficult to get used to it, but at least one learns to expect it.</dd>
<dd>If I were you, I'd try editing some less controversial articles, so that you get a feel for the Wikipedia approach; then you might try something a bit heavier, like <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> (or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a>...). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 23:08, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like Mel Etitis said, I act quickly and aggressively, but what he didn't mention was why. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia which is actively being visited by readers around the world. Before you contribute, you need to stop and consider your would-be edits. Are they appropriate? Are they well-written? Researched? Fact-checked? Cited? Are there any grammatical or spelling errors? Can the content be improved before being published? The objective is to reduce the error margin before contributing. If there are any mistakes you didn't notice before publishing, they'll most likely be corrected. Anyway, that's part of how you improve an article. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 00:29, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The latest edit from Haiduc: "Only the elderly could attend with relative impunity. Consequently, religious organizations were among the staunchest opponents of communist regimes. In particular, the Catholic Church under Pope John Paul was instrumental in the fall of communism."</p>
<p>Few historical facts from former Czechoslovakia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elderly were (and are) most frequent church attendants because of their habits. Church attendance was not welcomed but largely overlooked (as it was going down steadily anyway).</li>
<li>Quite a many of clergymen tried to survive harsh conditions by (mostly symbolic) collaboration with regime and the "christian party" <a href="../../../k/d/u/KDU-CSL_8faf.html" title="KDU-CSL">KDU-CSL</a> had token presence in the goverment. Staunchest opponents were people who emigrated (huge groups, hundreths of thousands). There was very tiny "underground church" outside traditional structures.</li>
<li>I am not sure how big was influence of Catholic Church "globally" (in Czechoslovakia rather small) but I had seen how the economical and social incompetence of system was instrumental in its fall.</li>

<p>I provided a set of links to sources showing that atheism was the most common position among scientists (physical and social). They're now somewhere in the archives.

<p>I'd rather not, if it's the same to you.&#160;:-) Reading that archive, I see it was down to squabbling about who was included under the term <i>scientist</i>, with dictionaries being hauled out and everything. I understand the facts in the "contemporary atheism" section are not disputed? Which includes, in particular (oh, what an ironic full circle) a link to <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html" rel="nofollow">Leading scientists still reject God</a>? That does make explicit mention of the survey being conducted among natural scientists, not social scientists. Of course the counterargument is that "science" typically refers to natural science and hence natural scientists, but this is not a very strong counterargument, because if you can make the statement more precise, why risk any accusation of overgeneralization? Unencumbered writing is nice, but not if at an avoidable loss of precision. If we have references for the level of atheism among <i>all</i> scientists, regardless of particular field, it's another matter. Keep in mind that not generalizing for lack of sources is not the same as implying that we have information on those who are not included by the statement, that is, saying "natural scientists" would not imply that atheism is not common among the "unnatural scientists".&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 16:40, 2005 May 2 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As long as <i>you</i> are going to bring up an old topic, the term "scientist" is demonstrably <i>ambiguous</i> having more than one possible meaning. Mel Etitis rejects the idea of "business sciences"; however, many institutions of higher learning use the phrase to refer to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Management.html" title="Management">management</a> (called <i>managerial sciences</i>), <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a>, and other "so-called" business sciences. On numerous occasions, my studies have revealed that business (not the act of doing business) as a field of study is a social science. Business sciences encompass many different scientific fields just as many natural and physical sciences do. My attempt to disambiguate the term "scientist" failed because Mel Etitis is unwilling to acknowledge the usefulness of specification and the reality of the ambiguous nature of the term "scientist". Mel Etitis argues, "It's of course true that the term 'science' can ben used metaphorically, loosely, and plain wrongly, as can just about any term; that's no reason to claim that it's ambiguous." <a href="http://www.metavirus.net/wp/OED3_SCIENCE.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.metavirus.net/wp/OED3_SCIENCE.HTM" rel="nofollow">These are all correct usages of the term "science".</a> Mel Etitis <i>believes</i> that definition 5b is the one and only true definition, which states, "In modern use, <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a></i> is often treated as synonymous with 'Natural and Physical Science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws, sometimes with implied exclusion of pure mathematics. This is now the dominant sense in ordinary use." This is the definition, by the way, which convinced me to allow Mel Etitis his twisted perceptions. I've stated this before somewhere in the archives unless someone "refactored" my concession out of the discussion. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 17:06, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, for what it's worth, I don't accept the definition that Adraeus says that I do; indeed, my inclusion of social scientists should have suggested that. The term "science" isn't ambiguous, it's broad; I argue, however, that it isn't so broad as to include business studies. If there are bits of business studies that are social science, that doesn't make business studies a social science (one of the problems with all these new, putative academic disciplines that generally end with "studies" is that they're fuzzy, usually only united by a certain area of interest rather than by a particular, central methodology). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:24, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is my punishment for bringing up an old topic? I'll be sure to remember that.&#160;:-) I don't think that whether or not science includes business studies is of relevance to the article as it stands; as far as I'm concerned, anyone can hold any beliefs on this matter as they see fit, "twisted perceptions" or not, broad terms or not. Do the sources as we have them in the article allow us to generalize over all scientists (<i>as defined by those sources</i>) or not? If not, then we should talk about <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_scientist.html" title="Natural scientist">natural scientists</a>, or add more sources. If they do (whether or not they explicitly include business studies or mathematics or <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philately.html" title="Philately">philately</a>) then we should talk about scientists in general. And if it should turn out that the issue is too complicated to dismiss with one sentence in the intro, then we shouldn't try. We can argue over what particular definition of "science" we subscribe to in the pub. Or better, we can find more sources.

<li>An illiterate (or biased) contributor misquoted the Larson-Witham 1996 study (<a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html" class="external free" title="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html</a>) as stating that 93% of all natural scientists rejected or disbelieved god, thus attempting to support his opinion that there had been a momentous decline of religious belief in the scientific community between 1914 and 1996. In fact, the linked study clearly states that among randomly selected natural scientists, that percentage has only marginally increased, from 58% to 60.7% in the past century.</li>

<li>The 93% number refers to a completely unrelated sample of "leading scientists" of National Academy of Sciences surveyed members, who were questioned by mail in a different study in 1998, and among whom only 50% agreed to answer. Wikipedia's relevant entry in "the relationship between religion and science" article also makes a good point wrt this study by stating that "the phrasing of the question could be criticized as presenting an overly narrow definition of God. The survey among NAS scientists was conducted via mail and had a low and perhaps statistically biased return rate of 50%."</li>

Feel free to reincorporate the 1998 study as you see fit (WITHOUT as disguising it as something it is not).</li>

MELETITIS, have you been reduced to vandalism? I made a correction to the fraudulent misrepresentation of the 1996 Larson-Witham study while referencing the relevant article, and you revert to the old fallacious misquote? Are you joking? The study clearly states that, when using the 1914 method of inquiry, the results of the survey were identical in 1996 to those of 1914 (58% vs 60.17%). This is why Wikipedia is useless for anything but the most non-controversial matter, in my humble opinion. Kids with too much spare time in their hands will systematically vandalize corrections "just because", without answering to the comments and concerns of those who made them in the first place.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">rationalists, and humanists</span></h2>
<p>I think "rationalists, and humanists" in the header should be deleted or given a CURRENT (not 1960s) reference. My reason for wishing to delete it even if a reference were found is that it seems a bit tautological to me in that everyone I've ever talked to that self identifies as a "rationalist" or "humanist" did so because it sounded better than "atheist". 4.250.198.247 12:42, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">Rationalism</a> says it "rejects ... all religions".

<dd>Secular humanism is "Humans matter and can solve human problems, science, free speech, rational thought, democracy and freedom in the arts go together, there is nothing supernatural" and rationalism is "truth should be determined by reason and factual analysis, rather than faith, dogma or religious teaching." The rationalism article says that historically some rationalists weren't atheists, and secular humanists can be agnostics as well. There's nothing tautological about this - secular humanists, rationalists, and atheists are not the same thing, though many of all three believe the same things. Additionally, the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a> article states that there are two types of humanism: religious and secular, and obviously religious humanists aren't going to be atheists. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 15:00, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Being an atheist and a nonatheist is contradictory</span></h2>
<p>The article currently contains the following sentence: "The apparent contradiction of being both atheist and nonatheist is no more actually contradictory than a person or a box being black from one point of view and white from another." This is utter nonsense. Either a person is an atheist, or he isn't (that is, he is a nonatheist). I would also disagree with the assertion that an object can "be" both entirely black and entirely white to two different people. It can <i>appear</i> white to one and black to another, but it cannot <i>be</i> both.

<p>Can you conceive of two different people having two different definitions for what an atheist is? Can you concieve of someone that fits one of those definitions but not the other?

<dd>Replace "atheist" with any other noun and the argument applies likewise.

We can similarly claim that one person's Christian is another person's heretic; that one person's brilliant movie is another person's turgid mess...

<p>This article makes a very big deal out of counting percentages of atheists in the heading and a section about this and that and the other poll. Those references to counting atheists makes it relavent here but not in articles that define a term but don't go out of their way to assert so many percent are in the group. Remove those references and the contradictory use and nonexclusive use is no longer directly relevant. So remove those and then I would agree with you. Leave them and pointing out the difficulty in counting atheists remains relevant. The child of two Jews is adopted by a Catholic and given infant baptism. The person has no specific religious beliefs. That person is counted as what? At age two? at age 20? inbetween? The point is relevant. The way I made it could undoubtably be improved. But the point is better made as is than not made at all. 4.250.132.180 00:42, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But then you're questioning the validity/applicability of the polls, suggesting that we're incorporating them wrongly because they may be based on different definitions. You'll have to back up that statement with something more concrete than "definitions <i>may</i> be different across polls". The percentages are listed with explicit mention of the <i>source</i>—whether by self-identification of people, or by definitions applied by the poll-taker. The reader is supposed to understand from this that obviously, the definition of "atheism" may not be exactly what Wikipedia (or the reader) has in mind—<i>caveat lector</i>. To dispute the accuracy or relevance of the percentages, you'll have to use an argument that's more specific than "definitions may differ". That's always the case. The question is whether they do misleadingly so, and that hasn't been established. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 00:57, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Atheism is the state either of being without theistic beliefs, or of actively disbelieving in the existence of deities." is the first sentence. "A 1995 survey [16] (<a href="http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html" class="external free" title="http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html</a>) attributed to the Encyclopedia Britannica indicates that non-religious are about 14.7% of the world's population, and atheists around 3.8%." is the first listed poll result. The definition provided in the first sentence indicates the non-religious ARE atheists. Am I to add a discussion after each and every freaking poll result? I think it better to have a seperate section than to do that. 4.250.132.180 01:06, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"60.7 percent" in the first page asserts that atheists can be counted to an accuracy of one part in a thousand. It used to be 60% which is justifiable. The unreverted addition of the point seven is exactly why pointing out contradictory and nonexclusive use is necessary. 4.250.132.180 00:54, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe the section should be retitled <b>Difficulties in counting atheists</b> and reedited to fit that new title. 4.250.132.180 00:59, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The big problem is is that it's more aptly titled <b>Difficulties in counting any adherence to any religious/spiritual/philosophical view</b>. As the saying goes, there are "lies, damn lies and statistics". What you'd want is nothing short of a crash course in how to interpret polls properly (that is: with what and how many grains of sand one has to take any poll result). The conclusions you can draw from a poll depend critically on how the poll was conducted.</dd>
<dd>But all that is <i>not relevant</i>. The reason it's not relevant is because we are not <i>claiming</i> any of these percentages are right. We don't have to. We simply state that such-and-such has reported a percentage of such-and-such; if at all possible we should add more information (what institution conducted the poll, exactly? What questions were asked? Etc.), but the information itself isn't wrong or dubious; everybody understands Wikipedia is not claiming these figures were carefully adjusted to match our definition of "atheism", but is quoting external sources, however those sources may have obtained their figures. "The 2001 New Zealand census showed that 40% of the respondents claimed 'no religion'." is simply a statement, clearly having some relevance to atheism, but we're not saying 40% of New Zealanders are atheist, because that's just not what was established. What <i>conclusion</i> you draw from the poll is another matter. We make an explicit point of some of the more dangerous assumptions and biases underlying some of the polls in the "statistics" section when we happen to be aware of them (inflated atheism counts in communist countries, etc.)</dd>
<dd>Aside from that. Your section doesn't even address those polls; it's actually even less specific than that. Rather than clarifying anything, your section confuses me intensely, because I can't determine the author's intent. What's being said here? That words can be used in nonobvious ways? I already knew that. That "A" and "not A" may not be exclusive if we use different definitions of "A" in either statement? That seems obvious. That we will use "atheism" in a manner consistent with how we defined it in the intro, and clearly indicate when we do not? That should not have to be explained, or we're doing something wrong.</dd>
<dd>In short: what's the point of the philosophical discourse here? If it's to make the reader critical of polls, then you a) need a more direct approach and b) need to hold the discussion somewhere more general than <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>. If it's just to educate the reader on <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a> and how our processes of understanding can play tricks on us, it shouldn't be anywhere, since encyclopedia articles are not how-tos or lecture notes. I think you're trying to address an issue that's not a problem, in a way that's far too general. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:35, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section should simply be removed. It is completely, totally, and utterly irrelevant and a great deal of it is false or self-contradictory. It is obvious that being an atheist does not preclude you from having a certain ethnicity; we do not spell this out in numerous philosophical and religious articles, so there's no reason to do it here. And saying that you can be an atheist and a Christian is completely, totally, and utterly contradictory. A Christian must believe in a deity; that is part of what makes a Christian a Christian. Arguing that it is cultural is bunk; no disinterested party refers to Christianity in such a fashion. You cannot believe in a deity and be an atheist; therefore you cannot be a Christian, a member of the Jewish religion, Muslim, Asatru, Wiccan, or a number of other religions which necessitate belief in divinities.</p>
<p>The word god is not meaningless, contrary to what obfuscationists think. It is a word with a number of very specific meanings. Though some people obviously are unable to differentiate between bizzare philisopical constructs and any sort of reality, that does not mean we have to include such things in the article. That belongs in the appropriate philosphical article.</p>
<p>Being an atheist is very much exclusive; it excludes you from being a theist. Stating it is nonexclusive is incorrect. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 05:37, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Atheism is a <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive.html" title="Exclusive">nonexclusive</a> condition and can be combined with also being <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> (by race), also being <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> (as a philosophy and ethical system), also being called a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> (some believe "once a Christian, always a Christian" <a href="http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternalsecurity1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternalsecurity1.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>; others may admire Jesus as a role model while rejecting any religious implications), and even in apparent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contradiction.html" title="Contradiction">contradiction</a> calling oneself something other than atheist when specifically choosing between atheist and something else <a href="http://www.luminary.us/russell/atheist_agnostic.html|label" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.luminary.us/russell/atheist_agnostic.html|label" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Atheism is nonexclusive when the definition of atheism and the definition of the other state both apply, example: Jewish atheist. Atheism is nonexclusive when by one point of view or situation atheism as a label applies and by another point of view or situation it does not. Am I talking to someone who shares my understanding of the word or to someone who understands the definition or implications very differently from me?</p>
<p>The apparent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contradiction.html" title="Contradiction">contradiction</a> of being both atheist and nonatheist is no more actually contradictory than a person or a box being black from one point of view and white from another.</p>
<p>The nature of belief itself also permits apparent opposites to be believed. Most people have no trouble believing in both timely behavior "He who hesitates is lost" and caution "Look before you leap", even though on some occasions you can't do both.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivism.html" title="Logical positivism">Logical positivism</a> asserts the term god is meaningless. So not only may one be both atheist from one point of view and nonatheist from another, some assert they are neither atheist nor nonatheist.</p>
<p>The previous discussion covers honest nonexclusive and contradictory use. The nature of speech allows actual opposites to be asserted as opposed to merely apparent opposites; sometimes in error, sometimes as a ploy. So in its actual use as a word, atheism can be used in a nonexclusive or contradictory fashion with any other term whatever.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is impossible to be an atheist and a nonatheist at the same time; you simply do nuot understand what it means. Being of Jewish ancestry has NO bearing on whether or not you are an atheist; someone who does not believe in God is an Atheist, and someone whose mother was Jewish is a Jew. Therefore, these are nonexclusive.</dd>
<dd>However, a "nonatheist" is a theist. An atheist by definition is the opposite of a theist (or vice-versa, as technically the word atheist existed before the word theist). In any event, it is impossible to be an atheist and a theist at the same time, as they are mutually exclusive. A Buddhist can be an atheist, as (depending on the branch of Buddhism) their religious belief does not equate with belief in a deity, which an atheist is (strictly). Being an atheist is not synonymous with being irreligious. However, oftentimes in surveys they are not looking at atheists (which make up a fairly large chunk of the world) but irreligious atheists (who are the aforementioned relatively small percentage), which can lead to some amount of confusion.</dd>
<dd>You cannot be a Christian and be an atheist. You cannot be a religious Jew and an atheist, though you could be an ethnic Jew and an atheist. If your religion includes a god, and you believe in your religion, then you cannot be an atheist. If you religion does not include a deity, and you don't believe in one, you can be religious and an atheist. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 05:17, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm told it has to go because it is so obviously true it is not needed. I'm told it is so obviously false it must be deleted. Normally this would indicate false reasons are being given; but I don't believe that is the case here due to my respect for the people involved. I give up. I'm not going to fight for it anymore. But I am an atheist and due to my good works ("by their fruit you shall know them") and the fact that I accepted Christ into my heart in my Christian youth, some people I know believe me to still be a Christian, no matter what I say I believe ("God will know you as one of His own when you die.")

<dd>well, I have labelled myself a Christian before, in Islamic areas, so I could not be offended by being referred to as a Christian. Although, if people insisted did I really believe in the Lamb, the Blood, the Resurrection and all that, I would have had to excuse myself. My point is, that Christians are really self-defined. If you say you are a Christian, for all practical purposes you are one. So in principle you could call yourself an atheist Christian.

<dd>It meant that although she no longer holds to Catholic dogma, her Catholic upbringing had a permanent affect on her personality. And perhaps that religion should not necessarily be defined only in terms of belief. One can be a Jewish atheist, because Judaism consists at least as much of folkways and practice as belief. The same can be said of Catholicism. Paglia often speaks of the affect of Andy Warhol's Catholic upbringing on his art. It is really Protestantism, Islam and atheism that tend to emphasize belief more than practice, ritual and culture. --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <big>ॐ</big> 16:31, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strong atheism inconsistency</span></h2>
<p>Currently in the strong atheism section, the article says, "Strong atheism ... is the belief that no deities exist. This may be based on the view that there is insufficient evidence or grounds to justify belief in deities... ." That can't be right. "Insufficient evidence or grounds <b>to justify</b> belief in deities" is a <i>weak</i> atheism position, not a strong atheism position. A strong atheist position would be based on the view that a lack of evidence should suffice (perhaps in combination with other reasons) to affirmatively believe that no God exists. I want to get some input and thoughts before I change this. But as currently phrased, it's definitely not a strong atheist perspective, speaking as a strong atheist. <a href="../../../u/n/e/User%7EUnended_db36.html" title="User:Unended">Unended</a> 05:22, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mel Etitis, even on the Atheism article, the convention "God"=<i>singular deity</i>, "god"= <i>any old deity</i> should hold. Therefore, I cannot follow your "fixing" of capitalisation. Where "god" appears, it should read "any gods", i.e. either it should be "is there a God", or "are there any gods", but <i>not</i> "is there a god". "God" vs. "god" is not a matter of point of view (in the sense that the spelling "God" would imply that you are a believer), but they should be treated as two different lexemes, much like <a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAllah_8e32.html" title="Talk:Allah"><i>llah</i> vs. <i>ilah</i></a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 8 July 2005 08:58 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, unfortunately expressed ("I can't allow...."). The fact that one article adopts one approach doesn't necessitate the same approach in all other articles (any more than the reverse). My view, which is of course far from unanimous, but which is nevertheless very widely shared) is that "god" is never a name or a title (it's sometimes been described as a job description), and should therefore never be capitalised. "Allah", "Jehovah", "Siva", "Quetzalcoatl", "Ahura Mazda", etc. — all these are names, so need capitals, but not "god", whether plural or singular. My own view is that the claim that the word should be capitalised when it refers to a unique being is an attempt by believers to keep their honorific use while seeming not to; that's backed up by the fact that it goes against normal English usage (e.g., "Queen Anne", but "Anne was queen"). Thus the use of the capital is implicitly PoV. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:58, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, this "lack of evidence" probably isn't the ONLY reason that people are atheists. Perhaps they feel oppressed by the rules of their religion and don't want to believe in a deity anymore because of the laws he instigates? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 02:44, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd disagree with that assessment, Scorpionman. While reasons for atheism other than lack of evidence may exist, I've never heard of one. If one feels oppressed by the rules of their religion, wouldn't the more logical course of action be to switch to another religion with similar beliefs, but less strigent rules? ex. A Catholic that is uncomfortable with confession decides to convert to a form of Protestantism. -Cog05 18:25, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I suspect most atheists don't want to be bound by the laws of some omnipotent being, but that doesn't mean it's their reason.

<dd>in fairness, some of these articles look alright. It is not their authors' fault that they are hosted on bible-thumping websites. They should be discussed one by one. As far as I see, the "fall of atheism" argument is that religion is ingrained in human behaviour, and that the default state of human society is theistic. That's a very atheistic/rationalist argument, if you like. Falling back into theism is a perpetual risk, and widespread atheism is a cultural acheivement not unlike literacy. Religious fanatism, especially in nuclear powers, is a very serious threat, and signs that atheism is on the decline should be taken very seriously. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not erase my material arbitrarily. I don't want to lodge a NPOV complaint.</p>
<p>I don't think Christianity is a narrow viewpoint and Plantinga is highly recognized thoughout the Christian community. Plantinga's "freewill defense" for the existence of evil is widely praised for example. Also, Christianity is the largest worldview in the world.</p>
<p>I think the real reason is that many of those who profess atheism are tenuous in their position and/or feel uncomfortable about any pointed criticism.</p>
<p>I cite the following:</p>
<p>A website declares Sartre as saying in Harper's magazine:</p>
<p>"As for me, I don’t see myself as so much dust that has appeared in the world but as a being that was expected, prefigured, called forth. In short, as a being that could, it seems, come only from a creator; and this idea of a creating hand that created me refers me back to God. Naturally this is not a clear, exact idea that I set in motion every time I think of myself. It contradicts many of my other ideas; but it is there, floating vaguely. And when I think of myself I often think rather in this way, for wont of being able to think otherwise."</p>

<p>I believe the evidence is strong though that Sartre professed to be an atheist. Here is a education website's information below:</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Sartre_c20d.html" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> was a well known French philosopher who lived from 1905-1980. His thought was influenced heavily by philosophers Heidigger and Husserl. He became one of the early proponents of existentialism, which emphasizes among other things, the ultimacy of human freedom. He considered himself an atheist existentialist (as opposed to a Christian existentialist) and eventually included Marxism and humanism in his philosophy."</p>

<p>Here is some additional data that support that perhaps many professed materialists are doubleminded:</p>
<p>"Crick is also a fervent atheistic materialist, who propounds the particle story. In his autobiography, Crick says very candidly biologists must remind themselves daily that what they study was not created, it evolved; it was not designed, it evolved. Why do they have to remind themselves of that? Because otherwise, the facts which are staring them in the face and trying to get their attention might break through."</p>

<p>Here is the exact quote:</p>
<p>"Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved." (Crick F.H.C., "What Mad Pursuit," 1990, p.138). "</p>

<li><a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">talk:atheism</a> NPOV complaint. I listed two links at this page which were negative of atheism due to the exclusivity of only positive links. The links were written a Oxford scholar (published in Christianity Today) and also a link was written by Alvin Plantinga who is widely written about with the Christian community which is currently the largest worldview on earth and not a fringe view. Alvin Plantinga's freewill defense is widely quoted by both Christians and non-christians alike. The links were deleted. I assert that these links should be added and they are responsible links.</li>

<dd>The free-will defence is, of course, one of the main attempts to defend against the problem of evil, but Plantinga's version of it isn't particularly highly regarded (it involves, for example, a rather dubious appeal to modal logic, and especially to world-indexed properties).</dd>
<dd>McGrath's article isn't very good, but I see no objection to including a link to it beyond the general Wikipedia policy that we're not a link farm.</dd>
<dd>The same applies to the Plantinga link. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:12, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>you could try to make your point, instead of insisting on a particular link. then there could be discussion about a compromise wording. The article could mention <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodicy.html" title="Theodicy">theodicy</a> as a common motivation for atheism, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a> as a common counter argument. This is all highly trivial, and it should be possible to make mention of it without much ado. We don't need Plantinga to tell us that, that's probably all in Augustine, if not in Plato. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Comment from FuelWagon</span></h4>
<p>I'm not convinced that the article is POV. It seems to do a good job of presenting atheism in the tone of "atheists believe this" or "atheists don't believe that" as the case may be. I think the subsection titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Views_of_atheism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Views_of_atheism" rel="nofollow">Views of atheism</a> <b>might</b> include a sub-subsection about christian views of atheism. However, this should be reported from the point of view of what christians think of atheism and atheists in a neutral way, not an opportunity to insert a christian sermon. The first link especially seems little more than a POV sermon about the supposed end of atheism, which is a highly questionable assertion. The person complaining the article is POV because his partisan links keep getting removed doesn't seem as much interested in presenting the christian point of view of atheism in a neutral tone, rather he seems interested in advocating within the article that atheism is wrong. I think the christian view of atheism is referred to throughout various parts of the article, a quick glance found a paragraph starting with <i>In the European Middle Ages people were persecuted for heresy</i> which fairly well indicates Christianity's hostile relationship to atheism. Later on a paragraph starts with <i>By the 1770s, atheism was ceasing to be a dangerous accusation that required denial</i> which indicates christianity's change to a less hostile view of Christianity. The section ends quoting Bush saying <i>"I don't know that atheists should be regarded as citizens, nor should they be regarded as patriotic. This is one nation under God."</i>, which seems to indicate a return to slightly more hostile responses to atheists, in attitude at least. Perhaps a section under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Views_of_atheism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Views_of_atheism" rel="nofollow">Views of atheism</a> that specifically lists a brief history of christianity's attitude towards atheism would put the christian point of view alongside the other opposing views. This could be done in a neutral manner and would not require the insertion of a link that is little more than advocation against atheism. I'd prefer we keep it on wikipedia and keep it encyclopediac, rather than defer to an outside advocacy site. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 22:11, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>===I mostly agree with FuelWagon. I don't think that the article in general is POV. Atheism is a widely held enough point of view that it does deserve to be presented on its own terms. I think that the statement about widespread scientific support in the introductory paragraph is out of place there. The discussion below about science and atheism is reasonable NPOV. I also agree that if the views of Judaism and Islam on atheism are presented as subsections, so should that of Christianity. It should say that Christianity is inconsistent with atheism, and that Christian views of atheism range from as intolerant as Islam to more moderate criticisms of atheism. Also, the reference to the Christian theologian who recognized that the existence of evil is the <i>killer argument</i> should at least state that he thought he offered his own refutation of it. (If he did not, he would have presumably ceased to be a Christian.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 22:27, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are no "con atheism" links for atheism here. Is atheism so impotent and weak it cannot withstand a few critiques? I don't go beserk and panic when skeptics post links against the reliability of the Christian faith in the Christian categories. What exactly are many atheists afraid of here? I find the absence of con links to be a very poor reflection on the atheist community here. Why is the people of faith seem to be more tolerant and confident at Wikipedia? I think some atheist need to ask this question.</p>

<p>Ken, the lack of "con" links doesn't make the article biased. At worst it <b>might</b> make the section (external links) biased, and we have a tag for that. But generally speaking, getting the links section right is secondary to the article itself.</p>
<p>Can you cite a sentence or paragraph from the article that has an NPOV problem? If not, the article as a whole does not need an NPOV tag.</p>
<p>If you have some con links you would like to provide, propose them on the talk page.</p>
<p>I personally got my start editing Wikipedia on the Atheism article, anonymously. And here I've come full circle.&#160;:) Last I checked, it did not have a POV problem, but I'll admit I haven't read it recently.</p>

<dd>Ken, you seem to be holding a mistaken view of what NPOV means. It does not mean that atheism presents itself in the best possible light and then every religious denomination gets to semonize against it. That is not Neutral Point Of View. The word that you seem to be missing is "neutral". If you read the atheism article, there isn't anything in it that is coming out and <i>advocating</i> for atheism. It pretty much explains what atheism is in its various flavors, some history of atheism, and some current info about it. the article is <b>neutral</b> because it doesn't advocate for or against atheism so much as it simply <i>reports</i> on it. Your links point to sites that are in no way a <i>neutral</i> explanation of Christianity's view on atheism. They <i>advocate</i> against atheism. That is not <i>neutral.</i> Christianity's view of atheism is already contained in the article as I mentioned in my comment above. It just happens to be woven into the article rather than given it's own subsection. Your arguments that your links are being removed because someone is "afraid" of some criticism of atheism and that the article is POV without the links is a misguided interpretation of NPOV. The point is not to advocate "for" atheism and then "neutralize" it by advocating "against" atheism. The point is for the article to be neutral throughout, start to finish, reporting facts. That is NPOV. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 03:46, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, to be fair, according to <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, external links themselves do not have to be neutral. Some representative religious response pages would make a good addition to the article's external links section. But their lack does not indicate a POV problem with the article. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 12:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, while I don't really agree with adding those links, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, for example, does include a link to a piece by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russel_99f1.html" title="Bertrand Russel">Bertrand Russel</a> critical of the religion. Does every article need links to counterpoint pieces and Op-Eds? This is an honest question, I'm not sure what contributes best to the article in cases like this. By way of further comparison, there are no criticisms listed on <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>...</dd>
<dd>That said, Ken, you've basically launched an all-out campaign on every major article related to christianity and it's intersection with modern science, before you've even had a chance to become acclimated to the Wikipedia environment, the concept of concensus, or even the technical aspects or editting the Wiki. I'm not sure this is the best way to accomplish your goal, but your technique is obviously your choice, and you're not really breaking any policy, so I just offer that as my opinion.</dd>

<p>Links are not the issue, the article is. Add a Christian part to Views of Atheism, and give a proper NPOV summary; this is the Wikipedia way. A POV Christian link or two is no substitute for this. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:51, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I would suggest that "Reasons for atheism", "Atheism, morality and religion", "God as a philosophical category" and "types of atheism" need to be merged in some way under a larger heading - something to the effect of "Why are people atheists", but with a better title. Also Reasons for atheism is effecively a list, and very bad form for an encyclopedia article. We need paragraphs and arguments, not quotes! <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:51, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
