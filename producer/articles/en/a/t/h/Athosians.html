An abandoned Athosian city.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like other human cultures throughout Pegasus, the Athosians were subject to periodic culling every few hundred years by the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>. Some time ago, the Athosians were a relatively advanced society, possessing technology such as the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscellaneous_technology_in_Stargate_61d1.html#Athosian_fire_starter" title="Miscellaneous technology in Stargate">Athosian fire starter</a> and living in large cities. However, after the last <i>Great Attack</i>, in which the Wraith almost wiped them out as they do to all species reaching a level of technology that could potentially threaten them, the Athosians abandoned city living and reverted to an <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrarian.html" title="Agrarian">agrarian</a> society to avoid detection by the Wraith.</p>
<p>They still retain some advanced technology, hiding it to avoid detection. The Athosians moved their hunting camps to confuse invaders, and in the past, were known to use nearby <a href="../../../c/a/v/Caves.html" title="Caves">caves</a> to hide in and document the attacks on their planet. However, their people remained prey, and dying in peace, instead of being fed on by the Wraith, is very rare. Also, almost every Athosian has lost someone to the Wraith.</p>

<p>When the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> expedition arrived searching for a viable evacuation site, the Athosian people were initially suspicious of the strange group that had never heard of the Wraith. Eventually, through <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">John Sheppard</a> and their leader, <a href="../../../t/e/y/Teyla_Emmagan_fb1d.html" title="Teyla Emmagan">Teyla Emmagan</a>, the two peoples connected. After several Athosians and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> personnel were abducted in a Wraith attack, Sheppard evacuated the encampment's survivors back to Atlantis. It is unknown if there were any other Athosian villages on the planet. <sup id="_ref-Rising_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Storm_%28Stargate_Atlantis%29_423a.html" title="The Storm (Stargate Atlantis)">The Storm</a> <a href="../../../t/e/y/Teyla.html" title="Teyla">Teyla</a> said that her people were talking of returning to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athos.html" title="Athos">Athos</a> even though she told them that the Wraith had "scorched it bare in revenge for our resistance". This seems to indicate that the at some point in time the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_Expedition_88a2.html" title="Atlantis Expedition">Atlantis Expedition</a> returned to the planet perhaps to see if the Athosians could return now that the threat was over and discovered it destroyed.</p>
<p>As the Athosians had nowhere else to go, the displaced people were forced to remain living in Atlantis. However, they found their new surroundings very intimidating, and were distrusted by several members of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_Expedition_88a2.html" title="Atlantis Expedition">Atlantis Expedition</a>, including Sergeant <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bates_%28Stargate%29_de55.html" title="Bates (Stargate)">Bates</a>. Becoming disgruntled with living in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> city, they eventually relocated to a nearby continent on the Atlantis planet, which had been recently discovered. There, they began a new life. <sup id="_ref-Suspicion_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Suspicion" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, their villages have been evacuated several times when the Wraith threatened to Atlantis. <sup id="_ref-The_Siege_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Siege" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Critical_Mass_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Critical_Mass" title="">[4]</a></sup> When an Ancient delegation temporarily retook control of Atlantis, the Athosians were forced to relocate to another planet.

However, whether they chose to relocate back to Atlantis is unknown. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The Ring Ceremony.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a people, the Athosians hold a special reverence for the Ancestors (better known as the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancients_%28Stargate%29_8c99.html" title="Ancients (Stargate)">Ancients</a>). Although not fanatically worshipped, prayers are often dedicated to them. <sup id="_ref-Hide_and_Seek_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hide_and_Seek" title="">[6]</a></sup> Many Athosians believe the Atlantis Expedition is trespassing on sacred ground by setting up a base in Atlantis, as evident when <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athosian_characters_in_Stargate_bbca.html#Halling" title="Athosian characters in Stargate">Halling</a> objected to destroying the city should the need ever arise.<sup id="_ref-The_Siege_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Siege" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Death is an important cornerstone of the Athosian way of life. Because of the numerous Wraith cullings, an Athosian is considered very lucky if they know when and where they are going to die. <sup id="_ref-Thirty-Eight_Minutes_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thirty-Eight_Minutes" title="">[7]</a></sup> In respect of this knowledge, prayers and meditation are performed to allow the dying and their close friends and family to meditate on their life.</p>
<p>On the even rarer occasion of a funeral, the body is put in the middle of a stone ring, a representation of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a>. During this so-called <i>Ring Ceremony</i>, prayers are said and a song is performed to honour the life of a person who did not die at the hands of the Wraith to celebrate the new journey they undertake with the Ancestors. It is unknown what is done with the body after the ceremony. <sup id="_ref-Critical_Mass_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Critical_Mass" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early morning, the Athosians enjoy a stout tea to brace them for the rest of the day.<sup id="_ref-Rising_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[1]</a></sup> They also eat <i>Tuttleroot</i> soup, a dish that Teyla considers difficult to make.<sup id="_ref-Critical_Mass_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Critical_Mass" title="">[4]</a></sup> In Athosian culture, women are not expected to express their attraction to someone before the male does. <sup id="_ref-Sunday_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sunday" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Interstellar_Relations" id="Interstellar_Relations"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Athosians.html" title="Edit section: Interstellar Relations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interstellar Relations</span></h2>
<p>The Athosians were popular interstellar traders before they evacuated their planet. As a society, they know a great number of Stargate addresses and use them to trade with the people of other worlds. When the Atlantis Expedition first arrived in the Pegasus Galaxy, the Athosians were invaluable in introducing the humans of Earth to the native societies in Pegasus. In the early exploratory missions Athosians accompanied teams to introduce them to other cultures.<sup id="_ref-Suspicion_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Suspicion" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, when some members of the Atlantis Expedition became convinced that an Athosian who strongly disagreed with the Earth expedition taking control of Atlantis was leaking information to the Wraith, the friendship between the two peoples were strained, and the Athosians felt they had no choice but to move to the mainland to separate themselves from the expedition and start again. It was later determined that a necklace worn by Teyla, which was part of a Wraith signalling device, had been responsible for alerting the Wraith to a team's presence on alien worlds, not the Athosians.<sup id="_ref-Suspicion_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Suspicion" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, Teyla introduced <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">Sheppard</a> and his team to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genii.html" title="Genii">Genii</a>, apparently a race of farmers. Eventually, Teyla discovered that the Genii were actually a developed civilization living underground and on the brink of creating a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a>. She was shocked that people she would call friends could kept such a large part of their life hidden for so long from the Athosians. <sup id="_ref-Underground_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Underground" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Genetic_Attributes" id="Genetic_Attributes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/h/Athosians.html" title="Edit section: Genetic Attributes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Genetic Attributes</span></h2>
<p>Like the rest of the native civilisations of the Pegasus Galaxy, Athosians do not possess the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Technology_Activation_gene_ba4b.html" title="Ancient Technology Activation gene">ATA</a> gene as the Ancients never interbred with cultures in Pegasus, only the people of Earth. Several bloodlines however have the ability to 'sense' Wraith approaching, due to their possession of Wraith <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>. Of these people, their leader Teyla has the keenest sense currently known. Her Wraith DNA is so pronounced that she can actually connect to the Wraith telepathic network <sup id="_ref-The_Gift_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Gift" title="">[10]</a></sup> and, to a limited degree, pilot a <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_Hive-Ship_edb7.html" title="Wraith Hive-Ship">Wraith Hive-Ship</a>. <sup id="_ref-Misbegotten_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Misbegotten" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is believed that the ability comes from a man the Athosians once offered sanctuary to many generations ago. This man, along with several others, had been taken during a Wraith culling and then set free again to their homeworld. The people there believed they were blessed by the Ancestors and celebrated their return. But when he and the others started telling the villagers of dreams they were having about the Wraith and in one or two instances, were becoming homicidal, the villagers exiled the "blessed". One man found his way to Athos, where it is believed his descendants are those that can sense the Wraith coming because of their mixed Human/Wraith DNA. <sup id="_ref-The_Gift_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Gift" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
