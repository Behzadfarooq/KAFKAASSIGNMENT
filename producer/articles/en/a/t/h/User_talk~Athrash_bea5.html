<p>Welcome, I arrived on my birthday, April 5, this being the 63rd recurrence. My primary concern is the Modernity Version of the New Testament, secondarily, the definition of omnificence, who, what and wherefore that unique word, and thirdly, could expand on <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmacognosy.html" title="Pharmacognosy">Pharmacognosy</a>. A vision from God appeared in my rain soaked study Bible in 1991. On the quoted Ladder of Divine Ascent, it must rank as a 10. I would consider myself eligible to moderate a spiritual Wikipedia project.</p>

<p>We, the Wikipedia Bible people translate/paraphrase the N.T. within the Weymouth tradition. I set the rules with the first two chapters of the Gospel of John and we see what develops as each verse starting with John 2:23 is up for edit. Unlock the secret, possibly, reverent thinking, definitely. THE RULES: Eliminate the seeming anti-semitism — appears to be regional strife — that is, Galilean against Judean supremacy. This requires <a href="http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/greek/johnpap.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/greek/johnpap.html" rel="nofollow">Judean(s)</a> for Jew(s). Racial epithets invariably are harsh sounds like the N word, Jew (boy), Wop, Slob, Injun, or Chink. "Jews" is emblematic, why not the more historically sound and melodic, Jew-dee-ans? There are 101 believes in John (KJV). Retain "believe" instead of Weymouth's "trust," "regards," or "convinced." The watchword could be I AM [That I Am] He, rather blasphemous in that day. Order of Gospels should be JOHN, MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, and ACTS. What better in the beginning than "In the beginning?" The Catholic Encyclopedia says John had sometimes been first in order in earlier times because of the surety of authorship (or statement of eye-witness account). The Epistles of Paul in historical order, is there a split Timothy movement, there is an outline in Weymouth? Make St. John, "the greatest marvel of all the world's literature," more literary and the most important letters in history more historical, if it happens, this would be a testament to the communion of minds available here and, come on, your particular verse may live forever. Change British spelling and Elizabethan phraseology of Weymouth (sometimes all that is required). Highlight Aramaic origin (at least once). Explain John 7:53, make consistent figures of speech and capitalization throughout, i.e. Life of the Ages (3rd edition Weymouth) = eternal Life (5th edition). I love John's theology, although his discourses are somewhat repetitious. Matthew, Mark and Luke are open source, you can discuss Alpha and Omega till Kingdom come and, wala, Wikibook? Gender neutral when possible. John is the Book of Signs, use "signs" for quoting that word when spoken and substitute, miracles, for the running commentary. Plan to reconstruct an icon "the truth" in Greek of the P52 fragment as the ultimate visual image of the earliest New Testament manuscript. Each new verse will follow Weymouth 5th edition, minor changes have already been made with problem words for the sake of consistency. Bracketed [text] is termed explanatory apposition or inline footnote, could be read not said. Need only three such notes in the Gospel of John, initiate the ultimate Word play, add a touch of the miraculous, and send everybody home. John as a Gospel evidences considerable play on words, punning, and irony, such irony they say, that the "very Christ" (7:26) is proclaiming the Word all about with total impunity.</p>

<p>Why change the verse? example — 2:23 Judeans do sometimes designate their celebrations as Festivals.

<p>Gospel of JOHN</p>
<p><br />
Chapter 1</p>
<p><br />
1 In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God.</p>
<p>2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
<p>3 All things came <b>into being</b> through Him and by His creative power everything was made that was made.</p>
<p>4 In Him was Life and that Life was the Light of the entire human race;</p>
<p>5 for even as the Light shines on in darkness, the darkness has never overtaken it.</p>
<p>6 There appeared a man <b>named John</b>, sent from God <b>as a witness</b>,</p>
<p>7 <s>sent for</s> a witness to testify concerning the Light <b>seeing</b> <s>considering</s> that all might <s>come to</s> <u>believe</u> through Him.</p>
<p>8 John, himself, was not the Light, but <s>was sent</s> <b>did come</b> to bear witness of that Light.</p>
<p>9 <s>Yes,</s> The true Light illuminating every person was, <b>then</b>, coming into the world.</p>
<p>10 He was in the world; He made the world, yet, the world did not know Him.</p>
<p>11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him,</p>
<p>12 though as many as would receive Him − that is, to those who <u>believe</u> in <b>the</b> <s>His</s> name <b>of Jesus</b> − He has given the right to become the children of God,</p>
<p>13 who are not born of blood, not born by physical urge, not born by the will of man, but are those reborn of God [read: the Word].</p>
<p>14 The Word became flesh and lived for a time among us, so that we perceived His glory, glory as of the only born of the Father.</p>
<p>15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because He was in all things before me.’ ”</p>
<p>16 And from His abundance we have, every one of us, received grace upon grace.</p>
<p>17 For even though the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>18 While no one has ever seen God, the only Son by His very closeness to the Father has made Him known.</p>
<p>19 This is the testimony of John, when the leaders of Judea decided to send priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.</p>
<p>20 He had to confess and did not deny the truth, but avowed, “I am not the Messiah.”</p>
<p>21 They said, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He responded, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, his voice gone, “No.”</p>
<p>22 They continued to ask him, “Who are you, that we may answer those that sent us? What do you say for yourself?”</p>
<p>23 “I am THE VOICE,” he replied, “OF ONE CRYING ALOUD IN THE DESERT, MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD” (Isa. 40:3).</p>
<p>24 A delegation of <s>the</s> Pharisees was sent, also,</p>
<p>25 And demanded of him, “Why do you baptize, then, if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?”</p>
<p>26 "I baptize in water only," he replied, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize.</p>
<p>27 He who comes after me is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to unlatch."</p>
<p>28 These events occurred in Bethany beyond the river Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p>29 The next day John saw Jesus coming his way and said, "See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</p>
<p>30 "This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man ranking ahead of me for He was in all things before me.'</p>
<p>31 Even if, at first, I did not recognize Him, my purpose in coming was to baptize in water so that He might be revealed to Israel."</p>
<p>32 John testifying further said, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and remain on Him;</p>
<p>33 I did not know who He was, but the One who sent me to baptize in water told me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</p>
<p>34 This I witnessed while coming to the realization that He is the Son of God."</p>
<p>35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.</p>
<p>36 He looked upon Jesus as He walked by and said as before, "See, the Lamb of God!"</p>
<p>37 After hearing this, the two disciples followed Jesus.</p>
<p>38 Then, Jesus turned and seeing that they followed said, "What is your need?" Their reply, a <s>tentative</s> <b>polite</b>, "Rabbi, (which is to say, Teacher) where are you staying?"</p>
<p>39 He said to them, "Come and see." They went and saw where he stayed and remained there the rest of the day (for it was about four o'clock in the afternoon).</p>
<p>40 One of the two who followed Jesus after John spoke of the Lamb of God was Andrew, the brother of Simon.</p>
<p>41 Soon after the meeting with Jesus, Andrew found Simon and told him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is to say, the Christ);</p>
<p>42 He then brought his brother to Jesus who gazing upon him intently said, "You are Simon, son of Jona: You will be called Kepha" (meaning a rock, being translated Peter).</p>
<p>43 The following day Jesus decided to go to Galilee, and found Philip, and said to him, "Follow Me."</p>
<p>44 Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>
<p>45 Philip, in turn, found Nathana-el, and told him, "We have found him, of whom Moses and the Prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</p>
<p>46 Whereupon, Nathana-el said to him, "Can any good <s>thing</s> come out of Nazareth?" Philip replied, "Come and see."</p>
<p>47 Jesus saw Nathana-el coming and exclaimed, "Look! An Israelite, not in name only, but true."</p>
<p>48 Nathana-el asked, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered, "Even before Philip sought you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</p>
<p>49 Nathana-el said, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</p>
<p>50 Jesus answered <b>saying</b>, "<s>If</s> <b>Because</b> I said, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,' and you <u>believe</u>: What then? If you should see far greater things.</p>
<p>51 In all truthfulness, I say that, hereafter, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</p>
<p><br />
Chapter 2</p>
<p><br />
1 Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.</p>
<p>2 Jesus and His disciples were also invited.</p>
<p>3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to her son, "They have no wine."</p>
<p>4 Jesus said, "Dear woman, what is it to you or to me. My hour has not yet come."</p>
<p>5 His mother instructed the servants, "Whatever He says, do it."</p>
<p>6 Six waterpots of stone were set out in the manner of Judean ceremonial washing, each about twenty gallons.</p>
<p>7 Jesus told the servants, "Fill the pots with water." And they filled them to the brim.</p>
<p>8 Then He said, "Now, take a portion to the table-master." And they did.</p>
<p>9 When the master had tasted the water made wine without knowing the source, (albeit, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom:</p>
<p>10 and said, "The usual host at the very beginning serves good wine, and when the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior; but you saved the best until last."</p>
<p>11 Jesus performed this, the first of His [miraculous] signs, at Cana in Galilee; and as He revealed His glory, His disciples <u>believed</u> in Him.</p>
<p>12 After Cana He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers, and His disciples; and they spent a few days there.</p>
<p>13 Just about this time, the yearly Judean Passover was approaching and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14 In the temple He found the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves: and the moneychangers were also sitting there.</p>
<p>15 And when He had plaited a whip of rushes, He drove those selling oxen and sheep out of the temple, and poured out the changers' money, and overturned the tables.</p>
<p>16 Then, He said to those who sold doves, "Take these things away. Do not make My Father's house, a house of merchandise."</p>
<p>17 And His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR GOD'S HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME” (Ps. 69:9).</p>
<p>18 But the Judean hierarchy issued a challenge, "Give us a sign for doing such things."</p>
<p>19 Jesus said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</p>
<p>20 The hierarchs replied, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and you will rebuild it in three days?"</p>
<p>21 Though, here, He spoke of the temple of His body.</p>
<p>22 So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they <u>believed</u> the Scripture and the prophetic words of Jesus.</p>

<p>Thank you for your courtesy. This is an experiment, I just finished the layout, you found it before I was ready to publicize. I am a newbie, so maybe I won't publish at all.
