<p>What exactly is meant by "The Athlon is an Intel Pentium II compatible processor" - same instruction set?</p>
<p>The major distinctions are in the SIMD instructions, neh?</p>
<hr />
<p>Oh and perhaps this should be linked up as "Athlon"</p>
<hr />
<p>The Athlon is considered "Pentium II compatible" because it supports the Intel MMX instruction set, but not the SSE found in the Pentium III. The Athlon XP added this functionality. Of course, the Athlons also supports instructions the Intel processors do not (3dNow and 3dNow Pro).</p>
<hr />
<p>Some mention of Athlon MP (multiprocessing) would be good. Also, Opteron should be mentioned sometime.</p>
<p>I think all this talk about overclocking should be removed. It is simply unprofessional and does actually add little information.</p>
<hr />
<p>re: Athlon XP: There's a lot of talk about the Thunderbird initially, but what are we reading that's specific to the XP line?

<p>There is a redirect from K7, that can mislead the reader when he types in "K7" and finds out Athlon 64 in the same article. Any ideas how to work it out? I know the main article's title is 'Athlon' but still the redirect is misleading. Elthe 20:28, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone doublecheck the facts relating to the section about the Athlon's design? It states that it is a reworking of the K6 design, but I remember when it was in development that this wasn't the story at all. AMD designed the K5 from scratch, then they bought NexGen which was working on a chip called the Nx6x86. That chip became the AMD K6. In the time being, AMD had acquired engineers from DEC and had begun working on a next generation chip called the "K7", which became the Athlon. In short, the AMD K5 and K7 (Athlon) were designed wholly by AMD, while the K6 was acquired from NexGen. I don't think there's any relation between the architecture of the K6 and Athlon.</p>

<p>A couple of things that stick out to me:</p>
<p>Too many products. Athlon, Athlon XP, mobiles, mention of Athlon 64- it's too much. Some can be resolved with a split, some just needs reworking. I don't think it's appropriate to bring up Opterons, as they are a server chip. Conversely, in the present state of affairs it may be necessary to add Athlon MPs, as they don't have a page of their own.</p>
<p>The topic of overclocking as it stands doesn't really fit. Some mention of it could be made in a different context, I suppose. Also, there is no explanation of the selection process that separates out Mobiles. Power Now! is not linked.</p>
<p>The article jumps from μm to micrometre as a measure of process size. It's inconsistent and confusing. Normally in discussions of process size, either μm or the term micron is used (except where nm is more appropriate). I'd be happy to stick with μm.</p>
<p>The abbreviation FSB is used inconsistently and without being directly expanded as front side bus. It's linked twice in the main body and repeatedly in the "Models" section. Conversely, Vcore, L1-cache, and L2-cache are never linked.</p>
<p>Codenames are not consistently italicized. What is the consensus on how this should be handled?</p>
<p>The Athlon XP logo down the right side should really be replaced with a picture of a Palomino in order to fit in with the rest of the images on the right. And if we're going that route, a Barton pictures makes sense as well. <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAluvus_32e3.html" title="User:Aluvus">Aluvus</a> 11:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've added headings to this talk page so the threads are separated more visibly.</dd>
<dd>I think everybody will benefit if you or anyone removes all the editing inconsistencies like different and non-standard units, and sanitize linking.</dd>
<dd>However I think the article reads quite well, particularly overclocking is described in connection to the development of the chip. Any removing or splitting should be well thought-out. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 14:25, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it right for this article to include the Athlon XPs as well? I realize the technical differences between the T-bird and XP are pretty minor, but you'd think the new name would merit a separate article, in the same way that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_II_de8e.html" title="Pentium II">Pentium II</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_III_cb74.html" title="Pentium III">Pentium III</a> are separate (Deschutes P2 and Katmai P3 were nearly identical). <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 10:30, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since the FSB wars that have involved this and related pages seem to have started again, I'll try a new compromise: using MT/s for transfer rates. It's something I've seen used quite a bit, so I figure it's worth a try (and MT/s pretty much means MHz anyway--it's just semantics). I'm using this article as the testbed, as this is where the latest edit involving FSB semantics has hsppened. If this goes over well, I'll stick it in other applicable articles. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">Jgp</a> 09:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The name "Athlon" was chosen by AMD as short for "decathlon". " Where did that come from?

<p>Should we put more information on the process of building an Athlon into the article? I mean: About the technology that is used to build it. Especially the bonding concerns me, since I have heard in the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, that it is done in case of very little contacts by humans, who might get health damage by certain gases and fumes... --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomer_Landskirty_2f11.html" title="User:Homer Landskirty">Homer Landskirty</a> 23:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the reference mentioning the existence of an AthlonXP 3300+ Barton because such a CPU cannot be found anywhere on the HP website for that model. In fact, the HP site states the desktop in question used an Athlon64:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=c00280647&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN#N299" class="external free" title="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=c00280647&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN#N299" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=c00280647&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN#N299</a></p>
<p>All other references to an AthlonXP 3300+ Barton in the a810n are those that cite the Wikipedia reference, which violates the rules regarding verification of fact. We cannot verify that such a CPU exists if we're citing sources that are citing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Further research into the alleged a810 3300+ Barton needs to be conducted.ShadowTao 05:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
