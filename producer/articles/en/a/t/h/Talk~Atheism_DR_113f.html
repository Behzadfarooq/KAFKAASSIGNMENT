<p>Atheism is the disbelief in, or denial of, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">gods</a>.</p>
<p>No particular problem - though why not just <i>divine</i>? (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No special reason, except then we'd be unique amongst reference sources in stating it that way. They all say "God or gods", pretty much. But divine would be ok too. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 00:33, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Divine" is not as precise as God/gods, or even deity/deities. It is only an oblique reference to God. Additionally, Sam is right, it is not a common way of defining atheism.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 14:51, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My reasoning is that most of what is covered by issues of God/god/gods, etc. can be more simply dealt with by 'divine'- I have no strong issues about this -</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regardless, there are all sorts of problems saying "God" without defining what God means to an atheist! - If Bob disbelieves in e.g. god the omnipotent, god the judge, god the creator, but believes in the possibility of omniscience and omnipresence, is Bob a theist or an atheist? I guess that depends upon interpretation - for those who think that omniscience is cognate with the divine, Bob is a theist - yet for those who think that omniscience does not entail the divine, Bob could be an atheist. Hmm.&#160;:-) (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't care what God means to an atheist, it is intrinsic to their position that they misunderstand the nature of God. Rather my concern is how an atheist can objectively be labeled. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 14:19, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many atheists feel it is intrinsic to the theist's position that they misunderstand the nature of atheism and the likelihood of God. Do you think personal opinions like that are really helpful here? If you do, then you should enlighten the atheists and define the nature of God for everyone so we can proceed.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 14:51, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough - though I feel that 'misunderstand the nature of' may be more adequately expressed as 'disbelieve in', as 'misunderstand' is your POV, not theirs! They would say that theists misunderstand the nature of God! (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

<p>I feel that as an opening definition "Atheism is the lack of belief in the existence of a deity. Atheism can involve the positive assertion that there is no deity. Atheism can be the absence of a belief that there is a deity." is more accurate and consistent with both the academic and common definitions. I'm open to reasoned arguments or appeals otherwise. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 14:51, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>"...two meanings: Primarily it is the belief in gods or goddesses. The word originated in Ancient Greece and signified belief in the traditional gods, the Olympians.</dd>
<dd>It can also mean the belief in God, a god, or gods, who is/are actively involved in maintaining the Universe.This secondary meaning is shown in context to other beliefs concerning the divine,..."</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- This is important because the 'base' definition of atheism is that it is 'not theism'. Look at many dictionaries definition of theism (and theist if separate) first and then atheism (and atheist if separate), if the definition of atheism is 'not theism' then they are being 'true to the language' (if one can actually say that). The etymology states "The literal meaning of the term is therefore 'lack of belief in a god.'". This is the very basic and full definition and seems like nothing needs to be added. The 'disbelief' or some active stance would narrow down the definition. This needs to be pointed out if one is going to do that in a dictionary or encyclopedia. Especially since there is more space here than a ' normal' encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- While the proper noun "God" may be included this again narrows down the definition. Of course, if they don't believe in any god, they obviously don't believe in God. This is unnecessary as part of the definition, however it should be noted that many (in this hemisphere anyway) do note it as not believing in God.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- It should be pointed out somewhere that some view the definition (as above) as not believing in <b>their</b> god(s). Since they believe that their god(s) is all powerfull and the only, it would seem natural that they would assume anyone not believing in it/them to be atheist. For instance, the Romans veiw toward christians (and other religions that rejected their pantheon) or some chrisians toward other some other religions.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>In brief, Atheism is disbelief in the divine. Some consider Atheism to be a state of merely lacking such beliefs, while others consider Atheism to be the active disbelief or denial of the divine. Some religious communities consider the term to be cognate with Infidel and atheist can be found being used in a pejorative manner.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>- Is this the one we are to argue for or against? I will have to argue against if that is the case. 'disbelief' seems like an active stance (such as the way dictionary.com defines <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=disbelief" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=disbelief" rel="nofollow">disbelief</a>) and narrows the definition down. It is 'not theism' or 'without the belief in a deity' (which doesn't appear to need to be plural). 'divine' seems ok, but rather odd (POV of course). The other two sentences seem just fine, but could use some work. Maybe the following would be ok?</p>
<ul>
<li>- <i>Atheism is not having belief in the divine. The term atheism includes those having an active stance of disbelief or denial toward the divine and is often viewed as such. Some religious communities consider the term to be cognate with Infidel and atheist can be found being used in a pejorative manner.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>- I need to work on my writing ability, so maybe someone else can brush it up. Maybe the first sentence would be more appropriate with 'the lack of' instead of 'not having' and 'a deity' for 'the divine', but I'm unsure which seems most appropriate.</p>

<p>By its strictist definition, atheism entails an absence of belief in <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> or gods, but in common usage it usually refers to a disbelief in all things <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendental.html" title="Transcendental">transcendental</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a>. This does not always preclude belief in the possibility or probability of an advanced <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra-terrestrial.html" title="Extra-terrestrial">extra-terrestrial</a> species that exerts "god-like" powers because this is a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_naturalism.html" title="Philosophical naturalism">naturalistic</a> notion that does not require, by neccessity, admittance of transcendental or supernatural forces. I think that common usage is highly important to the definition of a word, and I see no reason to exclude mention of it in the introduction. When most people use the word "atheist" they refer to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_naturalism.html" title="Philosophical naturalism">philosophical naturalism</a>, and in spite of this technically being a misusage of the word "atheism," it is important for us to bow to common usage. Pointing out that atheists generally reject Buddhism is too specific, and "divine" is both generally used to refer, either literally or poetically, to that which approaches or is like <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> (E.G.: "To err is human, but to forgive is divine") and has common roots with "deity." Therefore, I think that a word that calls to mind all things that are not naturalic would be ideal. Contest the appropriateness of "supernatural" and "transcendental" if you will, but "divine" simply doesn't work in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Mutz_713b.html" title="User:Bill Mutz">Bill Mutz</a> 00:26, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In order to avoid sparking a revert war on the DR page, I would prefer it if I were the only one to edit it and it would only be edited after discussion of the section or sections to be edited and the change agreed upon by all parties. I think this will raise tensions less than seeing changes on the page out of no where, which is what was occurring with the article previously.</dd>
<dd>I will open discussion on any section you would like to change; however, and we can discuss the proposed change to see if there are objections. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyler1534_f063.html" title="User:Skyler1534">Skyler</a><a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESkyler1534_414b.html" title="User talk:Skyler1534"><b>1534</b></a> 02:14, Oct 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There hasn't been any significant work on this article since October of last year, the dispute this article was created for is passed, and the current version of the atheism article is progressing beyond what was worked on here. To top it all off, this is a "scratch" page that's sitting in the main article namespace as if it was a real article. I think it should be moved or deleted, is anyone still watching it? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:46, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
