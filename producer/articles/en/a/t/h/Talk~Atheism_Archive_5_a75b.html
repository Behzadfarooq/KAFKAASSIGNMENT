<p>User:12.231.81.82 added the following to the article. Am posting it here for record.</p>
<p>[Minority report: As an agnostic I would like to point out that whoever wrote what follows below is operating under a popular misconception of what agnosticism is. The issue is religious belief that an ad hoc hypothetically invisible god might exist (theist) and the absence of that belief (atheist), or the outright denial and repudiation of such religious belief that an ad hoc hypothetically invisible god might exist, on principle (agnostic).</p>
<p>Here is the whole situation in a nutshell:</p>
<p><br />
Theism is characterized by a belief that a magic invisible god might exist.</p>
<p>"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of gods." -- <a href="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html" class="external free" title="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html</a></p>
<p>Agnostics, also atheist, go one step further to deny and repudiate religious belief in the existence of gods:</p>
<p>"That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence." -- Thomas Huxley, who coined the term 'agnostic', in his excoriation of the Christian belief, "Agnosticism and Christianity" <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" class="external free" title="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" rel="nofollow">http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html</a> ]</p>

<hr />
<p>Whatever Huxley and even infidels.org said, in modern usage the term "atheist" means denial and repudiation of the existence of a god associated with this universe. Agnosticism is something like non-belief, lack of belief, etc., wrt such a god. Every atheist (quite a few) and atheist organization I know (with the possible exception of infidels.org) defines atheism that way. Agnostics may define themselves any way they please, but that's another topic. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairandbalanced_3a34.html" title="User:Fairandbalanced">Fairandbalanced</a> 01:25, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it seems to be that most atheists and atheist organizations seem to not claim absolutely that a god does not exist, but instead takes their position on lack of evidence that supports the multiple claims of deities. Since they view such claims as usually as silly as the existence of Santa Claus, Bigfoot, etc, they find the likelihood of a deity existing to be less likely than one existing, thus they are not neutral, but recognize a god could exist outside of their knowledge. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 01:57, Jan 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a>'s questions regarding edits made by <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">User:JackLynch</a></span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">User:JackLynch</a> asked me to explain my dispute with his changes here on talk:, so here they are.</p>
<p>In the opening paragraph, he changed this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The literal meaning of the term is therefore <i>without a belief in a god or gods</i>, making any person who does not believe in the existence of a god or gods an atheist -- including both those who assert that no gods exists and those who, for whatever reason, do not make any assertion regarding the existence of gods.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The literal meaning of the term is therefore <i>without a belief in a god or gods</i>, making any person who does not believe in the existence of a god or gods an atheist.</dd>
</dl>
<p>ie, removing everything after the dash, which IMO was an important clarification of the term's meaning.</p>
<p>At the end of the first paragraph, he changed this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism is not synonymous with <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreligion.html" title="Irreligion">irreligion</a>; the idea of an eternal non-created universe is an important concept in some religions and as such it is possible to be very religious and very atheistic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism is not synonymous with <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreligion.html" title="Irreligion">irreligion</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which also removed clarity, in this case an explanation of how one can be both "religious" and an atheist. Many Buddhists would fit under this description, for example.</p>
<p>In the second paragraph, he changed this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> (coined by <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._H._Huxley_e14a.html" title="T. H. Huxley">T. H. Huxley</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>) describes a form of philosophical <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scepticism.html" title="Scepticism">scepticism</a> in which the existence of gods is considered undecidable or in which inquiry into the existence is considered unproductive.</dd>
</dl>
<p>to this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> (coined by <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._H._Huxley_e14a.html" title="T. H. Huxley">T. H. Huxley</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>) describes a form of philosophical <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scepticism.html" title="Scepticism">scepticism</a> in which the existence of gods is considered undecided.</dd>
</dl>
<p>which is a significantly different definition of agnosticism from what's in its Wikipedia article, and simply incorrect as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>He also changed this line from later on in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothwithstanding Cold War attitudes, atheists are legally protected from discrimination in the United States and they have been among the strongest advocates of the legal separation of church and state.</dd>
</dl>
<p>to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothwithstanding Cold War attitudes, atheists are legally protected from discrimination in the United States and they have been the strongest advocates of the legal separation of church and state.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Removing the "among." I'd like to see some sort of evidence before stating categorically that atheists are <i>the</i> strongest advocates of separation of church and state. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:33, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>wow, thats hard to read. Here goes</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Atheism asserts that no God exists. Those that don't make any assertian at all arn't atheists.</li>
<li>"the idea of an eternal non-created universe is an important concept in some religions and as such it is possible to be very religious and very atheistic." you make a valid objection, it will be replaced, or rewriten.</li>
<li>Thank you for alerting me to the errors on the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> page, I am looking into it.</li>
<li>"Nothwithstanding Cold War attitudes, atheists are legally protected from discrimination in the United States and they have been among the strongest advocates of the legal separation of church and state." I don't believe I can provide such documentation, and so the ambiguous statement will be restored or rewriten. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 03:03, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Re point 1: that's incorrect. An atheist lacks belief in any gods. Some atheists <i>also</i> assert that no gods exist, but that is not a necessary implication of simply lacking a belief in any gods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re point 3: even with the changes you made to the agnosticism page, it still doesn't match what you've written here. You wrote that an agnostic believes the issue is undecided, whereas the definition is that an agnostic believes the issue is undecide<b>able</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, amending that; you've changed the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> article to agree with this. So now I disagree with <i>both</i> the changes you made here and the changes you made to agnosticism.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd><a href="http://encyclopedia.com/html/a1/agnostic.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://encyclopedia.com/html/a1/agnostic.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> appears to agree with "undecideable" rather than "undecided". <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=agnostic" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=agnostic" rel="nofollow">agnostic</a> has many different definitions from a collection of different dictionaries, with the first two agreeing with "undecideable" and the second two with "undecided" (IMO). A better definition to check in this case, though may be <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=agnosticism" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=agnosticism" rel="nofollow">agnosticism</a>; all four of those agree with "undecideable" (and indeed the Websters definition there appears to be an expansion of the Websters definition for agnostic that seemed to fall into the "undecided" camp above). The third one is from 1898 and appears written from a Christian POV to me, so I would advise against using that as a reference when others are available. However, it too looks more like the "undecideable" than the "undecided" definitions. I'm going to change that back in the article, and if there's further dispute we should take it to the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Talk%7EAgnosticism_6491.html" title="Talk:Agnosticism">talk:agnosticism</a> page. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:58, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do not revert useful, or even debatable additions, but rather vandalism only. The recent revert of my numerous spelling and grammer corrections, along w change from lower case to upper case "G" in God, was thoughtless, unneccessary, and contrary to the spirit of wiki. Make improvements, not reverts. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 02:35, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look, I can discuss the differences between "g" and "G", I agree they have different meanings. However, it is clear that <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> needs to be reviewed by those who feel reversion is an acceptable response to an emminantly debatable difference (and not to mention reverted the spelling and grammer corrections I had spent no small amount of time making) of opinion. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 02:47, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an expert in these matters, but to me, <i>God</i> seems more POV than <i>god</i> as it implies worship. Furthermore, <i>God</i> seems only reserved for the Christian one, because I have never seen <i>the God Zeus</i> or <i>the God Thor</i> anywhere. And since atheism is a disbelief in all kinds of gods, narrowing it down to the Christian god seems wrong. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdice_53f8.html" title="User:Mrdice">Mrdice</a> 02:53, 2004 Jan 13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see the G/g as so much implying worship, as the English-language convention that improper nouns are lower cased, and proper nouns - as in the god named 'God' - are upper. The only place I've seen "the God Foo" is, if I recall, in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Eddings_f67a.html" title="David Eddings">David Eddings</a>' novels (hey, I was young). <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalsa_Shark_0519.html" title="User:Salsa Shark">Salsa Shark</a> 03:04, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Actually, God is not only the Christian God, but the proper, reverent term for God amongst monotheists, and even some polytheists. See the article <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> for more info. IMO using the term "gods" is far more POV, since that does NOT include or refer to the one God worshipped by the vast majority of the world population <a href="http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/xx.html#People" class="external autonumber" title="http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/xx.html#People" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Hindu's, BTW refer to Brahma as God, thus making the spelling "God" (when using english, of course!) the term appropriate for use in refering to the entity worshipped by over 70% of the worlds population. I seriously doubt atheists mean only to specify disbelief in the varied, ancient polytheistic gods, such as Zues, Thor, etc...&#160;;) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 03:15, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm the one who did the reversion. I did because it wasn't the first time that someone changed the "g" to a "G" today, making it very POV, and I was afraid that it was the start of some kind of (pardon the pun) holy war. I was under the impression that most of your other changes were made only to make it difficult to revert all the "G" by hand to their correct, neutral, lower case form, making it <i>Cheval de Troy</i> vandalism. Also, I agree with what <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdice_53f8.html" title="User:Mrdice">Mrdice</a> said above. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeCapone_8ccc.html" title="User:MikeCapone">MikeCapone</a> 03:10, 2004 Jan 13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what your problem is, Jack, but "god" remains uncapitalized in much the same way "dad" or "mom" remain uncapitalized. If you are referring to a specific "mom", for example, you would say: "Hey, Mom, can I eat an orange now?". It's painfully obvious you're a biased theist trying to screw up the page, and even then I would consider that vandalism. You are not trying to "correct grammatical errors" but to forward your weird religious agenda. Quit it, and use a dictionary if you have to. If I see that crap, I'll revert it myself as well.

I say you are vandalizing the page because you made the page POV and then changed it back after someone corrected it. It's okay if YOU are POV, but when you change an article incorrectly and then refuse to let the fixes stand it's obvious that you are trying to make the article POV. "God" is not capitalized when used in the general sense. Neither is "mom", "dad", "aunt", or any other similar noun. Only when it is used as a pronoun is it capitalized. Atheists do not just not believe in a specific "God", but other gods as well. Atheists are not only atheists to the Christian or general "God". And quit trying to act like you're so scholarly, you don't even know the basic rules behind nouns and pronouns. Go somewhere else to push your weird agenda, and lay off this "atheists deny "God"! B.S. It's ridiculous, and it's grammatically incorrect. Sorry pal, but it's not just your god atheists don't believe in. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 02:39, Jan 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh yeah, and the difference between "god" and "God" has already been well-noted here. I doubt you even read the web-page you linked to; if you didn't, it's atheism you don't understand. As noted on the page you linked to, <i>When spelled with a capital "G" it is a proper noun, usually the name given in English to the one supreme being as postulated by the three major Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism. When spelled with a small "g" it is a common noun, referring to a postulated supernatural being of any religious system, as for example the gods of the Greek and Roman religions.</i> And guess what? Atheists don't believe in "gods" or "god". It doesn't matter if it's plural or singular! Atheists don't just not believe in a specific god, it's "god" in general. Please go back to English class. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 02:43, Jan 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the article "God" to call the spelling with a capital "G" only a "proper noun" is a little disingenuous. It is similar (but different in a critical way) to calling "Man" a proper noun. The capitalized spelling, used for "the Being perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness who is worshipped as creator and ruler of the universe" (Webster's), is more essentially understood as the root of the word; the non-capitalized spelling is a derivative, evoking the general idea of God, but for lesser supernatural beings.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More to the point: God is not a god. So the article "Atheism" as presently written does not properly define atheism because it does not say that atheists do not believe in God, only that they do not believe in a god or gods. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnstone_0b7c.html" title="User:Johnstone">Johnstone</a> 13:51, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>God is not a god? What is it, then? Your definition here seems to be very specific, excluding both all manner of polytheistic system (or labelling them as "lesser supernatural beings," which may be inaccurate or POV for some belief systems) and monotheistic creator-gods who are <i>not</i> perfect in power or wisdom or goodness. Would you consider a believer in the Greek pantheon to be an atheist, for example? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:01, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the problem here is that these particular theists who are intent on altering <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> think their conception of god should receive special treatment because they think there god is "better than" other gods, and actually exists. It doesn't matter if you define god to mean an omnipotent, omniscient power or simply a being capable of supernatural powers. It's the same to most atheists either way, as most I know do not believe in god, as per the common definition of god or gods. I could as well say their is one great Fairy, better than all the other fairies, and insist that "afairieism" must include mention of this Great Fairy, fairy being capitalized. It's ridiculous. As for the definition of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>, there is nothing wrong with that. I've seen more atheists describe themselves as "lacking a belief in god" than saying "I don't believe in god". The difference is a semantic one and probably due to the scientific nature of many atheists, because they do not claim that a god CANNOT exist... - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 21:09, Jan 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word "god" with a lowercase "g" refers only to a "being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers, and to require worship, [but also] <u>controlling a particular aspect or part of reality</u>." (Webster's again, with my underlining). Such a definition does not include the omnipotent, omniscient God. I assume that most people will understand the words according to standard, accepted definitions. To be clear, the defintion of an atheist should be "one who does not believe in any god(s) or God". It's not about seeking special treatment.

<p>"1&#160;: <i>Capitalized</i>&#160;: the supreme or ultimate reality: as a&#160;: the Being perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness who is worshiped as creator and ruler of the universe b Christian Science&#160;: the incorporeal divine Principle ruling over all as eternal Spirit&#160;: infinite Mind 2&#160;: a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship; <i>specifically</i>&#160;: one controlling a particular aspect or part of reality"</p>
<p>Now, you changed "; <i>specifically</i>", to ", [but also]". The piece you replaced does not have the same meaning as the piece you used. <i>Capitalized</i> and <i>specifically</i> are used as selectors, to refine which meaning is intended. The semi-colon rather than comma before specifically also indicates a split rather than the simple continuation you used with a comma. Your rewriting changesd a selector to a restriction and gave rise to your claim that god was limited to only a being controlling an aspect and could not also be omnipotent and omniscient. Better to use the real Websters definition, which is consistent with the use in this article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">Jamesday</a> 21:24, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "Division of Senses" section of the Explanatory Notes in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate dictionary explains "The sense divider <i>specif</i> (for <i>specifically</i>) is used to introduce a common but highly restricted meaning subsumed in the more general preceding definition." As far as this goes, it agrees what you have just written. However, the example that it uses: "pontiff . . . <i>n</i> . . . <b>2</b>&#160;: BISHOP; <i>specif</i>&#160;: POPE", is instructive. Now, while the word "<a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiff.html" title="Pontiff">pontiff</a>" may actually mean "bishop", most people are unfamiliar with this usage, and would understand it to mean "pope". Similarly, while the word "god" (with lowercase "g") may mean "a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship", most people will understand it to mean "one controlling a particular aspect or part of reality". Thus, while using only the word "god" is technically OK, from a practical standpoint, it will be appear to be wrong to the large majority of readers, since the more general definition is not commonly known. Wikipedia should not be esoteric.

<dd>God is not a god. The reason: God is defined as (among other things) a being of unlimited power, while a god is defined as (among other things) a being of limited power. A being of unlimited power is not a being of limited power. QED. (For the record: I was wrong about the root of the word in my initial posting above. The word "god" existed in the English language before it was appropriated for the God of monotheism. It meant "the one invoked" or "the one sacrificed to", and was used to refer to pagan deities and the like.

Within this scheme, agnosticism represents a rationale for weak atheism. However, none of these terms are in common use.

You are correct to say "the literal defintion of atheism <i>is</i> "not a theist", what I am pointing out is that agnostics, non religious persons, ordinary secular non-church goers <b>are not</b> by necessity atheists. While some of them (apparently about 2.44% of that larger 14%) do agree to being callled atheists, the rest do not, and it is innaccurate and unfair to lump them into that catagory. Atheism is very specific ly <b>not</b> following God. The others are indifferent, uncertain, unmotivated, angry at God, or what have you. The specifics of why <b>they</b> arn't specific types of theists isn't the issue here, because while they may not go to church, that in no way makes them atheist. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">JackLynch</a> 07:59, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The other changes you made that someone took out in a revert when you changed "god" to "God" were an honest mistake and should stay, but these other ones are NOT NPOV and SHOULD NOT STAY Again, please stop.

Bear in mind three things: (a) it's only for 24 hours to allow a cooling off, (b) you have every opportunity to create a case for your point of view here on talk in the meantime, (c) the thing that tipped me over the edge and decided me that the page needed to be protected was that (as it seemed at the time) you had stooped to dishonest edit summaries. Since then, I have read your apology and assurance that the misleading summaries were not deliberate but simply mistakes. Fair enough.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weak atheism vs. agnosticism</span></h2>
<p>JackLynch seems to assert that "weak atheism" is an attempt by online writers to include agnosticism as a type of atheism. I would like to see evidence for that assertion. For one thing, there is obviously a philosophical difference between saying "I don't believe in God" (weak atheism) and "I think the question whether God exists is unanswerable / irrelevant" (agnosticism). To me, the distinction seems to be fairly clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I believe God doesn't exist / cannot exist" - strong atheism</li>
<li>"I don't believe in the existence of God / it has not been proven" - weak atheism</li>
<li>"The question whether God exists is unanswerable / irrelevant" - agnosticism</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 03:00, Jan 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is based on a misunderstanding of the views of <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnostics</a>. Your above statement for agnostics is not an overview of agnisticism, but rather an extremely small portion of their philosophy. The best way to sum it up is</p>
<ul>
<li>agnosticism is the view that the existance of God is undecided.</li>
</ul>
<p>That of course includes weak atheism (a term I have never heard outside of this page, and which I am wondering if deserves mention, it clearly has not inspired a page) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 03:03, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Er, that last paragraph is a non sequitur. Why does your definition of agnosticism "of course" include weak atheism? It seems to me that "I don't believe that God exists" and "I believe the existence of God is undecided" are clearly different statements. In scholarly circles, "weak atheism" is probably more commonly known as "negative atheism", but given that the modern atheist movement manifests itself most strongly in the form of communities such as the ones you find online, it seems entirely appropriate to favor the definitions provided by said movement.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 03:24, Jan 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have argued the definition of agnosticsm with Jack previously, and at this point I feel fairly confident in saying I think he's simply wrong; he claims that agnosticism means "the existance of god is unknown" whereas most of the sources I've found (including ones he's directed me to) indicate that it means "the existance of god is unknow<b>able</b>." This is a significant distinction, and it makes agnosticism independant of the question of atheism/theism. For example, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> was an agnostic theist <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08603a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08603a.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> - he believed that one could only believe in God on the basis of faith, not through empirical knowledge or logical deduction (so says my cursory reading of that article, anyway). The common colloquial usage of the term is now a fuzzy "uncertain about god's existance," true, but this is an encyclopedia and I think it's entirely proper to be using the <i>techincal</i> meaning of terms in their appropriate contexts. Otherwise, we lose an important shading of philosophical perspective. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:53, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

It leaves human society without a basis for order and human government without foundation (Romans 1:10-32). All is hopeless, all is wretchedness, all is tending to the grave and the grave ends all."

<p>Jack, that edit stating that the 2.44% might be an overestimate is hopelessly POV and grossly inaccurate. The website you were citing says that the number might be lower than the quoted one, because it also includes non-religious people in its count of "atheists". The cia however has differentiated between non-religion (12.x%) and atheism (2.x%). This is very POV indeed. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 07:38, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Estimates for atheism alone range from 200 to 240 million. But these come primarily from China and former Soviet Union nations (especially Russia). Prior to Communist takeovers of these regions and government attempts to eradicate religion, both places had very high levels of affiliation with organized religions (especially Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism), as well as high levels of participation in and belief in traditional local traditions such as shamanism, ancestor ceremonies, spiritism, etc. Since the fall of Communism in former Soviet nations and the relaxation of anti-religious policies in China, observed religious affiliation and activity has increased dramatically, especially in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<p>China probably does have the largest number of actual atheists of any country in the world and many Russians clearly remain atheists. But at this point, it is impossible to accurately determine how many of those classified as atheists or nonreligious during Communist-era USSR and by the current Chinese government are actually atheists according to their personal beliefs, and how many are unregistered religious adherents or participants in less-organized traditional systems that are oriented around ancestors, animism, shamanism, etc. Many people are unaware, for instance, that China has one of the largest, most active Christian communities in the world, and that in many former Soviet nations religions such as shamanism, Islam and Russian Orthodoxy remained even while official government reports announced the elimination of religion in these regions.</p>
<p>In the Western world, Europe is by far the place with the most self-avowed nonreligious, atheists and agnostics, with the nonreligious proportion of the population particularly high in Scandinavia. The Encyclopedia Britannica reports approximately 41 million atheists in Europe. The self-described nonreligious segment of society in Australia and New Zealand is also high, at around 15%. In Australia less than a tenth of one percent described themselves as atheists in the latest national census (1996). In the U.S. about 7.5% of the population describe themselves as nonreligious, 0.7% describe themselves as agnostic, and a smaller number describe themselves as atheist (Kosmin, National Survey of Religious Identification, 1990).

<p>You have not at all answered my question about how you quoted that page.

Well, there is also reasons for it being too low (like morwen mentioned). You are free to cite that link if you use it in a responsible manner. Ie after giving the arguments why it might be exaggerated.

<p>Hey, Jack, fair go. <i>Lots</i> of places.</p>
<p>You tried being an athiest in Iran lately? (For example.) I had an interesting conversation with an Iranian refugee a while ago. He was in fact a Christian, but his point was that it didn't matter what your belief was, if you were not Muslim, you were in <i>huge</i> trouble. His tale of escape from the regime was chilling, all the more so because he told it in such a matter-of-fact, low-key way. He had obviously taken huge risks, but didn't want to talk about them much.</p>
<p>Or, for that matter, you can even try it in a "modern", "democratic" country like the USA or Canada or Australia. There are substantial barriers placed in the way of athiests in our "free" countries. Few of them are official, but they are suibstantial nevertheless. For example, athiests are barred from becoming members of Rotary, and until recently were barred from joining the Boy Scouts Association. Athiests are actively discouraged from attending the 30% of Australian schools that enjoy 70% of all educational funding and produce maybe 90% of our doctors, lawyers, and captains of industry. In short, even here in Australia - a much less religious country than the USA - if you are an athiest, it pays to keep very quiet about it.</p>
<p>In consequence, any figures you see on athieism in countries like the US or the UK must be treated with deep suspicion. If we have learned one thing from psychological and sociological survey research over the years, it is this: people answer questions with the answers that they think people want to hear, and athiests in (e.g.) Australia or New Zealand have had a lifetime's practice at giving "nice", "conventional" (i.e., lip-service to religion) answers - just as much practice, indeed, as their Christian counterparts have had in the former Soviet Union. To be sure, the ultimate penalties are less severe, but social pressure is social pressure, and we humans, social animals that we are, bend to social pressures as a stalk of grass bends before the breeze.</p>

<p>Splendid POV, have any sources? I have spoken to atheists <b>IN</b> iran! They had no problem telling me first that they were muslim, and second that they did not believe in god, and found the subject of religion repugnant. I have heard from muslim friends of mine that atheism is seen as a lesser evil, since at least it doesn't promote a false God or false teachings, and isn't seen by many muslims as apostacy at all. And as far as what you said about atheists in america... I nearly bit my tongue off&#160;;) Have you any idea what those rascals are doing to us?

<p>Tannin, I think you'll find private schools enjoy 70% of all <i>Federal</i> funding.

<p>"Some [3] distinguish between a narrow, strict category "strong atheism" (the explicit rejection of the existence of gods) and "weak atheism" (a lack of belief in gods but no explicit rejection). They also use these two terms in describing whether one believes in the existence of gods as an impossibility (strong atheism), or that the existence of gods is possible but no evidence indicates one does exist (weak atheism). In the freethought tradition, terms such as "positive" and "negative" atheism are used."</p>
<p>this section needs a counterpoint, and these views are simply innaccurate. Review any unbiased information source. You will find no such definitions of atheism. You only find these terms at biased sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are no "unbiased information sources" on a subject as this -- there are only sources which collect different points of view neutrally, as we do (all of them "biased"). This definition is clearly held by some people, whether you like it or not. There are plenty of atheist websites which use the weak / strong distinction, and it is also used in atheist literature:</dd>

<dd>The word `atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusally. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts there is no such being as God,' I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively. I want the originally Greek prefix 'a' to be read in the same way in 'atheist' as it customarily is read in such other Greco-English words as 'amoral,' 'atypical,' and 'asymmetrical'. In this interpretation an atheist becomes: someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter. [Antony G.N.

<p>There ARE reliable sources, despite what some might say. Such sources should be cited with clarification that the number may be greater, or smaller, due to circumstances described. I also insist opon documentation of contemporary persecution of atheists. As my wife pointed out, classic persectutions are a non-issue. The inquisition burned EVERYBODY.

<p>Certainly, in fact it reminds me of the wikipedia! But you don't HAVE to be a witch, or an atheist, or a troll, or whatnot. All it takes is the accusation coming from the right place. It doesn't matter your religious beliefs or other such "proofs", if the accuser was sufficiently above the accused in hierachy, they went to burn on the stake. In "the grand inquisitor" Jesus himself returns to the earth during the inquisition, and is promptly tortured and burned. Atheists had no special status, nor any special danger. The true danger is always for the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformer.html" title="Reformer">radical</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 05:04, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, this doesn't make any sense. First, you are confusing the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> and the much less regulated <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchhunt.html" title="Witchhunt">witchhunts</a>. It was the specific function of the Inqusition to go after <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heretic.html" title="Heretic">heretics</a>, a group to which atheists obviously belonged. The "if the accuser was sufficiently above the accused" argument is more applicable to the witchhunts, which often happened without any central organization, but even in this case, atheists were obviously at greater risk of being accused if they publicly pronounced their beliefs.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think there is also some misunderstanding here between thoughts and actions. Of course nobody is prosecuted for simply <i>believing</i> the wrong things, how would anyone else know? They may suffer if they fail to abide by certain societal rituals, but these are <i>actions</i>, not beliefs. The failure to partake in a ritual, the protest against it, this is the action of a radical, and atheists were, of course, more likely to act in such a radical fashion than those who shared the beliefs of the Church.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a></dd>

<dd>Hehe, no, that wasn't my point. Let me just simplify. The Inquisition killed based on factors other than sincere devotion, or lack thereof. they wiped out entire towns.

<p>Jack, the dispute headers are meant for disputes. We are in agreement that there should be citations and more facts in this article. Dispute headers only generate conflict and hard feelings -- let's instead try to work together on improving this article in the areas where it needs to be improved. (Frankly, I'm a bit surprised that with so many atheists here, the main article is still a bit disappointing. On the other hand, we do have many detailed articles on related subjects.) I seem to recall that you tried to add some statistics to this article which others removed.

<p>You can find them in the history. I'd be more helpful, but scooter asked me to take a week off, and that seems reasonable considering.

I think its best that things are done slow, and (at least until next weds night) not by me&#160;:). I may not be an atheist, but I don't think that in any way reduces my ability to produce a NPOV article.

<dd>Atheism is a lack of belief in god or gods. Only believers capitalise the G in god, as far as I know.

<p>One possible compromise, and one suggestion on the proper form of god/God:<br />
1. What about using the word "deity"?<br />
2.

It is interesting to note that it translates "theos" as "god" (note small 'G'). I investigated to see whether all translated words are given uncapitalised, but found out that only nouns that are properly spelled in capitals in english are also given in capitals: "Hellas, Greece" is given in capitals as a translation of "ellas", whereas "bear" is given as a translation of "genno". --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 18:53, 24 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your all dancing around the issue. Read some entries for "God" "theism" and "atheism" in other encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc... They all spell God "G"od. And a vote would prove nothing whatsoever. I am 100% positive that atheists outnumber believers among interested parties on this issue here, and besides, if this is a place (I happen to know that its not) where the majority opinions of the editors are to be presented as fact regardless of documentations and other such <b>proof</b> then I don't want anything further to do with such a cesspoll (intentionally humorous mispelling) of dubious informations ;). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 00:59, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jack, you haven't made a very good argument for the "God" spelling either. Just because other encyclopedias do it a certain way doesn't mean we have to. Other encyclopedias do a lot of things wrong or not at all.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a></dd>

<dd>Considering that most, if not all of the encyclopedias you are referring to are being produced in predominantly christian countries there would be good reason for them to be non-neutral on the issue of the capitalisation of 'god'/'God'. (One writes for one's readers). We aim to produce a truly neutral encyclopedia, which includes removing the old biased claims that other encyclopedias make. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 16:51, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And what, pray tell, might these other encyclopedias do wrong? Might I enjoy an example (I do so love citations...)? I myself am endlessly fascinated by their quality and impartiality, their shining beacon of neutrality. Neutrality is <b>not</b> changing a generally agreed upon definition to suit your own bias. God is the name of the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_Infinite_f35b.html" title="Absolute Infinite">Absolute Infinite</a>, the one God who is all. He is not included among your "gods" and failing to mention him creates an error in your definition of atheism. You are implying that you only reject the false, lesser gods, and you fail to address the great "I AM". It's the typical straw man fallacy of atheists to summon up an image of a lesser "magic invisible god" who is of course ridiculous and impossible to reconcile with rational, scientific analysis. On the other hand, you seem unwilling to include in your definition of atheism a rejection of God, who is neither invisible, magical, nor imaginary. Perhaps this is a good sign for you spiritually (assuming you consider yourself atheist) but it is a misleading definition of atheism, not entirely removed from the slippery slope of "soft atheism" wherein you attempt again to avoid true rejection of God by wrapping the unwilling agnostics and uncertain into your <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">redefined</a> concept of atheism. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 17:20, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow! The above shows that you are even more biased than I thought. I guess that you are so far along that you can't even imagine that some people could think that your deity doesn't exist, and because of it you can't imagine that for these people "a god or many gods" - general and <i>neutral</i> terms - means exactly what you are talking about. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeCapone_8ccc.html" title="User:MikeCapone">MikeCapone</a> 17:25, Jan 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh. Back on January 19th you created the header <a href="#read_some_sources" title="">#read some sources</a> and presented four links, consisting of those three and the one I mention above. You can read my original critique of them in full by clicking that link, but in summary; those three links all lead to the <i>same</i> article, a paragraph-long article from the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia that is less useful than a dictionary entry. Repeating the same reference over and over again does not make it any more significant. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:59, 26 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright. At the bottom of the first article, there's the lines: " The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia Copyright © 2003, Columbia University Press. Licensed from Columbia University Press. All rights reserved." At the bottom of the second article, there's this line: "The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Copyright © 2003 Columbia University Press." And at the bottom of the third article, there's this line: "Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, Copyright (c) 2004." Combined with the word-for-word similarity between those single-paragraph articles, I think that looks pretty conclusive that they're all from the same source. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:47, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I should have been more clear. I quickly realized that you were right about the three of my sources all going back to one original (thereby giving it rather mighty praise, I dare say). I should have complimented you, but I havn't been in a good mood for doing that (in regards to you in particular) in some time. I apologise. What I was looking for was for you to provide a source of your own, demonstrating that exclusive use of the "g" is useful in discussing God in regards to atheism. IMO this is done sheerly for propaganda and shock value purposes. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 20:29, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Christianity, monotheism, or whatever else it is that you are referring to when you use the capital-G God would seem to fall into the grouping "any religious system". I'm not sure how that's supposed to be propagandistic or shocking, feel free to explain that part further if you wish. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:41, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh. The truth is of course totally immune to whatever we may say or do about it, but for the time being Wikipedia seems pretty much stuck with a consensus approach. There's been talk from time to time of introducing a peer review mechanism to mark certain versions of pages as "vouched for by an expert", but until something like that comes along there's not much that can be done about everyone here being roughly equal in their authority. I haven't looked at the edit history of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">god</a> article, so I don't know if you've already tried it or not, but perhaps that would be a good place to try adding something about what some people feel is correct capitalization protocol? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:04, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Jack. A quick look through the theology and philosophy texts on my shelf showed that “G” is the accepted usage in such discussions. <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> also makes the point that “God” refers to the postulated “one supreme being”. The construct “God or gods” looks fine, unless one has some rhetorical intent. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 10:55, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But capital-G God refers to a very <i>specific</i> god, not to monotheistic gods in general; it's the name of a god, not a class of gods. It looks as silly a construct to me as saying atheists don't believe in "Zeus or gods" or "Ahura Mazda or gods." Perhaps a way out of this impasse would be to remove all the "god"s from this article and replace with "deity" and "deities"? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:04, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bryan, how many times have you had a heated discussion with someone about the existence of Zeus or Ahura Mazda? Why are you intent on denying the prominence of that particular god referred to in the western tradition? Theology is dominated by God, not Zeus. To deny that is just vacuous. “Deity” is fine, if somewhat unusual. If it can be used to avoid this silly, trivial issue, then please use it.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 19:54, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not denying that one particular god is most prominent in western tradition, I don't see how that's even relevant to what I said. I'm saying that atheism in general is not concerned with a <i>specific</i> god, and so mentioning one in the basic definition like this is simply misleading. What does it matter whether I've had heated discussions about the existence of other specific gods if I still don't believe in them either way? If I was in ancient Greece and I'd never even <i>heard</i> of Christianity before my objection to using "God or gods" would remain exactly the same; it has nothing to do with which gods happen to be currently the most prominent. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 20:45, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Come on. How many people come to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> looking for a brilliant intellectual discussion about people who do not believe in Zeus? The debate is an attempt to trivialise Theism by claiming that there is no difference between God and other deities. The point you are making is rhetorical, not logical. But you have cast your net too wide - In attempting to trivialise theism, you have caught the whole of theological thought, including atheism. Atheists are interesting not because they do not believe in Zeus, but because they do not believe in God. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 20:58, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not trying to trivialize theism and I really don't see how you're getting that from what I'm saying - we seem to be having two completely separate arguments here. I'm going out of my way to recognize the great range and diversity of beliefs that theism encompasses. You seem to be to be lumping atheism in with all sorts of theistic religions that don't feature God. However, I can definitely agree with you on one thing; let's just implement that "deity" compromise already and get this whole stupid argument over with. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:57, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I will agree to "diety" inm the short term, as a compromise/concencus. Long term I think "God or gods" will end up being what it says, but lets leave that one alone for now.
