<p>Your helpful contribution to the discussion was here: <a href="../../../a/a/r/Talk%7EAaron_Klein_a4aa.html#Edit_warring" title="Talk:Aaron Klein">Talk:Aaron Klein#Edit warring</a>. Recently User:MikeJason has appeared and begun to make some of the same changes previously reverted when they were made by anons. MikeJason (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikeJason_39e6.html" title="User talk:MikeJason">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MikeJason_0677.html" title="Special:Contributions/MikeJason">contribs</a>) is a new contributor to Wikipedia. Sigh.. Can you advise patience, or something? I kind of have two choices: (1) forget it, and think peaceful thoughts. (2) Propose the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> article for deletion. (3) anything else? My colleague in POV-fighting, <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robocracy</a>, had earlier sponsored the page for semi-protection, which has recently expired. What can you do about logged-in contributors who misbehave, when they seem to be single-purpose accounts? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 23:06, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Athaenara. Recent updates at <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> by an anonymous contributor, mostly labelled 'minor edit' and 'brief add', often restoring previously-deleted material, deserve your attention, should you still be interested in this obviously non-earthshaking issue. I wonder if writing to WorldNetDaily would do any good. Perhaps we could denounce them for tampering with Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 00:13, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I saw it, it's on my watch list, too. 192.118.11.112 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.118.11.112_8835.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.118.11.112">contribs</a>) is undoubtedly MikeJason (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MikeJason_0677.html" title="Special:Contributions/MikeJason">contribs</a>). He didn't puff it up promotion style this time, but WND links are still too numerous and other newsmedia links (which he should find if they're out there) are still too few. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 12pt; margin-left: .05em">–Æ.</span></a> 02:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I left this request at WP:RFPP:

<dd><i>Semi-protection requested for this page. The issue is not conventional vandalism, this page is constantly attacked by POV editors, most of them (recently) anonymous. In the last 30 days two different anons have removed tags from the page referring to the POV issues. Article is currently awaiting attention at WP:COI/N. I'm requesting a 'tprotect' for 30 days, which should be long enough for COI/N to take some action or give us advice. EdJohnston 18:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I can see <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64">Nishkid's</a> point. Compared to articles with daily vandals or revert wars, this one's problems are small potatoes. It's reasonable to suppose that a few editors can keep up with intermittent problems. Now, about that sockpuppet thing ... (see next subsection (WW SSP); it's been there awhile.) Though frankly it <i>is</i> a low level problem, however aggravating over time—perhaps editor aggravation-tolerance needs to be adjusted a notch or two higher&#160;;-D. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 14pt">— Æ. ✉</span></a> 21:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not fluent with this process. All I recall is that User:MikeJason made his first edit to the AK article on 22 November after <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robacracy</a> succeeded in getting the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> page semi-protected on 17 November. This suggests that Mike Jason was a reincarnation of a previous IP. After protection went away on 5 December the POV warriors must have decided to go back to the safety of anonymity, and Mike Jason disappeared again. Mike J. never responded to any questions left on his talk page. His last edit was on 4 December 2006.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The oldest IP account was 192.118.11.112, the one that originally drew my attention to the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> page, because he persisted in making eccentric edits to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floating_point.html" title="Floating point">Floating point</a> that I didn't understand. My first message to that anon was on 24 October, and I never got a response. That anon is still active; his last edit was on 28 January.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While you didn't ask about this, it occurs to me that the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> page could be stubbified, because there are almost no reliable sources in the conventional sense. If we rule out blogs as unreliable (and there is some justification for that view at WP:RS) and rely only on printed sources, then the AK article, completely sourced from print publications, would become very small. One could well argue that WND and ConWebWatch are not reliable sources. I still can't believe that 'Klein barred from Syria' is accepted as a legitimate external link in the AK article. Note that even trivial biographic info, like the following sentence, has no reliable source: "Klein attended Jewish schooling from nursery through college." If the POV warriors want to pretend that we don't exist, and WP standards don't exist, then applying the letter of the law to an extreme degree might be a reasonable approach. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 01:49, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Athaenara, I've looked at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewsMax_6ae8.html" title="NewsMax">NewsMax</a> article and it seems that there's POV-pushing there, as well. As it seems to me — and this is just a suspicion — NewsMax may be actually employing people to edit Wikipedia, the same way that Microsoft has. I'm <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">User:Robocracy</a> (the one who originally brought this Aaron Klein article to your attention) and I rarely use Wikipedia anymore (too lazy to even login now). A report for "long-term vandalism," including names of all of those who have pushed POVs on <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsmax.html" title="Newsmax">Newsmax</a> and other Newsmax-related articles would be helpful. As it stands now, the Newsmax article <i>itself</i> looks like an advertisement and the "criticism of Newsmax" section I saw there months ago has since been totally removed. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.138.31.96_65aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.138.31.96">69.138.31.96</a> 01:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was good to hear from you again, Robocracy; I'm sorry you're not an active editor these days. I'm giving this newsmax thing some thought. <i>(Aside:</i>&#160;Have I become a magnet for <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">POV</a> issues in articles about conservative news reportage?) <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 14pt">— Athænara ✉</span></a> 20:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, since this page is well-organized and archived, it has become a sensible place for people to file new info. You will soon have the data to write a WP history of important COI debates.. I like the {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">Primarysources</a>}} banner currently seen at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsmax.html" title="Newsmax">Newsmax</a>.

<p>Hello Athaenara! Since you've been on the job, I have felt free to ignore the constant POV issues on the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Klein_8b20.html" title="Aaron Klein">Aaron Klein</a> page, and I've made no further edits (since 13 Nov). We have a similar problem now over at <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliweb.html" title="Aliweb">Aliweb</a>, where the topic may be just notable enough to prevent deletion, but there is a troublesome user (with the same name as the page). Perhaps the remedy there is something like 'stubbification', where everything not verifiable is removed. I'm not sure I have as much patience as you do to keep tidying up the page after multiple assaults; deletion (if appropriate) would be simpler. If you could just look at the page and give me advice, that would be very helpful. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for following up. My only new finding since December is that <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> has an entry for</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Usernames that promote a company or website: Usernames of or closely resembling the names of companies, groups, or include the URL of a particular website are discouraged and may be blocked."</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a section later on that page explaining how to ask that a username be changed. When the problem is commercial promotion rather than an offensive name, It's not as simple as taking it to WP:AIV, but there is a procedure.</p>
<p>A second possible step would be to file a user conduct WP:RFC asking the user to abstain from editing his company's own site. This is a heavyweight remedy that can actually lead to Arbcom action, not something I'd lightly do. A third possibility is an AfD debate about <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliweb.html" title="Aliweb">Aliweb</a>. That's beginning to seem more reasonable. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm impressed by your very thorough writeup at WP:COI/N. I didn't know there were so many IPs that worked on it. Do you have a remedy in mind?

<dd>Thanks. All Wikipedians share the burden with admins, and non-sock editors of that article have shouldered quite a bit of it. Whoever was using the socks is indifferent to Wikipedia policies and equally indifferent to efforts of Wikipedians to maintain them.

<dd>It turns out the WP:COI/N process has only existed since 27 December. The complete record of their past decisions is <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard/Archive_1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard/Archive_1" rel="nofollow">here</a></span>. Once started, the process should be allowed to run, but I note that AfD might be simpler&#160;:-). I believe that the notability of Aliweb could be strongly contested for lack of any printed sources. If <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">WP:WEB</a> is the criterion we would have:
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations..</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I doubt that any of this exists for Aliweb. The current references are blog postings, usenet messages and web sites. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As cited in my first post on WP:COI/N, there is at least one printed source: Jeremy M. Norman's <i>From Gutenberg to the Internet: A Sourcebook on the History of Information Technology</i>, 2005, Norman Publishing, hardcover 889 pages, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-930405-87-0</a> (also carried on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gutenberg-Internet-Sourcebook-Information-Technology/dp/0930405870" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Gutenberg-Internet-Sourcebook-Information-Technology/dp/0930405870" rel="nofollow">amazon</a></span>). I find WP:COI/N's emergence from the starting gate encouraging (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_Noticeboard_Archive_1_b1b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard/Archive 1">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard/Archive 1</a>). <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 12pt; margin-left: .05em">—Æ. <small>✉</small></span></a> 02:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the pointer.

<dd>Hello Athaenara.

<p><b>RFCN Poweroid</b><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Please see my comments at that topic. I started looking around prompted by your RFCN. I'm having a hard time believing the problem is at all as serious as presented. Is the name duplicative of a business - yes? Is it probable that the business name was the source of the name - very much could be. I didn't see where that was asked of him. But by my random shot at investigating, I just can't see imputing the motives as they appear to be presented. So far, I can't see this as 'suspicious'. If this is CoI, it is goshdarn subtle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, I believe you have conflated two issues. Is there CoI? That is what I am having a lot of trouble with. Is there a name conflict? Yes. But it is a name that's been used for 2.5+ years. To bring it to RFCN under this progression of steps is really unfortunate, in my view. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 07:32, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like the username could be acceptable given the guidelines in place at the time when Poweroid registered it. Does he have a coi with the links he's been adding? Absolutely. Is there more to it? Possibly - he likes to include the links in the first edit of three successive ones, and rarely mentions that he's adding a link (from what I've seen, he used to mention the added links, but stopped doing so after they were being removed). He says he's added other links to clients of his, but he won't remove them nor make a list of them for all to examine. He's made no contention that the links are inappropriate currently. I don't know what should be done about the situation, but I'm disappointed by his lack of cooperation in fixing mistakes he readily admits to making. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 14:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
