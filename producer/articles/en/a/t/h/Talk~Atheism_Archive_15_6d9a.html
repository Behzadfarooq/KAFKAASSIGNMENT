<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paul Holbach</span></h2>
<p>Felonious Monk says that Paul Holbach (1723 - 1789) is an example of an early atheist who uses the weak "lack of belief" definition of atheism, I have been reading Holbach, and it is clear that he is what we would call a "strong atheist". For example, he says in paragraph 17-18 of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/gsens10.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/gsens10.txt" rel="nofollow">Common Sense</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>17. Can we imagine ourselves sincerely convinced of the existence of a being, whose nature we know not; who is inaccessible to all our senses; whose attributes, we are assured, are incomprehensible to us? To persuade me that a being exists or can exist, I must be first told what that being is. To induce me to believe the existence or the possibility of such a being, it is necessary to tell me things concerning him that are not contradictory, and do not destroy one another. In short, to fully convince me of the existence of that being, it is necessary to tell me things that I can understand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>18. A thing is impossible, when it includes two ideas that mutually destroy one another, and which can neither be conceived nor united in thought. Conviction can be founded only upon the constant testimony of our senses, which alone give birth to our ideas, and enable us to judge of their agreement or disagreement. That, which exists necessarily, is that, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. These principles, universally acknowledged, become erroneous, when applied to the existence of a God. Whatever has been hitherto said upon the subject, is either unintelligible, or perfect contradiction, and must therefore appear absurd to every rational man.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These kind of statements are hallmarks of a strong atheist. I have not found an actual definition of atheism. Felonious, can you produce a quote demonstrating that we must consider Holbach a supporter of the "weak" definition of atheism? While you are at it, how about the Voltaire and Aquinas quotes? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:41, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, another straw man argument from BM. I've never said Holbach was a implicit (weak) atheist, or even uses the term implicit (or weak) atheism, or even is sympathetic to the implicit (weak) atheist position. What <i>I have</i> said is that Holbach (and all of my other cites) acknowledge the existence of implicit(weak) atheism in their writings. You really need to re-read my original citations: <i>"And once again I'll remind you and Sam that Paul Henri Holbach (1772)... in their writings made the distinction between weak and strong atheism, then known as "implicit" and "explicit" atheism."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Still don't understand why it's a straw man, BM? You're claiming I've insisted Holbach an atheist who supports the weak "lack of belief" definition of atheism, that I've suggested <i>"we must consider Holbach a supporter of the "weak" definition of atheism."</i> I have not. You are misrepresenting what I have claimed when I cited Holbach. I think we can really expect better technique in rhetoric and debate from someone who invokes on alleged BA in Philosophy from Harvard, <i>magna cum laude</i> no less. Either make your arguments on their points without the blatant logical fallacies, or your run the risk being ignored and dismissed. I have my doubts as to many of your claims here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, I understand how you were using Holbach. You didn't claim that he was a weak atheist, and I never said you did. You said that he gave a definition of atheism that was consistent with the weak definition you have been arguing is primary. I can't find in either Common Sense, or The System of Nature, where he gives a definition of atheism. I haven't read through both of them in their entirety; so I'm asking you for the quote or a reference. Or perhaps it is in some other work. If you say he didn't give the weak definition but made the distinction between weak and strong atheism, OK, that is slightly different, but I would still like the reference. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:09, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Funny, but your own quotes of Holbach presented above do not even support your own claim that he is clearly a strong atheist. Both quotes form is as near a perfect justification as I've read for implicit atheism. Holbach said: <i>"Whatever has been hitherto said upon the subject, is either unintelligible, or perfect contradiction, and must therefore appear absurd to every rational man."</i> Maybe I should have claimed he was a weak atheist... --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:54, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My goodness, the quoted paragraph 18 from Common Sense is the classic strong atheist argument that God (at least, the ominiscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, transcendent God that is understood by Christians) is impossible because his alleged attributes are unintelligible, contradictory, and absurd. How can someone who says directly that God is "impossible" be merely a weak atheist? That is about all the more stronger atheism as it gets (as my Rhode Island friends say). If you are reading that paragraph as implicit atheism, it is hard to rely on any of your statements. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a></dd>

<dd>I could respond to the specifics here, but I'd sooner not get involved in that as I can't see how speculating about whether Holbarch writings catogarises him personally as a strong or weak atheist beares upon improving the Wikipedia article or indeed how it devalues FM's citation of Holbach as having used the 'lack of belief'(weak) definition.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This aside; A specific question for you to answer please BM. You changed the atheism article to put in the Oxford Eng dictionary definition under the general intro, the OED atheism definition encompasses the weak definition. Does that mean you now accept that the weak definition is valid and appropriate for inclusion into the Wikipedia general definition of atheism? --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 15:09, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nick, frankly I'm astonished at your question. I've been saying all along that the article needs BOTH definitions. I know I'm long-winded, but my writing skills must really suck if this was not clear. I've been open about my POV, which is that I don't think the weak definition is the one that "most people" would give as the definition of atheism, and I personally think the weak definition is not a particularly enlightening or helpful one. But it is quite clear that it is a common definition, especially in academic discussions of atheism. It is obviously very prevalent in English language on-line sources for example, and many, probably most, perhaps even all, notable thinkers in the freethought tradition have used this definition. Of course it needs to be in the article. But the strong definition also does. I don't think any of the editors have produced a convincing case that one or the other is the primary definition (although I'm more persuaded, naturally, of the truth of my own POV). So I don't think we can neutrally say in the article which is the primary definition. It is not really necessary to say which is primary, anyway. It is amazing that such a minor issue has blocked progress on the article all this time. On Holbach, he is relevant because FM has cited Holbach as an early user of the weak definition, along with Aquinas (even earlier) and Voltaire (somewhat a contemporary of Holbach). Holbach seems like a fairly interesting figure, and I notice the Wikipedia doesn't have an article on him; so maybe I'll write one. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>BM - I must have missed your agreement, if so I’m sorry for that. I thought you agreed with Sam. I understand Sam Spade's position to be that he wishes...or rather 'insists' that the general definition of atheism in the intro only include strong/ positive atheism and that weak/passive atheism be only dealt with in the body of the article and that either Wikipedia NPOV policy should be set aside with regards atheism or that he is simply incapable of being NPOV in this matter.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He has thus far explicitly rejected the inclusion of the weak/ passive definition in the intro general definition (with a couple of enigmatic self contradictions) despite being shown ample evidence that the weak and strong definitions are common, are valid and has been for centuries. The frustration FM, Adraeus and myself have with Sam relates to Sam's very clear slant and seeming personal crusade driven by some sort of agenda on this point and his rejection of the evidence that both the strong and weak definitions are valid.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems you BM agree with FM, Adraeus, myself and a few others. That is that we all agree that the general definition of atheism in the intro should cover both the meaning of the strong and weak definitions and should cover both without preference, is that correct, please clarify this again for me.....?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 12:08, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think the article should not indicate any preference for one definition over the other, and should give "equal time" to both of them. I'm not sure how common the weak atheist definition is. If the universe being considered includes the theist "man-in-the-street", I think it is not very common. And I am skeptical about the statement that it has been "valid for centuries". But it is certainly common enough in English-language academic and on-line sources that it needs to be mentioned in the article. Someone reading about atheism online is going to encounter it and would think it odd not to have a discussion of it in the Wikipedia. My personal opinion is that weak atheism is an incorrect position and that the definition of atheism that goes along with it isn't helpful. I think it would be better if people didn't have to be confused by it. But there are lots of incoherent/confusing positions that are actually held by significant numbers of people, and I can't banish them from the Wikipedia, either, or else the religion category would be empty. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:39, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My $.02 here. So far as I recall over the past few months, I think Sam is the only person to steadfastly oppose any mention the definition of weak atheism (but even there, I think he may have compromised somewhat at a few points). What is primarily at issue is not whether to mention the definition, but how to phrase the introduction so as to not imply bias for/against one or the other. As for the commonness of the weak definition, I suspect if you do a wide range of in-the-street interviews, you'd find plenty of people who would agree with a statement formulated something like "An atheist is someone who doesn't believe in god". However I suspect that most of these same people would not accept the generalization of this in the form of something like "All people who do not believe in god are atheists." That is the heart of my problem with presenting the weak atheism definition. The categorical statement is an unecessary extrapolation of the weak atheism position for polemical purposes and is not integral to a definition of weak atheism. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 14:32, Dec 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bkonrad, I think you are probably correct about the outcome of your hypothetical survey. The man-in-the-street would accept a definition that makes an atheist a person "who does not believe in god". However, it would probably not occur to the man-in-the-street that "not believing in god" is different from "believing that there is not a god", unless it was pointed out. Generally people aren't that rigorous in their speech, and if you say you "don't believe in ghosts", usually your position is not merely that you lack a belief in ghosts (although that *is* literally what you are saying). Your position is likely to be that you believe that ghosts do not exist. Same with gods. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:53, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another point, for me the decisive one, is that if we don't include both definitions and give them equal time, we will constantly have people coming upon the article, thinking it strange that one of the definitions is missing, and editing it in. Thus, deciding to exlude one of the definitions is a decision to have edit wars. Stability alone drives us towards being neutral. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:10, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So following on from all this is there anyone and I include Sam Spade, that doesn't now accept that the general definition of atheism should include both the negative/ weak and positive/ strong meanings in the intro to be written neutrally and without favour to either. I'm proposing that we state our positions to allow us to find out if there is a reasonably broad consensus and if so where it lies.</p>

<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<p>Firstly I oppose voting on matters such as these (article content, POV, etc...), the wikipedia isn't a democracy, or <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majoritocracy.html" title="Majoritocracy">majoritocracy</a>, but is instead consensus based. Secondly beginning an article with a dictionary definition is generally frowned upon, and for good reason: It isn't encyclopedic. The weak definition shouldn't be in the intro at all, of course, but this is an improvement, more accurate than what was there before, and I don't expect better at present. In other words, I don't approve of the intro, but won't stand in the way of the current consensus.

<dd>I concur exactly what Sam said, the current definition is good but should not be the final version. However, the passive athiesm probably should be there. I would like everyone to start calling weak or negative atheism, Passive athiesm. Why? because weak and negative are downer words and it belittles those that are passive athiests. Wikipedia cannot be a party for this, so as it stands, passive is the only descriptor that can be used to describe those who are not strong athiests. In the end however, passive might not cut it as an appropriate descriptor. "implicit atheism" vs. "explicit atheism" should probably be used. See the <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathq_strongweak.htm" class="external text" title="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathq_strongweak.htm" rel="nofollow">article on about.com</a> about strong vs. weak. --<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunborn_6931.html" title="User:Sunborn">The Sunborn</a></dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, "weak" and "strong" are the adjectives that appear to be most commonly used for those terms and so whether you personally prefer them or not those are the terms that we should use in Wikipedia.

<dd>I agree that calling this "voting" is a little bit unfortunate. Perhaps it should be called "making a list of people's positions so we know where consensus may lie." The results won't be particularly binding on the form of the article. However, given that most people support giving the strong and weak definitions equal standing in the introduction (for which extensive evidence has been provided in the discussion archives), it will provide ammunition for shooting down any disbelief-only edits, if and when they should pop up in watchlists. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 23:36, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Atheism has both strong and weak forms, since Wikipedia policy says that a lead section should summarize the article, I think weak atheism should be included in the lead. If "weak" carries too much negative connotation I have no problems in using another wide-spread term for it, but it should defintely be included.

<dd>Atheism having strong and weak forms is an opinion, or interpretation, not a fact.

I agree with you on the "two types of atheism" phrase. That is what it said before, and I didn't change that, but should have. If you want to remove or replace, fine with me, and now that you point out the problem, if you don't do it, I will probably do it myself before too long.</p>
<p>I don't think my wording puts the definitions into the mouths of weak atheists or strong atheists. I agree that more than just atheists have a difference of opinion about these definitions (e.g. Sam, who is a theist).

<p>Sam, I think I know what your point about 'God' is, and I think it is valid. But, I don't think you can telegraph it by just capitalizing 'god' in various places. First of all, the other editors don't get the point of this, and neither will readers of the article. We need to think about how to get it more explicitly into the article.

<dd>Its best explained by reviewing <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">Deity</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/d/Gods.html" title="Gods">gods</a>. The gist of it is that certain conceptions of God are so esoteric and abstract as to be able to be mathematicaly provable commodities. This would include <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_15f6.html" title="The Ultimate">The Ultimate</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_quantification.html" title="Universal quantification">All</a>, and the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_Infinite_f35b.html" title="Absolute Infinite">Absolute Infinite</a> at minimum. Other concepts of God (<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a>) may include these concepts, but even if not, their conception of God maintains that he is necessarily unique, and is possessed of certain maximum qualities (often <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanence.html" title="Immanence">immanence</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omniscience.html" title="Omniscience">omniscience</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipotence.html" title="Omnipotence">omnipotence</a>, or others, this varies). These two conceptions are (capital) G-od. gods are far lesser entities, even to those who believe in them. Indeed, one can be a monotheist and still believe in gods, so long as you think of them as minor spirits (angels, devils, djinn, etc...) or aspects of God, rather than possessed of maximum attributes. The denial of minor entities is not relevant to most people’s conception of atheism, since many people deny (or fail to worship) some entity or other. It is the blanket denial of the Ultimate that is presented when one invokes atheism.

<dd>That justification for capitalization of "god" is what's <i>esoteric and abstract</i> here. Your argument assumes what is in the minds of the readers. Some may indeed being thinking about <i>God</i> (whatever/whomever that may be) and so see the need for capitalizing the proper noun. But certainly others will just read the term "god" as a concept that can mean just any old supernatural being. The capitalization of god in this instance is unjustified. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 23:30, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>God, capitalized, is a proper noun, referring to a specific entity. The unfortunate and inappropriate split of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deity</a> articles isn't a mistake that needs to be repeated here. The Hebrew god, who is referred to as God as a proper noun, is simply another god. That said, there are those who like to define atheism as "denial of my Yahweh/God", and this definition can be included due to its popularity, but it is not the only mainstream definition, and due to NPOV policy should not be the only one in the introduction.</dd>

<dd>I don't think Sam's comment is a theistic tirade. He is just trying to explain his POV, which is fine on a Talk page. His POV is basically that 'God' is not merely a 'god' or 'deity'. This is not a view that is any way unique to him. There are conceptions of the monotheistic 'God' of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, as well as the Hindu concept of Brahman according to which God is not merely a god or deity. Under this view, 'God' is not a supernatural being, but rather is conceived as the Divine Ground, Existence or Being itself, the ground of being, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monism.html" title="Monism">monistic</a> substrate, etc. Gods and deities are beings, supernatural though they may be. God is conceived not as *a* being but as Being itself. By this view, it is not enough to say that an atheist denies 'gods' or 'deities', because the theist with this conception probably also denies them, or at best thinks of them as symbols. Many atheists may not even be aware of this conception of God and it is hard to say whether they deny God as the ground of being (etc) or not. Other atheists are aware of it, and deny God as well as gods, think this conception is incomprehensible, or disagree with the relevant theories of metaphysics. This is why I consistently define atheism as the denial of God or gods, but with this conception of God in mind saying that atheism is the denial of deities is not quite accurate or sufficient. I am pretty sure this is what is behind Sam's campaign to replace 'god' with 'God'. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:43, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was wondering when Sam would bring up capitalization again.&#160;:) This is yet another point that's been fought over since he first arrived here, a while back he started a poll on the subject: <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_Godvrs.god_poll_8d60.html" title="Talk:Atheism/Godvrs.god poll">Talk:Atheism/Godvrs.god poll</a>. The result was IMO pretty clear. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:09, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the solution is fairly easy. Consistently refer to "God or gods", not "gods" or "deities". Unless someone is prepared to differentiate between atheism as the denial of supernatural gods and deities versus atheism as the denial of the "ground of being"/monist substrate interpretation of "God". These are actually quite different, which many atheists (or even theists) may not realize. Denial of gods and deities is a position against the existence of supernatural beings, or at least a position against a class of supernatural beings, and is an <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontological</a> position, i.e. what objects exist? Denial of God (as interpreted by Sam, and many others) is a part of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a> --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:28, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bryan, I just looked at the poll. Obviously most people voted for an interpretation of "God" as an member of the set of "gods/deities" and saw no difference beween denying God and denying "gods/deities". No doubt many theists as well as atheists think of God as a supernatural being and are not familiar with the monistic "Divine Ground", "ground of being", "Absolute Infinite", etc line of thinking about God. Sam didn't do a very good job of explaining. However, while a somewhat advanced theological topic, it is not at all unique to Sam. It is a common strand of thought in the Hindu conception of Brahman, in Protestant theologians (such as Paul Tillich), and even in the Roman Catholic doctrine of "divine simplicity". I don't think it can be so easily dismissed as the poll did, but it is a complex topic to go into in a short article on atheism. Other articles on the Wikipedia only touch on this. The solution, as I said above, is to define atheism consistently in relation to "God or gods" or as lack of "theistic beliefs" and let it go at that. At this point, we aren't actually giving arguments in the article for atheism, anyway. The ontological arguments for the denial of gods and deities as supernatural entities are quite different (and a lot easier to understand) than the metaphysical arguments related to substance, etc, which are involved in rejecting monist metaphysics. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:58, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The substantive communication which ended up resolving things did not occur on that poll page. If you scroll way down to the bottom, you will see things suddenly wrapping up, and concensus declared. That was due to <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">User:Eloquence</a> removing all mention of God or gods and replacing it w deity. Unsatisfactory, but an acceptable stop gap measure needed at the time, because tensions were high. A particularly unpleseant troll had been involved in talk:Atheism and I was about as annoyed as I get on the wiki (mjy comments within the poll are reflective of that). Shortly after eloquences compromise, bryan and I went to mediation, and the atheism page cooled down for some time, until recent changes forced me back into the maelstrom&#160;;) Just thought I'd give you some context.

<p>To add my own 2 pence worth, the statement God of gods is itself POV, regardless of whether theologians consider God to be a god or not. Obviously, many atheists (and other theists) regard God as merely one among many gods. To make an explicit distinction between gods and God is ignoring the position of these individuals. By your argument we should similarly list all gods (Allah, Jehovah, Brahman) to avoid Christian bias. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 12:16, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Axon for the same reason to a different extent. To state "God or gods" is extremely <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_morality.html" title="Victorian morality">Victorian</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correct.html" title="Politically correct">politically correct</a>. "God" is contained within "gods."

<p>Victorian <i>and</i> politically correct? And I thought I'd heard it all. Equally, one could make a similar argument that simply referring to gods ignores those individuals who consider God to not be a god, but something seperate (although one can't help feeling that, semantically, they are fighting a losing cause). I'm not arguing against "politically correct" (whatever that means) inclusivity, rather I'm saying that using the phrase "Gods and gods" excludes those who think the two are one and the same, and simply referring to "gods" excludes those who think they are distinct. Listing all possible gods so as to avoid Christian bias is also not a solution, so some compromise needs to make itself available. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 12:41, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just in case someone thinks it was an anonymous vandal, 129.59.26.46 was in fact me (Titanium Dragon). I changed a few instances of "God or gods" to just "gods" or "deities", but I believe I preserved at least one in order to maintain the link to the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> page, as opposed to the <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deities.html" title="Deities">deities</a> page (which gods also links to). The concept of "God", as in the universal one, is no more or less a god than any other. Just because some people believe all the gods are the same one doesn't mean atheists aren't going to deny this combined god's existence as well. I didn't mean to throw in stuff without consent, and I understand if it is reverted, as it was my fault for not noticing that this section was a dispute over that very phrase. Maybe we should just refer to it as "deities"? "God or gods" not only is redundant, but also is a very awkward construction which is best avoided. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 12:51, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hypothetical supreme beings are gods/deities by definition. Again, it is redundant and overly verbose, not to mention terribly awkward. Singling out supreme beings is just not going to be NPOV, as there are literally hundreds of them. It would be tolerable to have one link to the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> page somewhere on the page (maybe under the guise of "Supreme being" or something), but it doesn't need to be repeated ad infinitum. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 13:23, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If "God" is not a "god", then it doesn't belong in this article anyway as it is NOT a god and atheism is not the same thing as irreligion, though a large number of atheists are irreligious. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 14:57, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would you mind being the one to fix it this time? I don't want to "use up" another revert.

<dd>According to BM, the changes made "lost a lot of a ground"; apparently, that ground specifically belongs to him and his posse.

<dd>It depends on whether Adraeus' edits get any further support, or if he is a minority of one. If there are still two larg-ish groups that disagree, who are going to carry on an edit war, then the article needs to be protected again. Yesterday, there seemed to be a consensus around the text, including Felonious and Nick. So, if it is just Adraeus, he will be stymied by the 3-revert rule, and the page doesn't need to be protected again. Anyway, he is out of reverts for today, having now reverted 3 times. In fact, he overstepped the 2-revert limit for which the administrator requested voluntary compliance -- which does not show good faith. By the way, Adraeus has a good point about agnosticism being not necessarily a weak-atheist position, and that should be made more clear. However, agnosticism and unwillingness to adopt positions on faith are the mainstays of many a "weak atheist" position so it is not unreasonable to mention agnosticism as long as it is clear that agnosticism is an epistemological position to which theists can subscribe as well. I've done one revert this morning, and a series of edits which I didn't think of as a revert, but which from Adraeus point of view amount to a revert, apparently. So, I'll honor the 2-revert rule, meaning someone else needs to carry the ball now. If something close to yesterday's text is reinstated, then I will try to make the status of weak/strong agnosticism more clear in the "Types" section. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:45, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather prefered Adraeus' version, because it seemed slightly more concise and did not contain some rather poor phrasing (ex. "God or gods" being repeated). However, some aspects of your version should certainly be incorporated. The "merger" didn't seem to be much of one though from my POV and reading of it, and seemed more like a revert, espeically of my minor changes (including the grammatical one of "policies" to "policy"; "has been the policies" is improper grammar, and there is no reason to change it from "has been the policy" to an improper construction. "Have been the policies" doesn't sound right to me.) <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 13:13, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weak atheism in the intro, Sam</span></h2>
<p>Hey Sam. Earlier, I asked how you responded to certain references that included a definition of atheism as lack of belief. The question was a bit off-topic in a section about "God vs. god", so I'll reopen the subject in a fresh header.</p>
<p>Here are the references: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=8113068&amp;oldid=8106293" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=8113068&amp;oldid=8106293" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=8119982&amp;oldid=8119949" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Atheism&amp;diff=8119982&amp;oldid=8119949" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, kindly provided by <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a>. There seem to be at least 20 of them, and in my opinion, many are reputable sources.</p>
<p>With so many sources providing the weak atheism definition, it seems to me that we have no choice but to include weak atheism on a similar footing as the atheism=denial definition.</p>
<p>What do you think, Sam?</p>

<dd>well, if you look at my most recent edit (reverted by andreas) you'll see thats exactly what I did. I may not agree about the equal footing, but I am clearly willing to compromise as far as this article is concerned.

<dd>I still feel that way, but as I said I am willing to0 compromise, and sway with the flow of consensus (particularly the concensus of <i>reasonable</i> minds, such as yourself). I think the reader would be best served by a greater emphasis on denial of God, w weak atheism relegated to a a section on views within atheism, or types of atheism, or whatever. But I'm not here to enforce this, or any other view, but rather to involve myself with this article in a manner accomadating to progress. At this time, progress seems to involve placing all definitions equally in the inro, and I accept that.

<dd>It looks like the current header already contains both definitions (I refer to the one unlocked by MGM), though it does not explicitly use the terms "strong" or "weak", it does seem to contain both definitions. Going into minutae in the header (such as defining those terms explicity) would dilute it. The introduction should be clear and concise. "Denial of the existance of gods" is the explicit strong atheist view, while "not believing in gods" (or something similar, I forget the precise wording) encompasses both views but seems (in contrast with the first) to imply the weak atheist viewpoint. As the only difference between the two is the explicit denial, I do not think we really need to change the header much. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 13:34, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The edit history of December 14 (today) clearly shows 4 reverts on Adraeus' part. I've blocked him for 24 hours as per Wikipedia policy. I'll also unprotect again, since this effectively stops the edit war.

<p>Adraeus won't you slow down and not fix the whole article overnight? Make a little edit and see how it sits.

<p>OK, Well, I fixed it by going back a bit, then applying a series of edits. I hope this doesn't count as a revert. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:29, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
