<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute Resolution Closure</span></h2>
<p>With only one side of the dispute remaining involved, I am forced to withdraw from this discussion. I am not happy that this is the manner in which it has been resolved, but it has been resolved all the same. After 3 days time without any objection from the other side, I will be requesting that the page be unprotected and contributions shall resume. If any member of the other side (namely <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">User:Andrevan</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">User:Nick-in-South-Africa</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">User:Adraeus</a>) reverts future edits without discussion, these reversions must be considered attacks and further dispute resolution will be facilitated by myself against that particular user. If, at any time, the opposing side wishes to resume talks, I will gladly return and the page will be protected once more while discussion continues.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, I am not happy with this result, but without dispute, I have no purpose here and shall withdraw. I wish this article and its contributors the best of fortune and hope further hostilities will be avoided.</p>

<dd>Thanks, Skyler! Sorry I skipped out before this dispute resolution began, I've been involved in several endlessly-repeating arguments recently and didn't want to get back into one that ate up a month of my time earlier this year already. I promise to stick around next time as penance. Should I give some sort of "official" opinion on how things stand, or would you prefer if I don't do anything in the eleventh hour after being absent for most of the discussion? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:23, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How things currently stand is that there was basically a "walk-out" on one side. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> have stepped away from the table. So, while the dispute is over, nothing was actually resolved. You mentioned above that you think the article as it stands now is fine, but the problem is that after 3 days of no discussion, I will be requesting that the article be unprotected and I would expect that it will change drastically shortly thereafter. The only difference will be that we are one more notch up on the dispute resolution process and if users continue to revert edits without discussion, it will be considered a hostile act and I will personally, as an impartial observer, request arbitration against that user.</dd>
<dd>To make one thing clear, I am not here in any official capacity. I am not a member of the Mediation Committee and am not even an administrator. I simply wished to help after <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">User:20040302</a> mistakenly posted his request for mediation on the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">Association of Members Advocates</a> page (an association of which I am a member). Also, I wish to make clear that I have not taken any side in the matter as far as the dispute goes. I have followed Wikipedia policy. Policy is that compromises must be made in the absense of a person clearly being factually wrong or vandalizing. All parties have acted in good faith here, so the only solution is discussion. Actions taken after this (other than to restart discussion) must be considered to have been made in bad faith.</dd>
<dd>Bryan, if you were on the side of Andre, Nick and Adraeus in the dispute and would like to continue resolution efforts in an attempt to keep matters from getting ugly again, I will be more than happy to consider the dispute still open and we can continue to work. If this is not the case or you are not willing (for whatever reason), the article will be unprotected on Friday and unreasonable actions without prior discussion will be considered hostile.</dd>
<dd>I get the impression from Nick that I have handled this process incorrectly and from Adraeus that I am simply on the opposite side of him and want to destroy the article. I'm sorry to any who feel this way, but all that can be done is to end or resolve the dispute so that contributions to the article can continue. That is, after all, what Wikipedia is all about. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyler1534_f063.html" title="User:Skyler1534">Skyler</a><a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESkyler1534_414b.html" title="User talk:Skyler1534"><b>1534</b></a> 04:32, Oct 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm. I'm not really sure I can "pledge allegience" to any particular side here. I consider the current version's definitions of weak and strong atheism to be correct and the efforts to equate weak atheism and agnosticism to be misguided, but I notice that at one point Andre said that agnostics were always atheists and I don't agree with that either. I've got a lot of catching up to do if I'm to pick up the current disagreement. As for whether this is "official" Wikipedia policy or not, I'll go with whatever works. I recently got involved in another dispute that went all the way to arbitration and sadly I haven't seen the "official" steps of dispute resolution working so well. I guess all I can suggest is that perhaps we could try to describe the argument itself in a concise summary and then add that description to the article? Since it seems to come up again and again, that may be a route to a more stable and NPOV article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:36, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bryan, see <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism_DR_6f5d.html" title="Atheism/DR">Atheism/DR</a> for my attempts to do just that. One of the significant changes I have proposed to the article is to move the issues of strong/weak atheism down the article - I consider that atheism qua atheism has a lot to offer before needing to discuss differentiations. One of the issues that has been brought to light for me regarding the term is that it has two significant categories of usage- one is general community usage, and the other is finely examined usage as found in academics and philosophers involved in the promotion (or discussion) of atheism as a Weltanschauung. The current protected article does little to mention this, and yet it appears to be a fundamental cause of edit wars. A key objection that I had in the article was the blurring of definition so much that it first of all appeared to say that anyone without belief in God is an atheist, and this definition is the defacto correct one. Then, the article extensively uses the term to refer to those who actively disbelieve in God. As I wrote at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism_DR_6f5d.html" title="Atheism/DR">Atheism/DR</a>:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Many people commonly use the term to indicate the belief system represented by those who actively do not believe in the divine. There are many individuals and organisations that declare themselves proactively atheist, and the rest of the article adopts such an interpretation. <i>Otherwise we would have to talk about why babies weren't sentenced to death for being atheists, struggle to explain what was going to be taught in British schools, and be at a loss as to how the CIA factbook estimates (world population) 12.5% to be non-religious and about 2.4% to be atheist.</i>"</dd>

<dd>Looks even better. Not sure if it's a good idea to move the strong/weak distinction right to the <i>very</i> end of the article, but I can't think of anyplace else to put it aside from immediately after the "interpretations" section and that's right at the beginning again. Skyler, may I try adding a paragraph at the end of the "divisions within atheism" summarizing the dispute here, mentioning some of the POVs I've seen that oppose the weak/strong distinction? That seems to be a good place to put them, IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:20, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Welcome Bryan</span></h2>
<p>I have discussed matters extensively w <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">user:andrevan</a>, record of which is @ <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html#Talk:Atheism" title="User talk:Sam Spade">User_talk:Sam_Spade#Talk:Atheism</a>. The summary (IMO) is that we both agree that both points of view aught to be included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The POV that Atheism means only those who reject God actively (this is the theist POV, largely)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That atheism has strong and weak variations, strong being the common meaning, and weak including many others. (the atheist POV as I see it)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think all POV's should be expressed equally, and clarified. Andre feels the atheist definition is more etymologically correct. I don't agree, but we can let the reader decide on this, by providing them the info. I also think this debate should be moved lower in the article, or perhaps to a subpage if it grows too long. Cheers, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 14:13, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Though I agree with Andre that Strong Atheism is not more etymologically correct (And I would add nor is it certain that Strong Atheists are the most common form of Atheist.), I do also agree with you here that we need to let the reader decide.</p>
<p>As stated at <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" rel="nofollow">religioustolerance.org</a>, Atheism is confined to one factor: the existence or non-existence of a deity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atheism can involve the positive assertion that there is no deity.</li>
<li>Atheism can be the absence of a belief that there is a deity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering this, the only thing that the article can assert with any certainty is that Atheism is the absence of belief in God or gods; whether it's by an active assertion or a passive lack of belief is moot and the article should not seek to characterize either position, merely state them. Referencing some credible statistics would allow characterizations to be made, if rather obliquely.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 18:32, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>absence of a belief has no one lable, and is in no way included w/in atheism (indeed its excluded, since atheism is the <i>belief</i> that their is no God). You can say some people think that, but anything more is unacceptable. Atheism is an (anti)spiritual act, not a default. Presenting all POV's is ok, but stating the contemporary Athiest POV as fact is contrary to compromise (and NPOV), and will earn the article a dispute header, as well as a ton of conflict, for the forseeable future. <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> involves stating all verifiable POV's impartially, not taking a stance. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 20:14, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you've misstated the issue: I see absence of belief as an attribute. It's an attribute common to atheism, agnosticism and any number of others positions, whether they be passive positions or active beliefs. <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathd_index.htm" class="external text" title="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathd_index.htm" rel="nofollow">About.com</a> (not a scholarly reference but one that is nonetheless accessed by millions) states about Atheism: "The broader, and more common, understanding of atheism among atheists is quite simply "not believing in any gods." No claims or denials are made - an atheist is just a person who does not happen to be a theist. Sometimes this broader understanding is called "weak" or "implicit" atheism. Most good, complete dictionaries readily support this."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About your personal definition of atheism -<i>" since atheism is the</i> belief <i>that their is no God"</i>- You think it doesn't take a stance? It's pure POV, as is <i>"Atheism is an (anti)spiritual act, not a default"</i>. A significant number of Rationalists do not so much assert that Atheism is rational, but that Theism is irrational. Therefore for them Atheism is no more than a default position. Consider the words of Isaac Asimov: <i>"I prefer rationalism to atheism. The question of God and other objects-of-faith are outside reason and play no part in rationalism, thus you don't have to waste your time in either attacking or defending."</i> Clearly he viewed Atheism as merely a default position. Further, one could easily argue that since no one is born with beliefs, say, as a Theist or Deist, Weak Atheism is indeed everyone's original default position. Also, if you're so convinced that Atheism is a "(anti)spiritual act", perhaps you should try to include that point in the article...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that any article that overtly favors any POV and is vigorously defended by ideological ax-grinders by definition should have dispute header. I'll place one myself for such an article. As far as compromise here, I don't see a lot of compromise. I see several editors who are not Atheists trying to dictate to several Atheists what constitutes Atheism, based on their POV (based solely on a priori knowledge as best I can tell). Do Jews get to define what and who is Jewish? Hindus? So why is it you claim Atheists cannot do the same? Especially when they can provide extensive scholarly references in support of their position? I reject your definition of Atheism and hence your idea that this is any sort of compromise. I support a purely neutral definition of Atheism consistent with what is found on <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" rel="nofollow">religioustolerance.org</a>:

<dd>FeloniousMonk et al. For the record, I am not a theist. This means that according to the definition of some editors, I am an atheist. Do not be so quick to label people into categories that appear to suit you. However, as it happens, I do not consider myself an atheist either - and who are you to tell me who I am?</dd>
<dd>I understand why atheists wish to say that they merely lack belief - this is to do with the idea of otherwise falling into a 'faith' of disbelief. Well, so much for the rationalist project. As I see it, we choose our beliefs and convictions, whether or not we are conscious of the fact.</dd>
<dd><strike>I note that many atheists have been actively bringing about a change in which the word is used - and the fact that this is reflected on WP comes to no surprise. There are always socio-political projects going on, and I hope that the current article can reflect that. The British education project has redefined it's broader scope, and now does NOT include atheism - because I guess, what is the point of teaching a non-movement? Instead, they are proposing to include "secular philosophies such as humanism". (BBC news, today: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3959255.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3959255.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3959255.stm</a> ), so I notice the shift in understanding of the word.</strike></dd>
<dd><strike>Regardless of any novel developments, as you say, (FM) there are definately two current positions regarding atheism, which is all I ever asked of the article. Moreover, the original article, from Persecution down, concerns itself with those who positively assert that there is no deity. To demonstrate this, as (another) thought experiment, substitute the word "baby" (as an example of a mere unbeliever), for the word atheist in each case, and re-read the article.</strike> I now agree that the ideas of weak and strong atheism are older than I initially thought. Issues concerning the status of babies are dealt with below. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

<p>Funny, I never said you were an Theist or Atheist. In fact, I've never referred to you at all.</p>
<p>You attempt to spin this debate as Atheists just trying to rewrite a more favorable definition. You couldn't be more wrong. Anyone who's actually read Atheism's critical writings, Paul Henri Holbach (1772), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Bradlaugh_5ea8.html" title="Charles Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh</a> (1876), etc., and is intellectually honest will know that Strong and Weak Atheism have been historically and scholarly recognized components Atheism for over two hundred years.</p>
<p>I cite the following support for my position that both Weak and Strong Atheism have historically been and remain scholarly and central to understanding Atheism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>New Dictionary of Religions</b>, edited by by John R. Hinnells. Atheism: Disbelief in the existence of any Gods or of God. This may take the form of: (a) dogmatic rejection of specific beliefs, e.g. of theism; (b) scepticism about all religious claims; or (c) agnosticism, the view that humans can never be certain in matters of so-called religious knowledge (e.g. whether God exists or not). An atheist may hold belief in God to be false, irrational, or meaningless</p>

<p><b>The HarperCollins Dictionary of Religion</b>, edited by by Jonathan Z. Smith and William S. Green atheism: Gk. a-theos, "no god" A critical stance toward divinity. Ancient forms of atheism, for example, the Greek atomist school of philosophy, did not deny the possible existence of gods but did deny their permanence and immortality. The atomists viewed the gods - if they existed - as merely higher forms of life within nature. Buddhism does not exempt the gods from the cycle of karmic reincarnation. Modern naturalistic atheism descends from atomism but goes further and denies the existence of any superhuman beings, of any form of transcendent order or meaning in the universe. These notions, it insists, are merely temporary human projections onto a reality alien to human thinking. In practice, atheism denotes a way of life conducted in disregard of any alleged superhuman reality. Existential atheism is a positive form of the teaching: it argues that if humans are to be authentically free in the universe, then it is necessary that God not exist since that would limit human liberty. <i>The above definition at first defines atheism simply as the denial of the existence of any gods, but then it proceeds to acknowledge that, in practice, atheism simply involves the absence of any belief in a "supernatural reality."</i></p>

Moreover, as people generally do not discriminate between belief and conduct, the term atheist has also been applied to those who refuse to participate in the customary forms of public worship.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Charles Bradlaugh</b>: One of the England's leading atheists and freethinkers in the 19th century, Bradlaugh wrote in 1876 in his book The Freethinker's Text Book that <i>Atheism is without God. It does not assert no God. The atheist does not say that there is no God, but he says 'I know not what you mean by God. I am without the idea of God. The word God to me is a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation. I do not deny God, because I cannot deny that of which I have no conception, and the conception of which by its affirmer is so imperfect that he is unable to define it for me.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Annie Besant</b>: Before she became a Theosophist, Besant was one of England's most well known atheists and advocates of freethought. In her 1877 book The Gospel of Atheism, she stated: <i>The position of the atheist is a clear and reasonable one. I know nothing about God and therefore I do not believe in Him or it. What you tell me about your God is self-contradictory and is therefore incredible. I do not deny 'God,' which is an unknown tongue to me. I do deny your God, who is an impossibility. I am without God.</i> Here it is made explicit how an atheist might go so far as to deny certain, specific gods without also necessarily deny all possible gods - a position taken by most atheists today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Edward Royle</b> describes the "negative atheism" of nineteenth-century freethinkers like Carlile, Southwell, Cooper, Holyoake: <i>Logically, this kind of atheism did not prove that there was no God.... On the contrary, Southwell was typical in placing the onus probandi on those who affirmed the existence of God and Holyoake regarded himself as an atheist only in his inability to believe what the churches would have him believe. They were content to show that the Christian concept of the supernatural was meaningless, that the arguments in its favor were illogical, and that the mysteries of the universe, insofar as they were explicable, could be accounted for in material terms.</i></p>

<p>Sam, your references are sparse, insignificant and incomplete. Mine are extensive and from leading academic publications; you ignore them at your own risk. Also, you don't need to lecture me on NPOV policy, I am exceptionally familiar with it and its application here. Considering that you are aggressively asserting your argument (which rests solely on three insignificant and incomplete references) while denying Atheists their own definition of Atheism (which is itself consistent and well supported in the academic and common literature as I have just shown) based solely on the fact that they are <i>Atheists</i> I may well conclude that it is you who needs to reacquaint himself with the NPOV policy. You as a Sr. Admin. should know better than to claim that <i>"atheists can't define atheism here"</i>; by doing so you're denying them a significant and credible seat at the table in defining their own beliefs. <i>That's</i> NPOV?--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 22:35, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Atheists have more than a seat at the table, they are the majority on this page (and perhaps even the wiki generally).

They show the variety of interpretations of the term. Oh, and thanks for appointing me as "Sr. Admin", thus far on the wiki today I have been dubbed "Jehovahs witness" as well as "Sr. Admin".

The fact remains that the references are not just consistent with, but indeed <i>are</i> both the academic <i>and</i> the common vernacular definitions of Atheism, and they both include the distinction between Weak and Strong Atheism. The fact that they are taken from several Dictionaries of Religion as well as a Religious Encyclopedia indicate strongly that they are indeed neutral. <i>"Partisan snowjob"?</i> I think we can safely say that that is not the case here.

<dd>While I don't exist on any side of this arguement. I know one thing, you can't let a religion self-define itself. While I am the first to say Atheism is not a religion, everything should be stand-offish. <i>while denying Atheists their own definition of Atheism</i> Your point scares me because while agnostic, and according to one side here, atheistic, we need a outside critical examination and definition. However, I am quite impressed with your blockquotes. Ideally, we would have the atheists make the article and then have someone who is neither an atheist or a theist to copyedit it.

<p>Oy vey. A section titled "Welcome Bryan" is created and ends up with with almost 24 kilobytes of arguing before I even <i>see</i> it (and an edit conflict while typing up this reply, too). This is exactly the reason I virtually quit editing for a couple of days when this subject originally came up again.&#160;:) So, what can I say? I fell on the side of "the definition of atheism used in academia includes weak atheism" even before FeloniousMonk provided this quite impressive collection of references, I don't know what else I can add to that. The version of the article at /DR already has "Some consider Atheism to be a state of merely lacking such beliefs, while others consider Atheism to be the active disbelief or denial of the divine" at the beginning, which IMO should be enough to cover all the bases. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:37, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">On the meanings of words</span></h3>
<p>I admit I haven't read in detail all the debate here, but I think the following point should be clarified. In English, at least, there is no such thing as an objective or absolute source for what a word does or doesn't mean. A word simply means what people use it to mean. In the case of the word <i>atheism</i>, people use it to mean at least two different things. Both of these meaning are legitimate. It doesn't matter if one meaning is used more than the other. For example, besides referring to a type of fish, the word <i>tuna</i> also refers to a kind of prickly pear <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=tuna&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=tuna&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Now, probably more than 99% of the time the word <i>tuna</i> is used, it refers to the fish. But that doesn't mean uses of the word <i>tuna</i> to refer to the prickly pear is in any way wrong. It's just a minority usage. Dictionaries, both general, and religion-specific, support the contention that there are two meanings for the word <i>atheism</i>. Therefore this article should not state that one meaning is "more correct" than the other. The article can only state that there are two meanings for the word and what those meanings are. To do anything else would not be NPOV. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 00:00, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think we should attempt to characterize which defintion of <i>atheism</i> is more commonly used or which is used by which group. I think that anyone who discusses or considers atheism at any length at some point has to confront the two meanings, and any extended debate about atheism has to be clear about which definition it debating. I think we would do our readers a disservice if we pick one meaning or the other as the default meaning for <i>atheism</i>. We should use <i>atheism</i> when discussing aspects of atheism that apply to either definition, and a more specific term when discussing something that is specific to one or the other meaning of atheism. <i>Weak atheism</i> and <i>strong atheism</i> seem to be the most commonly used unambiguous terms. Are there specific objections to using those terms when relevant? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 04:31, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The entire sections "Persecution of Atheists", "Persecution in the name of Atheism", "Atheism today", and "Statistics" are all concerned specifically with "atheism" in relation to the many individuals and organisations that declare themselves proactively atheist, as opposed to the broad categorisation of atheism that depends upon mere lack of belief, which includes babies, etc. I refer you to the article at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism_DR_6f5d.html" title="Atheism/DR">Atheism/DR</a> for a proposed solution.

<dd>I disagree with using "Strong" and "weak" atheism outside of a small section describing their meaning and usage. They are not widely used, and they have their own articles. This article aught be about <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> itself, not some new phrases using the term. A section yes, the whole article qualifying "strong" and "weak" atheism as tho they are the accepted terminology? Certainly not. I think people need to consider the provocative, POV stance which the use of these terms makes. Thats fine for individual atheists (free speech and all), but not OK for a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 13:40, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

20040302: I have encountered your argument that "weak atheism" is a vacuous concept because it includes babies and rocks before. It's a fallacious argument. It's like saying non-gasoline-based is a vacuous concept because it includes babies and rocks. The argument ignores the concept of "relevant properties". It makes no sense to qualify the beliefs or lack thereof of things that aren't capable of having beliefs, much as it makes no sense to qualify the engine fuel source of things that don't have engines. It is inherent in a definition that says that X lacks property Y that X is at least capable in theory of having property Y. Babies and rocks aren't capable of belief in God; therefore atheism doesn't really apply to them. Second, you are incorrect that the sections you name don't apply to "weak atheists". Weak atheism is still rejection of God, just not on the grounds that God doesn't exist; instead they reject God on the grounds that there isn't enough evidence that God does exist.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nohat, your definition of weak atheist is fine for me - because it involves rejection. My difficulties is when the term atheist is applied to non-theistic societal groups; I get your point about babies and I concur - though others (see discussion/archives) disagree with you. But e.g. how about those individuals (see my table in 9. Archive 8) who consider beliefs or arguments based on ontological status just do not apply to ineffables. This is very much a philosophical argument that rejects both theism and atheism as being part of a human-constructed linguistic dyad, with a self-defined lack of correspondence to verifiability. You may argue that such protaganists are atheist - but they cannot be, because they assert that one cannot engage in such discussions meaningfully. This position is held (not exclusively) by many Buddhists. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sam: You have already agreed with me that "atheism" is inherently ambiguous. Don't you think then that it does our readers a disservice to talk about aspects of atheism that refer only to one kind without specifying exactly what kind? We don't have make the POV choice that the terms "strong" and "weak" atheism are commonly used or accepted. We can be explicit in the conceit that we have chosen those terms because there are no better terms, despite the fact that they're controversial. Although some people disagree with the terms, the alternative is to be ambiguous, which I think everyone would agree is not desirable. How do you suggest we avoid being ambiguous if we don't use terms to disambiguate? <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:13, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sam, a lack of belief in God or gods, aka: Weak Atheism is the common definition of Atheism. Anyone, yourself included, who makes claims to the contrary should present some credible and neutral support for your position. Perhaps you can explain and justify your claim that Weak Atheism is an uncommon definition in light of it being a central feature in each of these reference sources (either that or demonstrate exactly how these references are wrong):</dd>

<p><b>Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language, 1903</b><br />
atheism: 1. The disbelief or denial of the existence of a God, or supreme intelligent Being. 2. Godlessness.<br />
<br />
<b>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1947</b><br />
atheism: The denial of or disbelief in God, as a First Cause, or Ground, of the universe. As dogmatic atheism it denies, as negative atheism it does not believe in, and as critical or skeptical atheism (or agnosticism) it doubts, the existence of god. What is called positive or dogmatic atheism, so far from being the only type of atheism, is the rarest of all kinds. . . . Every man is an atheist who does not believe that there is a God. R. FLINT Agnosticism sec. 3, p. 53. [s. '03]<br />
<br />
<b>Webster's Unabridged Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1957</b><br />
atheism: Disbelief in the existence of God; the state of godlessness. Atheism: unbelief in or denial of God or any supernaturalism; to ancient Greek it meant denial and lack of recognition of stat gods. In 18th cent. it was a protest against religious hypocrisy; in 19th cent. it was any system not recognizing the idea of a personal Creator or any one supreme being. It sees marter, not spirit, as sole universal principle; its history one of opposition. Term often loosely used in referring to agnostics who neither deny nor admit the existence of God, or in regard to others who disagree with current theological doctrine.<br />
<br />
<b>Oxford English Dictionary</b><br />
atheism: (from Greek atheos, "without God, denying God") Disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of a God. Also, Disregard of duty to God, godlessness (practical atheism).<br />
<br />
<b>New Dictionary of Religions</b>, edited by by John R. Hinnells<br />
atheism: Disbelief in the existence of any Gods or of God. This may take the form of: (a) dogmatic rejection of specific beliefs, e.g. of theism; (b) scepticism about all religious claims; or (c) agnosticism, the view that humans can never be certain in matters of so-called religious knowledge (e.g. whether God exists or not). An atheist may hold belief in God to be false, irrational, or meaningless<br />
<br />
<b>The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences</b>, edited by Edwin R. A. Seligman<br />
In its narrowest sense the term atheist applies to one who categorically denies the existence of any gods. But in its wider sense it properly applies also to skeptics, materialists, positivists and all other who do not accept the claims of theism.<br />

<dd>(sorry to split your response, FM) To quote Nohat: <i>Weak atheism is still rejection of God, just not on the grounds that God doesn't exist; instead they reject God on the grounds that there isn't enough evidence that God does exist.</i> Well, I agree with Nohan, and disagree with FM. However, I acknowledge that there are people (FM included) who have a different POV. I am willing to accept that the definition of WA as defined by Nohat is a common view, and one that applies to the history/persecution. etc parts of the article. I still disagree that a mere lack of belief is enough. To me 'lack of belief' in God is <b>not</b> a fallacious argument when applied to babies, because 'lack of belief' is a status that I would give to those things unable to hold beliefs, whereas 'rejection' I would say <b>is</b> a fallacious argument when applied to babies, because they are incapable of rejecting things like God.

<dd>11 Significant and credible reference sources I provide above do not support your opinion on this. Do you have any credible, neutral references you can cite in support of your claim that Weak Atheism requires an active disbelief in God/gods, not a passive disbelief as is commonly understood? Atheism is literally the lack of belief in God or gods, without qualification. No claims or denials are made - an Atheist is just a person who does not happen to be a theist. The broader understanding is called "weak" or "implicit" atheism. Nohat's definition is factually incorrect. He does not understand Weak Atheism, and confuses it with Strong Atheism. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">Strong Atheism</a> by definition requires a denial of deities, <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_atheism.html" title="Weak atheism">Weak Atheism</a> precludes it. Attempts to say the two are essentially the same make errors of both fact and logic. Clearly there are many people who simply lack belief in God/gods without making a decision to do so; they are either unaware, apathetic or feel the point is moot for whatever reason. They also happen to be the most numerous type of Atheist.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:43, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not need to change my POV to suit you - I expect the article to demonstrate varying POV that are popularly held. We are not involved in promoting socio-political agendas here, but in attempting to write a fair, NPOV article. Most of your issues are addressed further down the discussion. Nevertheless, I will provide sources, once we have actually addressed another core issue which this particular point rests upon. Do you agree with me that (1) disbelief requires a stance, or (2) do you claim that <i>disbelief</i> is cognate with <i>absence of belief</i>, either in the qualified manner as held by BKonrad, or the unqualified manner as held by Adraeus et al. The reason why the argument rests on this issue is to do with interpretation. I have pointed out that some of the sources you cite appear to support my viewpoint - on the basis that disbelief is in accordance with the dictionary definitions etc. that subscribe to position (1) of this list. If you hold position (2), then we will never agree on the interpretation of provided references. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

But it seems the atheist doesn't just disbelieve rather can not see a reason (in one example) to believe according to the proof. Actually, he states "Atheism, properly understood, is no mere disbelief; is in no wise a cold, barren negative; it is, on the contrary, a hearty, fruitful affirmation of all truth, and involves the positive assertion of action of highest humanity. "</dd>

<dl>
<dd>- I would like to note again that <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/theism" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/theism" rel="nofollow">theism</a> stems from theos or god and "Generally it is the belief in gods or goddesses, or the belief in a creator of the universe who is actively invovled in maintaining and ruling it." (note, they do not say "the belief in God or gods"). And <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/atheism" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/atheism" rel="nofollow">atheism</a> which "The literal meaning of the term is therefore 'lack of belief in a god.'" Lack of belief, not having a belief, or without a belief is not 'disbelief' or 'belief' that something doesn't exist. While a willful disbelief in something may be 'lack of belief', 'lack of belief' is certainly not a willful disbelief.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>- that said while someone disbelieving in any gods may be an atheist, this is not a full definition of the term and is only giving a piece of it. While many say they aren't theist, yet can not be atheist, this is a fallacy. They don't want to be associated with a negative term that society has made negative, yet with a full definition they still fall under that catagory. One that lacks theism or lacks a belief in a god or gods is simply atheist.</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, but you haven't made a case at all that Disbelief = belief. You've only established that a number of dictionaries rightly state disbelief is an act. This was never in question. It's a straw man. The real question is, is an absence of belief an act?--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 13:04, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you make it clear as to whom you are talking to, FM? I don't want to be told once more that I was not being referred to. But, for the benefit of doubt, I do not consider <i>mere absence of belief</i> to be <i>belief</i>. My claim regarding disbelief is less strong than that of Sam's, but I do claim that disbelief is an active state, and therefore is a position regarding the issue. You may argue with Sam about whether or not disbelief entails belief, but I doubt the issue is directly relevant to discussion. As for the view that I do hold regarding disbelief - I think that I have enough evidence to demonstrate that <i>absence of belief</i> and <i>disbelief</i> are not cognate. That is all I sought to demonstrate. An example (see discussion with bkonrad below) is rocks. Rocks indeed are absent of belief, just as happiness is absent of color. However, most people totally agree that it is nonsensical to claim that rocks hold a disbelief, because it is a position to hold, a stance, a view.

<dd>- That is the problem with terms we use. It's such that infinity does not imply a number, but rather a condition of no limits, yet that doesn't stop someone from using the concept as such though it may be flawed. Atheism simply is 'not theism'. So naturally, if one were to apply a label to something and know that something can not hold a belief, would it not be without that belief then? This is why someone was making the baby claim earlier. I for one agree with it, but do not agree putting it as a definition or description seeing as 'atheism' has too much negativity attached to it.</dd>

<p>In some discussions above, I see people discussing the question of whether "weak atheism" involves active disbelief, and other such distractions. While these are interesting questions, I feel it would be a good idea to restrict the discussion over what actually goes into the article to the original question. Therefore, alas, I am creating yet another section.</p>
<p><a name="Positions_A.2FB" id="Positions_A.2FB"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Positions A/B</span></h2>
<p><b>Position A</b>: The article should only state the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism is a set of beliefs including weak atheism, which involves lack of belief in gods, and strong atheism, which is the denial of the existence of any gods.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Position B</b>: The article should include the definition as held by many Christians and dictionaries:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some people define atheism as a set of beliefs including weak atheism, which involves lack of belief in gods, and strong atheism, which is the denial of the existence of any gods. Others consider all atheism to be the denial of the existence of any gods, while one who simply lacks belief in any gods is an agnostic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see an argument of whether weak atheism, lacking any positive assertions, is a condition that humans are actually capable of. Such a discussion can be fascinating, but is completely off-topic. What we need to resolve is how, exactly, the encyclopedia will report the various views.</p>
<p>Now, it had been my impression that "position a" was mostly abandoned. Is there anyone who wants to support it? (For the record, I support position B.) --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 20:10, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

The term is also used to describe those who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities.</i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 02:33, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC))</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FM considers weak atheism to be the mere absence of theism. So, FM asserts that rocks and babies are atheist, in that anything that has a mere absence of theism is atheist, just as anything that has no color (e.g. thought) is colorless. This appears to be due to FM reading 'disbelief' as being cognate with 'mere absence of belief'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, as I (and Websters, etc) consider the word 'disbelief' to be something that is not a mere absence of belief, but a conviction regarding the issue, I do not think it is possible for babies, rocks, etc. to disbelieve. This means (for me, etc.) that disbelief requires an active position - a conviction regarding the subject, in this case, the divine, or God. (Note, FM, I am not attempting to denigrate your view here, but trying to understand the nuances of differentiation.) It appears from the various definitions of atheism kindly gathered by FM that I concur with the following: Websters 1, Funk &amp; Wagnell, Websters 2, OED, NDR. I do not entirely agree with the definitions from: Agora, PoR, EoRH. This is because the latter definitions admit babies and rocks as atheists. I also consider the latter sources to be significantly less authoritative than the former, though I completely admit this is POV.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I prefer (and agree with) Nohat's distinction between weak atheism and strong atheism: <i>Weak atheism is still a rejection of God, just not on the grounds that God doesn't exist; instead they reject God on the grounds that there isn't enough evidence that God does exist.</i>, which is distinctly a disbelief (as I understand the term).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also disagree with the way in which agnosticism is being used in positions A and B. I do agree that agnosticism should be mentioned, but I basically agree with those who (in my mind accurately) distinguish between belief and provability. I consider agnosticism to be concerned with the proof of God, and atheism to be concerned with the existence of God.</dd>

<dd>- using the literaly translation of theism being the belief in a god or gods, would it not seem natural to assume atheism to be 'not theism' or without the belief in a god or gods. The terms used today by some people (while they probably need to be addressed) should be noted that they narrow down the definition to one who denies the belief in a god or gods and some people or religions define it even narrower claiming anyone an atheist who denies existence in <b>their</b> god or gods. Many claim they are not atheist simply because they do not want to be in the negative light that is cast about the word since they don't 'deny' any existence rather just don't believe it exists due to unreasonable evidence. But if they do not hold a theistic belief then they are not theist or 'a-thiest'. They may be intelligent enough to avoid the title by saying they just don't know (agnostic) which avoids answering whether they hold any theistic belief or not, therefor avoiding a negative label. If one says they are not theist, then they are simply atheist.</dd>

<dd>Well, I agree it would be a straw man if it weren't for the fact that some people assert that babies are indeed atheists. We have discussed this before. I find the idea ludicrous - but that is merely POV. I ask you to consider the statement "thought is colorless" - is that a meaningless statement because thought cannot have color? Or is it informative? Similarly "babies are atheist" is grammatically and semantically analogous <b>IFF</b> we assert that atheism is indeed the <i>mere lack of belief in God</i>, just as colorlessness is the mere lack of color. My purpose is honest. I agree with you - I think it is mistaken to apply definitions of atheism in such a broad manner. I find the concept of theism/atheism as a metaphysical dyad unwieldy and un-useful, though I find the concept of color/colorlessness as a metaphysical dyad useful and sensible. Therefore, to me, it is not sensible to say that atheism is the mere lack of theism. Stating that no-one calls babies atheists because they are unable to believe in the first place actually doesn't work too well: I have atheist friends who say "I would like to believe in God, but I just can't" - We cannot say that they are not atheists, just because they aren't able to believe in God! I would happily call them weak atheists. They call themselves atheists, therefore they are actively atheist. They have a conviction about their beliefs. Why is that so hard?

<dd>Bkonrad, would you not agree that -against your own criteria- it makes sense to at least qualify a statement such as 'atheism is the lack of belief in god', by explicitly restricting it to the population that is able to get involved? Then we would not have this 'straw man' argument/counter-argument. If we can agree on a fully qualified statement, then we can subsequently work on the editorial. Something like "Atheism is defined either as (1) the disbelief in God, or (2) the lack of belief in God by those who are capable of belief in God." Unwieldy, but it gets us out of the straw men - as has been stated earlier, babies and rocks is an old argument - let's address it through careful definition, rather than sweep it under a carpet by leaving it as an ambiguity left unaddressed. And, as a statement, it is far harder to argue against. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

<dd>No, because there is no need to qualify "lack of belief" as not applying to rocks or babies because it sophistry to assert that it does. In short, the qualification is unnecessary.

<dd><i>It is sophistry to assert that it does.</i> This is a faulty premise. Your argument is unsound. I have argued the case that it is not at all sophistry to make the assertion: I have given evidence that people hold the view which you consider so ludicrous that you call it sophistry to deny. There is indeed differing POV grounded in that ambiguity - unless you agree with NISA, Adraeus, and Andrevan. I understand their argument well - they use the a- prefix to demonstrate that atheism is a dyadic opposition to theism. Their view is quite clear (look in the archives) that everything is either atheist or theist. It is a easily stated position. <b>Anything</b> that lacks belief (therefore rocks, and babies too) is atheist. I just have a different view regarding atheism. Your position, as I understand it, differs in that it indeed qualifies the limits of atheism to the limits of what may believe in God. These are distinct positions.

Also your statement that my arguments are without merit is, as yet, unfounded. I would appreciate a compassionate demonstration of their lack of merit, preferably something more substantial than a bare assertion. On to your final statement, a question: Do you think that one must be capable of having belief to be an atheist, or do you think that one must be capable of believing in God to be an atheist? In other words, do you think that anyone who is capable of belief is capable of belief in God? (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

<dd>- "lack belief" in a meaningful sense doesn't have to be meaningful to the one lacking the belief does it? Say one grew up not being around any theism and not developing any theistic idea. While many may refer (and correctly I might add) that the person is atheist or 'not theist', that person does not lack belief (in a theistic sence) in their own mind or in any meaningful sense (did i say that correctly?). That person would still be atheist in the most true sense of them being 'not thiest'.</dd>
<dd>- At the beginning, it was said "... All of us also either assert that disbelief is a mere lack of belief, while others consider it to be a denial or conviction, ...". Disbelief may be lack of belief, lack of belief, however, is not disbelief. That makes a definition with 'disbelief' conflicting with the full meaning of atheism although it may be a part of it...</dd>

<p><b>Position D</b>: <strike><i>Atheism is defined either as (1) the disbelief in God, or (2) the lack of belief in God by those who are capable of belief in God. Atheism itself is often divided into</i> strong atheism<i>, and</i> weak atheism<i>.

<dd>This one is easy to judge, because it isn't factual. No one defines atheism that way, so the article shouldn't say that they do. It is clear enough that you do not approve of the definition of weak atheism as mere lack of belief ("<i>We cannot say that they are not atheists, just because they aren't able to believe in God!</i>"), but your personal distaste for it should not be a criterion for judging what what gets included in the article. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 00:52, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure that you read that correctly - try re-reading the quote in context.

<dd>My issue directly above was actually about the need to qualify what may be three differing views of what is meant by <i>weak atheism</i>: Namely, (1) The definition as supplied by Nohat. (2) Weak atheism is the lack of belief in God by those who are capable of belief in God (derived from Bkonrad's response to my argument as being a straw man. (3) Weak atheism is the dyadic opposition of theism - the state of not being theist. (as held by NISA, Adraeus and Andrevan)</dd>

<dd>My apologies 20040302, I did miss the comments in earlier discussion that you point out (I was searching on "rocks" and "babies" not "children" or "born") and the comments have been accreting so quickly on this page that I had missed portions of your replies to me. Until you pointed it out to me, I found it difficult to fathom that reasonable people would postulate babies as being atheists because they lack belief. For me, and this is a subtle point perhaps, but the key term is "lack". This is not simply "absense of", but carries an implicit connotation indicating that the "something" lacked is something which had once been present or which is at the least familiar enough for the absence to be noticed (I don't mean to imply that "belief" is the default condition and "lack" is somehow aberrant though). So I guess my personal POV is that one cannot be an atheist due to ignorance (although one might be through apathy). I can now see that the three positions you describe are applicable. I can see now that some proponents of atheism want to assert atheism as the default condition of human nature and that the condition of belief is a subset. I'll have to ponder this a bit more. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:51, Oct 31, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's inaccurate to characterize this as only proponents of atheism claiming that an absence of belief in theism is the default nature of humans; anyone not introduced to theistic beliefs would find the notion of a default theistic nature odd.

<dd>I agree with you FM - that it is not necessary to be a proponent of atheism to hold view E3, though I guess it is not central to Bkonrad's views. I also think you are correct to assert that many consider a default theistic nature to be 'odd'. This is why some of us struggle with the idea of placing all reasoning people into an atheist/theist dichotomy.

<dd>Yes, it is not central and FM is misreading my characterization. I say some proponents of atheism appear to be asserting <i>atheism</i> as the default. You are equating atheism with <i>absence of belief in theism</i>. This is a disputed point. I (and I do not think I am alone) feel that the lack of belief in entities that are incapable of belief is meaningless. I am most definitely NOT asserting theism as a default nature (although there are some who do). However I also do not agree that atheism is a default either. Insofar as atheism is a rejection of god(s) and the supernatural, I suspect that many in the fields of psychology and anthropology (and perhaps even neurobiology) would hold that humans do indeed have a predisposition to believe in something beyond the physical realm. I do not think that the assertion of a fundamental "blank slate" regarding theism is a univerally accepted position, possibly not even by all atheists. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 14:52, Oct 31, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is an interesting point - and one that I guess would be best left open. Certainly, I consider theism as one of many artefacts of a psychological response to mortality. Though the thought that theism/atheism are anything more than socio-cultural terms used to model belief systems is something I would struggle with, and the idea that theism is the sole religious response to mortality is something I would resist - e.g. look at ancestor worship. I would certainly argue that for societies that don't admit the theism/atheism dyad it doesn't make sense to force them into either side of that dyad, though I imagine some protagonists would do so, especially those who hold to view E3.

<dd>How about simply not mentioning agnosticism at all there?

<dd>That is sensible, though I think Yath's purpose was to find equivalences of definition; this could be more easily expressed (and avoid the can of worms that agnosticism brings) by saying: <i>Some consider all atheism to be the denial of the existence of any gods, while one who simply lacks belief in God is neither an atheist nor a theist.:</i> However, following the discussion with Bkonrad, I prefer the distinctions as made in Position E, and I consider point B to be incomplete: There is no need to force the number of views down to two, and so far we have found at least three positions regarding the definition of atheism, and two positions regarding the definitions of strong/weak atheism. My question right now is does that cover points of view among the discussants? I also wonder if it would not be more readable if we moved the weak/strong atheism definitions away from the introductory paragraph.

<dd>- I would have to agree that qualifiers are definitely needed. Just by stating 'God' shows that one is of an Abrahamic faith and more than likely, christian. If you really mean 'a god or gods' and if we want to be less sexist 'a deity or deities', then <i>3) The absence of belief in God</i> seems to be the most appealing to the actual meaning of the word 'atheism' or lack of belief in a god or gods or basically 'not theism'. While this definition may include rocks, babies, and the like, it is pointless unless you want to pick a fight -- there may be many that would reject this statement.</dd>

<dd>- To say that atheism is the denial in the existance in a god or gods is narrowing the definition. While it may still be true, it's not the entire definition. You could say more, "Atheism: the lack of belief in the existance of a deity or deities (such as God, Allah, Zeus, etc.) which is used when refering to one who denies the belief in a deity or deities. A specific religion might refer to one as atheist if they do not hold or reject the belief in their deity or deities, and in this case, atheist is usually used negatively toward the person." That may be way off, someone could clean that up though, no?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Position F</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Atheism is the lack of belief in the existence of a deity.</p>

<li>Atheism can involve the positive assertion that there is no deity.</li>

<p>This definition benefits from simplicity by avoiding qualifiers and caveats, and is the only one wholly consistent with the prevailing academic and common vernacular definition. This definition is consistent the most widely held academic definition:</p>
<dl>
<dd><br />
<b>The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences</b>, edited by Edwin R. A. Seligman<br />
In its narrowest sense the term atheist applies to one who categorically denies the existence of any gods. But in its wider sense it properly applies also to skeptics, materialists, positivists and all other who do not accept the claims of theism.</dd>
<dd><br />
<b>Agora, the Online Undergraduate Research Journal of Humanities</b><a href="http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/sukumaran1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/sukumaran1.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>:<br />
The term atheism has several subtle meanings. Theism literally refers to a belief in a God or gods. Since the prefix “a” means “without,” the term atheism literally means “without theism.” Therefore atheism is the absence of a theistic belief. However, this term encompasses two meanings. Essentially, atheism holds to a weak epistemological position – it is simply the negation of theism. Regarding this weak atheism, a person simply does not include God/gods in his metaphysics.</dd>
<dd><br />
<b>The Philosophy of Religion website</b><a href="http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/defintions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/defintions.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>:<br />
Weak atheism is defined as the absence of belief in God... A strong atheist, on the other hand, is someone who has the positive belief that God does not exist.</dd>
<dd><br />
<b>Encyclopedia of American Religious History</b>, by by Edward L. Queen, Stephen R. Prothero, and Gardiner H. Shattuck<br />
Atheism, literally the absence of belief in God, has always been a minority viewpoint in American culture.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<br />
It is consistent with credible dictionary definitions:</p>
<dl>
<dd><br />
<b>Oxford English Dictionary</b><br />
atheism: (from Greek atheos, "without God, denying God") Disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of a God.</dd>
<dd><br />
<b>Webster's Unabridged Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1957</b><br />
atheism: Disbelief in the existence of God; the state of godlessness. Atheism: unbelief in or denial of God or any supernaturalism</dd>
<dd><br />
<b>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1947</b><br />
atheism: The denial of or disbelief in God, as a First Cause, or Ground, of the universe. As dogmatic atheism it denies, as negative atheism it does not believe in, and as critical or skeptical atheism (or agnosticism) it doubts, the existence of god.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<br />
It is also consistent with common relevant online referrences: <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/atheism" class="external text" title="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/atheism" rel="nofollow">wordreference.com</a> <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist.htm" rel="nofollow">Religioustolerance.org</a> <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathd_index.htm" class="external text" title="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathd_index.htm" rel="nofollow">About.com</a> And lastly, it is consistent with these references cited in the article itself:</p>

<dd>In general, <strike>I have no problem with</strike> position F <strike>, except that it</strike> sustains the inherent ambiguity that was addressed in Position E.

I applaud the removal of definitions of weak and strong atheism from the intial statement, though where they are defined, we will need to address differences of interpretation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I currently hold that we do need to express the two separate subviews of F(2) concerning the qualification of absence of belief.

I feel we have a responsibility towards this, as WP is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I am still uncertain regarding the opening statement. I do not consider 'disbelief' to be cognate with 'absence of belief'. See discussions and definitions above. Also, position F(2) reads almost identically to the opening statement, to the point of redundancy focused merely on the exchange of 'lack' and 'absence'. Something like:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism concerns the issues of not having belief in a deity.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Atheism can involve the positive assertion that there is no deity.</li>
<li>Atheism can be the absence of belief (by those who are able) that there is a deity (disallowing babies).</li>
<li>Atheism can be the opposing metaphysical dyad to theism (allowing babies).</li>

<dd>You are not asked to believe the position of E1, just acknowledge that others hold it.

I have already told you that I cannot begin to cite sources until we have reached either an agreement, or an agreement to differ regarding the interpretation of the term 'disbelief'. I have also stated earlier that I do not consider the AGORA site, nor the PoR website to be authoritative, so it does no good in a debate with me to quote from them, as I do not accept their status as authoritative.</dd>

In fact, just the opposite, wikipedia policy enjoins us to create articles that represent the current state of understanding and knowledge. Both the Online Undergraduate Research Journal of Humanities and philosophyofreligion.info are well-established, credible publications relied upon by many.

<p>It is because of your selective interpretation of the term <i>disbelief</i> that we cannot continue sensible discussion. I acknowledge that your interpretation is one of several valid interpretations. You appear to dismiss any other reading than your own as being errors of fact. FM, I am asking you to understand the necessary plural nature of WP - it is written by massive numbers of editors, all of whom have varying POV. The fact that you consider my views to be erroneous does not make them erroneous for me. There is no point in providing citations, as we cannot even agree a common language.</p>
<p>Take for instance, the way in which you and I read a paragraph from, say, <a href="http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/presumption.html" class="external free" title="http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/presumption.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/presumption.html</a>&#160;:</p>
<p><i>Some weak atheists argue that atheism is the default position because he who asserts must prove. Theists make the positive claim that God exists. Weak atheists do not make the positive claim that God does not exist, but merely withhold their assent from the theists’ claim that God does exist. According to the weak atheist, because it is the theist that makes an assertion, it is the theist that bears the burden of proof. He who asserts must prove, and so unless the theist can offer some convincing argument for God’s existence, the weak atheist will be justified in his atheism.</i></p>
<p>My reading is that this demonstrates that weak atheists identify themselves as beings so. Firstly, they have an argument. They actively withold assent. They have a point of view ("because it is the theist that makes an assertion, it is the theist that bears the burden of proof") against which, he seeks justification. Your reading differs. This is because of the way in which we differ in our interpretation. You can continue to fling 'straw man' at me if you wish, (it appears to be phrase of the day!) but that doesn't change my reading. This is why I ask you merely to accept differing POV regarding definitions. We will be here forever if we attempt to sway everyone to our way of thinking, won't we?

<dd>The point that I have to make concerning the nominal Buddhist is that she would certainly not agree to being labelled as an atheist either. This is the position that you find so hard to understand. Buddhism traditionally (check out e.g. the Anguttara Nikaaya Sutta) has said that questions regarding the existence or non-existence of phenomena such as God are the wrong sort of question. This indicates that there is no way that a knowledgable Buddhist would claim to be either a theist or an atheist - they are the wrong sort of dyad.

<dd>Again another Straw Man. Being an Atheist no more requires the consent of the person who lacks the belief in God or gods than being an American requires the consent of someone born in the US. Found on the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> page: <i>"...(some Hindus) consider Buddhism to be a heresy as it tended to be atheistic (Buddhism, additionally rejects the Vedas, traditionally believed in Hinduism, as divine revelation, or the word of God) even though Buddha himself was ambivalent about the nature of God and such notions of heresy are alien to Hinduism as it is a liberal and tolerant religion."</i> <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/buddhism4.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/buddhism4.htm" rel="nofollow">Religioustolerance.org</a> states: <i>"Buddhists do not share most of the core beliefs of historical Christianity.

<dd>Actually, not a straw man. Your definition of atheist is only one definition of atheist. Being an atheist requires identity as an atheist. Being <i>called</i> an atheist requires only that you belong to the definition of atheist belonging to the individual who calls you that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The references you have chosen concerning Buddhism are pretty reductive third party viewpoints. The first is the POV of some Hindus, the second is authored by B.A. Robinson, a Christian theologian. Citation from Sutra or other traditinal Buddhist text is reasonably authoritative if you wish to make a strong claim about Buddhists. I did.

<dd>2) The absence of belief in God by those who are capable of belief in God. Strong Atheism is the active denial of the existence of God. Weak Atheism is mere absence of belief in god by those who are capable of belief in God.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"by those who are capable of belief in God"</i> is an spurious qualifier that serves no purpose other than to <i>imply</i> that belief in God/gods is being rejected, implying Weak Atheism is really deprecated Strong Atheism. It's unnecessary, by definition anyone capable of holding a belief is capable of believing in God, as any number of 4 year-olds will attest.</p>

<dd>So do you hold that dogs - which are able to believe their food will arrive when the packet rustles - are able capable of believing in God? Therefore all animals are atheist, right? Moreover, a newborn is not yet cognitively developed, so the claim of those who hold that newborns are atheist is indeed a dyadic position. Again, I feel that there is a need to qualify, quite carefully, the differences of opinion. Secondly, I disagree with your interpretation of "by those who are capable of belief in God". To me this is a reasonable statement, that should accord with those who consider the ability to believe in God to be a necessary precondition for being marked as an atheist.

<dd>Spare us the Straw Man arguments. Many people go through their entire life's either completely unaware of, or totally indifferent to Theism; Buddhists for example. By definition they are Atheists. And this state of unawareness or indifference means they did not by making a conscious choice to be Atheists. To exclude this significant category of people, likely multiple millions if not billions, from the article because you and others either cannot grasp this simple fact or willfully choose to ignore will only lead to a mediocre, POV-addled, and factually incorrect wikipedia article.

<dd><i>Do you find the idea of being an American or Frenchman without identifying ones-self as an American, Frenchman or whatever to be equally outlandish?</i> Well actually yes. If I were an Algerian in France, I might have some problem with being arbitrarily identified as French. Similarly, I'm sure there are many in the U.S. who would not self-identify as American and could rightfully object to an arbitrary classification (for example native peoples). Your definition is actually only factually correct if you subscribe to the world-view that you hold. People who hold a different view of the world find your definition false (at least in part). The article needs to address these differences of perspective fairly. You say the other definition isn't (factually correct, inclusive and supported by credible academic references). I think there have been ample credible references provided that show this is not the case. Please stop trying to assert your definition as being the only valid definition otherwise we will never be able to make any progress. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 19:42, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Is someone who's lived on an isolated island his whole life and has never heard of gods before "capable of believing"?

<dd>Quite true, Bryan committed a fallacy of appealing to great numbers. Just because lots of people believe something doesn't make it true. My favourite example of this is the fact that everyone in the middle ages firmly believed that the earth was flat. Is the earth flat? Atheism must be an active belief. It is in contrast to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheism.html" title="Polytheism">polytheism</a> and in general <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are babies athiest?</span></h2>
<p>Who cares? It's a completely irrelevent point in this discussion. Whether or not the term athiest applies to babies is outside the scope of reason. It doesn't matter if they are or if they're not, it's just a label, and any discussion about the issue is completely innane.</p>
<p>The definition of atheism is one who disbelieves or denies the existance of God or gods. The question seems to be, does the word disbelief pertain to an active assertion that there is not a god, or the lack of an active assertion that there is a god. I think we can all agree that the word denies is congruent with the first of those two options. Someone who denies that there is a god is someone who has an active stance of believing that there is no god. That said I think it becomes obvious that the word disbelief is meant to include the other option, lack of an active belief in god, otherwise why not just leave it at one who denies god? That much is pretty well backed up by the dictionary definitions of disbelief as a lack of belief. What argument is there for this to not be so? --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarx_036f.html" title="User:Starx">Starx</a> 17:32, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is quite possible to not believe in god and also not consider oneself an athiest. Others might apply the label, but is that fair? It is a POV. By comparision, by some accounts groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, the Church of Latter Day Saints, and Unitarians are Christians, while by other accounts they are not. It is a matter of who does the defining and for what purpose. Let us not labor under the delusion that there is an "objective" definition of atheism. There are competing definitions put forward by different POVs for different purposes. The article needs to address all of the common understandings of atheism fairly. It seems that some proponents of atheism would apply the term to anyone who meets the criteria set forth by the proponents, regardless of whether persons would apply the term to themselves. Others, quite rightly I think, find this objectionable, or at least of dubious ethical character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the issue comes down to a matter of what degree "atheism" involves conscious choice. It seems some assert that atheism does not require any taking conscious choice regarding the existence of god, simply that they do not hold any beliefs in that regard. Others, it appears, hold that atheism does entail some degree of conscious choice, even if the choice is not necessarily an explicit denial of god--one might take the position that there is simply insufficent evidence to assume the existence of god. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 19:00, Oct 31, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came on to actually write these two paragraphs. I couldn't have said it better myself. I know many Buddhists who would feel as uncomfortable about being labelled atheists as they would do theists. The point is not that they have an erroneous view of what atheism is - they merely have a different view to those who would label them as such. They would object to the label on the grounds that <i>concerning their identity as Buddhists</i> merely because it misses the point. The correlation is misapplied. It's not the right sort of assumption. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 22:49, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>If someone who doesn't believe in god doesn't consider themselves an athiest then it's because their idea of what an athiest is is incorrect. Athiest is a word with a specific meaning, there is no need for any POV. I think both of the groups you mentioned above are rightfully considered athiests. There's no reason why we can't explain the different viewpoints and at the same time stick with the true meaning of the word. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarx_036f.html" title="User:Starx">Starx</a> 22:17, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Starx, I disagree. We are allowed to have difference of opinion. If you think that there is no need for any POV, then what does POV mean? Is it an invention of sophists? 'Atheist' has a definition sure - but the day-to-day interpretation of that definition - the manner by which we have come to that term and used it in the engagement of our Weltanschauung, is inevitably varied from person to person. This is because words are sociolinguistic human constructs. We must embrace the variation of understandings that words have, not deny it.

<dd>Well said. A dictionary definition normally discusses different meanings. We know that there is no objectively definitive definition, because differing dictionaries have differing definitions. We can begin to see see how they fit into different language games, (and none of the dictionaries are so varied in their definition for us to get confused with e.g. the definition of 'cat') But dictionaries only reflect usage, the everchanging sociolinguistic flux that makes being a human so fascinating, which is the point I was attempting to make to starx (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 00:14, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC))</dd>

<p>In regards to babies being atheists, I want to point out a subtule but important point here b/c I keep seeing babies, rocks, and dogs lumped into the same category. Regardless of how you define the term atheism, an "atheist" as a noun is a *person* who subscribes to atheism. You and I are people. Intelligent aliens from other planets might be people. Babies might be people, but rocks and dogs are not people, thus they cannot be atheists. I don't see anything wrong, however, with Rocks and dogs being described with the *adjectives* atheist/atheistic/atheistical. It is in no way a "foolish conclusion" to describe them that way as Sam seems to think. My only guess is that Sam is confusing his adjectives and nouns. I don't really see any difference between calling rocks atheistic, and calling thoughts colorless. They are both silly statements, but neither of them are foolish conclusions, they are just potential unimportant facts.

<dd>Here is a quote from the very wiki article that you just pointed to: "A few philosophers have simply accepted that babies are not persons. However, most have not." I'm well aware that there are some disagreements about whether or not babies are people. That's why I used the phrase "Babies might be people" instead of outright saying that they <b>are</b> people. That's why it is reasonable to argue over whether or not babies are atheists, but not reasonable to argue over whether or not rocks are atheists. They shouldn't be lumped together like that. Furthermore, I don't believe that the term weak atheism was ever intended to be considered a belief.

<dd>Sorry, Sam, but as you yourself have said <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_DR_113f.html#Part_1:_The_introduction" title="Talk:Atheism/DR">here</a>, Atheism is not necessarily an act of denial of God/gods or a belief that there is no God/gods. In it's common and academic definition, Atheism is merely the absence of belief in God/gods. In your post above you are factually wrong about both what constitutes atheism, what constitutes an ad hominem, and what constitutes acceptable behavior at wikipedia. Thanks for making your obvious POV quite clear and how it's influenced your personal definition of atheism. Wikipedia policy on Good Faith enjoins me to assume you are here to write an objective, factually correct article, not one that represents your theistic POV. We all expect each other to remain objective. I for one refuse to once again debate anyone spouting irrational, POV rhetoric, or from considering any point that lacks any credible supporting references. Both are completely without merit and not constructive to making this an encyclopedic article.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 20:11, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
