<p>Click on <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64 FX</a>. I don't think it should be redirected to the basic article about the AMD Athlon. If you guys are re-directing that term, I think it should point directly to this article. Just my opinion. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_Cow_1aaa.html" title="User:Anonymous Cow">Anonymous Cow</a> 20:35, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've checked, it appears that it was a article before for about a year and it was redirected recently (Feb 14). I reverted the redirect. The Athlon 64 FX should have a seperate article because of the differences between the two proccessor types despite the similar names. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorm_25a0.html" title="User:Norm">Norman Rogers</a>\<sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorm_b46b.html" title="User talk:Norm">talk</a></sup> 23:03, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have made some changes.</p>
<p>For an article to have a subheading "Athlon 64" even though the article has a title "Athlon 64" seems a bit redundant.</p>
<p>I removed references to the Athlon 64 architecture (Athlon 64 is a product that implements the AMD64 architecture. There is no Athlon 64 architecture), and information abou the AMD64 architecture that is not specific to the Athlon 64 processor. This fits the pattern of the rest of wikipedia, where articles about processor products don't go into details about the processor's architecture, but instead just point out that they implement a certain architecture, and let the <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a> article handle that information.</p>

<dd>The article should say something about the different revisions of the Athlon 64. Clawhammer and Newcastle are basically the same processor, but with only 512 kB Cache in the latter case. Both can either be revision C0 or CG. CG has an improved memory controller and is more energy efficient. Then came revision D0 aka "Winchester" (90 nm with an even more improved memory controller and less power consumption). --<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchoray_be35.html" title="User:Echoray">Echoray</a> 17:03, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that Athlon 64 page contains info also about FX model, and in the future maybe X2 dual cores also. Currently there is at least short article about FX cores, so should those be merged? --<a href="../../../t/h/v/User%7EThv_5fce.html" title="User:Thv">Thv</a> 10:18, 2005 May 4 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A question: how is it that the Athlon 64 FX gets its own page when ALL K7-based Athlons (from Pluto to Barton) share the same page? The modern Socket 939 Athlon 64 FX is pretty much just a San Diego with unlocked multipliers, but there are many differences between the Athlon Classic and Athlon XP. <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 22:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do we merge the rival Intel processor(s)? We separate the desktop from the server processor, but do not separate the performance advanced version from the normal consumer version (nor the dual core). I'm an AMD guy atw, but whatever we do to Intel we need to do it to AMD... unless there is a big difference or special situation. Is the X2 a special situation? Dual core is new but nothing special. FX is a high end consumer edition, but eh... Overall I'd like Athlon 64 and Pentium 4 go one way or the other, and that means <b>I want Athlon 64 combined and merged</b>. --<a href="../../../x/1/9/User%7EX1987x_57ab.html" title="User:X1987x">x1987x</a> 17:12, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>X2 is just two A64 cores on one die. They are different processors, but I am unsure as to whether they are different enough to justify separation. Besides, article separation is not done on a technological basis; Pentium II and Pentium III are separate articles, even though early (Katmai) P3s are the exact same as late (Deschutes) P2s with just SSE and the infamous PSN added. More significantly, the Celeron article includes Celerons from Covington to Dothan to Prescott; there are HUGE technological differences between them all. Processor articles are separate on a name basis, not a technological basis-- and even if they were on a tech basis, surely two of the same core is a smaller difference than a complete arch shift (as with, say, Cu128 Celerons and Willamette Celerons). For these reasons, X2 should definitely be merged.</dd>
<dd>Also, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_microprocessors_09b6.html" title="List of AMD microprocessors">List of AMD microprocessors</a> is wrong, and has since been corrected. AMD themselves classify the X2 processors as K8, as does sandpile. K9 was originally meant to be dual-core, but AMD revised their plans. K9 is cancelled, or at the very least not in official existence yet.</dd>
<dd>The 64 FX is easy. It's almost identical to a regular 64 AND is also an "Athlon 64". Definitely merge. <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 01:12, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I vote for merging both articles into this one. The FX should be merged without a doubt. As for the X2, AMD renamed their K9s to dual core K8s a LONG time ago. Each core in an X2 is really just a regular K8, so a merge is definitely in order. Somebody just do it already.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 02:32, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An athlon x2 is not "just" 2 cores on one die (well, ok it nearly is) intels dual core is just 2 cores on one die, However as long as no info is lost and it is still clear I won't cry if they are merged. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Bluemoose</a> 22:31, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And a Venice isn't "just" a Winchester with SSE3, but the other differences are so minor that they barely deserve mention. Same applies here. Besides, as I said, it's done by nomenclature, not technological advances, so even a huge difference among processors with the same name would not merit article splittage. <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 23:05, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Well, if no one else is going to do it, I'll merge, scared newbie or no. All relevant info on the A64FX except the SH core (130nm Opterons, used for the early 940 FXes) was already in this article, so I just copied over SledgeHammer and redirected <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64 FX</a> to this article. Are there any objections to merging <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64_X2_481f.html" title="Athlon 64 X2">Athlon 64 X2</a> with this article? <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 18:06, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please update the Athlon 64 article with all Athlon64 FX info found in the old article&#160;!! And do update the cores with the FX model numbers as well. Do not merge the Athlon64 X2 - if ou are doing this then please don't forget to merge the Pentium D and EE into the Pentium 4 as well&#160;!! The X2 is more then just using two dies on one core as Intel tried on these two CPU. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenniss_c92b.html" title="User:Denniss">Denniss</a> 22:24, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Already did, the 64FX is practically identical. And as I've said before, articles are not separated on a technical basis, they are separated on NOMENCLATURE. The "Pentium D" is not the Pentium 4D (that's Gallatin, if sandpile is to be trusted), it is a "Pentium D"-- its different name merits a different article. (The same goes for the "Pentium Extreme Edition", although not the "Pentium 4 Extreme Edition".) The Athlon 64 X2, on the other hand, is clearly an Athlon 64 variant. The Celeron article includes processors from Covington to Northwood, surely a much bigger difference than just two cores (and yes, that's pretty much what it is-- I realize that AMD has a special interconnect, but that doesn't make the tech gap any larger). The Pentium III article includes IIIE, IIIEB, and late Tualatin variants, because they're ALL PENTIUM IIIs. Are there any objections that I haven't addressed? <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 06:27, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I again vote to merge the X2 article. There is no reason to keep them separate. Whoever did the FX merge, good job.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 01:25, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion no matter the simmilarity between Athlon 64 and the FX and X2 series, they all deserve a separate page, it would be much better. I totaly disagree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> it so wrong to be merged like this. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApocalypse_Bg_0d33.html" title="User:Apocalypse Bg">Apocalypse_Bg</a></dd>

<p>The Athlon 64 X2 bears very little difference from its single core brethren, other than a second core being linked through the integrated crossbar. At its heart, an Athlon 64 X2 is in reality two Venice or San Diego cores fabricated next to each other and linked by that crossbar. As a result, the data of this page should be merged with the main Athlon 64 page, which currently lacks a lot of information about the X2 processor.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think they should not be merged as 1) <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64</a> will become too long and complicated; 2) if a person searched for "athlon x2" they would be disappointed to be redirected to the athlon64 article; 3) the athlon x2 article is clearly long enough to sustain itself, it's hardly a stub, and it duplicates very little material. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin - The non-blue non-moose</a> 18:51, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Athlon 64 is not nearly as long or complicated as other articles; I doubt anyone would be disappointed to find a redirect to the relevant article; this has nothing to do with duplication.

<p>Are the micro-architectures of Opteron, Athlon 64, Turion 64, etc. sufficiently similar that there should be an "AMD K8" page for the K8 micro-architecture, with the pages for particular K8-micro-architecture chips referring to it (as is already done for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_P6_54ed.html" title="Intel P6">Intel P6</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/NetBurst_7f63.html" title="NetBurst">NetBurst</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Next_Generation_Microarchitecture_2894.html" title="Intel Next Generation Microarchitecture">Intel Next Generation Microarchitecture</a>)?

<dd>I've wondered about that (more in the context of the lack of a K7 article, but K8 too). I do think such a thing would make sense; processor articles seem to be devoted mainly to describing the history and forms of said processor rather than in-depth technical details, and most people looking for technical details would probably look up the architecture rather than the brand name of one of the processors based on said architecture. Plus, as you said, there's quite a precedent with P6 et al.</dd>
<dd>In short: I think it makes perfect sense, and I'd support such a thing, but I am too lazy and uneducated to make something like that myself. <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 05:35, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As it was, the article referred to the Athlon 64 FX-60 as an unreleased CPU. I changed this to reflect its recent release date (today!) and placed emphasis on the dual-core nature of this CPU as opposed to the other models in the FX line. I also defined the analogy between it and the Athlon 64 FX-53, both of which saw/will see two versions for two different sockets (940 then 939 for FX-53 and 939 then AM2 for FX-60). Oh and it's fine and dandy that the Athlon 64 FX and Athlon 64 articles are merged now, but I think the FX series should at LEAST get its own section! Another user pointed out that modern FXes are just Socket 939 San Diego chips with a high clock rate... but let's not forget the architectural basis of the FX line! The Athlon 64 FX-51 was very similar to the Opteron when they both were released originally (even note they were both on Socket 940). Because this gives it a clear distinction between it and the Athlon 64 line, and now the fact that the FX line has both single and dual core items, I think it is worthy of its own section in this article.

<p>On the other hand, most if not all of the <i>other</i> AMD chip pages, including the Athlon page, have "AMD" in the name, so perhaps the Athlon 64 page should be renamed for consistency.

<p>The mathematical expression for calculating the DRAM speed, displayed on the main page is <b>wrong</b>!</p>
<p>The inaccuracy is in the celling function where the "DRAM divider" and "CPU multiplier" parameters must be multiplied NOT divided.</p>
<p>A typical situation to illustrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU speed: 2500MHz;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>CPU multiplier: x9;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DRAM divider: for DDR333 mode == 6/5 ratio;</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
1. Wrong formula -</p>
<pre>
 (CPU_speed)/(Multiplier/Divider) = 2500/(9/(6/5)) = 2500/(9/1.2) =
  = 2500/8 = <b>312</b>MHz for the DRAM interface;
</pre>
<p><br />
2. Correct formula -</p>
<pre>
 (CPU_speed)/(Multiplier*Divider) = 2500/(9*6/5) = 2500/(9*1.2) =
  = 2500/11 = <b>227</b>MHz for the DRAM interface;
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>First, there's no A64 with 2500 MHz, either 2400 or 2600 MHz. Multiplier at 2400 MHz is 12 (12x200). I'm not that expert in A64 DRAM interface but I know PC-2700 (using DDR-333 chips, 166 MHz) will run slightly underclocked with standard 200 MHz system clock. Memory divider is CPU frequency divided by memory frequency and rounded up to the next multiplier. Example with PC-2700: 2400/166 = 14.457 = 15. 2400/15 = 160 MHz memory clock. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenniss_c92b.html" title="User:Denniss">Denniss</a> 18:53, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
There is 2500MHz or any other frequency in the feasible clock range for the given CPU architecture. Haven't you heard about overclocking? The example above was just a random picked number for the core speed. Whatever, your case is indicative that the DRAM divider can't take halfs but only integer values, that's why memory clock got a little bias because of the divider value rounded up from actual 14.4 to 15. Well it could be in the opposite direction, rouded down to 14, but this will result in non-standart and slightly overclocked memory (~171MHz in this case)... well not that 160MHz is stantard, but it's safer.

<dd>The formula is fine, you're just interpreting DDR333 as 6/5, when its actually 5/6. 6/5 is 1.2, and using that would be meant to INCREASE the RAM speed, not decrease it; yet DDR333 is meant to produce lower speeds than the normal DDR400. With that in mind, divide works.</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
DRAM clock = CPU clock / ( ceil(CPU multiplier / DRAM divider) ) = 2500 / ( ceil(9 / (5/6) ) ) =
= 2500 / ceil(10.8) = 2500/11 = 227.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>Using a multiplier worked in that case, but switching it back around and using divide produces the same result. To fully prove it to you, take this example:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
Multiplier =10.5, LDT = 266, Divider = DDR333 (5/6). 2793 / ceil( 10.5 / (5/6) ) = 215.
</pre>
<pre>
2793 / ceil( 10.5 / (5/6) ) = 215.
</pre>

<dd>Well you'r right for the DDR ratio flipping, but that's simple mathematics - when you divide by fraction number that or either way you have to change the positions of the numerator and denominator and thus "my" formulation comes in to place, so both cases are correct by my mean. Now I wonder how is the case with the new AM2 DDR2 platform? And yes, I have a K8 setup and thus I've verified much enough cases in practice&#160;;). Fellix 11:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, AM2 calculates its DRAM speed in the same way. Thats why the speed ends up being about 780MHz instead of 800MHz on some chips. You're right about both formulas being valid depending on how you take the DRAM divider, too. The trouble is that DDR333 is 5/6, due to the original meaning for that divider.</dd>

<dd>I cant remember exactly what motherboard or chipset had the divider feature first, but it was in the Pentium 4 Northwood era if I remember correctly. You had various options offered as 6:5, 5:6, 4:3, etc etc. The board would take the ratio and just multiply the FSB by it, to get the DRAM frequency, without any of this formula nonsense (you probably know all this, but bear with me). Some manufacturers labeled them as DDR266, DDR333, DDR400, DDR466, and the rest, depending on what the resultant speed was. Multiplying 200MHz by 5/6 resulted in a speed of 166.67MHz, or DDR333, and from that day on we've been using 5/6 as DDR333, even now the FSB has taken a long walk of a short pier. In keeping with that, you need to use the formula already on the page. --<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkorp_956a.html" title="User:Skorp">AthlonBoy</a> 15:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The newly filled-in History section (by the way, nice work BorgHunter) states that the main benefit of socket 939 was its 1GHz hypertransport. Surely the dual channel memory controller did more? It has been shown that even a Hypertransport speed of 600MHz is fine, by lowering the HT multiplier, so a small 200MHz bump hardly made the difference. The near-doubling of memory bandwith did, however. I edited the section but it has been reverted because the citation is incorrect, but the citation was a Toms Hardware review of the first 939 parts, and it clearly states that 754 has a single channel memory controller.</p>

One could argue that the list on the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64</a> can shrink (or disappear), with the details going on the "List of AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors" page. (The same probably applies to other x86 processor pages, whether Intel or AMD; there are already "List of" pages for several of them.) <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 07:44, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been all over the Net trying to get some more information on this "Hardware-set permission levels" business, and unless it's part of Presidio or that virtualisation thing (Pacifica?) can't find anything! Where did this bit of info come from and which 64s is this feature in?</p>

<p>What's this shit about "Mobile Athlon 64" leading to Turion 64? They're two separate processors. The Turion 64 is the low energy consumption one, and the Athlon 64 Mobile was, for a time, the high-performance one that was essentially the desktop processor with SpeedStep added. I know this because I've got a shitty Athlon 64 Mobile in the computer I'm typing this with.</p>
