<h2><span class="mw-headline">Added "Subud"</span></h2>
<p>Weak or strong atheists may be (and in fact are) members of the international spiritual, charitable, and cultural association called Subud. At the minimum, Subud requires one to be open to insight from a source that is not explicitly known. Religious persons in Subud call this source "God" or a "creative energy in the universe" while atheistic or agnostic persons refer to it as coming into contact with intuition or the unconscious. E.g., there are various therapies such as Primal Therapy (see <a href="http://www.primalinstitute.com/theory.html" class="external free" title="http://www.primalinstitute.com/theory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.primalinstitute.com/theory.html</a>) that are cathartic and energizing (like the Subud meditation exercise is), yet do not require belief in God. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 21:47, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleted Subud</span></h2>
<p>I deleted the link to Subud. I see a difference between the words "religious" and "spiritual" that some people (at least Sam Spade and Dunc Harris, and probably many others) do not accept. To some, the words "religious" and "spiritual" have the same meaning. This is fine, b/c in some coarse sense they are in fact the same. In a more nuanced sense, however, there are slight but critical differences. However, it is not my purpose to argue that specific point right now. Rather, I want to point out that b/c this distinction isn't accepted, that the article got edited, and now the article is in error. That is, when I originally edited, the wording looked like this: &lt;...religious or spiritual organizations which allow atheists as members. Some examples are the Naturalistic Pantheists, Brianism, Subud...&gt; However, after more edits, the article now looks like this: &lt;There are religious belief systems, including much of Buddhism, Unitarian Universalism, Subud and Universism, which do not require belief in a deity.&gt; And, as I've said here, Subud has no beliefs, creed, dogma, nor any kind of religious tenets. Thus I've deleted it-Subud is not a "religious belief system" as the article stated. Subud may be "spiritual" in some sense (although it need not be), but it certainly is not overtly a "religious belief system."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism precludes spirituality</span></h2>
<p>Sam Spade said a person cannot be both spiritual and atheist (i.e., atheism precludes spirituality). Dunc Harris said that words used to describe Spirituality are incomprehensible gobledegook. However, in order to be consistent with these views, shouldn’t the entire section on “atheist religious organizations” in the Atheist article be deleted? From your points of view such wording is unintelligible. I submit to you both that you argue that atheism precludes spirituality, and if you are successful then we can delete that section of the Atheist article that mentions “atheist religious organizations.” <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 12:26, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

From the principles of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalist_ee58.html" title="Unitarian Universalist">Unitarian Universalist</a> Association: "Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations" and listed among the sources of the traditions they follow: "Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature" and "Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life." In general, see the definition of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, which indicates spiritality as being a focus on personal experience and revelation as the way to true understanding of the universe but does not necessarily require any gods to be involved.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Further observations on "Atheism precludes spirituality" (APS)</span></h2>
<p>First, Sam Spade said: "...Mentioning religious groups which accept atheists seems fine to me, so long as its accurate. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a>..."</p>
<p>Fine, and I agree. However, there's a difference between the words "religious" and "spiritual." Spirituality doesn't necessarily have anything to do with God nor anything transcendent, while religion usually does have elements of belief in God and/or belief in something transcendent. (From <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">Spirituality</a>: "...Others hold that spirituality is not religion, per se, but the active and vital connection to a force, power, or sense of the deep self."). Given this aspect of the definition, it seems appropriate to mention Subud in the Atheist article because Subud does not require religious belief, and accepts atheists as members. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 11:10, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">Spirituality</a> has everything to do with the transcendent, to suggest otherwise makes the term meaningless. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 23:17, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, Sam Spade said: "...atheism precludes spirituality..." (let's call it APS) and, as <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> perspicuously pointed out, it seems that this statement (APS) is in error, given the definition of "spirituality" (cited above from the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">Spirituality</a> article.) An atheist can certainly have a "vital connection to a force, power, or sense of the deep self." Neuroses and patholgoy in general stem from buried unconscious drives which, in part, result from repressed traumatic experiences from early childhood. Various therapies (e.g., Philosophical Counseling, <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_therapy.html" title="Cognitive therapy">Cognitive therapy</a>, etc.) deal with resolving these unconscious problems, and some take a spiritual (NOT necessarily religious) approach to doing so. At the root of most therapy is developing that vital connection to the deeper self, and ridding one's self of irrational ideas (such as an omnipotent God sitting up on a golden throne, inexplicably blessing people with wonderful bounties one moment, and torturing them with Holocausts and Pol Pots the next). An atheist (or non-atheist) can fully and beneficially participate in these various types of therapy, even if the therapist does take a "spiritual" approach. So, at one end, APS is a complete error, and at the other end it's an exaggeration. Either way, it has a hard time standing up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>I do agree with the statement: "atheism precludes belief in the transcendent," but it could be argued that "value," in and of itself, is not something that is purely instrumental. If the argument for "inherent value" is taken far enough (which I won't argue here), the statement "atheism precludes belief in the transcendent," also, at the very least, comes into question. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 11:10, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Spirituality refers to ones relationship with the trancendant. Taking this into account, the majority of your above statements are not relevant. Psychology does indeed have some relationship with spirituality, but this is not always the case. Look into <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jung.html" title="Jung">Jung</a>. I don't understand your statements regarding value. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 23:24, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Third, Sam Spade, please clarify this group of words, because it is a sentence fragment (in terms of English grammar, I mean): "If atheism precludes spirituality is an important question, but is not something the article narrative should be expressing an opinion on." E.g., if you remove the first word of this group of words (the word "If"), then the group of words becomes a sentence. There are, of course, other alterations of this group of words that could be made to turn them into a sentence, but I don't know which alterations to make. Thanks in advance for clarifying this. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 11:10, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fourth, just as a head's up, I'm going to consider putting "Subud" back into the atheism article, especially if it can be done in one sentence to show that it need only be "spiritual" in a very weak and generic sense, and that it's certainly NOT necessarily religious. The problem rears it's head here that much of what is written about Subud is written from a religious point of view, and those of us who are atheistic or agnostic (from the classical theistic point of view) have only a small voice. I.e., do a Google search, and almost everything that comes up (including things that I've written on the internet) will have the word "God" in it. But, Subud need not have any type of religious component. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 11:10, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind you mentioning Subud, so long as what you mention is <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and factually accurate. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 23:26, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I shouldn't put anything more on this page because it is too long? It says "44 KB" at the top.

(Duncharris said: "Although an atheist may well be able to follow Subud, I have never heard of [t]he term, and it appears to be religious/spiritual, and uses the same incomprehensible gobledegook [sic]." The gist of my response is that "there is room for "spirituality" within a scientific/materialistic worldview." See <a href="../../../s/p/i/Talk%7ESpirituality_bade.html" title="Talk:Spirituality">Talk:Spirituality</a> for the argument. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliman_b860.html" title="User:Aliman">Aliman</a> 11:10, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but God is a particular instance of a god (according to most people), so he's included when you talk about gods. And atheists don't not-believe <i>only</i> God, so IMO it's best to avoid using that one specific god's name if possible. This is an issue that's been argued extensively before, check out /Archive 5#"God vs. god", /Archive 5#Capitalization of G, /Godvrs.god poll and /Archive_6#Conventions_in_capitalization for some historical background on it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:23, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This argument is absurd; Sam sums up the reasons admirably. But in addition, our typical reader doesn’t care that atheists do not believe in god or gods – since the vast majority of readers will agree with them. It is that they do not believe in God that makes atheism a worth topic for inclusion. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 10:18, Aug 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly, essentially everyone "does not believe in" or at least does not worship, some god or another. It is the denial of God that defines atheism, a crude inspection of the etymology of the term tells us that. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 11:28, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The etymological definition has since expanded to include disbelief in any god, not just the Abrahamic god. Obviously, someone who lacks belief in that god but worships another would not rightly be called an atheist, except perhaps by some of the more extremist religious believers. It is this lack of belief in any god that defines atheism. The origin of the word is irrelevant to its current meaning, just as with many, if not most, words. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavin_1d1a.html" title="User:Davin">Davin</a> 00:46, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is exactly the same argument that's been gone over before. Banno's "atheism is only about <i>my</i> particular god" argument was done here: /Archive 5#Capitalization of G (about three quarters of the way down the section, on January 28). You can read my responses to this argument there if you like, but to summarize: "no it isn't." Atheism is about <i>all</i> gods, which includes the one that any given monotheist believes in but also much more than just that. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:05, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the real question in all of this, is why so many religious people who believe in God (here I do mean the name of a particular monotheistic deity) feel the need to define a minority view point in opposition to their own beliefs (a view point which encompases much more than just a <b>silly</b> argument over the existance of a deity named God -- ask 10 people who believe in "God" just what "God" is, and you'll get 10 different answers, but theist rarely ask what others mean by the word God). Are they really so self absorbed, that everyone else's view point has to revolve around their own? The answer is so obvious I shouldn't even have to comment on it.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/c/Juche.html" title="Juche">Juche</a> just got removed from the list of atheistic "churches", and although I'm quite ambivalent about it myself (I also removed it once and then restored it again some time ago) I figure it's sufficiently borderline that we should discuss it a bit here on talk:. From the Juche article, this paragraph is the source of my discontent:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some sociologists and other overseas scholars have likened Juche to a religious movement. They have claimed that the modern ideology indicates that adherents can achieve immortal life by shaping the immortal state and that the leader, according to Juche literature, is received in the same language in which Korean Christians would receive communion. Juche authorities state that the idea is a secular one.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>All that I know about Juche comes from that article, and based on that I'm thinking we might want to mention it here as an "iffy" case. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:26, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was I who removed it. Juche is a political idea developed and promulgated by the late Kim Il-sung in North Korea. The "sociologists and other overseas scholars" who claim that it is a religious movement are really reaching. That claim is on a par with the frequent and tiresome accusation that communism is a religion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know a bit about juche, but this is the first time that I have read that "its adherents can achieve immortal life". That's a patently absurd statement. I nearly removed it when I edited the article on juche just now (for NPOV), but I decided to leave it on the grounds that there probably are "sociologists" or "scholars" in South Korea who spread this silly rumour.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, juche certainly isn't a church. There is no community of adherents, and there certainly aren't institutions comparable to communion. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 23:39, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the positions on this table may seem contradictory, or at least unfounded, but where beliefs are concerned a great many people rely on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a> and thus can believe strongly in things which they do not believe have been or can be rigorously proven.</p>

<dd>This table has been moving around for awhile. Maybe it can go in this article? I don't know if atheists agree w the definitions in it, but I as a theist don't. Anyhow, if you do put it in, please qualify it as the opinion of some, not an end all be all catagorization (since I am sure lots of people have divergent opinions). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 01:27, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think including the table would create more confusion in a word with a very simple meaning and itself is seriously open to question. An atheist is simply one who lacks any god belief. The reasons may vary from indifference, ignorance (All young children are atheists) or a careful weighing of the issue (not necessarily a choice, many atheists couldn't believe in any deity if they wanted to, and some wish they could, anymore than most could convince themselves that the Earth is flat). Within that definition there is a strong spectrum of view which the article covers well. Also I think the latest edit whilst correct in this sense is now less clear because the English is more difficult, but that's just my subjective view. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 07:31, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nick, where do you get your definition from? <i>An atheist is simply one who lacks any god belief</i> is dependant too strongly on etymology, rather than common usage. Atheism is defined by most dictionaries and encyclopedias as the "disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of God or gods."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is quite clearly a stance regarding God in the definition - there is a distinct difference between disbelief (it requires a conviction) and mere absence of belief (such as is supposedly held by babies).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly, many conservative christians consider absence of belief to be atheist, but this cannot be said to be NPOV - there are other definitions, and other viewpoints. And I am pretty sure that you agree that there is a strong difference between a skeptical atheist who writes books such as Atheism: The Case Against God (ISBN:087975124X), and a baby. Are you really sure that it is NPOV to state that babies are atheist?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the table, Sam, I personally feel it needs further work. There is indeed a problem of POV - certainly the terms are not universally recognised! But what it does show is that there is a wide spectrum of viewpoints regarding the existence of God. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that there are two fundamental flaws regarding the axes of the table - if you will, it shows variation of provability over variation of existence. This indicates that it would only be relevant to those who subscribe to the rationalist project - who buy into a fundamental conviction about the nature of existence and proof. What about, for instance, someone who says that provability is meaningful only within the context of its bounds? This would suggest that one could not begin to use the term 'proof' regarding the existence of God one way or another. Secondly, regarding existence - it appears counter-factual to me for people to talk about the 'existence' of God, in that it implies that the existence/non-existence dichotomy is larger than God (according to the table God is contained in one or the other - the irrelevance columns appear to be not part of an existence or proof criteria). Essentially, I am saying that if we agree that God is ineffable, then talking about God in terms of existence or provability is a meaningless exercise, analogically similar to arguing whether or not the statement "This statement is false" is actually true or false. These issues may be addressable for the table, but they are currently not dealt with as it stands. Also, where are Nick's babies in the table?!

<p>Here is an extended variant, which includes babies, and those who do not subscribe to the ideas of meaningfulness concerning the metaphysical/ontological existence of God, but still allow for belief in God.

<p><br />
It should be noted that here I came to the conclusion that one may merely believe in God without necessarily believing in an ontological status of God. Some people may consider the distinction irrelevant, but I am not so sure. To me, the to assert the <i>existence</i> of God requires an ontological/metaphysical assertion regarding the nature of the universe, which I feel is not necessary for the mere belief in God. I have chosen label the label 'simple' for those who have no views regarding the ontological status of God; this does not mean to denigrate such views, but merely distinguishes them from the 'naive' view of not having views regarding the provability of God. I also feel that it is possibly mistaken to use the term apatheist to describe both those who say that the existence of God is not relavant, as well as those who say that the provability of God is irrelevant: - we end up with ambiguous apatheist apatheists! I have added labels for those who feel nothing can be said (silent), and those who believe that the provability of god has been decided (established).</p>
<p>Again, the actual labels are pretty arbitrary, and do not necessarily represent their common uses. The purpose of the table is to look at covering the entire spectrum of beliefs concerning God, and it is not concerned with accurately labeling them. Secondly, none of the labels are meant to be denigratory or insulting. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</p>

<dd>This table also should include the mentally ill, those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and those who incur brain damage who become atheists. Atheist at least in the soft sense of not having any deity belief, even if at one stage they were staunch deists of one 'brand' of theistic conviction or another. I maintain that the table is trite, a harsh view perhaps, but there it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I assert again that the meaning of atheist is very simple 'to be without belief in any deity' this is not POV, there is absolutely no hint of axe grinding here. Within that definition we have soft or hard or if you prefer positive and negative atheists and the article covers these rather well to my mind. The common misuses problem is a rather moot point, the word 'disingenuous' is misused all the time, but this does not make the common error any more correct anymore than the plethora of individuals who are incapable of pronouncing properly the word ‘nuclear’ or even the simple word ‘ask’ makes this correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is indeed quite possible to be an apathetic atheist, in so far as one does not have to be one who 'denies' anything. The problem of course is that the very term atheist tells us very little about what any individual atheist’s cosmic view is. All it does is tell us a tiny part of what their view isn't, such is the nature of describing somebodies views by what they are not. A bit like describing someone as a non-capitalist could cover the spectrum from a Tibetan Buddhist monk through to a Namibian Himba tribesperson and on to a screaming if slightly anachronistic Trotskyite (and yes the anachronistic was POV!).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 21:37, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are all entitled to our opinions Nick - and I ask you to remain cordial, as well as civil - but the choice is yours. There remains areas of the extended table which are not covered by your reductive stance. For instance, (1) I believe that one cannot talk meaningfully about the ontological status of God, and I also (2) believe that it is not meaningful to talk about the provability of God; further more, I am convinced that (3) nothing meaningful can be said about belief regarding God. The extended table would call me a "skeptic relativist silent". This does not make me an atheist on your terms, because I reject the attribution 'to be without belief in any deity' in (3). I am also not an agnostic, or a theist. So - using your own criteria, label me.</p>
<p>On your earlier note, brain damaged individuals would (in extreme cases) be under the heading "unaware naive simple". The table does cover most beliefs regarding God. Secondly, I doubt you meant to say 'trite' - as it was created today, it is counterfactual to say that it is so worn out, hackneyed, and common that it has lost interest for anyone.

<dd>The reason I see the table as silly, and yes I did mean 'trite' is that I see it as yet another attempt to pigeon hole or categorize views using largely arbitrary criteria, it is a false categorization of a multi faceted, multi dimensional continuum, which is why I don’t see a table as the proper tool for this exercise. I see simple descriptions using well written prose as far more appropriate and my view is that including your table in the main article would make it a considerably lesser piece and less enlightening for the vast majority of readers. It is actually quite a good article save for those that keep seeking to come seemingly with some agenda to the definition at the start and making it less enlightening--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 23:18, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Briefly,
<ol>
<li>Any simple definition is a pigeonhole. I agree that the tables are indeed imposed reductive categorisations of one or more continua; that was my purpose: To begin to show the extent of such continua. That is exactly why any in/out (black and white) definition of atheism will inevitably be reductive and mistaken. Secondly, I am not convinced in 'shades of gray' - I feel that the scope of the term is more than bipolar.</li>
<li><i>Nothing meaningful can be said about belief regarding God</i> is not-necessarily self-contradictory. If one asserts that God -by definition- (and this may not be your definition) is ineffable (or inconceivable) then what meaning does it have to say that one can think of, or have a concept of God? If God cannot be conceived of, then in my mind it is meaningless to talk about belief regarding God. This neither is a statement of belief or non-belief regarding God, but a statement of the limitations of the normal human mind. So, IMHPOV any question regarding the existence or nature of god is likely to be answered with something like "It's not like that". With real respect, it appears to me that because such thoughts don't fit into your boxes, you wish to say that my POV is self-contradictory.

<p>I consider the recent work by Adraeus to be suitable, and in the right direction.</p>
<p>Without attempting to incite trouble though, it seems that NISA considers atheism to be a passive position, whereas Adraeus (if I understand correctly) and myself consider it to be an active position. Is it possible to find rooted concensus, or should the article indicate the distint variations of POV?</p>
<p>Secondly, Adraeus considering it is possible to be neither a theist, nor an atheist, is there some way that is sensible for naming those that belong to such a group? (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>At the risk of sounding arrogant, I don't think a consensus is required for the types of atheism if some people don't understand atheism correctly. There are as many variations of atheism as there are atheists. I suggest keeping the definitions of atheism, weak atheism, and strong atheism generalized. After all, specificity isn't required for a person to state, "I'm an atheist." The same is true for political parties. I also don't think it's possible to be neither theistic nor atheistic. Those are yes/no descriptions of a person's theistic beliefs: they either believe in gods or they do not. How they believe or don't believe is another matter. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 19:40, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that other people (such as myself in this case&#160;:) are going to be accusing <i>you</i> of not understanding atheism correctly. Case in point, your apparent rejection of negative atheism and insistance on calling weak atheism agnostic atheism here in the main article. I consider this to be a misunderstanding since agnosticism is not directly related to atheism/theism; it's a philosophical position about <i>knowledge</i> whereas atheism/theism is about <i>belief</i>. This has come up before in the history of the atheism article and we achieved consensus about most of it, I'll dig up some references to past discussion in a few minutes to make sure we don't just go through the same efforts over again. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:44, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

An agnostic <i>can</i> be a theist; <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> is an example of an agnostic theist that pops to mind (see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08603a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08603a.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>).

<dd>There are agnostic atheists and there are agnostic theists. Agnosticism regards <b>how</b> one believes (or doesn't believe). "Agnostic atheist" is a perfect term for a "weak atheist." As mentioned later in the section, weak atheism is not equivalent to agnosticism; however, they do overlap. "Agnostic" is an adjective, not a noun. Think of that way and you shouldn't have a problem comprehending this issue. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 00:33, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with all that. But I disagree that weak atheism and agnostic atheism are synonymous; it is quite possible to believe it is <i>possible</i> to know whether gods exist (not-agnostic) and yet lack a belief in any gods because no compelling evidence has come along to convince you (weak atheist). One word is about knowledge, the other's about belief. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:37, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Separate issue</span></h4>
<p>A separate issue, in the meantime. This was removed from the "morality and philosophy" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most religions include a moral code (e.g., the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>) and teach that morality derives from their deity or deities. Their followers, therefore, often believe that to fail to believe as they do is to be without morals—or even, in the absence of a protective religious belief, to be defenseless against the corrupting influence of agents of evil.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I consider this to be quite relevant, since although it's discussing the beliefs of religious people rather than atheists it's addressing the beliefs of religious people <i>about</i> athiests. The line immediately after this bit begins "Atheists deny charges of amorality", but without this section there aren't any "charges of amorality" mentioned now. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:50, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Most religions..." is a generalization and therefore ambiguous. (That section is also poorly written.) This article is supposed to <i>discuss</i> atheism not <i>argue</i> for it. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 23:56, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A specific example is given in parentheses right in the first line.

It's a description of certain views of atheists that are commonly held by theists. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:04, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

For a more general example, see <a href="http://www.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T936" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T936" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. It includes the following lovely description of atheistic outlook: "Since there is no God, there is no right nor wrong, and human action is neither good nor bad, but convenient or inconvenient. It leaves human society without a basis for order and human government without foundation (Romans 1:10-32). All is hopeless, all is wretchedness, all is tending to the grave and the grave ends all." While it is true that not <i>everyone</i> thinks of atheists this way, it is true that <i>many</i> people do. I think it's quite important to address this issue when discussing atheist morality in an encyclopedia article, and it's possible to do so in an NPOV way. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:32, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree with Adraeus' removal today of the mention of charges of atheist amorality. These charges are more than quite common, but represent one of the primary arguments against atheism leveled by theists. Their absence is glaring; most atheists have faced these very allegations, and not having them addressed here leaves them without one more definitive source to refer those making the argument to. I suggest rewriting the passage and providing links to examples of the charges being made, there are plenty available online.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 00:40, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If many people make a case against atheism, then it seems reasonable for an encyclopedia to mention that.

For example, everything linked to from <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God_0cb5.html" title="Arguments for the existence of God">Arguments for the existence of God</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_against_the_existence_of_God_dcf7.html" title="Arguments against the existence of God">Arguments against the existence of God</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">bogus terms</span></h2>
<p>Weak atheism, agnostic atheism, strong atheism, what-ever-you-call-it, it’s a bogus term. The accepted terms are written by theists (the majority, esp. historically), and the terms are "agnostic" and "atheist".</p>
<p>An agnostic is he who doubts, or claims incompetence to judge. An atheist is a denier of God, someone who is adamant in their refusal to accept God. <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalek.html" title="Amalek">Amalek</a>.</p>
<p>Atheism is a very strong word, and these attempts to rewrite the terms (not by editors here, but by atheists/agnostics/non-believers generally) blur the lines. It is very important in this article, and in all of those articles using these terms, to clarify that these used here are not the generally accepted labels. Maybe they are in some communities, or will be in time, but they are not generally the terms used <i>now</i>, and must be clarified as such. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 23:58, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

Atheism is not a choice; it's a natural state of being. Humans are born lacking theistic beliefs. Humans are born as atheists. When one states, "I am an atheist," they are identifying themselves as a person who lacks theistic beliefs. They are identifying themselves as a person who has not subscribed to a religion or a theistic belief-system. There's nothing more to it than that!

<dd>I don't know where you get your information but what you've presented is incorrect. "Weak atheism" and "strong atheism" are accepted terms that refer to the two main categories of atheists. Religionists may not accept those terms; however, their opinion is irrelevant for they are no longer sane. The <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=atheism" class="external text" title="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=atheism" rel="nofollow">definition of atheism</a> contains two senses: the first refers to strong atheism while the second refers to weak atheism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism is not a passive stance</span></h2>
<p>Quite clearly there remains a distinction of view regarding the necessity of mental activity in atheism. I, and most dictionary definitions, assert that atheism is an active stance- it involves a <i>disbelief</i>, and not merely a lack of belief. Moreover, theism also is an active choice. Regardless of whether or not it fits with ideas of a necessary dichotomy that we may have concerning the term, the position of requiring an active position means that there is a scope for people who are neither atheists nor theists.</p>
<p>I am a person whose view is not unique in believing that it is NOT true that the entire population can be divided into theists and atheist. The article does not appear to address such a community that I am a member of, which means that it remains POV. Before someone says "oh that is weak atheism", I disagree. Weak atheism, regardless of whether or not it is a neologism, would be a misnomer as such people do NOT disbelieve in God, just as they do not believe in one; they maybe merely completely unaware of the idea, they may believe that belief in God is itself ineffable.</p>
<p>Lastly, a possibly smaller community (which I would include myself to be within) consider themselves to be involved in the philosophies of (a)theism, but reject the theism/atheism dichotomy as they consider such terms to be cultural, semantic issues that can bear no relation to fact. This is not a self-contradictory position. It is more of a pragmatic position, if anything.</p>
<p>My final view of terms such as atheism is that they are deliberatly used by socio-political authorities to promote their own cause, and in themselves are nothing more than typical tools used in socio-political propaganda exercises. To say "I am a theist" or "I am an atheist" is just another way of declaring ones-self as belonging to a community; it appears to me to be nothing more than thinly veiled tribalism. Therefore it is not necessary to use a label at all for those who are neither atheist nor theist, just as it is meaningless to say to a Greek "If you aren't a Republican you must be a Democrat" (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</p>

<dd><b>Atheism cannot be an active stance--a choice--for humans are born as atheists.</b> That is, humans are born lacking belief in gods; therefore, atheism is a passive and natural condition. Theistic behavior is learned and religious behavior, regarding theism or atheism, is also learned. These behaviors are not components of atheism. The two categories of atheism are explicit: <i>strong atheism</i> is a positive belief in the nonexistence of gods while <i>weak atheism</i> is the lack of theistic belief for absence of certainty of the existence or nonexistence of gods. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 11:41, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a contradiction in your stance, from my POV. These two sentences contradict: <i>"Humans are born lacking belief in gods; therefore, atheism is a passive and natural condition."</i> AND <i>"Atheism is generally defined by most dictionaries and encyclopedias as the "disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of God or gods.</i>" I reiterate. Disbelief or denial is not cognate with a passive condition.</dd>

<dd>Learn how to use a dictionary. For many words, there are multiple senses. You can't choose one sense and try to argue that everything centers around that one sense. Positive belief in the nonexistence of gods (strong atheism) is the "disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of God or gods." That sense, that category of atheism, is an active position; however, the term "atheism" is used to refer to only the lack of theistic beliefs. Here's <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=atheism" class="external text" title="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=atheism" rel="nofollow">what Princeton University has to say about atheism</a>. Strong atheism is motivated, and therefore, an active belief in the nonexistence of gods. <b>Atheism, sometimes called weak atheism, is only the lack of theistic beliefs.</b> Nothing more, nothing less. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 13:15, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with pre-scientific thinking is that statements of assumption (belief) and statements of fact tend to be regarded as the same. Belief and knowledge <b>are not</b> synonymous. You're obviously bringing this discussion off-topic. Bryan meant by "knowledge" that agnosticism regards <b>how</b> one believes (or doesn't believe.) It is a concept, not a religion. It is not a belief in, a disbelief of, or a lack of belief. It is a concept that regards <b>how</b> those beliefs are processed. Amazing. I actually have to say that again.

<dd>I did <b>not</b> say they were synonymous. I said they were linked. As most people do not think scientifically (and I'd guess of those who do, most only do so when necessary for the task at hand), I think it's overly simplistic to seperate out the two. For example, a lot of strongly religious people will tell you they don't just believe God exists, they know He/She/It does. To me it's obvious that belief isn't a simple off/on thing: religion is a complex issue that many take years to arrive at their final answer. Clearly there are various strengths of belief. Why is it so hard to believe that there can be states in between: where it would be incorrect to classify someone as either a believer or a non-believer? I think such states exist, and I think <i>some</i> of those states are called agnosticism. Others would be called ignorance, as in the lack of knowledge that theism (and hence atheism) is even an option.</dd>

<dd>To relate that back to the original topic: atheism is an active stance due to this. Humans don't start out lacking belief. They start out not knowing about the concept of religion. You can't lack belief in something until you know of the possibility of the thing existing. Trying to define this otherwise is like talking about what existed before time started: the concept of before doesn't make sense without time. Likewise, belief doesn't make sense without the option of something to believe in!</dd>

<dd>As I see it, the only way atheism can be the default is if there is a God, and that God ensures humans are born with a knowledge of the possibility of theism, but without theistic beliefs. While that could be true, it sounds a little far fetched to me, and is certainly not a solid base for an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 14:12, Oct 22, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Atheism is an active stance" is just your particular POV, however. As several people have argued, there are people out there who count themselves as passive disbelievers - weak atheists, but not <i>necessarily</i> agnostic (even though they're often linked). One can develop agnostic beliefs or one can develop non-agnostic beliefs without necessarily affecting one's atheism. The issue of what's the "default" isn't strictly relevant to this. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 14:59, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was born a weak atheist, but more importantly one who had no inkling of any gods at all. In my youth (we're talking age 4 or 5 here), I was introduced to theism and I strongly disliked it, becoming a sort of strong atheist (with arguments like "God doesn't exist obviously because I can't see him, and it's impossible to be invisible") until I was about 10 years old, when I realized that weak atheism is the only defensible stance. Weak atheism can be defended because it is a <b>passive</b> stance, one that makes no arguments about the world. Strong atheism is an active stance because it argues that no gods exist. Agnosticism isn't involved here because it deals with the possibility of knowing the truth, rather than what the truth itself is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 17:01, Oct 22, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lack of belief does not preclude believing when psychologically capable. Lack of belief does not require previous belief just as a lack of salt in a soup doesn't require previous salt in a soup. The verb "lack" means "to be without." Newborn humans lack beliefs; therefore, they lack theistic beliefs, which is the condition of being an atheist. Remember that an infant child has only a single sense of right and wrong: what feels good and what feels bad.

<dd>An atheist is not a theist. A theist is not an atheist. If one lacks theistic belief, they are an atheist. If one possesses theistic belief, they are a theist. One either believes in a god (theism) or one doesn't (atheism). You do not have a valid argument. The problem rests with your POV, not the article. You think that atheism as "a condition of lacking theistic belief" is too dependent on etymology and not on common usage. What makes your argument invalid is that the common and accepted usage of "atheism" is the etymologically dependent definition. You fail to recognize this. As such, your POV is not our problem. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 03:35, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion a weak atheist is one who takes the position there is insufficient evidence for gods, and hence choose not to believe. A strong atheist is one who goes beyond that, and asserts there is sufficent reason to disbelieve in gods. An agnostic is one who, for any of a variety of reasons, decides they don't know enough to make a choice either way. To me, that's neither believing nor disbelieving. It's like saying one must be either heterosexual or homosexual because you have to sleep with either men or women, ignoring the fact you can choose not to sleep with anyone at all.</dd>

<dd>Babies, when born, are amoral (without morals), asexual (without sexual preference), and weak atheist (without belief). This is different than being homo or heterosexual, immoral or moral, or theist or positive/strong atheist. Agnostics aren't without knowledge, they are those who stipulate that knowledge is unknown or unknowable, and babies aren't born this way. ("Weak agnosticism or negative agnosticism is the belief that the existence or nonexistence of God or gods is currently unknown, but is not necessarily unknowable." "Strong agnosticism or positive agnosticism is the belief that it is impossible for humans to know whether or not any God or gods exist.") Nobody is redefining the term atheist; it means what it always has meant, since the term was coined: not theist. A is a passive Greek prefix, meaning simply not, as opposed to against. I hope this clears up some of your objections. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 15:33, Oct 23, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like this hinges on the question of whether you define atheism as "without belief in gods" or "denying the existence of God". Modern organized religions tend to define atheism as being in opposition to their own deity(ies), and so often hold the second definition. Under that belief system, they like to classify people in three ways: Theist, Agnostic, Atheist. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 22:01, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Religionists apply the definition of strong atheism to all atheism which is an incorrect application; therefore, that misapplication is irrelevant to this objective description of atheism as it applies to atheists.

<dd>I think most of the conflict here stems from this divergence. When I change it to "does not believe in any gods" and Sam Spade changes it to "does not believe in God or gods", I deemphasizing the second definition. This is because, from the atheist point of view, singling out a single deity for disbelief is nonsensical. You might as well say, when describing Iraq as free of WMDs, that it has no WMDs or anthrax artillery shells. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 22:01, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I didn't counter it with the atheist viewpoint (atheism = lack of belief) because I assumed that was the default understanding here. I fully understand both sides, and the difference between strong and weak atheism. The point I am trying to get across, and one that I hope Adraeus will not be too hostile to, is that usage defines words. Dictionaries report meanings, they do not create them. Well, at least they're supposed to. Therefore, if 100 million people think that atheism means "disbelief in God", then they are correct, and the fact that the word meant something entirely different before they all started to twist the meaning will not change that. There is a large group of people who like to divide atheism into strong and weak, and there is a large group of people who lump them all into one definition. In order to be properly neutral, the article must report both views, and it doesn't, yet. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 10:07, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I also don't feel that atheism correctly describes my beliefs. Furthermore, outside of wikipedia, I have never heard atheism described in this way. If the definition presented here is the "true" definition of atheism, I find that strange, since I primarily associate with people who describe themselves as atheists.

<dd>The capitalized "Atheism" is the strong atheism promoted by American Atheists. The American Atheists organization does not represent all atheists and they are not considered an authority on atheism (except by religionists that don't know better.) Since the AA does have much financial power, they are able to voice their opinions louder than other atheists. The problem is that they are strong atheists, not weak atheists. I think they've produced more confusion than clarity regarding atheism in their position; therefore, I don't agree with their movement most of the time. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 03:28, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I reject that elitist hogwash: if I tried to define a Christian's religious beliefs for them, they'd be (justifiably) offended. I don't see why it should be any different with atheism.</dd>

<dd>Those bunch of links you've thrown out don't (at least directly, I'm not going to bother go looking) point to anything that supports your point of view. Even if they do, I still don't see your point. So what if some people agree with your definition. Many people don't. Therefore, for NPOV purposes, they should be heard. I also don't see why it matters whether that's what theists, atheists, or whatever think: atheists have no more a monopoly on the definition of the term than theists. The NPOV policy says that if theists see the term meaning something, they get to have their say. In fact, since theists are the majority, they get their views phrased along the lines of "The majority of people believe", as I read the policy. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 09:13, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would have posted a more extensive response; fortunately, further explanation isn't required for a rational person to comprehend. You don't understand atheism as it is. You understand atheism as you want it to be. Your arguments have been weighed, measured, and found lacking reason. Perhaps you're better suited for a theistic worldview. I tire of your endless banter in which you repeat the same falsehoods over and over. Not once have you mentioned your interpretation of the etymologically defined atheism as described in the article. Post your description of atheism so that we may see where you err in your understanding. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 10:12, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much for the personal attack. In response to your query, I quote myself: "In my opinion a weak atheist is one who takes the position there is insufficient evidence for gods, and hence choose not to believe. A strong atheist is one who goes beyond that, and asserts there is sufficent reason to disbelieve in gods." <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 00:41, Oct 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The point of my earlier questions</span></h2>
<p>The point of my early <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html#Questions_about_atheism_as_non-belief_in_deities" title="Talk:Atheism">questions</a> is that any places where the article defines atheism as "non-belief in gods" are potentially very misleading. I only got one real response, but that correspondent agreed that one can believe in beings such as Shiva, Zeus, Odin, etc. and still be an atheist. Now, I'm not really comfortable myself using the word "god" to refer to this sort of thing (I prefer saying "deva" in the context of Buddhism), but with regard to Norse or Greek ones, I just don't know what else to call them. So, it appears that atheism must mean something other than simply not believing in gods, or at least that the article needs to be much more specific about what it means by "god". - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 16:29, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a major difference between believing in those gods and believing that they were myths based on historical figures. The first is theism, the second is atheism. However, the second is a view about history; regardless of your view on history, you still don't believe those people were gods and as such reject theism in their regard. The meaning is clear, to me. This is a rather rare occurence I think, so it doesn't appear to have its own term. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 17:41, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't referring to a theory that conceptions of monotheistic gods are based on historical figures. I meant people who believe that Shiva or Zeus or Odin are real, currently existing, nonhuman beings. This is not really a rare occurance; in fact, it is perhaps the default among Buddhists. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:25, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
