<td><b>Atheism</b>, as usually defined in the context of philosophy, is an absence of belief in the existence of <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deities</a>. The definition is construed broadly: covering not just those who deny that any deity could exist, but also those who, without making any claim as to the possibility of such entities, are simply unconvinced by (or indifferent to) current arguments for their existence. It is also a formally negative definition, in the sense that it makes no assertion as to what any given atheist <i>does</i> believe, nor does it entail any specific rationale for their lack of belief.
<p>While some self-identified atheists also favor this purely descriptive definition, atheism, in common parlance, is more often defined <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normative.html" title="Normative">normatively</a>. While this definition takes varying forms, often depending on a given person's religious sensibilities, it is generally anchored in two perceptions: first, the sense that atheists reject the concept of deities and many of the accompanying religious norms of their culture, and second, that atheists are motivated in this rejection by their adherence to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanist</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalist</a> principles.</p>

<p>As this article is part of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Philosophy_88d8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Philosophy">philosophy project</a>, it seems important to provide the fully qualified formal definition up front. As the common usage definition can be fluid, I've tried to describe the factors from which it coalesces rather than try to specify the specific forms it takes, the latter being probably too unwieldy a task for an intro. While I think the language I've chosen for this is neutral, for some reason I'm not sure it <i>comes off</i> as neutral – but I could be imagining things. I think the distinctions descriptive/normative and formal/informal are more useful for the purpose of distinguishing the two definitions than the former broad/narrow, which, while strictly accurate, seems to miss the point. Any suggestions? (And anyone got a better term than 'religious sensibilities' to use in that spot?)<br />
--<a href="../../../p/l/o/User%7EPlover_d3f1.html" title="User:Plover">Plover</a> 03:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for working on this, Plover. I think the first paragraph is brilliant. I do not believe the second paragraph accurately captures the common ways in which atheism is regarded by the public. Frankly, I don't think most members of the public think enough about such things to even have as developed a view as you present in the second paragraph. I think a better approach to the normative definition(s) of atheism would be simply to list the two most common ones: (1) conscious rejection of belief in God, and (2) the doctrine that there is no God. These are the top two meanings I've found in my survey of dictionary definitions (see below), and this conforms with my own experience and readings on the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think that, though the atheism article is part of the philosophy project, the normative definitions should not be given secondary treatment, since this is a resource for all people, not just philosophy majors. Due respect ought to be given to how most people use these words in everyday language, and I think one consequence of this respect ought to be that we list the most common definitions first, followed by the more specialized descriptive definition with which you lead. Defining atheism as a mere lack of belief in deities--such that infants and people who don't even consider the matter qualify as atheists--is a very small minority usage of the word, and I'm not sure even most self-identified atheists use it this way. I certainly don't. For this reason, I think it ought to be listed after the other two, following the convention of listing definitions from most commonly used to least commonly used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I don't believe the definitions will fall neatly into the categories of "descriptive/normative" and "formal/informal" you propose. For example, one common understanding of atheism is that it is the belief that there is no God. While this might be considered in some philosophical circles as an informal understanding of the word, it has been formalized by at least one atheist philosopher (Theodore Drange), who uses it primarily because of his belief that this definition has greater utility (it more closely conforms with standard public usage, saving much misunderstanding, and it preserves a unique meaning for another word--"nontheist"--which would be rendered superfluous if atheism were defined in the broadest sense). <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 05:31, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Draft 2.0</span></h3>
<p>So, here's a new proposal. Again, I expect I'll put this up tomorrow if no one registers objections.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<table style="Background: #EEF">
<tr>
<td><b>Atheism</b>, in its most general sense, denotes disbelief in <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deities</a>. However, while all definitions contain an element of absence of or rejection of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theistic</a> <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">beliefs</a>, there are wide variations of emphasis, inclusiveness and specificity.
<p>In cultures with strong traditions of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a>, atheism is often defined as <i>disbelief in or denial of God</i>. The use of the monotheistic term "<a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>" indicating that atheism is often conceived as a departure from the assumed baseline theism of the culture. While this definition is in common use by both atheists and non-atheists, some atheists with a commitment to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a> reverse the implications and assert that theism is a departure from a baseline of rational and scientific thinking. There is also in common use a second, more narrow, definition of atheism: <i>the belief that no God exists</i>. This definition denotes the explicit assertion on the part of some atheists that no God exists or even that no God <i>could</i> exist, and is similar to the formal term <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">strong atheism</a>.</p>
<p>In the context of philosophy, atheism is usually defined as <i>an absence of belief in the existence of deities</i>. This definition is construed broadly: covering not just those who deny that any deity exists, but also those who, without making any claim as to the possibility of such entities, are simply unconvinced by (or indifferent to) current arguments for their existence. It is also a formally negative definition, in the sense that it makes no assertion as to what any given atheist <i>does</i> believe, nor does it entail any specific rationale for their lack of belief. (Some atheists also prefer this definition.)</p>
<p>Historically, strongly monotheistic cultures have considered atheism as a form of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>, with those who publically professed atheism often being <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">put to death</a>. While few nations currently treat atheism as a capital crime, widespread <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> against atheists exists in many places.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure if I completely understand. I assume the 2 definitions you refer to are the one currently in the article and whatever the proposal might be? And by leave them "up front", do you mean put both together on the article page itself? Is that a common procedure for significant edits on controversial pages? This is probably one of the more difficult intros to do justice to, but, well, I might as well try. And I have invited discussion – I'm actually a little surprised there hasn't been a greater response. I don't have much experience here, so suggestions about how to proceed are appreciated.</dd>

<p>LEAVE the 2 defintions up front:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atheism, in its <b>broadest sense</b>, is an absence of belief in the existence of gods. This definition includes as atheists both those who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not. <b>Narrower definitions</b>, however, often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists, labeling the others as nontheists or agnostics.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, at least when I misconstrue someone's post I do a thorough job of it... :)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, one of the reasons I started doing this in the first place is because I think the dichotomy represented by those two definitions determines too much of the structure of the current intro and is misleading about how the word is used overall. AFAICT, atheists (or at least atheists who chatter online) take those as the two most important definitions, and more to the point take the <i>distinction</i> between the definitions to be important – something which people who haven't considered the subject, for the most part, I would guess, don't. The standard definitions of an atheist as someone who 'disbelieves in God' or who 'doesn't believe in God' do a fairly good job of semantically punting that distinction, and, I think, indicate fairly well how most people view the question. For most people – certainly most theists, but a good number of atheists too, I would guess – the only important distinction is whether or not someone derives their morality and sense of meaning from belief in a deity. In fact, the distinction isn't even necessarily that precise: many people would probably take some convincing that a Buddhist could be an atheist, because, after all, Buddhists are religious. This is what I was getting at above about normative and descriptive terms. The terms, as used by atheists who worry about the difference between implicit and explicit atheism, are a descriptive taxonomy of what a person believes. In common usage, an atheist is just someone who not only doesn't go to church, but doesn't think they need to, and doesn't even feel guilty about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing about this intro that is easy. Among the things that need to be balanced are: the common usage definitions, the descriptive definitions, how these definitions fit into more formal philosophy, recognition of how atheists self-identify, and recognition of how atheists as a group fit into society. I doubt my current proposal really succeeds at all this yet, but I've done my best to incorporate the different issues everyone's raised. To me it seems that to privilege the descriptive definitions is to adopt an atheist POV rather than a neutral POV. The atheist POV needs to be described not assumed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In warning about edit wars, I assume you are referring to some of the discussions that took place a few months back. I may not have read enough of the archive yet, but so far I haven't seen that anyone was making the same argument that I am now, so I'd at least like to see someone argue against it before I switch tacks. I appreciate the warning though – part of me has been wondering when this is all going to blow up in my face.</dd>
<dd>--<a href="../../../p/l/o/User%7EPlover_d3f1.html" title="User:Plover">Plover</a> 14:50, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think the current first sentence ("Atheism, in its broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of gods.") is better than: "Atheism, in its most general sense, denotes an absence of belief in deities." Most importantly, "absense of belief" is more clear than "disbelief" which is a bit ambiguous. The rest seems reasonable however. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 17:58, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This ambiguity is deliberate, and is intended to follow from the change from "broadest sense" to "most general sense" i.e. rather than the definition which applies to the largest number of people, I have tried to choose the definition which reflects the largest number of other <i>definitions</i>. This is the theory anyway (some of the reasoning behind this is included above). The term 'atheism' is often used imprecisely (though correctly, as opposed to the more usual case (I think) of words that are used precisely but incorrectly), and so I'm not sure the article is best served by starting with a precise definition – or at least this is my current notion on how to implement NPOV. That said, I don't think the phrasing is particularly wonderful, and I'm open to changing it. Though I think it is important to keep 'deities' rather than 'gods', I wouldn't object too much to using the 'absence of' phrasing, but I would prefer a solution that better reflects the intent I was trying for.</dd>

<dd>But surely, "an absence of belief" <i>does</i> cover the largest number of definitions? When I say "ambiguous", I do not mean that it covers several definitions, but rather that it is ambiguous to the reader which of those definitions we mean - for example, it might be implied that we mean one of the less general definitions. Furthermore, I'd say that "disbelief" at the least implies explicit atheism, and therefore isn't really the most general way of defining it anyway.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with the rest of what you say (and I have no opinion on whether deities or gods is used), but I feel that "absence" satisfies the requirement of being the most general definition, whilst also being clear exactly what it means. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 06:41, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my response to JimWae above, I discussed how I think the common usage definition works. In particular, I think it elides the difference between the two definitions that are important to some parts of the atheist community in more or less precisely the way that the wording 'disbelief in deities' does. Yes, I realize that this distinction is important to some atheists, and I think it is important that the distinction be described. However, even if the distinction were important to all atheists, I'm not sure I would think that starting the article with the distinction would make sense, as it is not an important distinction to everyone who uses the word atheist. This is what I was getting at above by the difference between describing the atheist POV and assuming the atheist POV. You and I see the term as being ambiguous because the distinction is meaningful to us, but my working assumption is that for most people, the distinction is <i>not</i> important. Thus, start with the generic definition that is most widely recognized, then show how that definition is ambiguous, and outline the specific uses of term that are important to the people who identify as atheists. Again, this is my current notion on how to implement NPOV.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On your point that <i>"disbelief" at the least implies explicit atheism</i>: yeah, I thought of that, it's one reason I wish I could think of better wording. I decided I cared more about the POV reasoning above. I also thought of using 'unbelief' instead of 'disbelief', but that just sounded icky and awkward to me. If it's just me and doesn't sound that way to other people, it might be a good choice. However, what you're saying also makes me think that the phrase "most general sense" probably doesn't quite work the way I intended.</dd>

<dd>So why do you object to "absence of belief"? I can see what you're saying about disbelief not being ambiguous to most people, but we both agree that we want a definition that includes implicit atheism, and that "disbelief" doesn't really cover that. I agree that "unbelief" is awkard (and a rather vague too, perhaps), but "absense of belief" is quite clear. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 17:15, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not so much that I want a definition that includes implicit atheism, but more that I think a wording where the ambiguity extended to cover implicit atheism would be more semantically elegant overall. My arguments above are intended to convey why my first choice is to err on the side of using the common form of the definition (i.e. why I think this choice better implements NPOV), and it's this rationale itself rather than any particular wording <i>per se</i> to which I've been hoping for a response. My reading of your statements is that you think a wording that includes implicit atheism is more important than one reflecting the most common definition. What I'd like to know is: why? How are you applying NPOV (or maybe some other principle I haven't taken into account) to arrive at your choice? My assumption is that reaching some consensus on how NPOV and such apply to the current situation may be the easiest way to minimize contention over word choice.</dd>

<dd>Also, FWIW, the 'absence of' language does appear in the second sentence. The purpose of the second sentence is basically to indicate the inadequacy of the common definition at conveying the range of meaning covered by the term.</dd>

<dd>I don't necessarily think that a definition including implicit atheism is more important. The article doesn't start with "<i>Atheism is an absence of belief in the existence of gods."</i>, it includes the words <i>in its broadest sense</i>, and it then gives the narrower definition (though I note we don't distinguish between implicit and explicit weak atheism - but is that important to do in the introduction?). I don't think it's a problem that we have to put one definition first - I don't care whether the order is broad-&gt;narrow or narrow-&gt;broad. I don't think it's solved by putting an ambiguous definition in front of them all.</dd>

<dd>Another thought I had was to consider that this is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary. The important issue here is an article about atheism, and not how people use the word "atheism". In that sense, I'd say that (a) the philosophical definition of atheism, and (b) how people who self-identify as atheists use the word <i>is</i> more important than (c) what non-atheists think atheism is.</dd>

<dd>Again, thankyou Plover for your work on this, and for engaging in careful dialogue here. I've seen the article go through many changes, many of which have involved controversies over the "proper" definition of the word, and the "proper" classification of its many subspecies. As has happened with such words as <i>Mormon</i> and <i><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a></i>, <i>atheism</i> has been subjected to many tussles over ownership from all sides, and it seems that the moment when it will dawn on everyone that no single individual or group or dictionary owns this word and can fix its meaning once and for all is yet far away. In the case of <i>atheism</i>, where there are many definitions being used by many people at once, it's hard to know how to make an accurate, comprehensive and neutral article on the subject. My inclination is to keep this complex issue as simple as possible in the introduction. I am in favor of restricting the intro to statements amounting to: (1) a list of the most common definitions (please see below) for <i>atheism</i>, with a note that not everyone is in agreement on the proper definition, (2) a statement that the article treats as its subject all positions encompassed by those definitions, without taking a stance as to the proper definition, and (3) a note distinguishing <i>atheist</i> as a taxonomic classification in philosophy and <i>atheist</i> as a chosen self-identity that might carry with it certain attitudes, assumptions and significance within a given culture. I don't think the entire intro should be changed at once, nor do I think that every change to it ought to be discussed in depth here and voted on before being made. We want to avoid constant reverts, but we also want to avoid catatonia brought on by perfectionism. I think the intro right now is a pretty good start, and that we can start to build on it and tweak it. I propose that we avoid major overhauls as too contentious, and that we instead go ahead and make small changes--perhaps no more than one sentence per day per editor--keeping in mind the opinions expressed here both now and in the future, and responding with constructive criticism if we ever feel compelled to revert someone else's edit, and also taking such criticism in stride, explaining our changes if we ever feel our edits have been reverted to the article's detriment. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 08:27, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Draft 3.0</span></h3>
<p>So, I finally got around to finishing a new draft. This is definitely closer to what I've been trying for, and should better illustrate some of the structural ideas I've discussed above. Everyone's feedback has been very helpful – my thanks to each of you.</p>

<table style="Background: #EEF">
<tr>
<td><b>Atheism</b> can be characterized, in a general, inclusive sense, as an absence of belief in <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deities</a>. While this characterization identifies a chief element common to the various definitions of atheism – both current and historical – definitions of atheism are often strongly affected by social and cultural perceptions and exhibit wide variations of emphasis, inclusiveness and specificity.
<p>In cultures with strong traditions of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a>, atheism is commonly defined as <i>disbelief in or denial of God</i>. While this definition is in common use by both atheists and non-atheists, and often serves the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normative.html" title="Normative">normative</a> purpose of identifying atheists as a social group, many self-identified atheists consider it too ambiguous to accurately characterize the diversity of attitudes toward belief among atheists.</p>
<p>One approach taken by atheists is to adopt the inclusive characterization given above – that is, to define atheism as <i>an absence of belief in the existence of deities</i>. As a definition, this is construed broadly: covering not just those who deny that any deity exists, but also those who, without making any claim as to the possibility of such entities, are simply unconvinced by (or indifferent to) current arguments for their existence. It is also a formally negative definition, in the sense that it makes no assertion as to what any given atheist <i>does</i> believe, nor does it entail any specific rationale for their lack of belief. Another common approach is to adopt a more restrictive definition of atheism as the explicit denial that any deity exists – or, in its more common form, the assertion <i>there is no God</i> – and label other positions covered under the broader definition as <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontheism.html" title="Nontheism">nontheism</a>.</p>
<p>These approaches provide definitions of atheism that function descriptively rather normatively. However, among atheists with a strong commitment to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, it is common for these definitions to be accompanied by a view that theistic beliefs are a departure from a baseline of rational and scientific thinking, reversing the more common notion which views atheism as a departure from a culture's assumed baseline of theism.</p>
<p>Although atheists often share common concerns regarding <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">empirical</a> evidence and the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> of investigation and a large number are <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_skepticism.html" title="Scientific skepticism">skeptics</a>, there is no single <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> that all atheists share. Additionally, there are atheists who are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a>, though many of these would not describe themselves as atheists.</p>
<p>Historically, strongly monotheistic cultures have considered atheism as a form of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>, with those who publically professed atheism often being <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">put to death</a>. While few nations currently treat atheism as a capital crime, widespread <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> against atheists exists in many places. Sometimes this arises from a confusion of atheism with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a> – a position which goes beyond just the rejection of theistic beliefs on the part of the individual atheist to active opposition to others holding such beliefs. While this is not an uncommon position among atheists, the majority do not directly oppose theism.</p>

<dd>Yes, and I wrote an answer explaining what I was doing to which you never responded. What I've tried to do this time is actually have <i>no</i> definition in the first paragraph – I've stated the unifying factor among definitions without giving it the status of one, and waited until later to show how the same wording can function as a defintion. My goal is to illustrate the fluidity with which the word is actually used. The audience for this article is not atheists; it's everyone. And this goes double for the intro, since atheists who argue about what the word means obviously already have some sense of the different ways people use it. I think it's more important to find a way to introduce the subject to people unfamiliar with it than to worry about what definitions come first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would help if you would actually explain the problem. Do you find this first paragraph offensive for some reason? If not, who would? Why? There's obviously something going on here.</dd>

<p>That piece is fantastic. Only one point of contention from me - the second sentence of the final paragraph seems to imply that one does not need to look far to find discrimination against atheists comparable to, say, discrimination against blacks in the 50s and 60s. I know some states still have laws that prevent atheists from holding particular positions, but if a challenge ever came up they probably wouldn't even need to go through the full appeals process before someone just put a stop to the madness - beyond that, not much comes to mind, as atheists tend not to flaunt their atheism (in my experience). Then again, I've always lived in a relatively liberal part of a relatively liberal country. Did you have something specific in mind to back up that statement, or am I misinterpreting it? --Ted 20:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="A_survey_of_definitions_for_atheism" id="A_survey_of_definitions_for_atheism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">A survey of definitions for atheism</span></h2>
<p>Here's a survey I made of definitions linked by <a href="http://www.onelook.com/?w=atheism&amp;ls=a" class="external text" title="http://www.onelook.com/?w=atheism&amp;ls=a" rel="nofollow">One Look</a>, supplemented by the definitions I found in my own print dictionary. I found basically 4 definitions, having the following frequency:</p>
<p><b>A.</b> Lack of belief in God = 5<br />
<b>B.</b> Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God = 12<br />
<b>C.</b> Belief that God does not exist = 11<br />
<b>D.</b> Godlessness or immorality = 8<br /></p>
<p>Note that definition B is pretty ambiguous. If disbelief is defined in the weak sense (of lacking belief without necessarily having consciously rejected belief), definition B extends into the territory covered by definition A. And if denial is defined in the strong sense (of asserting the contrary of a belief, rather than merely refusing to accept it), it extends into the territory covered by definition C. Note also that definition D was generally listed as an archaic meaning.</p>
<p>This should give us some idea as to the frequency of the various usages of the word. Obviously, this is a very rough survey, by no means random, no doubt skewed by plagiarism between the sources, and premised on the assumption that the frequency of word usage by the public is reflected in the frequency of such definitions in dictionaries. Also, those dictionaries that are purely online are probably not as authoritative as those that are in print.</p>

<dd>The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/" class="external text" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/" rel="nofollow">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> has: <i>‘Atheism’ means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God.</i> What is more interesting from that page though is this prefatory remark:
<dl>
<dd><i>these words [atheism and agnosticism] are what Wittgenstein called ‘family resemblance’ words. That is, we cannot expect to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for their use. Their use is appropriate if a fair number of the conditions are satisfied. Moreover even particular members of the families are often imprecise, and sometimes almost completely obscure. Sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised philosophical scepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic.</i></dd>

<dd>I'd say that disbelief is equivalent to lack of belief by definition - it's not clear why Encarta is making a distinction - I'd say that "disbelief" implies concious rejection (so it can still be weak atheism, but it's explicit atheism), where as unbelief would include implicit atheism. Denial is more ambiguous between weak and strong, I agree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say the most important increasingly-narrower definitions are (a) Implicit weak atheism, (b) Explicit weak atheism, (c) Explicit strong atheism, which we should try to define without possibly ambiguous words like "disbelief", "deny", "reject".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's also important to indicate the definitions common only among non-atheists. It's like saying that many people think a witch is a evil person who rides on broomsticks - clearly this has no relevance on those who self-identify as witches. Another example would be <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point is that the people who only use definition C tend to use "agnostic" to refer to weak atheists (and similarly, plenty of dictionaries include the "weak atheist" definition for "agnostic). But I don't believe this definition is covered over at <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> - there we stick with the strict definition, rather than the popular misconception of the word. Perhaps we should follow the same example here? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 23:50, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is one of the problems here. One of the things that should perhaps be reflected by the articles on atheism, agnosticism, nontheism, etc. is some consistent philosophical taxonomy of the various positions. However, the system of terminology that is AFAIK the most prevalent in philosophy does not map especially well onto the common usage of the terms. Secondly, unlike most philosophical terms people other than philosophers care about what the term 'atheism' means, and so the conflict between the different meanings can't be made a side issue. In other words, in addition to a philosophical categorization, being an atheist is also an identity, and each person who adopts the identity has a specific definition in mind under which they choose that identity, and people often get upset if anyone uses a definition that is too distant from the one their identity is based on – especially if that other person's terminology puts them in a different category. Note this obviously holds even more strongly for those who define themselves <i>against</i> atheism, i.e. those equating atheism with immorality. This is what I was getting at above in the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html#Another_intro_proposal" title="Talk:Atheism">Another intro proposal</a> section when I was talking about common use definitions of atheism being normative: the definitions are motivated by factors other than providing a consistent (or sometimes even a coherent) taxonomy.</dd>

<dd>I think this problem mostly only arises for agnostics and atheists, as this is a case where there are too many concepts for the commonly known terms; weak atheism being the stance worst served by the terminology, but also, I've tended to assume, the most common. I like the term <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontheism.html" title="Nontheism">nontheist</a> as a better inclusive term to cover weak and strong atheism than atheism, but according to the article here on Wikipedia, even that has a technical sense which is distinct from any of the standard categories (and I have no idea whether the technical definition used in that article is more or less common than the use I'm suggesting which I'm assuming is the same (or nearly) as the one used by Drange that Rohirok mentioned above). Theists don't worry about the exact definition of theism too much because, their identity is associated much more with the specific <i>kind</i> of theism they adhere to, so while a theist may be very incensed at being identified as a member of the First Church of the Reformed Immaculate Whatsihoozer rather than the Second CotRIW, they are unlikely to care whether they are lumped together with deists or not under the label 'theism'. I suspect even deists and pantheists (though I could be wrong about this) aren't terribly concerned about whether they're lumped under some appropriate definition of theism – obviously as long as they aren't lumped under <i>mono</i>theism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, um, shorter more coherent version of the above: 'atheist' and 'agnostic' are the categories that most commonly act as both top level taxa in the classification of religious sensibilities, <i>and</i> as identities for individuals, and are thus the most contentious to define. (And this is in spite of the fact that, under their technical definitions, the two terms don't even categorize the same aspect of belief.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing that probably needs to be decided in organizing some of these articles is whether there should be any attempt to present any of the terms as constituting an exhaustive classification system. Theism and atheism are at least exclusive under (probably(!)) any set of definitions, but are not exhaustive under most. Theism/deism/pantheism/atheism is probably not much better. The theist/agnostic/atheist system as it exists in commmon usage is geared toward social realities of Western culture where agnostic and atheist serve most often to indicate attitudes to some perceived baseline of monotheism, but quickly becomes inadequate when complications are introduced. Most of the articles I've seen on Wikipedia on such terms seem to emphasize that the term under consideration actually answers a different question than any related terms. Is there some set of terms that can be established as a set of top of level categories? If there is, is it prevalent enough to form a basis for organizing a section of Wikipedia articles? And if no such categorization is reasonable, should Wikipedia address the concerns of those <i>looking</i> for such a categorization? If so, how and where?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Afterlife and karma consequences</span></h2>
<p>This article talks a lot about God. For me the key issue in Atheism is the denial of an <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a> (belief in non-existence at death) which implies a rejection of the view that actions (<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a>) have consequences after death. I started looking in google but was scared of it coming up with offensive material. I would like to encourage atheists to be clear about their views about these issues.<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhammapal_832a.html" title="User:Dhammapal">Dhammapal</a> 08:30, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright then Dhammapal, let me clarify the views of me and my atheistic brethren: Most of us do not believe in an afterlife or karma, and consoquently, do not believe in punishment after death.</p>
<p>This does not mean however that we have no sense of ethics or morality as we believe that karma, or the threat of any other divine punishment, is not necessary to stop us from comitting <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, assault, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, or other inhumane acts, as we have little desire to do this in the first place, or that we would not be able to live with ourselves afterwards (Atheism does not equal sociopathy).</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies our views a bit more for you,</p>

<dd>On the other hand, atheism does not imply adherence to any moral code, and, in my own usage of it, amoralism is a logical extension of atheism - God is morality, and morality requires an absolute judge to be of interpersonal significance. --Ted 03:24, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What does this concept have in common with the sorts of concepts that have held the name 'morality' in the past?

<dd>Actually, that's not necessarily so. The concepts of God and morality certainly exist; you can talk to anyone and see that he knows what it is. The fantasy of the big man in the sky is the source of the fantasy that there are inherent truths about right and wrong. All semantics aside, though, that's quite right. If it makes the world nice and fuzzy and easy to understand, and it's always been true in the past, how could it not be fact? --Ted 20:07, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please take Dammapal seriously. He (she?) didn't ask for a personal lesson, but had a suggestion for the <i>article</i>: that we do not only discuss disbelief in deities, but also whether disbelief in other "religious" concepts such as an afterlife, reincarnation, etc. is or is not implied by the term. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 01:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Phrasing it like that, you may be on to something, but does that go beyond the scope of the article? Atheism purely by its definition speaks not of religion as a whole but of theism specifically. Now, I personally feel that the entities or ideas required to govern things like that (and morality, yay) fill the exact same role as God and therefore must be discarded in order to be consistent with atheistic thinking, but my experience is that this is not that common a viewpoint. --Ted 00:27, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My understanding is that, like god, atheists would disbelieve any supernatural entity/reward/punishment. A strong atheists would even go so far as to deny any supernatural afterlife.

<dd>Atheism, as disbelief or unbelief in deities, does not necessitate any beliefs other than itself. You can be an atheist and believe in Santa Claus, or leprechauns, or the Loch Ness Monster, or whatever else you want, and you are no less an atheist for it. <i>However</i>, with that technicality in mind, in practical terms, the majority of people who <i>self-identify</i> as "atheists" hold a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">naturalistic</a> worldview, and reject all sorts of supernatural, mystical, etc. forces and entities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strong and weak Atheism</span></h2>
<p>Isn't strong atheism a sub category of weak atheism? weak athism can be summed up with the statement "I do not belive in a god" and strong as "I belive there is no god" a strong atheist is therefore also a weak atheist, but a weak atheist is not neccesarily a strong atheist.

<p>Hi. I haven't been following the discussion, so please excuse me if this has already been addressed.

(FWIW, I'm facing a similar problem over at <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_abuse.html" title="Drug abuse">Drug abuse</a>). A quick solution would be to eliminate most split sections and replace them with a top right-aligned navigation template. I would also like to move the "Reasons for atheism" as well as the "Distribution of atheists" and "Atheism studies and statistics" between "Etymology" and "Types and typologies of atheism". —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:04, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the page needs a lot of work too. There's a lot of good material, but there are consistency problems regarding definitions and so forth, and a lot more organization is needed for it to read like an article rather than an organic accretion of topics. So far I've only pursued rewriting the intro, and I haven't decided yet whether I'm going to continue after that. One thought I had though is that "Distribution of atheists" and "Atheism studies and statistics" should actually be moved to their own page (i.e. both sections as one page not two different ones) called "Atheism (demographics)" or something. The article is far too lengthy, and that seemed like one of the easiest bits to separate out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that really answers your question though. I'm happy to see anything that makes the page more navagable. Changes to this page are often controversial, but off the top of my head, I don't know why the type of changes you're proposing would particularly upset anyone. Several people here have a lot more familiarity with the history of page than I do though. Intuitively, I would push the "Distribution" and "Statistics" sections to the end of the article rather than the top (if they remain on the page), but, like I said, any real attempt at organization will probably be an improvement over what's there now.</dd>

<dd>I'm asking a question. I don't know exactly what is meant by "absence of belief." Why is it written that way? And it seems like original research to say "[Atheism] includes as atheists both those who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not." I've never heard of Atheism being non-cognitivist, and I can't find any dictionary that defines Atheism this way. Is that what the intro is supposed to be saying? That Atheism is non-cognitivist? Check out <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html" rel="nofollow">Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism</a> and there are quite a few references in there and none of them say Atheism is non-cognitivist.

<dd>Atheists consider "God exists" to be a proposition - they just don't assert that such a proposition is true (they don't necessarily state it false, by the way - many people use atheism in a way different to the link you gave, and the definition given for agnostic there is incorrect; <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> is about knowledge). The point is that we need to cover all the main usages of the term atheism, not just your personal opinion, or the usage as it appears on one random webpage. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 23:45, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is inappropriate to tag an article as either OR or not verified just because you are unfamiliar with or misunderstand a single phrase. Please google "weak atheism". The editors of this article are not making up this position, or the language used to describe it. I am unfamiliar with the term "non-cognitivist". Looking through its wiki entry, I do not see how it applies to an absence of belief. Just because you have <i>only</i> experienced one definition of the word, does not mean that "weak atheism" is OR on behalf of wikipedia editors. Are you making a philosophical argument against the position of 'weak atheism', or are you making an argument that 'weak atheism' should not be included in wikipedia (for whatever reason)?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:55, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, maybe we can clear it up this way. Is "having a lack/absence of belief in God" the same as "not believing God exists?" And if it is, let's substitute that instead. I think it would be a lot more understandable. And if that's not what the article is getting at, please explain the difference between "having a lack/absence of belief in God" and "not believing God exists."</p>
<p>And how does atheos, "without gods" turn into "lack of belief in gods????" It says nothing about belief at all. This is why I am concerned about original research in the article, especially concerning this "lack of belief" nonsense.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 00:58, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Lack of belief" is the same as "Not believing", as far as I know. I don't really mind what is put there, but I guess lack/absence was chosen to make it more explicitly clear (a lot of people confuse "don't believe in God" and "believe God doesn't exist", the latter being closer to an assertion that God doesn't exist).</dd>

<dd>By the latter, I mean people who assert that God doesn't exist. There are many things I don't believe in (unicorns, ghosts, etc), but I wouldn't necessarily assert that they don't exist. The distinction most likely came about in response to people criticising atheists, saying that they need evidence/proof/faith for their claims - the point being that many atheists do not make any claims.

<dd>"Lack of belief" nonsense? Did you google weak atheism like I asked? You can play semantics all you want, but this is an actual term that wikipedia editors did no make up. And it is very commonly defined as lack of belief, disbelief, or absence of belief in deities. None of this is remotely controversial. Just because you have never heard of weak atheism does not mean it should be excluded from wikipedia. Are you now convinced that weak atheism does exist and is defined in these terms, and therefore its ok to be included in the articles, or did you have another concern?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:51, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could you quote me the part that is confusing you? Or maybe you could edit it yourself to clear things up? I think your problem is a dualistic outlook, where someone either positively believes in the existence of deities, or they positively believe in the non-existence of deities, with no other options. Weak atheism is a third option that is not a positive belief either way (so what is something that is not a positive beleif if it isn't an absence/lack of belief or disbelief). I believe you are saying "disbelief in deties" is the exact same thing as "positive belief in the non-existence of deities", where this article (by explaining the difference between weak and strong atheism) differentiates between the two.

<td>[Atheism and agnosticism] are what Wittgenstein called ‘family resemblance’ words. That is, we cannot expect to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for their use. Their use is appropriate if a fair number of the conditions are satisfied. Moreover even particular members of the families are often imprecise, and sometimes almost completely obscure. Sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised philosophical scepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic.</td>

<dd>There are several different meanings of 'atheism' in use with varying descriptive and normative shadings. 'Agnosticism' poses a slightly different problem since, while there are fewer definitions, some use it as position about knowledge and others as a metaphysical position. In addition, the position taken on 'agnosticism' affects which definition of atheism is used. There are thus two incompatible taxonomies covered by the terms. IMHO, this is the one of the main issues that needs to be addressed.</dd>

<dd>This has left the realm of dealing with content of this article, and is entirely about your inability to understand the difference between the type of atheism. I'm only continuing the conversation because I want to try to help you understand. So, in case you missed this, I'm going to quote a portion of the link above:
<dl>
<dd><i>The average theologian (there are exceptions, of course) uses 'atheist' to mean a person who denies the existence of a God. Even an atheist would agree that some atheists (a small minority) would fit this definition. However, most atheists would stongly dispute the adequacy of this definition. Rather, they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in God. The distiniction is small but important. Denying something means that you have knowledge of what it is that you are being asked to affirm, but that you have rejected that particular concept. To be without a belief in God merely means that the term 'god' has no importance or possibly no meaning to you. Belief in God is not a factor in your life. Surely this is quite different from denying the existence of God. Atheism is not a belief as such. It is the lack of belief.</i></dd>

<dd><i>What is the difference between not believing in the existence of God and believing God does not exist?</i></dd>
<dd>One can find the God (or gods) defined by various religions unconvincing, and thus not believe in any of those ideas of God, without necessarily also thinking there is any certainty that <i>some</i> entity is not inextricably entwined with the existence of the universe (and which thus may as well be called God). It can also be a matter of whether any definition of God is sufficently specified and internally consistent – for someone who feels no such definition has been proposed, the current ideas of God are not so much disbelieved as dismissed as logical absurdities. Often these positions are called agnosticism, but when agnosticism is defined as an epistemological position, they are often called weak atheism.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the 'lack of belief' definition of atheism can be used purely descriptively, that is, with no normative component – for example, it covers those types of Buddhists who consider the question of God entirely irrelevant or nonsensical. In such cases, it simply registers that an individual does not hold certain types of belief, without any implication as to why that is so, or as to whether the individual would identify with any normative idea of atheism.</dd>

I came to this talk page precisely because the first two lines of this (otherwise very clear) article confused me, which is a pretty bad sign whatever position you take. The problem, I think, is that 'absence of belief in god(s)' broadens the definition of atheism so much that it includes agnosticism (in all its forms). Here are, as far as I can see, are the seven attitudes I can have towards the proposition 'God(s) exist(s)' (which have not been clearly separated in the comments so far):</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe the proposition is true.</li>
<li>I believe the proposition is false.</li>
<li>I have never <i>encountered</i> the proposition, so I 'lack belief' in it. This is the sort of lack of belief in the above examples of one's lack of belief about 'zorgs' or the common man's about phlogiston and would apply to people in a culture (if one ever existed) that simply never considered the question of a God or his existence.</li>
<li>I have encountered the proposition, but think it is meaningless. This is being a 'non-cognitivist' about the proposition and covers the position of philosophers such as A. J. Ayer and the example given of Buddhists who consider the question nonsensical. Such people (I think) could also be described as 'lacking belief' in God, insofar as they think formulating such a belief is impossible (since it includes a nonsensical claim).</li>
<li>I have encountered the proposition, but take the stance that the article defines as 'weak atheism': 'the absence of belief in the existence of deities without the positive assertion that deities do not exist'.</li>
<li>I am 'agnostic' about the proposition in the first sense (in WP <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a>): I think the truth or falsity of the claim is 'unknown or unknowable' (the article adds 'or incoherent' (i.e. 4.) but I think this is questionable)</li>
<li>I am 'agnostic' about the proposition in the second sense (in WP): those 'who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities as well as other matters of religion'.</li>
</ol>
<p>So 2-5 are the possible candidates for types of atheism. 2 is clearly atheism (and I think it is the primary and most commonly used sense of the word). 3 could indeed be seen as a sort of atheism (most definitely if we are thinking etymologically). 4 is difficult – I don’t think it is agnosticism as the WP article on agnosticism suggests, but it is also quite different from denying the existence of God, so it is perhaps safest to say it is a third, separate attitude to talk about God (as A J Ayer believed; see also <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism" class="external free" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism" rel="nofollow">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism</a>). On the other hand, it certainly includes a lack of belief in God and a refusal to assert that God exists, so some might want to call it atheism.</p>
<p>5. is even more difficult. Now this is most definitely an important part of the discussion of atheism and should have a place in the article. However I do not think it should be part of the primary definition of atheism that the first lines of the article represent.</p>
<p>First, it is a special notion of atheism and not how the word is normally used. Most people who argue for negative atheism recognise this point. Anthony Flew, perhaps the most prominent modern proponent of weak atheism, introduced the terms negative and positive atheism (synonyms of weak and strong atheism), noting that 'nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is "someone who asserts that there is no such being as God"' and that 'the introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be … going arbitrarily against established common usage' (<i>God, Freedom, and Morality</i>). Furthermore, in pretty much every reputable source that I have at hand (the OED, Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, Oxford Companion to Philosophy, and Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy Online) 2. is given as either the only or the primary definition of atheism. Finally, as a special notion, it is subject to debate; many thinkers think 5. is not atheism at all and many thinkers believe that it is - nonetheless, as far as I am aware, no one has ever denied that 2. is atheism.</p>
<p>Second, and most importantly, the reason I think it should not be part of the primary definition of atheism is that it includes agnosticism and is, thus, confusing. As defined in the article, weak atheism makes atheism a broad concept indeed, covering both senses of agnosticism: if one believes that the truth or falsity of ‘god exists’ is unknown or unknowable or is noncommittal on the question, then one (a) lacks belief in God and (b) does not assert that God does not exist. Flew also recognised that the idea of negative atheism will overlap with the common understanding of agnosticism (and accordingly he offers a special definition of agnosticism).</p>
<p>Thus, the first line of the article ('Atheism, in its broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of gods') makes atheism, first, an umbrella term that includes all forms of agnosticism (sacrificing consistency and making it fairly confusing) and, second, a term partly determined by a specialised sense of the word that is a matter of debate (thus defining it in a less than neutral way that takes a position in modern controversies). <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDast_39cc.html" title="User:Dast">Dast</a> 18:01, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But you're assuming that atheism is mutually exclusive to agnosticism - I see no reason why this should be true. Atheism is about belief, agnosticism is about knowledge, and therefore there will be stances which come under both. Also, I disagree that this definition makes agnosticism a subset of atheism - it is possible that someone could believe in God through faith alone, even though they also believed that this was something we could not know through evidence. Trying to list all possibile categories is a lot easier if we simply ask "Do you believe in God?":</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Then other ones such as "I think the question is meaningless" or "I don't know if I do".</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I don't see why number 2 should be subdivided in such a way that only some of those "No"s count as atheism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for sources, many dictionaries include one who "disbelieves" under atheism. I see no reason why we should exclude a definition that is both covered in dictionaries, and used by many who identify as atheists. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 18:57, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do you think that "absense of belief" differs in meaning from "disbelief"? And I'm not sure what you mean by <i>"Another one could say in its broadest interpretation Atheists believe a god does not exist"</i> - clearly that's not the most <i>broadest</i> interpretation. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 21:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Going by the definition better defines the broad aspect of the word. It would be more accurate by definition to simply say in its broadest sense it is a denial in the existence of deities as the definition states it is disbelief or denial than to say an absense of belief. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.110.213.218 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.110.213.218.html" title="User talk:66.110.213.218">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.110.213.218_f85a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.110.213.218">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>There is no such thing as THE definition of atheism - dictionaries disagree on the meaning. The paragraph gives BOTH meanings.

<p>There is a definition. Going beyond the definition to apply a broad interpretation innacurately describes the word.

<p>There are multiple definitions. That's the point. The intro explicitly gives the "broadest" definition, which is absence of belief. Disbelief (in the "denial" sense) is a less broad definition because it refers specifically to people who believe God does not exist, as opposed to those that don't have a positive belief that he does exist (but don't assert that he must not exist). Therefore, you cannot claim that atheism "in its broadest sense" means "disbelief". That's innacurate. You either have to remove the "broadest sense" wording, or leave it as is. I vote for the broader one, since it quickly clears up misconceptions about atheists all being of the "disbelief" variety. --ConnSmythe96</p>

<p>I did not know 10 edits in one day is not allowed. Saying the broadest interpretation is an absense of belief is narrow in its very wording, as such it is misleading and does follow definition.

There is clearly not agreement (look at the above comments) and neither case - that atheism is a denial of the existence of God or a an absence of belief in God - is obviously right. I side with the denial definition for the reasons outlined in my post above, but I can see that many people reasonably disagree with this. When we have fairly intractable disagreement like this, it seems to me to be a good idea to reflect it in the article - for example, to mention that some people do not think agnosticism is a subset of atheism and their reasons why and the reasons for the other side. What is not helpful is repeatedly reverting or, on the other side, claiming your case is obvious or widely agreed upon. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDast_39cc.html" title="User:Dast">Dast</a> 10:06, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Much of the literature on atheism discusses how it can be distinguished from agnosticism, and on whether or not atheism is itself a belief system. These issues are briefly addressed by pointing out that while agnosticism, focusing on what can be known, is an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> position (dealing with the nature and limits of human knowledge); both atheism and theism are <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontological</a> positions (a branch of metaphysics that deals with what types of entities exist). In this account, atheists do not need to assert "There are no gods" (which some would call a statement of belief, since it has yet to be proven), but rather simply do not count words referring to deities as among those having any <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reference.html" title="Reference">referent</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denotation.html" title="Denotation">denotation</a>. Some atheists and agnostics, pointing to inconsistencies in concepts of deities, go further and also maintain that the term "god" has no clear <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connotation.html" title="Connotation">connotation</a> (meaning) at all.</dd>

<dd>On one level, I like the approach that your proposed text takes in avoiding some of the definitional issues that have been raised previously. However, as it stands, I think it makes far too many assumptions about what the audience knows, that is, it appears to be addressed to philosophers rather than the average reader. Also, in common usage, agnosticism is not always used as a strictly epistemological term. (Also, the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#3" class="external text" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#3" rel="nofollow">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> skirts the issue in such a way as to imply a strictly epistemological usage may not be the consensus among philosophers either.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because this article has to serve so many functions, I think the important question to ask when writing the intro is, "What information does the average reader need in order for the article useful?" In my proposals, I've trended toward putting more into the intro rather than less, but I've realized this is at least in part due to the poor organization of the overall article, or at least poor organization for the purposes of a general reader. The "Typologies" section starts well, but wanders off into the kind detailed taxonomy that probably is not the most helpful thing for someone new to the subject, and the "Reasons for atheism" section, which probably <i>is</i> important for general readers, is stuck at the end of the article. A very minimal intro that mostly directed readers with different purposes to good places to start would be fine if the rest of the article supported that. Since that is not the case, it seems to me that more attention should be accorded to the needs of non-specialist readers who are not currently well served by the body of the article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "Spiritual and religious atheism" section</span></h2>
<p>"<i>Although atheistic beliefs are often accompanied by a total lack of supernatural beliefs, this is not an aspect, or even a necessary consequence, of atheism. Indeed, there are many atheists who are not irreligious or secular. These are most common in spiritualities like Buddhism and Taoism, but they also exist in sects of religions that are usually very theistic by nature, such as Christianity, especially in some Liberal Quaker groups.</i>"</p>
<p>Uh...what? Isn't the very definition of atheism the disbelief in God or a higher power? IMO, you <b>cannot</b> be religious and atheist at the same time; there's just no way. The first sentence in that section is in blatant contradiction to the crux of atheism. If someone thinks they are a religious atheist, they are just ignorant, and/or confused. Perhaps they should research agnosticism and other related schools of thought. The term "religious atheist" is an oxy-moron though, plain and simple. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_nothing_2_b221.html" title="User:King nothing 2">King nothing 2</a> 17:17, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I attend a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> meeting, and this is actually an issue. My understanding of it is that some people believe that reality is simply spiritual. In fact, New Age philosopher <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Wilber_82b2.html" title="Ken Wilber">Ken Wilber</a> has defined his conception of divinity as "The simple feeling of Being". Famous protestant theologian <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Tillich_85c2.html" title="Paul Tillich">Paul Tillich</a> defined god as the ground of being. This, of course, does not entail any belief in a seperate theistic being. Tillich was called an atheist by most Christian who understood his beliefs, but he called himself a Christian theologian. The holders of such views, which exist in Zen Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and among Quakers, generally decline to label these views as either theism or atheism. It seems appropriate to discuss or to link to a discussion regarding this phenomenon in this article. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 17:55, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can certainly be religious and/or spiritual, and an atheist. Atheism is simply not believing in God(s) - nothing more. You can believe in supernatural things in ghosts or telepathy. Also, whilst most religions are theistic, not all of them are - you can certainly follow a religion such as Buddhism, which does require believe in any god.</dd>

<p>On a similar topic, we have the sentence <i>"Additionally, although atheism is commonly equated with <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreligion.html" title="Irreligion">irreligion</a> in Western culture, atheism is not equivalent with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a>, the active opposition to theism or God.</i>" which has been edited about recently. I think that somewhere here we should summarise the idea that atheism isn't necessarily the same as <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreligion.html" title="Irreligion">irreligion</a>, as covered later in the article (e.g., atheists who are also Buddhists). This could be done by putting in "some atheists actually hold spiritual and religious beliefs" (i.e., what it said at one point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atheism&amp;oldid=55007943" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atheism&amp;oldid=55007943" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, but with "many" downgraded to "some", or is there a better way? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 22:49, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the current version that says "Although atheistic beliefs are often accompanied by a total lack of spiritual beliefs" is at odds with what the Royal College of Psychiatrists says on this <a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinformation/therapies/spiritualityandmentalhealth.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinformation/therapies/spiritualityandmentalhealth.aspx" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> From a mental healthcare point of view they imply a "universality of spirituality" which extends across all creeds and culture. It is extremely unlikely that an atheist would be totally devoid of spirituality if the Royal College of Psychiatrists opinion of what is spirituality is accepted. Given being religious may simply have a biological basis as a side effect of activities related to various <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin.html" title="Serotonin">serotonin</a> receptors (Studies with <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocybin.html" title="Psilocybin">Psilocybin</a> have shown that people who consumed this drug have had "experiencing profound religious experiences" ) then they are probably on the right track. I propose that the first paragraph is simply set to...</p>
<p><i>There are many atheists who are not <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreligion.html" title="Irreligion">irreligious</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secular</a>.

<dd>It's not as odds, it's a different definition of sprituality - they define it as "spirituality is identified with experiencing a deep-seated sense of meaning and purpose in life, together with a sense of belonging. It is about acceptance, integration and wholeness." I'm not sure that this is really a definition that is found in dictionaries. The Wikipedia article uses it in the sense of "supernatural", I presume - "spiritual" is a very vague word, perhaps we should change it to explicitly say "supernatural"? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 18:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism as a religion</span></h2>
<p>Atheism cannot be judged as or as not a religion. Reasons: Atheist nations persecute other religions. This level of fundamentalism is found in many religions. Religion does not need an institution, it can be personal. Read the definition below. The Seventh US Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the prison violated Kaufman's civil rights by not considering atheism as a religion and protected form of religious expression. Therefore to say implicitly that is or is not a religion is showing bias.</p>
<p>Definition(see 1b and 4):</p>
<p>re·li·gion ( P ) Pronunciation Key (r-ljn) n.</p>
<p>1a: Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. 1b: A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. 2: The life or condition of a person in a religious order. 3: A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. 4: A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.</p>

<dd>I find your intial sentence somewhat mysterious. Would it be correct to interpret it as "atheism is a religion for some folks, and for others it is not"? Are you suggesting that atheism can fulfil the definition you pasted under item #4? I apologize if I seem to be putting words into your mouth, I just didn't find the above very clear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At any rate, these so-called "zealous atheists" (if that is what you're referring to) must be awfully rare. I've met many atheists but no zealous ones.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anway, as to stating in the introduction that atheism isn't a religion, it does seem rather superfluous. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 06:26, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
That may be one way to interpret it. Stating that it is or is not shows bias. As for your comment about Atheist zealots. If you go to Wikipedia's article on North Korea you will read they are an official Atheist state and they persecute Christians more than any nation on Earth according to the study mentioned. If you also read the article on the former USSR you will see the similarity. As well as Cuba and China. So it is plausable to draw a conclusion between Atheist fundamentalism and any other type of religious fundamentalism.</p>

<dd>Definition 4 above <i>has nothing to do with</i> "religion" in the sense of any of the other meanings (i.e., what Wikipedia covers at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>). This usage is there to cover the usage of referring to anything, such as being a football fan, as a "religion". A dictionary needs to do that, but Wikipedia isn't a dictionary. To claim that two things are the same (i.e., atheism and other religions), because they can both be described by the same word, when you are using <i>entirely different</i> meanings of that word, is a fallacy. Thus, definition 4 should not be considered (except perhaps to point out that atheism can only be referred to as a "religion" in this sense, but is certainly not a religion in the more usual sense).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure how definition 1b applies. Since 1a doesn't apply, there clearly can't be a system grounded in such belief. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 14:18, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure how any of them apply. I'm not seeing any objections to 'atheism is a negative position and does not necessarily imply anything other than not being theistic about atheists', and I've never heard of a religion that makes no statements whatsoever about what should and shouldn't be done. Some (many? most?) atheists have principles that could be classified as religion (e.g.; any form of morality that ends with 'just because you do/don't do that'), but those are personal things and have nothing to with atheism as a whole.</dd>

<dd>Also, since there's no need to post twice - let's say that North Korea is defined as a nation by its atheism and it slaughters/oppresses thousands of Christians per year (poor minority, underrepresented bastards). Millions more were killed in the Crusades, and Hitler invoked Christianity on many occasions in arguing for the oppression of Jews and all the other undesirables. Does this mean that something about Christianity inherently leads to genocides? Of course not. --Ted 20:30, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

People should just accept atheism as it is. I respect Christians, Islams, etc. We should just all respect each other and stop hating everyone because they are not the same religion. A lot of people think that we athiests are like that because the devil made us do it. As a fact though,I thought we do not believe in the devil either. I would like this to be added if it already is not. Chad wolfe</p>
<p>I removed the sentence "There are specific individuals whose <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a> beliefs some might describe as atheistic, though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists" from the second paragraph. In its current form it conveyed very little. In earlier versions it made a point that even some people who "are" "religious or spiritual" (in some unspecified senses), and who do not self-describe as atheists, may be considered atheists by some other people's definitions. That was at best a debatable point and hardly one central enough to be worth a place in this concise definition/introduction section. - <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 01:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheists belief?</span></h2>
<p>I cannot analyse the logic of every atheist. But surely the word 'belief' is a strange one. I mean, we are all naturally disbelievers. We only start accept or know things when it becomes apperent to us that we should do this. I mean, I do not belief that leprechauns do not exist. Logic and reason forces me to assume they do not exist. Same with the pink invisible unicorn, Russel's chinese teapot, the spaggetti monster, etc. But also all kinds of other theories that are unfalsifiable. What theists do is to suspend their disbelief. All people are naturally atheists on all subjects. People do not believe in things. Children do, but adults generally do not. When one starts to belief in a conspiracy theory, in ETs visiting earth, in fairies or in god one suspends disbelief. What are all the people's stances on the endless lists of gods and demigods? Are we agnosts? Atheists? Do we need to define that one is a weak atheist on Zeus and Apollo but an atheist on Ishtar, Enlil, Ano and Enki? And are we nontheists or even Ignostic on the gods of the Mayans and Incas? I mean, I do not even know the names of these gods. I don't care. Surely one realises that one is naturally a disbeliever. A monotheist is an atheist that makes an exception.</p>
<p><br />
--If "belief" is strange here, then "assert" is even odder. Assert is an overt act "To state or express positively"--from dictionary.com. One however can feel that no gods exist without making any overt assertion of such to anyone. Maybe "feel" would be better than either believe or assert?</p>
<p>I have no idea what you mean when you say one is naturally a disbeliever. Just because I don't believe someone named Johnny Appleseed ever existed does not mean I disbelieve that himans existed before I born, with some exceptions. The existence of a supernatural being logically preceeds that being's name. Does a Christian disbelieve in Allah, or does he or she think that the concept of Allah is an approximate construct in his or her true god, with the ancient deities you mention being lesser approximations? The concept of belief is not as black and white as you make it out here. ---Zathras 31 May 2006</p>
<p>I think this might be an fallacy of <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">Equivocation</a> since it appears to use belief in two very distinct ways. The blind belief or faith a theist places in god(s) or dogma is much different from the inductive belief based on empirical evidence that a strong Atheist might have. It's the difference between "I believe in god" and "I believe the world is round". A strong Atheist might say "I don't believe in god" as easy as they might say "I don't believe in werewolves" but most people would not flinch at the second statement.

<dd>No, I don't feel or believe anything. No one can postulate a falsifiable theory of god. And there it ends. No one can tell me what god is. So how can I know if I either have to support or oppose this theory? How can I consider the evidence for and against? Let alone belief or disbelief it. Or feel anything about it. I myself cannot come up with a concept of god that describes and/or fits reality. I don't belief there is no god. But I don't believe in god either. I don't have to. The whole concept is just thrashed because it does not relate to reality.</dd>
<dd>So since I do not believe god does not exist, what am I? Surely I am not an atheist, right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you think there were no humans before you lived then you have a theory, the theory that there were no humans. You aren't a disbeliever if you believe. You are a disbeliever if you have no believe about it at all. You don't know if there were humans before us or not; you do not take a stance. And then instead of comming up with a story and believing in that you go out and find out. You look for evidence of humans living in times before. Then you know.</dd>
<dd>So, you can observe that humans lived before we did. No need to belief it. First there is either nothing or an unknown. Then we explore and observe it. Then someone postulates a theory. Then we try to refute it. If it doesn't it describes reality accurately enought.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But when we talk about god there is neither evidence pro or con, there is no falsifiable theory about god. There is nothing to consider. It is a non-issue.</dd>

I also agree about making distribution of atheists a subsection of Atheism studies and Statistics, though we shouldn't have subsections for each country if we do that. Finally, what do you think about the placement of "religion and atheism"? I think it may work better going in between "Reasons for atheism" and "distribution of atheists", since it does deal with the motivating factors behind atheism and its interplay with religion. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanaman5_142b.html" title="User:Danaman5">Danaman5</a> 05:51, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the good feedback; I'm glad we agree about history/etymology. I think we could shorten the "Distribution of atheists" section sufficiently to make it a subsection of "Statistics" by putting some of the country-by-country details in a daughter article, Atheism by country, modeled after the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Category%7EReligion_by_country_20a7.html" title="Category:Religion by country">Religion by country</a> series of articles. Per my comments on this article's FAC, I also think we should create a new section, "Atheism in philosophy" or "Philosophy and atheism", similar to the "Religion and atheism" section, and imagine an organization somewhat like:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Etymology</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Types and typologies</li>

<li>Studies and statistics</li>
<li>Reasons</li>
<li>Criticisms</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my view, "reasons" and "criticisms" go together well because many of the criticisms serve as attempted rebuttals for the reasons, and vice-versa. And I like including the "religion" section earlier in the article because atheism's role in various philosophies and religions is pretty closely-related to the various types of atheism that exist, whereas statistics is a substantially different matter, though admittedly the geographic factor relevant to many religions complicates matters. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 06:08, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think it is too bad, those are the main objections of atheists. It would be nice to have a citation if you can find one though.

<p>Agreed - but the atheist stance is that religion is not "intrinsically morally right". Most atheists would agree that religion can do good things, but some would point out that it also does bad things, and thus the moral correctness is not intrinsic and is rather human derived (thus removing the need for a God). I know pro-religion atheists who wish there was a God, so your point is taken that anti-religion and atheism are distinct, but they are very overlapping too, so I don't think this was too bad. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 00:18, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not all atheists are opposed to belief in a deity or deities, that's true enough in the sense that not all atheists actively promote their non-belief. They are still opposed to such belief enough to not hold them. My issue is not with this fact, but with the "normally defined" wording, which belongs among the worst kind of Wikiweasling. Nobody claims atheism is equivalent to "antitheism". Antitheism is a <i>subset</i> of atheism, and properly has its own section with {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} template here. I disagree with your insistence that antitheism must be linked from the (already overlong) intro. We don't list other things atheism is not equivalent to, either, without the implication that atheism is equivalent to <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanism.html" title="Satanism">satanism</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>. You can rest assure that anyone reading the article will understand your point. We even have a bleeding diagram showing the difference between "weak" and "strong" atheism, for crying out loud. The problem is not with the article being unclear, but with it droning on and on for too long about terminology so that nobody is very likely to read it in its entirety. Which in turn motivates you to cram whatever you happen to want noticed into the intro. Which extends the intro beyond readability. I hope I have made clear that my position is not in factual disagreement with yours, except for points of article layout and organisation and stylistic issues. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a> is not necessarily a subset of atheism. Read the article, there are two primary forms of "antitheism": the first denotes "opposition to belief in God", whereas the second denotes "opposition to God". Only the former can be construed as requiring atheism. Overall, antitheism is a complex and very loaded term that we probably should cover minimally, if at all, in atheism's intro (though certainly there's room to address antitheism/atheism misconceptions later in the article). Also, <i>"Nobody claims atheism is equivalent to 'antitheism'."</i> is simply untrue. Also, of the above examples you gave, most are absurd; the only one that <i>would</i>, perhaps, be a good idea to mention alongside <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a> is an incorrect thing to equate atheism with is <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a> (though all nihilists may be atheists). I have to disagree with your point, though, that the article is clear in explaining that atheism isn't "opposition to God/theism". I could easily see someone skimming through a fair amount of the article without realizing that; I see no harm in avoiding such a common misconception with a few words in the intro, as long as there's room. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>do you see the, what, 26 archive links at the top of this page? I have watched this article from about number 7. I am extremely bored by these discussions about mere terminology, and all I want is make the article readable again. I know my examples were absurd, they were of course intended to point out the absurdity of KillerChihuahua's assertion that the statement needs to be in the intro because it is true. I really don't give a rat's ass about the various definitions of "antitheism" because I think this is a term that creates more bother than its worth. I'll leave you to unravel it at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitheism.html" title="Antitheism">antitheism</a> to your heart's content, but featuring it in the intro here is just not helpful. What do you mean, "atheism isn't 'opposition to God/theism'"? Of course it 'is', meaning it <i>comprises</i>. You left out the crucial "equivalent": "atheism isn't <i>equivalent</i> to 'opposition to God/theism'": here you go: pure terminological hair-splitting unconductive to a better article. Atheism is the state of not believing in God or gods, that's the full definiton, entailing all that atheism is <i>not</i>. I don't see any claim of "atheism=antitheism" here, certainly not in the antitheism section, so I don't know what you mean when you say my assertion that "nobody claims" is false. I meant, of course, nobody <i>here</i> claims this, nor is any such claim referred to. I am prepared to believe that there was such a claim made on Usenet back in 1991 if you tell me so, but I would fail to see how this is at all relevant. Ah, and <i>there is no room</i>. We seriously need to branch out a lot of material, maybe beginning with exporting the whole statistics section to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_atheism.html" title="Demographics of atheism">Demographics of atheism</a> or something. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whoa! I do not <i>insist</i>, I did not <i>add</i> this bit, I did <i><b>not</b></i> state that this <i>needs</i> to be in the intro. I responded to an edit summary of <i>"the point is that "antitheism" is not 'normally defined' at all. it is a minority coinage with an agenda"</i> with the statement that it is indeed defined, in the Oxford English dictionary. I am more than open to the concept that it is not necessary in the intro or indeed at all in this article.

<dd>Hah, custom? lol, without understanding what is Buddhism, you had made an error in judgement. The denial of existence of Creator God and immortal self(note:soul is western custom/theology) is not a custom, but a part of a philosophy. The rest of the dieties are presented as not useful (this could be because Buddhism had to adapt to different theistic settings(Bon, Hinduism, and others unmentioned)).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assert vs. Belief</span></h2>
<p>--An earlier comment states that belief is a strange word for use as the atheist's postion. However, if "belief" is strange here, then "assert" is even odder. Assert is an overt act "To state or express positively"--from dictionary.com. One however can feel that no gods exist without making any overt assertion of such to anyone. Can a person on a desert idland not be a strong atheist? Maybe "feel" would be better than either believe or assert?</p>
<p>I also have no idea what the comment that "one is naturally a disbeliever" means. Just because I don't believe someone named Johnny Appleseed ever existed does not mean I disbelieve that himans existed before I born, with some exceptions. The existence of a supernatural being logically preceeds that being's name. Does a Christian disbelieve in Allah, or does he or she think that the concept of Allah is an approximate construct in his or her true god, with the ancient deities mentioned being lesser approximations? The concept of belief is not as black and white as it is made out here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.144.203.153 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.144.203.153.html" title="User talk:216.144.203.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__216.144.203.153_48d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 216.144.203.153">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>"Other criticisms are based on ideas that it leads to poor morals or ethics, or that lack of belief in a god is as much (or more) a leap of faith than belief in a god.

<p>1) It is poorly worded. I'd fix it except that 2) The criiticisms section should contain criticisms and 3) The phrase "all knowing invisible man in the sky" is not a NPOV, as I think just about no religious people describe their deity that way.</p>

<p>Why is there even a criticisms section to begin with? There are already criticisms of atheism in other parts of the text. Why then should the article end with a non-neutral section of criticisms? Is there a criticisms section for Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, etc? Do they end with a section questioning the moral fiber of religious people? If not perhaps we should delete the criticisms section here, or else add a criticisms section for every religion. I move for deletion of the section, especially if blatant non-neutral points of view cannot be answered in the section. -Steven Argue</p>

<p>The statement it has been "countered by atheists" does not imply a generalized athiest response. I guess you are looking for a more explicit statement that this only reflects some athiests that are willing to defend their views from criticism. I will edit to reflect this. In fact I'll see if I can find the exact quote from George Carlin. On the other points, as I've already stated, I am only countering the strong anti-athiest statements that are already presented in the section. -Steven Argue</p>

<p>Don't like Carlin, a great comedian in my opinion, but oh well. Anyway, I can agree to getting rid of both statements.</p>

<p>"Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it, religion has actually convinced people that there's an INVISIBLE MAN...LIVING IN THE SKY...who watches every thing you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten special things that he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry for ever and ever 'til the end of time...but he loves you."

Evolution is as you know one of the most well-established and -- in scientific circles -- universally agreed-upon concepts of science, and this article is not the place to debate it, certainly not to paint it as a controversy by sounding defensive. I had tried to include what I thought was the intended relevance to atheism of that paragraph into the preceding paragraph, explaining some implications of evolution for atheism, not merely defending evolution. (By the way, if one did want to include an experimental observation of evolution in action, speciation by hybridization is a horribly atypical example to use, being sudden instead of gradual and not driven by either random mutations or selective pressure.) Can you explain the thoughts behind your decision to revert? - <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 21:01, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, is evolution really by necessity contrary to <b>all</b> conceivable theistic creation stories? Would a hypothetical theism even need to have a creation story? Remember, this is about categorically rejecting all theism, not about rejecting some specific religion like literal Christianity. It seems to me that all we can say is that evolution is contrary to <i>some</i> theistic creation stories, and that to some athesists this is a basis for their rejection of <i>those</i> specific theistic beliefs that are based on those creation stories. - <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 21:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I think I see now the broader point you are aiming for, about an understanding of evolution being a reason for atheism. What I think weakens your lead sentence badly is the word <i>stories</i>, for the reason I mentioned above: it makes people think about specific literal stories (like the one in Genesis, including the bits about the rib, the snake, the apple...) which far from all theists believe in literally. A conflict with such stories is therefore hardly a general argument against theism. The argument needs to be reformulated so that it applies in the general sense you are aiming for. (And I don't mean defending evolution. I mean that the section must be a convincing argument for atheism <b>given</b> that one accepts evolution.) - <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 21:16, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>can we re-word this a little, with maybe another sentence and place it in the place of the sloppy 3 paragraphs alreafy under scientific reasoning? The reason people become atheists? evolution makes more sense than unprovable and supernatural tales of theists. or perhaps somewhere along those lines.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Note on Criticisms Edit</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to mention that I had previously edited out a sentence in the criticisms section due to a lack of citation. This was on an older account of mine, however. At the time of edit, I was still very new to Wikipedia, and worry that this edit may have been bad manners on my part, as I did not first discuss the edit before making it. Basically, the sentence stated that an Atheist is, by the truest dictionary definition, an evil / immoral person. While I have encountered this definition in some dictionaries, it still strikes me as not belonging to this article, in that the term may not necessarily be in realtion to anti-theology.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism And An Impersonal God</span></h2>
<p>Atheism means "absence of theism", and theism usually means a belief in a personal God that interferes with the affairs of the world directly. If this is the case can deists (who believe in an impersonal God) and pantheists (belief in an impersonal God being Nature) be considered atheist? <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 15:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would say no. It's easy enough to simply expand the definition of 'theist' (if expansion is even necessary) to 'one who believes in a god or gods'. --Ted 21:18, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I wasn't necessarily expanding the word theist because I have seen some that define "theism" as a belief in a personal god. Another thing to note is that deists and pantheists tend to be closer to atheists than they are to theists. Reason being is that deism and pantheism are freethinking philosophies that have similar arguments against the existance of Yahweh and other such deities. All three philosophies (deism, atheism, and pantheism) are based on reason and logic rather than faith and revealed doctrines. The worldview of a deist or a pantheist is closer to atheists in that regard. If you really think about it the philosophies sort of overlap as well. Deism is much different than pantheism, the only difference being that deism is a bit more dualist than pantheism. And pantheism isn't much different than atheism since atheists believe in the universe and nature while, and pantheists just choose to call nature and the universe god. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 21:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not the atheism I know. Fine, deism and pantheism get a point up on 'personal god' arrangements, but they still involve supernatural entities. In that respect, they are no more logical, and certainly completely separate from atheism where atheism is defined as not believing in gods (or, by extension, literally godlike entities).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other angle: atheism is a logically negative position. It does not denote belief in anything (nor disbelief if that is a positive action), which is also an irreconcilable difference.--Ted 03:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Rationally you could be an agnostic, with atheism as your "irrational faith" ("Logically I think nobody can know whether or not God exists, but outside of logical reasoning, I personally believe God does not exist.") <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 21:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The claim that "not all atheists claim to have a rational justification for their stance"? Well, how would you like to source the opposite, that all atheists claim to have a rational justification? You presumably wouldn't, so we'd need to reformulate the whole thing to avoid the issue altogether. I can tell you that <i>personally</i> I'm someone who firmly <i>believes</i> God does not exist, and I've done so long before I was capable of propping up this claim with reason. God as a concept has always seemed absurd to me, but not believing in the existence of something because you consider it absurd is not a rational justification. I do not feel troubled at all by being irrational in this sense, no more than if I told you I liked cherries and the color blue, neither of I can or want to rationally justify.</dd>
<dd>Even now I'm inclined to simply take the nonexistence of God on faith, regardless of any logic that might support or disavow it—I'm agnostic in the sense that I also <i>believe</i> that no conclusive reasoning for God's (non)existence can be mounted either way, although I feel the atheist side holds the better cards as far as (dis)proving the influence of God on the physical world goes.</dd>
<dd>Of course, my personal experience does not count as a source, and Wikipedia reports on verifiable facts, not truth. (If "one person does not claim to have a rational justification", that does not make it notable.) I don't care particularly for whether the claim stays or goes, sourced or otherwise.

<dd>Alright, I was bold and removed it and reworded the paragraph in question (which is entirely unsourced). If you feel like reinserting the sentence in question or reverting my edit, feel free.

<p>I've reworded "experiencable" to "physically experienced", I suppose this was the intended meaning. The only problem I have with the remaining sentence ("Many atheists assert their position does not require belief in anything other than that which can be physically experienced; they state the onus is on theists to prove the existence of god(s), rather than on atheists to disprove the existence of any supposed deities") is that it seems inaccurate/POV to me, because 1) "belief" in what is experienced is specious (you don't really "believe" in what you experience, it simply <i>is</i> to you) and 2) it implies that statements which rely only on what we can experience are "better" or "stronger" than statements which do not. This is no doubt what atheists actually claim, but it's not spelled out as their opinion here.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I re-rewrote the paragraph. It seems to me that <i>all</i> that it should do is serve as the introduction for the sections; it doesn't need to introduce additional claims. I've tried to do this as carefully as possible, though I'll admit I've come dangerously close to making it vacuous. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 00:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd expect the Christian page to have links to Mormonism, Catholicism, and the various other large Christian groups; heck, I'd expect the Judaism page to have links to Islam and Christianity, as it spawned both of them (along with the less visible Ba'hai faith).

<p>I believe that an atheist, like myself finds it impossibel for there to be an omnipotent being. But I am perfectly open to the suggestion of polytheism and spiritualism, although I find it extremely unlikely... it is not necessarily impossible. Having a finite diety which just means a being of a higher order of intelligence or power or existence, is perfectly plausible. What is not plausible is a bing that is everything and controls everything and knows everything et cetera. SO while I don't believe in a diety or dieties, I do find that the Philosophers' omnipotent God is impossible, while the polythiest is possible, however improbable. Thus there needs to also be a change between what is believed negatively (I don't believe in any gods) and what is believed positively ( that I know that an omnipotent god doesn't exist, but I don't know if finite gods don't exist). <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean1K2GA9_0cc0.html" title="User:Sean1K2GA9">Sean1K2GA9</a> 19:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)Sean1K2GA9<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean1K2GA9_0cc0.html" title="User:Sean1K2GA9">Sean1K2GA9</a> 19:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

High percentages of organic atheism correlate with low homicide rates, low poverty rates, low infant mortality rates, low illiteracy rates, as well as high levels of educational attainment, per capita income, and gender equality.

<dd>In particular, while there could be an argument that the atheist "response" to the criticism needn't be included, the claim that logical analysis "inevitably" leads to this criticism is patently false, not just POV. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 20:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Frankly, there are MANY "unsourced" opinions and points of view on the atheism page (among many others dealing with belief systems). I see no problem with what I wrote in the "criticism" section of "Atheism" as it is for criticisms and not apologetics. I will not deny that it is my "POV" (and that of many others as you rightly pointed out) that the ultimate logical end of atheism is nihilism, but it is certainly not "false". Unfortunately, those who subscribe to the view either commit suicide or choose to ignore it (known as cognitive dissonance).
<ul>
<li>It's quite false. <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilitarianism.html" title="Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/o/Deontology.html" title="Deontology">deontology</a>, are both compatible with atheism, and incompatible with <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a> (and in fact incompatible with each other as well). While many, (e.g. Dostoyesky) would agree that logical analysis of atheism does lead to nihilism, it is <i>by no means</i> "inevitable". Therefore the statement that's been repeatedly inserted into the article is quite false, but stating that there are some who claim that it's inevitable is obviously true, as our anonymous friend clearly instatiates such a group, even though it's a bit <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_term.html" title="Weasel term">weaselly</a>. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 21:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I disagree that it is false. Atheism leads inevitably to Nihilism. I understand that this is not desirable and will be denied at every opportunity and occasion. This is why alternatives such as Utilitarianism and Deontological ethics were created at such a recent date and within western "Christian" (or at least Deistic) societies where they were able to borrow from and rely upon the Christian moral values of the society around them. Of course they couldn't accept many, if any, things against religious morals because that would simply not be compatible with the majority views of those in whose society they lived. As to "inevitable" being a "bit weaselly", it is only so if "cognitive dissonance" is involved for those who wish to maintain their worldview and yet live in a society largely made up of religiously derived values, otherwise it is quite clear.
<ul>
<li>"Inevitable" is not the weasely part-- see the link; the weaselly part is the vague "some scholars" or "some people" who are making the claim. As for your statement: <i>This is why alternatives such as Utilitarianism and Deontological ethics were created at such a recent date</i>, this is rather bizarre as both utilitarianism and deontological ethics were actually formulated well before nihilism was introduced as a philosophy, and both utilitarianism and deontology are hundreds of years old. Deontology was introduced by <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> in the 17th century (though you could argue that it has its basis in the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoicism.html" title="Stoicism">Stoicism</a> of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneca.html" title="Seneca">Seneca</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zeno_of_Citium_f74b.html" title="Zeno of Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>), and the first instance of utilitarianism comes from <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozi.html" title="Mozi">Mozi</a> in the 5th-4th centuries BCE (in a non-christian society, no less). <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 21:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a term, sure Nihilism is relatively recent as well, but as you point out with respect to these theories of ethics, the philosophy has also been around for a long time. I do not doubt that non-christian societies were able to come up with a set of ethics derived from the values of the majority of God believing and fearing society about them. The problem, which often goes unacknowledged, comes at the level of the individual who maintains the power, in the absense of consequences, to secretly act in any manner desired and have no real definition of morals. Theists who believe in "God-given" laws written in a text (whether Jews, Muslims, Christians, or otherwise) have moral laws that they believe they must follow or receive punishment. For them, these laws become objective (act accordingly or recieve ultimate punishment, for no act is done in secret because God sees all). Theists honestly and objectively believe they may not murder in secret. Atheists may believe murder is ok and do so in secret if desired. Of course this does not mean they will do such a thing, but they do not believe in the same "ultimate consequences" for acts comitted in secret, so it becomes a valid and possibly unpunishable act for them.
<ul>
<li>The philosophy actually has not been around very long, relatively speaking. Moreover, Mozi wasn't a theist in the traditional sense, either. The "ultimate consequences" you are discussing do not necessarily need to be theistic or supernatural in nature; utilitaranism, as cited above, is a very good example. Regardless, this is beside the point as it's very clear by the sheer existence of alternate (and, btw, vastly more accepted) ethical theories that there is no such "inevitability", period. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 21:45, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The philosophy has been around a very long time. Utilitarianism does not come close to solving the ultimate problem. Again, I am not denying that atheists can find moral values, so yeah there are moral systems out there that are the result of "cognitive dissonance" and derived from the values of the religious society around them. What I deny is that they have any good reason to follow them should they choose not to. Case in point (hypothetically, of course): I am an atheist, homeless, and am no stranger to prison. I feel that I have worked hard in my life and can't get anywhere while others ride their Daddies' paychecks through nice colleges and into cushy high-salary jobs. Everyday, downtown, I watch you walk by near "my" alley, nose in the air, with your Armani suit and gold rolex, chatting away on the most expensive and new mobile phone you could find. I despise you because you never had to work like I did and yet look at what you have! Not only do you have the necessities of life that I am often deprived of, you have gone way overboard! Couldn't you have only fulfilled the necessities and spared some to help me out? Downtown, you have to do what you have to do to survive day after day and I have my sources who can easily allow me to borrow a gun. One day you work late and come prancing down the street. I follow, pull you into an alleyway, shoot you dead, and take your money, watch, and everything of value. Why should I care? There is no God looking down on me judging anything I do in secret. I fear no "ultimate consequences". I doubt I'll get caught and even if I do, at least I'll have free meals given to me in prison...I've been there before. It's a win-win situation for me as long as I play it right. Morals? What are those and who really cares? Morals are only for the rich and comfortable. I can't afford them in this world or I'll die. Of course, the logic continues to devolve until one finally winds up in Nihilism. It is simply inevitable.
<ul>
<li>This is entirely a matter of your POV, and I'm afraid you'll find that there are some "ultimate consequences" to POV-warring here on wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 22:10, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is true and uncounterable and only denied out of the necessity of "getting along in society" or by "cognitive dissonance". Merely thinking about it will make you realize although you will want to deny. Either way, I did not start a war. I merely wrote "truth" and had it erased numerous times. I did nothing wrong and started no war. Those erasing my posts were warring, quite unethically, I might add, since they are denying relevant information to people.</li>
<li>By the way, this is why Wikipedia will never be a good source of information. It is ultimately the moderators who decide what content is a POV and what is supposedly fact and truth. Wikipedia is not a good source of information on anything controversial and it never will be.
<ul>
<li>I'm not an administrator (what you seem to mean by "moderator"), and I have that on the contrary, because wikipedia ascribes to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and eschews <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">partisanship</a> and <a href="../../../d/b/f/WP%7EDBF_70fd.html" title="WP:DBF">fanaticism</a>, it is in effect a very good source of information on controversial subjects. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 22:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Forgive me, I'm not "wikipediaized" in my lingo yet. The information on wikipedia is most definitely biased as is evidenced by the highly biased and repeated editing of my benign and informational contributions. The edited versions don't even make sense as they simply respond in apologetic fashion to the points I bring up and therefore become unfocused. As I said, and will not repeat again, it is impossible for this site to be anything other than biased when it comes to controversial subjects. The subjects will constantly be edited and re-edited and re-re-edited until an "administrator" decides when enough is enough and makes a subjective decision about what the contents will ultimately be. That "administrator" and their views, or the views of the most repetitive editors, are the ultimate views that are expressed here. Not truth. Not even good information. Especially not complete information.
<ul>
<li>Well, I guess it's fortunate for everyone, then, that you know where the door is. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 00:14, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no idea what you're addressing Ted. By the way, I would not call the constant erasing of my entries "mature" or "working together". The problem (as I imagine to be the case for subjects on religion as well) is that the administrators will rule the day on this "project". It is funny that they say muliple editors have modified my entries, so I am the one in violation of their rules. Yeah, ok, so isn't that mob rule? If I get a bunch of buddies that out number your buddies, then all of a sudden I'm right? Oh, perhaps not. The administors' views will still rule the day. I will go ahead and admit that wiki has some decent information, but there is a TON of apologetic-type material (constantly edited and re-edited) on controversial subjects, and the views of the administrators or their online posse-mob will be the ultimate views expressed on a subject.</dd>

<dd>Somerset, you have no idea what you are talking about and you should spell "grammer" as "grammar", so don't talk to me about writing "horribley" [sic]. I do not give the reader false impressions. That is done by those who do not allow all facts and criticisms. You display your atheism in your Talk page, so you are obviously not unbiased in these matters. Besides that, nearly everything on that page is someone's point of view. If it's not an unsourced point of view (which much of it is), then it is a sourced "point of view" (which is hardly better, just sourced).</dd>

<dd>Actually, it's a lot better; if a point of view is referenced to a person ("i.e., Bob Jones says..." or better yet, "According to the large group of people named X..." with cites to print references) it's fact. Bob Jones or whomever does actually say that. Simply putting it in as fact as you were doing is inherently POV and not factual. The problem is not with the criticism itself, as has been made clear, but with the insistence that it is "inevitable", which is another way of saying that it's the only possible conclusion, which is clearly false and POV. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 22:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the style of dual portals like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Portal%7EMind_and_Brain_9e5d.html" title="Portal:Mind and Brain">Portal:Mind and Brain</a>, I think it might be wise to use a portal name like Portal:Atheism and Agnosticism, since the two concepts are often grouped together or conflated and we might otherwise have too many arguments between people fighting over what qualifies as an "agnostic" topic and what qualifies as an "atheist" topic (largely due to the variable definitions). These are also the two most common and popular nontheistic terms, so it makes sense to use them for a portal. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page move POV issue</span></h2>
<p>I was going to ask this on the Portal:Atheism, but as it is yet to materialise (see above) this seems like the best place... I stumbled across a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">page move</a> issue today, but it is a biggie and I don't have anywhere near enough enthusiasm to pursue it - perhaps someone else would be motivated.</p>
<p>Why is it that the article at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> is not a disambiguation page? There are a _lot_ of historically significant Davids and whilst King David of Israel may be an early one, does he really deserve primacy or is this POV. This applies to quite a lot of biblical names, but many (most?) other first names are disambig pages. Should not 'David' be moved to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_David_1375.html" title="King David">King David</a>?</p>
<p>Some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of links coming into the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> page and many of them refer to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_David_1375.html" title="King David">King David</a>. However, about 250 of them are redirects from <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_David_1375.html" title="King David">King David</a> in any case. More than a few of them are due to inclusion from templates, such as <a href="../../../a/d/a/Template%7EAdam_to_David_67b3.html" title="Template:Adam to David">Template:Adam to David</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProphets_in_the_Qur%27an_79dd.html" title="Template:Prophets in the Qur'an">Template:Prophets in the Qur'an</a>. A great many more are from links that have effectively been dab'd from 'King David' (see for example <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Book of Job">Book of Job</a>)</li>
<li>There are quite a number of other King Davids</li>

<dd>But about the David thing, I do not know of any famous David other than the king David listed in the disambiguation page, so let's keep it that way. Let's keep the personal opinions out and let the NPOV in you speak. :) The NPOV person in me would say that David being referenced to King David is such a Neutral POV because majority of the people know David as king david.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atheism in philosophical naturalism</span></h2>
<p><i>Atheism in philosophical naturalism</i> Many, if not most, atheists have preferred to say that atheism is a lack of a belief, rather than a belief in its own right (see, for example, Krueger (1998, p.22-24); Smith (1979, p.15-16)). This keeps the burden of proof on the theist (see Flew (1984b)), as the only one making any positive assertions. "Belief" also has other connotations that many atheists may wish to avoid. Nevertheless, some atheist writers identify atheism with the naturalistic world view, and defend it on that basis. The case for naturalism is used as a positive argument for atheism. See, for example, Thrower (1971), Harbour (2001), Nielsen (2001) and Baggini (2003). See also Everitt's discussion of an anti-atheist argument against naturalism (2004, Chapter 9, p.178-190). According to Thrower, Much atheism... can be understood only in the light of the current theism which it was concerned to reject. Such atheism is relative. There is, however, a way of looking at and interpreting events in the world, whose origins... can be seen as early as the beginnings of speculative thought itself, and which I shall call naturalistic, that is atheistic per se, in the sense that it is incompatible with any and every form of supernaturalism... naturalistic or absolute atheism is both fundamentally more important, and more interesting, representing as it does one polarity in the development of the human spirit. (p.3-4) Julian Baggini argues that, "atheism can be understood not simply as a denial of religion, but as a self-contained belief system, if it is seen as a commitment to the view that there is only one world and this is the world of nature" (p.74). For Baggini, therefore, the evidence for atheism is to be found in the fact that there is a plethora of evidence for the truth of naturalism and an absence of evidence for anything else. 'Anything else' of course includes God, but it also includes goblins, hobbits, and truly everlasting gobstoppers. There is nothing special about God in this sense. God is just one of the things that atheists don't believe in, it just happens to be the thing that, for historical reasons, gave them their name. (p.17) Baggini's position is that "an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls, life after death, ghosts, or supernatural powers. Although strictly speaking an atheist could believe in any of these things and still remain an atheist... the arguments and ideas that sustain atheism tend naturally to rule out other beliefs in the supernatural or transcendental" (p.3-4). Michael Martin (1990, p.470) notes that the view that "naturalism is compatible with nonatheism is true only if 'god' is understood in a most peculiar and misleading way", but he also points out that "atheism does not entail naturalism".</p>
<p>This is an ideology, not a type of atheism. However this is a big edit, so I'll put it hear for any discussion. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 20:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="atheism_as_immorality" id="atheism_as_immorality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">atheism as immorality</span></h2>
<p>Atheism as immorality The first attempts to define or develop a typology of atheism were in religious <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetics</a>. These attempts were expressed in terms and in contexts that reflected the religious assumptions and prejudices of the writers. A diversity of atheist opinion has been recognized at least since <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, and common distinctions have been established between <i>practical atheism</i> and <i>speculative</i> or <i>contemplative atheism</i>.</p>
<p>Practical atheism was said to be caused by moral failure, hypocrisy, willful ignorance and infidelity. Practical atheists were said to behave as though God, morals, ethics and social responsibility did not exist; they abandoned duty and embraced hedonism. Maritain's typology of atheism (1953, Chapter 8) proved influential in Catholic circles; it was followed in the <i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i> (see Reid, 1967). He identified, in addition to practical atheism, <i>pseudo-atheism</i> and <i>absolute atheism</i> (and subdivided theoretical atheism in a way that anticipated Flew). For an atheist critique of Maritain, see Smith (1979, Chapter 1, Section 5).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the French Catholic philosopher Étienne Borne (1961, p.10), 'Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.'</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Armstrong_ba0b.html" title="Karen Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a> (1999):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for polemic... In his tract <i>Atheism Closed and Open Anatomized</i> (1634), John Wingfield claimed: 'the hypocrite is an Atheist; the loose wicked man is an open Atheist; the secure, bold and proud transgressor is an Atheist: he that will not be taught or reformed is an Atheist'. For the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> poet <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Vaughan_%28Welsh_writer_and_colonial_investor%29_481e.html" title="William Vaughan (Welsh writer and colonial investor)">William Vaughan</a> (1577 [sic]–1641), who helped in the colonization of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, those who raised rents or enclosed commons were obvious atheists. The English dramatist <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Nashe_8857.html" title="Thomas Nashe">Thomas Nashe</a> (1567-1601) proclaimed that the ambitious, the greedy, the gluttons, the vainglorious and prostitutes were all atheists. The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling <i>himself</i> an atheist. (p.331-332)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the existence of serious, speculative atheism was often denied. That anyone might <i>reason</i> their way to atheism was thought to be impossible. The existence of God was self-evident, and (apparently) necessary for the proper functioning of society. Thus, speculative atheism was collapsed into a form of practical atheism, and conceptualized as hatred of God or a fight against righteous social mores. This is why Borne finds it necessary to say, 'to put forward the idea, as some apologists rashly do, that there are no atheists except in name but only <i>practical atheists</i> who through pride or idleness disregard the divine law, would be, at least at the beginning of the argument, a rhetorical convenience or an emotional prejudice evading the real question.' (p.18) Martin (1990, p.465-466) suggests that practical atheism would be better described as <i>alienated theism</i>.</p>
<p>Other pejorative definitions of atheism When denial of the existence of 'speculative' atheism became unsustainable, atheism was nevertheless often repressed and criticized by narrowing definitions, applying charges of dogmatism, and otherwise misrepresenting atheist positions. One of the reasons for the popularity of euphemistic alternative terms like <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularist</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">empiricist</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>, or '<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brights_movement.html" title="Brights movement">Bright</a>' is that <i>atheism</i> still has pejorative connotations arising from attempts at suppression and from its association with practical atheism; as mentioned above, <i>godless</i> is still used as an abusive epithet today.</p>
<p>Mynga Futrell and Paul Geisert, the originators of the term <i>Bright</i>, made this explicit in an essay published in 2003:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our personal frustration regarding labels reached culmination last fall when we were invited to join a march on Washington as 'Godless Americans'. The causes of the march were worthy, and the march itself well-planned and conducted. However, to unite for common interests under a disparaging term like 'godless' (it also means 'wicked') seemed ludicrous! Why accept and utilize the very derogatory language that so clearly hampers our own capacity to play a positive and contributing role in our communities and in the nation and world?<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That several religious groups have adopted the disparaging names handed to them as a badge of honour (the '<a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodists</a>', for example) seems to have only increased their ire.</p>
<p>Gaskin (1989) abandoned the term <i>atheism</i> in favor of <i>unbelief</i>, citing 'the pejorative associations of the term, its vagueness, and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist...' (p.4)</p>
<p>Despite these considerations, for others <i>atheist</i> has always been the preferred name. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Bradlaugh_5ea8.html" title="Charles Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh</a> once said, in debate with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jacob_Holyoake_e163.html" title="George Jacob Holyoake">George Jacob Holyoake</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, cited in Bradlaugh Bonner (1908):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I maintain that the opprobrium cast upon the word Atheism is a lie. I believe Atheists as a body to be men deserving respect... I do not care what kind of character religious men may put round the word Atheist, I would fight until men respect it. (p.334)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Implicit and explicit atheism</span></h2>
<p>The terms <i>implicit atheism</i> and <i>explicit atheism</i> were coined by George H. Smith (1979, p.13-18). Implicit atheism is defined by Smith as 'the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it.' Explicit atheism is defined as 'the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it', which, according to Smith, is sometimes called <i>antitheism</i> (see below).</p>
<p>For Smith, explicit atheism is subdivided further according to whether or not the rejection is made on rational grounds. The term <i>critical atheism</i> is used to label the view that belief in god is irrational, and is itself subdivided into a) the view usually expressed by the statement 'I do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being'; b) the view usually expressed by the statement, 'god does not exist' or 'the existence of god is impossible'; and c) the view which 'refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god' because 'the concept of a god is unintelligible' (p.17).</p>
<p>Although Nagel rejects Smith's definition of atheism as merely 'lack of theism', acknowledging only explicit 'atheism' as true atheism, his tripartite classification of <i>rejectionist atheism</i> (commonly found in the philosophical literature) is identical to Smith's <i>critical atheism</i> typology.</p>
<p>The difference between Nagel on the one hand and d'Holbach and Smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism (see Smith (1990, Chapter 3, p.51-60<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>), for example, but also alluded to by others).</p>
<p>Everitt (2004) makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to distinguish between a <i>biographical</i> or <i>sociological</i> enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in God, and an <i>epistemological</i> enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief... We are interested in the question of what <i>good reasons</i> there are for or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them. (p.10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in philosophy (Flew and Martin notwithstanding), atheism is commonly defined along the lines of 'rejection of theistic belief'. This is often misunderstood to mean only the view that there is no God, but it is conventional to distinguish between two or three main sub-types of atheism in this sense (writers differ in their characterization of this distinction, and in the labels they use for these positions).</p>
<p>The terms <i>weak atheism</i> and <i>strong atheism</i> (or <i>negative atheism</i> and <i>positive atheism</i>) are often used as synonyms of Smith's less-well-known <i>implicit</i> and <i>explicit</i> categories. However, the original and technical meanings of implicit and explicit atheism are quite different and distinct from weak and strong atheism, having to do with conscious rejection and unconscious rejection of theism rather than with positive belief and negative belief.</p>
<p>People who do not use the broad definition of atheism as 'lack of theism', but instead use the most common definition 'disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods'<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> would not recognize mere absence of belief in deities (implicit atheism) as a type of atheism at all, and would tend to use other terms, such as 'skeptic' or 'agnostic' or even the heavy-handed 'non-atheistic non-theism', for this position.</p>

<p>Doggonit! If people are going to edit on atheism, they'd better know their stuff, otherwise, everything is simply a POV. The supposed POV you removed was in response to the other POV expressed on murder that I keep removing (and it keeps getting put back). That section is for criticisms of atheism. The preceding statements are talking about the comparison of atheism and nihilism, which I (and others) happen to believe is the logical end of atheism. If you read a little about Nihilism, you will find out that there are no morals and there is no truth. If this is the case, then there may be no such thing as an "unjustified killing", therefore I think both my parenthetical comment on murder AND the other comment on murder should be removed, or they should BOTH be left. -- 67.187.9.149</p>
<p>I do think the thing about murder being defined as unjustified is unhelpful... nobody really forms their moral judgements in this way, I think. I mean, nobody would say "hey you murdered someone, that's wrong, because murder is defined as unjustified." Rather, they would say, "hey, you killed someone, and it was unjustified, so it's murder".... <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 23:28, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm allowed POV on a talk page, but I'm fairly certain no serious thinker says places any emphasis on the fact that some words are defined as "wrong acts". Saying that murder is "killing that is wrong" doesn't really get us anywhere unless we already know what "wrong" means. It's not the basis for any real philosophy as far as I know.

(you know trouble is afoot when you read "grammer" in an edit summary:) this 'murder' point seems awfully offtopic for an already rambling article. Atheists do not share a single concept of morality, period. I daresay typical atheists will at least ponder implications of humanism and morality, unlike the "who would Jesus kill" attitude of many Christian imperialists.

<dd>I disagree. It is obviously a loosely defined group. As proof, all one needs to do is to look for atheist groups on the internet. There are plenty. They may have differing beliefs, but they must have some unifying belief or there would be no point in forming groups. Even the views of intelligent atheists are flawed and their logic breaks down at some point. When one gets down to the basics, everything is belief and faith.

Kirkegaard also took up these notions, but went in a different direction. Derrida? Know there are some others, but I'd have to look them up.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Atheism &amp; Nihilism</span></h4>
<p>The criticism being examined is the one that atheism <i>inevitably</i> leads to nihilism. The basis for the claim needs some development first - supported by someone such as Nietzsche. Responses to such criticism merit inclusion too. Four reasons or systems of reasons that atheists have adopted have been presented - none of which are particularly <i>new</i>. If it is deccided that Nietsche has more to say in response - such as "why should I be concerned with what actions are justifiable?", then there is an opportunity to add more this important section. As it stands, Nietsche's objections are presented as fully defeating "rational morality" - when there is more than considerable doubt that his objections do not defeat all claims that "rational morality" is possible. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:10, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The repeatedly inserted claim that morality is "one person's idea of what rules he wants everyone to follow" ignores the previous statement in the paragraph that not all moral atheists are making rues for others - as such it is non-responsive &amp; does not belong as the last sentence --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:14, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is there because of a previous criticism in article (&amp; many other places) that atheists have no grounds to say that murder is wrong. It also can be a starting point with which to develop a "rational morality" - if one agrees that there are murders &amp; there are thefts, etc., then one must acknowledge that their thoughts include moral concepts - and that one does not need a deity to tell them these are wrong acts. And no, making all killing the same, including killing in self-defence, is not very helpful --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that if murder is just defined as "killing that's wrong" then this can't be a ground for any judgements about morality, since without further guidance we won't know whether a killing is wrong or not. On the other hand, if murder is defined as "killing that's illegal" or somesuch, then "murder is wrong" certainly is NOT true by definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe anyone argues that statements like "'murder is wrong' is true by definition" are actually useful. That's why I don't want it in the article.

<dl>
<dd>These morals are based off of social law. killing someone for no reason may be punishable where it's prohibited. It is not original research, it's social progress. Lynchings were considered moral at one point, if not now. They were based on hearsay from the bible, and by the fact that no one ever persecuted the lynchers. Some atheists don't murder because they have no good reason to put themselves on the opposite side of the law of society. Yes, it means taking responsibility for your own actions. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 02:02, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes you are missing the point. It is clearly not true by definition that breaking the law is wrong.

<p>ok ok... i think you're mis reading me here.

<dd>It's unclear to me how one is supposed to choose between two conflicting sets of laws one might follow. Basically you're saying that an act can simultaneously be "right" according to one set of laws, and "wrong" according to another.

<p>Name me one assasin that was an atheist.

<dl>
<dd>You haven't really answered my point, I feel. One society says something is wrong, another society says it is right. So, is it objectively right or objectively wrong? How are you to decide, since "right" for you simply means accordance with the law? Whose law? Clearly it can't just be "the society I'm in". What if you're in Nazi Germany? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 02:37, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What if you are? A lot of people had a hard time with that. some people did not kill because they lived through peaceful times and thought previous laws were better, other because of their religious laws. However lots of people did kill because hitler convinced them it was a religious war; and their religion had higher priority over social law. right and wrong are subjective, you learn this very quickly in anthropology, esp when studing cannibalistic cultures. So if you feel like you can't take responsibility for your actions and can't think on you own, then it's best for you to go and pick a religion thats won't screw you over; ie scientology, charles manson, any <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 02:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But we've drifted quite far from the point. It seems like you're now agreeing with me that "the law" and "objective right and wrong" don't have much necessary connection with each other. You say you have to "think on your own". Exactly my point. So do we agree now that something isn't wrong just because it's illegal? And therefore, if we define murder as "illegal killing", then it isn't true by definition that murder is wrong...? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 03:00, 30 July 2006 (UTC), <i>my apologies to other innocent readers of this talk page...</i></dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Nietzsche &amp; Atheism &amp; Nihilism</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is an article about atheism. It is not an article about Nihilism &amp; certainly not an article about Nietzsche &amp; how he (&amp; our anonymous 67. contributor) thinks he has defeated all attempts at rational morality. Despite that editor's insistence, scholars do not agree that atheism inevitably leads to nihilism nor to immorality. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 22:27, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The placement of those remarks by Nietzsche do not even cover his main position (Beyond Good &amp; Evil) that morality is "merely a master-slave relationship", nor are they responsive to the earlier presentation in the paragraph. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 22:27, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I will not be baited into violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Adding something is not a reversion. You are allowed 3 reversions <i>per article</i> per day - you are way over that &amp; have no <i>basis</i> to accuse others of that which you so blatantly do yourself - without even responding on talk pages. I have not determined if you are a nihilist or a Xian. If a nihilist, you have no basis to argue about unfair edits (or else your arguments belie your stated claims) and unlikely to respond to anything other than consequences -- like being banned. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 00:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh give it a rest. I am not "user Dot 6". I am a reasonable, though quite opinionated person. I DID leave comments above that you apparently didn't read, I just couldn't figure out where to leave them as I am relatively new to the quite errant Wikipedia. Everything I have added has been constantly removed or edited in favor of atheism in an apologistic fashion by people who obviously do not know their philosophy. I have been accused and already unfairly banned once because of the mob rule behavior of others here. My beliefs are of no concern. I believe I read on your own page that you are an "existentialist" (by a test), do I have the right person? If you are, then as a consequence, you have no interest in truth, right, or wrong, so don't accuse me of such.</dd>

<p>Not even Existentialists, which I am not really - though the test cannot tell, agree that FN has done away with all basis for morality. FN thought that Xty had become nihilistic &amp; done away will any basis for morality - he gives many indications that he thinks a "true" morality can be found - one that need not involve a deity. But whatever he thinks, it is certainly NOT the last word on the subject --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you believe his word is not the last on the subject, then perhaps you should read the many others who think the same such as Kirkegaard (and several other more recent names I could dredge up if necessary). I thought Nietsche might be a little more friendly and appropriate for an atheism page than Kirkegaard. 67.187.9.149 01:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your point reminds me most of <a href="../../../d/o/s/Dostoevsky.html" title="Dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a>. His writing appeals mostly only to those in the first stages of "death of God", or who have drawn back from even considering it. Later in life it is either laughable or simply tortured philosophy. Sure, morals are no longer <i>absolute</i> without deities - but that does not mean they are without foundation --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">article length</span></h2>
<p>I've been watching this article for over a year, and it has proven an awful sophist-magnet. It desperately needs a firm springcleaning, cutting it down to clearcut prose pointing out the essentials. It should <i>absolutely</i> be cut down to 60k, meaning that some 15k of ballast need to go (and good riddance too:) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is not a bleeding belief system, and I don't see how that affects our ability to reduce article size per <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> (plus much of this article is just rambling, belief system or no, I know no other article where authors are so possessive about their phrasings). also, you might want to use a spellchecker. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it is a belief system. You seem to understand the implications of the philosophies mentioned. If so, then you know that everything is merely belief and faith. Again, as mentioned above, if atheism is not a belief system, then why are there so many atheist groups? You wouldn't think they would have anything in common if atheism wasn't a belief system. 67.187.9.149 00:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Take <a href="../../../../de/a/t/h/Atheismus.html" class="extiw" title="de:Atheismus">de:Atheismus</a> for reference: it's a FA. It's also over-long (77k), but <i>half</i> of that is a concise treatment of the history of the concept, not some pov-counter-pov dialogue (while the History section was unceremoniously exported from this article to gain more room for self-centered hair splitting by editors of various convictions). I would like to remind everyone that this article is not a platform for your personal views, but should give a clean and distanced overview of the whole topic. The "studies and statistics" section for one thing is insanely long and should have been exported long ago. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"...this is not a platform for your personal views, but should give a clean and distanced overview of the whole topic." I agree, which is exactly why atheism leading to nihilism should remain in the criticism section. It is a valid philosophical criticism mentioned and maintained by multiple philosophers down through history. Am I incorrect? 67.187.9.149 00:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A lower case g</span></h2>
<p><s>I've just reverted someone's attempt to change "God" to "god". This is very controversial and I don't believe any decent text book would spell God, when used as a proper name as opposed to "a God" or "the God", with a lower case g. It's not standard and it looks to me like an atheist's attempt to impose some personal standard. --<a href="../../../l/o/2/User%7ELo2u_7160.html" title="User:Lo2u">Lo2u</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/o/2/User_talk%7ELo2u_fec7.html" title="User talk:Lo2u">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lo2u_7724.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lo2u">C</a>)</sup> 10:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
