<dd>I have no idea if enough data exists to support such a thing, but I'd <b>love</b> to see a chart that graphs the waxing and waning of major religions over the millenia as percentages of the human population on the planet. I thinkit would be useful to show that (say) even though worshipers of <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moloch.html" title="Moloch">Moloch</a> were a big deal in the -2000s (I'm making my data up), they had trended away to nothingness by the first century. It could, of course, also show all the "unaffiliated" folks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Otherwise, yes, some pie charts of the present situation would help, as might a photo or drawing of any famous atheist philosophers.</dd>

<dd>I can ask John for a photo and for permission to post that photo of him in Wikipedia, if we decide to go with him.

<dd>Good idea. A photograph of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> would be good, as he's a well-known and outspoken aetheist. He wrote a good article for <i>The Guardian</i> on September 15, 2001 about religion and 9/11, which I'd like to work into this article in some way. He writes of the hijackers: "Those people were not mindless and they were certainly not cowards. On the contrary, they had sufficiently effective minds braced with an insane courage, and it would pay us mightily to understand where that courage came from. It came from religion ... To fill a world with religion ... is like littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they are used." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:32, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was thinking about this before, and I think I may have come up with a fairly good idea. Why don't we use a few pictures of well known atheists, starting in chronological order as the article itself progresses? For example, we could start off with Epicurus, then move onto perhaps some enlightenment thinkers such as Paul Baron d'Holbach, towards more modern outspoken atheists such as Bertrand Russell and Richard Dawkins. Perhaps we could do something like this, where we follow the chain of outspoken atheist/rationalist types? I personally think this would be better than just adding a picture of one random atheist, and might help illustrate the continuity of the basic principles of the ideas associated with atheism quite well. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 14:54, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Richard Dawkins' atheism is controversial considering his overt overly negative conception of theism, religion, especially of Christianity. I think using his photo would be more of a "slap in the face" to theists. Because theists <i>are</i> part of the readership, we don't want to do that. Moreover, while Dawkins is a popular atheist, he's primarily involved with zoology, and associating his image perceived by theists with atheism would only further their negative perception of atheism and its adherents. Can we not find a less-abusive and civil figure in philosophy or the philosophy of science that can represent atheism fairly? <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 02:31, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally think that Richard Dawkins should probably be included in this article. He is certainly a very high profile atheist (possibly the most high profile living atheist at the moment??), and I don't personally think that an article on atheism should necessarily be tamed in order not to offend certain people and certain sensibilities. It is true that many find his style aggressive and perhaps confrontational, but it is also true that he is a very high profile atheist who is as respected by some as he is abhored by others. The fact that he is practically evangelical with his atheism and such a controversial figure makes his inclusion more necessary, not less, in my opinion. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 16:26, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're right, of course Dawkins should be mentioned (I say this through gritted teeth, because though I like him as a person, I find his approach to atheism alternately embarrassing and infuriating). He's nothing to do with zoology, incidentally. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:51, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing to do with zoology? Is that why he has a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</a> degree in zoology, was an assistant professor of zoology at UC Berkeley, and was a lecturer and reader in zoology at Oxford University?

<p>I guess I'm one of those people with the near-fatal allergy to humor; but I wouldn't like a picture or non-picture of IPU to be associated with this article.

<dd>the IPU is "internet atheism" and shouldn't be featured in the intro of a serious article on atheism. But we can put it under "contemporary atheism" somewhere. If we <i>must</i> have an image in the intro, it should either be Epicurus' mugshot, or a relevant title page, e.g. of Holbach's book. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:16, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>It seems a pity to have an article on aetheism with showing the aetheist logo. This is a visually dull page but anything other than the logo is going to be relevant only indirectly. No one is known for being a famous aetheist and nothing else. I suggest we have some sort of poll here, first to decide whether to use the logo, and then, if the answer is yes, to decide which one. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:22, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is a very obscure "logo". Nobody who is not familiar with IPU would recognize it, and not even most of them. As for IPU, her celebrity status on alt.atheism to the contrary notwithstanding, most people are not familiar with her either, even atheists. In general, I don't think we need to be so deferential towards a satire that has expanded a bit beyond alt.atheism to become a very, very minor Internet meme. I think it trivializes atheism to associate the main article in the Wikipedia about it with IPU. Anyway, Wikipedia already has an article on IPU, and we don't need to drag her into this article except, at most, as a "See also" link. It doesn't bother me at all that the page is "visually dull", as long as it is accurate and informative. I don't think we have to bend over backwards to find images to tart it up. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:07, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know whether it's as obscure as you say. It gets around 5,000 hits on Google, 13,000 on Google groups, and it's notable enough for its own Wikipedia entry. It would be somewhat obtuse to have an article on atheism that doesn't mention it and show it, especially as the point of the article is to educate people, not just to tell them things they already know. Anyway, we can have a poll. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:16, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you talking about IPU or the logo? IPU is not obscure on the Internet, I would agree, although if you don't hang out in alt.atheism, you might not have come across her. I would say her notability is borderline, and it would be more trouble than it was worth to nominate the Wikipedia article for VFD. (I thought about it, before spending a lot of time improving the article.) For an Internet phenomenon, those Google hits aren't that many, by the way. As for the logo, until I was involved in the editing of the IPU article I was unfamiliar with it, and I knew about IPU. The present article is about more than two thousand years of the history and philosophy of atheism -- not "Atheism on the Internet". Please write Atheism on the Internet, if you want. It might be interesting. For example, it might cover various Internet atheist phenomena as alt.atheism, IPU, the Evil Atheist Conspiracy, and the many atheist web sites. Why, I think "weak atheism" is mainly an Interet phenomenon, and you could throw that in, too, along with IPU and EAC. But that is not this article, and I think it is a bit narcissistic for an online encyclopedia to give various Internet manifestations too much prominence in serious articles about philosophical topics, and tends to trivialize them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:31, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, and "strong atheism" is merely a phenomenon originating from arrogant ignorance. Quit trivializing "weak atheism" as some sort of trend.

<dd>I had heard of it, and I don't post on or read Usenet. The present article isn't called History of Atheism. Of course, its history and philosophy will make up the bulk of article, but that's no reason to exclude other aspects that may be of interest to readers, and this is one of them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:38, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never heard of the Invisible Pink Unicorn until I came to Wikipedia. With that said, I don't think mentioning the IPU is encyclopedically significant. The IPU logo is also without any decipherable, relevant, and useful meaning to a so-called "atheism movement"... other than it being a logo with practical uses. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 02:23, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is there to clarify? My question only requires clarification if you're assuming my intent is something other than good faith.

<p>This is getting a little tangled, and we are talking past each other. When Adraeus asked whether this article should be submitted for peer review, I assumed he intended it as a form of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispute_resolution.html" title="Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a>. Naturally, I asked him to clarify what he thought the dispute was about. We've had so many disputes over the months, but it seems like most of them have settled down and we've all compromised our way to relative harmony (or maybe it is exhaustion). I didn't think there were any remaining hot disputes, and that we were down to arguing about dash length, and the like -- just, you know, to keep ourselves in arguing trim. Then, Sam raised a possibility that hadn't occurred to me, which was that Adraeus wanted the article peer-reviewed as a prerequisite to a Featured Article nomination. So, at this point, I'm a bit lost, since Adraeus still hasn't said why he thinks the article should be peer-reviewed. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:22, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, SS raised that possibility after Adraeus had said that he'd thought that Peer review was "was a more formal version of" RfC. In other words, your assumption about his intentions was correct; I admit that his later comment doesn't make sense (BM's "question was asked based on his misunderstanding and reinterpretation of the original question"), but there you are. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:47, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting it on PR will most probable only be useful if we request community comments on a particular topic. If we want to raise this to FA quality, we have quite a long way to go. I do not think it can be done, since too many editors are phrase-hugging and uncompromising. Never mind, it's a fair article, even if not brilliant or accomplished, and as such a good resource on the topic.
