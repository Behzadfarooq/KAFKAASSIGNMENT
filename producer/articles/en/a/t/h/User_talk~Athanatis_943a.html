<p>As you've probably noticed already, SuggestBot gave me articles to edit ages back. I haven't actually done any work on them yet. I think I prefer to just browse around and read till I find something that needs fixing.</p>
<p>I was just looking at <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason_Act_1351_890d.html" title="Treason Act 1351">Treason Act 1351</a>, which says that among the treasons listed in the Act is forging money. I always thought that forging money wasn't a treason until an amendment in Tudor times elevated it. I dunno... I'll do some research and see if it needs fixing. In any case I need to put a link to the original version of the Act, the one without all the amendments later added.</p>

<p>Nope, exams not over yet. But guess what: there's someone I know in offline life who's editing on Wikipedia! (See <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkdarb_34f4.html" title="User:Markdarb">markdarb</a>.) Haha, corrected one of the mistakes I always make, noun-verb disagreements...</p>
<p>Eugh bear with me, my last exam's this Wednesday, then I'd be able to edit as much as I like! Mwahahahahaha!</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry, I've been pretty much completely inactive these last few weeks. I've been very busy, first dealing with a pileup of assignments and now I've got the exams looming' the first one in around a week's time. Bear with me for a little, I'll be back soon! (Or sooner if I get bored studying.)</p>

<p>Heya, I'm back! Wheeee! Just added a paragraph in the <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyboard_layout.html" title="Keyboard layout">Keyboard layout</a> article. Under the US layout section, it said that US keyboards can't type accents or anything like that. Underneath is the US-International section, which defines weird accent keys at strange places. I've been using US-International (as defined by WinXP) for more than 3 years. It works just like the standard US keyboard, but it's much more accent-friendly. When you type a single quotation mark, for example, nothing shows up. If you type a key like a or e straight afterward, á or é will come out. If you press the spacebar, the normal ' will come out. If you try to accent a letter it doesn't allow you to accent, like m, it'll just come out as 'm. But, unlike the diagram of the weird US-International keyboard, the accented characters are placed on the same keys as the unaccented ones (e.g. if you want to type é, è, ê etc you just use the e key). So I added some stuff on it.</p>

<p>Phew, I've been soooo busy these last few days... This week I have two assignments and one test, another test next week. I don't actually have that much to say, cos I haven't been doing much on WP, but I just want you to know I'm still alive. I made a couple of minor edits, particularly the one on <a href="../../../e/i/d/Eidetic_memory.html" title="Eidetic memory">Eidetic memory</a> - someone deleted it, calling it advertising trash, and some other person restored it. I put it back in with a neutralised description, like I originally did. Don't know what will happen now.</p>

<p>Someone's deleted my edit in <a href="../../../e/i/d/Eidetic_memory.html" title="Eidetic memory">Eidetic memory</a>. That anonymous ip also deleted a whole bunch of other stuff. A bit of a debate going on as to whether an external link, the description of which I edited to NPOV it, should remain. I've re-edited it to make it NPOV. Wonder what would happen next.</p>

<p>Not completely on-topic, but I'm going to download MediaWiki and run it on my own computer. I was starting a sort of reference dictionary thing for a novel I'm writing. Using it mainly for the History feature - makes it easy to see how my ideas developed - and the simple formatting. No more trying to remember whether I'm supposed to do subsection headings in 14 point or 16 point.</p>

<p>Deleted several paragraphs at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_v._Sindermann_9961.html" title="Perry v. Sindermann">Perry v. Sindermann</a>, a US Supreme Court case on employment issues. The facts said that Sindermann was dismissed for insubordination. Below that was a lengthy discussion, largely without any sources, on the concept of insubordination in military and civilian contexts. That, while interesting, had nothing to do with the material facts of the case. It was also identical to text from the article <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insubordination.html" title="Insubordination">Insubordination</a>, and I suspect it was copied-and-pasted straight from there.</p>

<p>Heya, just started a stub on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Geiss_%28Academic%29_8117.html" title="James Geiss (Academic)">James Geiss</a>. I found him on the front cover of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118310/sr=8-2/qid=1156310836/ref=sr_1_2/102-2959460-5808121?ie=UTF8|textbook" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118310/sr=8-2/qid=1156310836/ref=sr_1_2/102-2959460-5808121?ie=UTF8|textbook" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on Classical Chinese. The textbook itself sounded like it was written by native Chinese speakers, since the English wasn't very smooth in places and sometimes did not translate the modern Chinese explanations as well as it could have. So I looked at the cover, and found that two of the authors were definitely Chinese. The third was Geiss, an obviously Western name, but above it was the Chinese name 蓋杰民. So I Googled for him to see who he really was. The first search result was Wikipedia, which came out as some 19th century businessman. And that's my long explanation for starting the disambiguation.</p>

<p>Yep, me again. In case nobody noticed (which is probably the case), I've made a proper <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthanatis_35b5.html" title="User:Athanatis">user page</a>. Version 1.0 you might call it. It's really cluttered and not complete, but it's a good start. Really sleepy now (see the Meta-Box to the right) - it's 1:30am now and I've been on Wikipedia for several hours straight. Munching on <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_food.html" title="Junk food">junk food</a>, too. I always get the munchies when I'm on the computer. Which isn't good, considering how I'm on the computer at least 6 hours a day.</p>

My very first edit is creating a page on <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meruzhan_Artzruni_1a6e.html" title="Meruzhan Artzruni">Meruzhan Artzruni</a>, a somewhat obscure character from early Armenian history. I'm not sure why I chose such a random topic. I'm not Armenian and don't have anything to do with Armenia (in fact, I couldn't point it out on a map two weeks back). But I was browsing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_convicted_of_treason.html" title="List of people convicted of treason">List of people convicted of treason</a>, and Meruzhan, the first person on the list, was red linked. I just felt it was totally immoral for the first guy on the list not to even have a stub, so I did some research, and voila! By the way, I like his name. I'll name my poodle after him. You'll probably (don't count on it, though - I'm pretty capricious) see my name floating around more articles on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Armenia_cfa2.html" title="History of Armenia">Armenian history</a> over the next month or so, cos I've decided to make it my research topic of the unspecified length of time.</p>
<p>After that I went and edited a coupla pages on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_writing.html" title="History of writing">beginnings of writing</a>. For decades it's been universally acknowledged that the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamian</a> script is the earliest known form of writing, dating back to c 4000 BCE. But recently archaeologists discovered <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_bones.html" title="Oracle bones">oracle bones</a>, tortoise shells with inscriptions, at Chinese sites that are carbon-dated to c 6000 BCE. Since then the Chinese who managed to dig up the little article on the findings have been hopping up and down telling the world they're the ones who invented writing at a whooping 2000 years earlier. Of course, critics have been quick to dismiss the inscriptions as primitive symbols that aren't nearly complicated enough to qualify as a written language. I believe this issue is still under debate, and I said so in the articles I edited. Personally I'd be predisposed to say they <i>are</i> writing, albeit in a very early form. I once saw a photo of one of the bones they excavated, and I could recognise several symbols as being early forms of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_characters.html" title="Chinese characters">Chinese characters</a> still in use today. From looking at the 30 or so symbols that appeared in the photo, I could very roughly work out what kind of inscription it was (something to do with a tribal chief and rain, if I remember correctly - it was a coupla years back). I think if a modern Chinese can decipher enough of these symbols to get a glimpse of the meaning, but a modern foreigner can't, it qualifies as early Chinese writing, right? Just my two cents though, I don't pretend to be an expert in Chinese, much less early Chinese.</p>
<p>Whew, that was one long rant. But I'm not done. I also edited some random articles for purely pedantic stylistic complaints. Linking words, separating a paragraph. Watch me, or soon I'll be going around deleting extra spaces at the end of sentences.</p>
<p>Okay, don't worry, I doubt my later posts will be nearly as long as this one. It's just that this is my first post to my own talk page (or anyone's, for that matter), and I'm pretty excited. In the future I don't think I'll be gloating over every <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostrophe.html" title="Apostrophe">apostrophe</a> I correct.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, I know my talk page looks pretty plain, and my user home page is basically non-existent. Be patient. It's not that I don't know enough <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> to change the background colour. (In fact, I know how to change it to lime green! Flashing neon! With dynamic javascript bunnies hopping about! Go me!!!!!!! ...err, you still there?) I just don't have the time yet. <i>But you seem to have the time for one big random rant -</i> <b>That's not the point, and this is <i>my</i> talk page, so you can just shoo</b> I'll make it all fancy soon. Pinky promise.</p>

<p>Well allow me to flame you. I just sat and read through every single one of your user boxes, and I have no idea why anyone could possibly have so many!&#160;;) Well, there are no doubt much worse culprits than you around. Oh, and tut tut, I had to correct something on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perduellio.html" title="Perduellio">Perduellio</a>. You should be ashamed of yourself! And no I don't make a habit of berating people for that kind of thing, but this is the first time I've come across someone I know editing on Wikipedia so I couldn't resist! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkdarb_34f4.html" title="User:Markdarb">Markdarb</a> 05:37, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, shut up, if you've been studying for the last 8 hours then found, to your annoyance, that there was no article on something you have to write about...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's really annoying, I keep making this same mistake over and over - nouns and verbs not matching it number. I suppose I'm just too arrogant to proofread my writing...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I spent the whole night looking up userboxes in every category I can find. It's pretty fun - you should try it sometime! Your user page is pathetically lacking in userboxes - if you can read though them in less than 2 minutes, you don't have enough.</dd>

<dd>I thought I might as well reply to your messages (even if it is a bit late). Yes, the poem is the 9/11 one. You spend ages finding every userbox you can use - I found one and decided to use it too! I perfectly understand starting an article because it doesn't exist, and I perfectly understand making some mistakes - a wiki is the perfect place for someone else to fix it for you!&#160;;) And I think Wikipedians in general might possibly find the amount of userboxes on your page somewhat excessive - I personally am going to delete almost all of mine soon so that I can use a user page template I'm currently making and testing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkdarb_34f4.html" title="User:Markdarb">Markdarb</a> 20:30, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
