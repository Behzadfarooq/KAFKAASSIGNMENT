<p>You're right that my earlier comment about the naming of Avenue Road was unsubstantiated. I have now provided a substantiated version and removed the unsubstantiated assertion that the name is unusual. My authority is the Collins <i>M25 London Master Street Atlas</i> which lists many streets with this name. Of course we may be using different meanings of <i>unusual</i>; if so that needs to be clarified before further revisions are made. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 13:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Got your message. Will do. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 18:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I put the citation in. When I get the time I'll figure out just how many Avenue Roads there are in London â€“ there are about three inches of map references to Avenue Roads in the atlas, but some may refer to the dsame street appearing on different pages (I haven't found any duplicates yet, but I haven't worked my way through all of them). Some other citations are needed in the article, too â€“ for example, the source of the quotation from Robert Fulford. The whole question of the unusualness of the name needs to be handled in a more wikilike way, too. I replaced an unsourced assertion that the name was unusual with an unsourced assertion that some people find it unusual. A safe enough assertion, that last one, but the question is whether the unusualness of the name needs to be mentioned at all if it's not really unusual. Again it depends what <i>unusual</i> means, I suppose. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 18:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I just noticed that the article said Avenue Road was an extension of University although they don't meet. So I corrected that with a citation.</p>
<p>Should mention I'm what you call a quiet environmentalist, too. Paid for it over the last few days, but it's worth it. I realize environmentalism has to go beyond the personal, but it has to start with the personal. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 18:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, I was using fans a lot the last few days. My non-personal environmental activities are pretty much non-existent at the moment â€“ I'd appreciate any suggestions you might have. One thing that might interest me is an environmental organization whcih is organized in chapters, rather than the centralized ones which dominate the field and in which your chief activity is writing cheques. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 19:39, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for the advice. if you could recommend some organizations I'd appreciate it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 14:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, again. Yes, I do live in TO (beautiful midtown), so suggestions about organizations would be helpful. You've also given me some ideas about organizations to look into. Thanks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I was wondering about whether <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue_Road_190d.html" title="Avenue Road">Avenue Road</a> should include any longer the discussion of the name's oddity, given that it's definitely not an unusual name elsewhere (if you haven't checked the article recently, I found 40 [forty] in London, mainly very short residential streets, but Avenue Roads all the same). I realize that some people do consider it odd, though. For the moment I'm assuming it will stay in. I've been looking for a citation for Robert Fulford's remark, without success. However, he's pretty approachable by e-mail, so I can always go to the source. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 15:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for the list. I've also found a couple of local organizations that look interesting. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 15:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Atrian, I'm well aware that "honours" is an alternative spelling, and I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge "honors" as the variant. And I spent some time stressing over whether to delete the "(u)". After a look at the Wiki (not specifically the contract bridge) style manual, I decided to strike it for a couple of reasons: I find the insertion of the parenthetical "u" visually jarring, and the manual advises against two different spellings on the same page. So, if we want to comply with that advice, we'd have to spell it "hono(u)rs" throughout, and I really doubt we want to do that. And then what of colo(u)rs? and favo(u)rs? and ardo(u)r?</p>
<p>Fowler's Modern English Usage says, "Those who are willing to put national prejudice aside and examine the facts soon realize, first, that the British -our words are much fewer in proportion to the -or words than they supposed, and, secondly, that there seems to be no discoverable line between the two sets so based on principle as to serve any useful purpose."</p>
<p>I've left your recent revision as is, but I think that we should let "honour" go the way of "governour." Xlmvp 15:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regardless if the company <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsville_and_Lake_of_Bays_Transportation_Company_15e7.html" title="Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company">Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company</a> expired or not, it was a different company formed in 1902 that built the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway which did not begin actual operations until 1904. I never had the chance to ride the original railway at Lake of Bays (Ontatio). Having a long time interest in railways and steamboats, I had only heard of the railway about 1969. From 1971 I was a volunteer on the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Segwun_d3b0.html" title="RMS Segwun">Segwun Steamboat Museum</a>. In 1972 I met Niall MacKay, who knew a lot about the railway. At that time he was collecting information for his book "By Steam Boat And Steam Train." I have been good friends with him ever since, and his brother and mom and dad too. In 1984 I was living in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parry_Sound%2C_Ontario_8ea2.html" title="Parry Sound, Ontario">Parry Sound, Ontario</a> and working as a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad_car.html" title="Railroad car">Railroad car</a> mechanic for <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railway_1825.html" title="Canadian National Railway">North America's best Railway</a>, at South Parry and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsville%2C_Ontario_6bd6.html" title="Huntsville, Ontario">Huntsville, Ontario</a>, when <b>we</b> formed the Huntsville &amp; Lake of Bays Railway Society. I am Life Member # 6. That same year I drove to <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer_Village_%28Nebraska%29_659d.html" title="Pioneer Village (Nebraska)">Pioneer Village (Nebraska)</a> at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minden%2C_Nebraska_a6cc.html" title="Minden, Nebraska">Minden, Nebraska</a> where I met with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Warp_d16a.html" title="Harold Warp">Harold Warp</a> and presented to him a copy of Mr. MacKay's book (at my expense). Until then there was nothing in the museum to suggest that the <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._K._Porter%2C_Inc_b340.html" title="H. K. Porter, Inc">H. K. Porter, Inc</a> locomotives came from Lake of Bays. Meanwhile back at Huntsville, I designed the front of the gasoline locomotive, and purchased, re-gaged and restored the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handcar.html" title="Handcar">Handcar</a>. I also suggested the use of retired <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excavator.html" title="Excavator">Excavator</a> machinery for the base of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turntable_%28railroad%29.html" title="Turntable (railroad)">turntables</a> now in use at the railway in Huntsville.<a href="../../../w/r/e/User%7EWrecksdale_Wreck_68ba.html" title="User:Wrecksdale Wreck">Wrecksdale Wreck</a> 01:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey man, I just said that you shouldn't be deleting those pages without any reason. I did not delete the Afd tags yet. No one has provided any support for deleting them. If no one does within a week, I am within my rights to delete those tags. I am the only person who has written anything on those talk pages. Either way if no one speaks then I will assume my voice will speak the loudest. I am not going to stand by and watch good articles that promote public transit use be deleted by certain "elements" who think they own this site. Also, you stated in your posting on my page, that you will ignore my opinion. That really is not fair seeing as you have not supported your choice to delete. My opinion does count. And by the way... other people have supported me. You are not the czar of this site, if that's what you think.

<p>A <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steamship.html" title="Steamship">Steamship</a> is something I think about the size of <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Titanic_9d7a.html" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a> or the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Mauritania_f48c.html" title="RMS Mauritania">RMS Mauritania</a>. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Queen_cede.html" title="Delta Queen">Mississippi paddle wheelers</a> were considered to be steamboats and they were a lot bigger than the S S Algonquin. Generally the rule is that a ship can carry a boat, but a boat cannot carry a ship, however, in this case I am more comfortable with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steamboat.html" title="Steamboat">Steamboat</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsville_and_Lake_of_Bays_Transportation_Company_15e7.html" title="Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company">article</a> deals with three different companies by name:</p>
<p>Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company,</p>
<p>Huntsville and Lake of Bays Navigation Company, and</p>
<p>Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway Company.</p>
<p>Why then wouldn't you list each one on an idividual page? Then you could present each one in chronological order, and also link each page with WIKI LINKS where the other title is mentioned within an article. Also the Huntsville &amp; Lake of Bays Railway can be listed in such categories as Defunct railway companies of Canada or <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portage_railway.html" title="Portage railway">Portage railway</a> without including the steamboat information, but still linked to it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway proposed by <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsville_and_Lake_of_Bays_Transportation_Company_15e7.html" title="Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company">Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company</a>, was chartered as a separate company, and that although the railway was built by the Huntsville &amp; Lake of Bays (and Lake Simcoe) Navigation Company, this was after the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsville_and_Lake_of_Bays_Transportation_Company_15e7.html" title="Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company">Transportation Company</a> ceased to exist, so why is the railway shown on the same page as the Transportation Company?</p>

<p>Boat or Ship? I reworked the article to improve readability. I changed the boldface to italics for the additional company names. This is in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines to use boldface for the article name only. I tend to use steamship and steamboat interchangeably however I suspect that there is a subtle difference. Which one is appropriate for this article? Atrian 14:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Atrian: I've made some adjustments to the Miller section. I'm inclined to agree with your point concerning local media coverage, but the previous wording struck me as a bit POV -- perhaps there's a more neutral way of making the same point.</p>
<p>The version I've prepared focused on priorities and included general criticism.

<p>Ah, thanks for the sources! I'm still curious where the Ojibwe translation of "black burnt lands" comes from, though? Ojibwe for "burnt" is <i>wiisakode-</i>, which looks quite similar to the "Wonscota-" part of the name. But I'm not sure where "-nach" comes from. <i>neyaashi</i> means "point of land" or "point", though, so maybe <i>wiisakode-neyaashi</i>, "burnt point of land"? --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 00:59, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed that you reverted an edit by Yoho2001 on March 20, whereby Yoho2001 had eliminated the reference to Canada in the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Clair_Avenue_db97.html" title="St. Clair Avenue">St. Clair Avenue</a> article (by the way, he went back and reverted your change afterwards).

I have reverted most of them, and left him a note on his talk page explaining that Wikipedia is read internationally. We may want to keep an eye on the issue in case (s)he persists. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 13:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
