<p>I disagree strongly with Mr. Cunningham's contention.</p>
<p>It is not merely a neologism, it mocks something that conservative (and some liberal) pro-Iraqi War commentators and politicians keep saying, which is they want to keep putting off making a hard decision about whether the US should stay in Iraq or not and that 6 months will somehow make the difference, and yet they do bother to explain what will be different if things don't change in 6 months other than they will add another Friedman Unit to the schedule, as it were.</p>
<p>More importantly, if Wikipedia insists on merging the term Friedman (Unit) then it must also merge <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_Derangement_Syndrome_225b.html" title="Bush Derangement Syndrome">Bush Derangement Syndrome</a> (BDS) with the article <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Krauthammer_0f21.html" title="Charles Krauthammer">Charles Krauthammer</a>. Otherwise, this is not in fact a neutral policy you're carrying out here, and instead an attempt to marginalize a liberal saying that is in fact used on multiple blogs around the Internet, while permitting a conservative saying to remain untouched.</p>
<p>I must also add that I find it odd and unnecessary to merge this subject at all, since it is rich with content and cites multiple examples of evidence of its use, and unlike other encyclopedias, Wikipedia does not have space limitations as such. Therefore, why does this need to be merged again?</p>

<p>I think it is absurd to merge this with Atrios, as the previous entry stated, it's an important subject that has numerous examples of Friedman himself and many other pundits and politicians using the "next 6 months are critical" phrase. It is a mainstay in the bloggosphere, used almost as often as MSM (Mainstream Media), LOL (laugh out loud), and IMO (in my opinion). It's an important Internet expression, and it's a phrase that politicans have used ad nauesum (with numerous examples listed on the Friedman Unit page).</p>

<li>Atrios is not the only person that's used the term "Friedman unit." If it should be merged anywhere, it should be merged into the Tom Friedman article. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidor_d74d.html" title="User:Vidor">Vidor</a> 01:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Friedman Unit is a key observation of the power that punditry has to manipulate, and its fragile transparency. It stopped being a neologism over six months ago. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamara_845a.html" title="User:Yamara">Yamara</a> 09:05, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It perfectly encapsulates a ridiculous and dangerous phenomenon in the media and in political decision-making. The examples on the wiki should be reason enough to keep the entry.</p>
<p>We are not talking about one person's pet redundant neologism (and even if we WERE, it should still be included in an individual wiki!) FU is a freestanding concept, and WIDELY invoked, and widely referred to, and concerns a critical aspect of war-planning, and therefore the health of nations. It is nonsensical to suggest a merge. If something is a free-standing concept, that appears constantly throughout the media, it's just pretentious and arrogant to suggest a merge (or in other cases, deletion.) Merging it provides no benefit to anybody whatsoever.</p>

<p>Use of the term "Friedman Unit" is a genuine phenomenon with its own history, about which a person may be interested without caring particularly to learn about Atrios. It no longer has much if anything to do with Atrios himself. Accordingly, merging it with the Atrios entry would be both inappropriate and confusing. It's really irrelevant whether one agrees or disagrees with the political sentiments expressed in using it, or whether the world would be a better or worse place for having an entry for this term.</p>
<p>This is not to say that I think the article could not be significantly improved; but my thoughts on that are not germane here. I will say this much: I suspect much of the discomfort with the article has to do not with the legitimacy of the entry itself, but with the way it has been written. In that case, anyone wishing to improve the entry is welcome to edit it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zinnyard (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zinnyard_2a26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zinnyard">contribs</a>) 20:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I had understood what Friedman Units were, and where they came from long before I ever found out that it was Atrios that had coined the term. The only reason to put anything about Friedman Units under Atrios would be to say something like "Also, he invented the Friedman Unit".</p>
<p>Might make sense to have a small line about it under Friedman, also, but Friedman Unit definitely deserves its own entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.32.154.249_77d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.32.154.249">209.32.154.249</a> (talk) 21:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>If someone is looking for Friedman units and doesn't know where to look, the logical place for them to start would be with the article on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Friedman_a48a.html" title="Tom Friedman">Tom Friedman</a>. But my preference is that because you might come upon the term in a variety of ways, the best way of handling it is to keep it a separate article. It is way too long to be a mere sidebar to the Atrios article - it has nearly 40 references of its own. This is quite different from a similar piece of political jargon from the right - <a href="../../../d/i/t/Dittohead.html" title="Dittohead">dittohead</a>, which has also been proposed to be merged - but in that case into a specific article just for <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon_of_The_Rush_Limbaugh_Show_7fa7.html" title="Jargon of The Rush Limbaugh Show">Jargon of The Rush Limbaugh Show</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to create a separate article for ALL <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a> jargon, then you could merge this article into that. Until then, keep it separate or merge with the Tom Friedman article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cy Guy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cy_Guy_93d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cy Guy">contribs</a>) 14:18, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I just arrived at the "Friedman Unit" page via a link from Crooks and Liars --- it makes no sense for me to go to some entry nested under Atrios, or even Tom Friedman... This is a global unit of measure, never before defined for general usage. It should have its own entry, with related link-to Tom Friedman. Has nothing to do with Atrios, even if he happened to be the first one who coined the term. That's meta data and only intelligible to "insiders" of the blogosohere. This word should be understandable completely outside of any context of "blogging" -- which is still not a tool of mainstream America. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Quicksite (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quicksite_2cb4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quicksite">contribs</a>) 22:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I've seen this term on dozens of blogs. It clearly has a meaning separate from both its author and its original subject. It belongs in its own entry. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroomkin_50dd.html" title="User:Froomkin">Froomkin</a> 22:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term "Friedman Unit" has obviously come into widespread usage. This debate seems to hinge on some obscure ideological ax-grinding.

<p>Something's not adding up. Why did the same person who "proposed" merger on FU add the lengthy section on it here, in a section called "Recurring Content," when in fact Duncan Black (Atrios) himself mentions the phrase at most a half-dozen times? This section is oddly out-of-place in a page about Duncan Black. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_Banks_b53d.html" title="User:Eugene Banks">Eugene Banks</a> 08:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you'd bothered to pay the slightest attention to the edit summaries at the time you'd see that this was part of a merge I carried out, which was later only partially reverted by its detractors. It's not my fault that the blogswarm who are defending the separation as part of a misguided attempt to use Wikipedia as a political platform aren't capable of properly undoing merges.</dd>
<dd>I'm also getting increasingly tired of being randomly accused of keeping sockpuppet accounts, or editing with a POV whenever I edit anything slightly controversial. Kindly refrain from ever doing that again unless you have firm evidence. It's this kind of idiocy (along with Wikipedia's broken governance model) which is seriously reducing my interest in contributing in future. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 11:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
