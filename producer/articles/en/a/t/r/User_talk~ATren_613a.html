<p>"Have you stopped beating your wife" is not a personal attack, but rather a common response to people who ask <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_question.html" title="Loaded question">loaded questions</a>. Based on your reactions to both this and the comment about ulterior motives, it would seem that you take offense at things more than is necessary, and I would advise some restraint against accusing people in the future. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would advise <i>you</i> to <b>link</b> the "beat" reference next time so there is no confusion; for someone who never heard of that reference, this could <b>only</b> be interpreted as a personal attack, and a link to the page explaining the reference would have eliminated any confusion. <i>If I were a suspicious person</i>, I <i>might</i> think you intentionally <i>didn't</i> link the reference, in order to bait me into over-reacting. But I am not a suspicious person so I didn't over-react, and I now consider the matter closed.</dd>
<dd>But let's not cloud the bigger issue here - you were the one who was asking for action against Fresheneesz. I found an instance of aggressive behavior on your part (I'll stop using the "v" word, even though it absolutely was) that inflamed the situation, and I pointed it out. I think you are the one who is taking undue offense to what I am saying. I would therefore similarly advise <i>you</i> show some restraint in the future. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 14:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism."</i> Says so almost at the top of the page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Deleting the comments of other users from Talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism."</i> This seems pretty clear cut. Note, I'm not calling you a vandal (I've said that before) but I do believe you stepped over the line in this case. I also believe you've been overzealous with the guideline tag on Notability and DDV - at least six other editors reverted your changes on DDV but you still claimed there was consensus. But all that is up to the arbitrators to decide, I'm just presenting evidence. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 14:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, you're presenting conjecture. You're assuming that I used DDV as a justification, whereas in fact I was only pointing you to some additional reading material (hence my words "see also", as opposed to "and this was based upon such-and-such policy"). Also, you're giving a one-sided view of the situation by only mentioning the six editors who opposed me on DDV, and omitting the twelve that supported me. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You cited DDV while claiming that removing a poll was justified. That, to me, implied that DDV justified the poll blanking (at least partially). But that's for the arbitrator to decide.</dd>
<dd>When I refer to the six editors who opposed, I'm talking about those who reverted your change to "guidline" or removal of "disputed". There were one or two other editors who reverted to "guideline" <i>in the very beginning</i>, but they didn't edit-war the tag. You persisted in reverting at least six other editors in re-applying "guideline" and/or removing "disputed". Aside from the edit warring with six other editors, there is the question of consensus - clearly, consensus had not been gained if <i>six</i> others were reverting you. Again, the arbitration committee is the ultimate judge on these issues. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 14:38, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what you're saying, basically, is that instead of offering evidence, you are offering your own assumptions on what happened, in the hope that the arbiters agree with them. By definition, an assumption is not evidence. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't we just let the arbitration committee decide? <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 14:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please stop imputing motives to me and making accusations of bad faith. Frankly it looks like you are trolling on the RfA page. I really don't want this to descend into the gutter. I'm going to give you fair warning that if you continue in this vein I will add your actions to the RfAr, and invite the arbitors to take a look at your civility and 'helpfulness' to this case. By all means contribute, but let's all assume good faith and stick to the issues.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 01:38, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm a little disappointed in the direction of this arbitration, but not entirely surprised. Wikipedia is, in my mind, hopelessly <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligarchy.html" title="Oligarchy">oligarchical</a>: admins and arbiters act as the ruling class, and very seldom rule against each other in support of an outsider. And once you get on the bad side of one admin, you are pretty much guaranteed to be at odds with all of them. I admire Fresheneesz's spirit in trying to break this oligarchy (or "cabal", as some like to call it) and for a time I was hopeful that maybe he could do it... but I'm not at all surprised at the result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is why my focus on Wikipedia has always been to protect, not to enhance. I originally got involved because of a single dispute in which a <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">single editor</a> on a <a href="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" class="external text" title="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" rel="nofollow">crusade</a> was trying to use Wikipedia to advance his political agenda (see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_Avidor_e31e.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor">this</a>) and I figured it would be easy enough to convince the powers-that-be that his agenda had little to do with fact. But he got an admin on his side (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a>, who was a fan of this guy's <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadkill_Bill_93cb.html" title="Roadkill Bill">cartoon work</a>) and the battle turned out to be an all out war. It didn't matter that my side of the argument was supported by 3 other reasonable editors (including <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a>) and based in verifiable fact - JzG accused us all of being POV pushers and essentially <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">took ownership</a> of the article, pushing it to an unjustified level of skepticism that was just a notch less extreme than the crusading editor's version. He justified his version in part using notability arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After <i>months</i> of fighting, we finally got it to a more balanced, verifiable state. It was after this debacle that Fresheneesz moved on to Non-notability in an effort to prevent this kind of abuse of notability in the future. He took the idealistic approach: he was going to try to change Wikipedia to prevent editors from using notability to push a POV. The rest of us were not so idealistic: I largely gave up on Wikipedia, choosing to just linger and protect some pages from abuse; <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> also largely gave up on Wikipedia; <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> continues to edit, but with a detectably cynical approach. These are four reasonable editors who were so disgusted by this debate that they reacted in extreme ways: two abandoning the project entirely and one spending all his efforts to fix the notability mess (and getting repremanded for his efforts). For JzG's part, he still continues to mis-represent that debate, even in this arbitration where he accuses Fresheneesz of pursuing non-notability just because his article was deleted (an extreme mis-characterization of what really happened over there - but other admins believe him implicitly because he's on the inside).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, basically, this arbitration is nothing short of what I'd expect from the Wikipedia cabal: a decision in support of its admins and admonishing an upstart who has the gall to question authority. For me, it only confirms the exact reasons why I've largely abandoned the project in the first place. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 07:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article is, of course, pretty much as I left it, what I did was simply to remove the egregious puffery added by fans of this hypothetical transportation mode and the <i>months</i> of fighting were over tiny details, largely related to precisely how many times a particular fan of PRT should be quoted, how to represent the arm-waving hypothetical cost calculations advanced by proponents, and what to do about the profound lack of sources other than proponents. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, after all, and I cited policy and guidelines at every turn and and as I pointed out numerous times if you thought that my interpretation of policy was at fault then you were at all times free to start an RfC.

<dd>I'm glad the insiders can have a good hearty laugh at the inherent corruption of Wikipedia. But you miss my point in all of this: I don't care! I know how it works now, I know about the cabal, and I know how to defend against future POV attacks like the one you and Avidor tried on the PRT article. That's all I care about. I do feel a little bad for Fresheneesz, an idealist who thought he could change things and was spanked for his audacity. But I think he's learned his lesson by now: <i>don't challenge the authority of the oligarchy</i>.</dd>
<dd>For me, my only concern was defending the PRT article against Avidorization by you, and I did that. My work here is basically done.</dd>

<dd>I won't go the RFAr route at this point; for one thing, most of the evidence in the dispute is old (from March and April).

<dd>Whats his^ deal? As for the arbitration, I think Tom harrison may be right - dispute resolution first. I dunno if that killed the arbitration I had, but it seems like the arbitration didn't really think very hard about the case. After their apparent lack of consideration - I'm not so sure I trust the arbcom to make decisions that make sense. It really seems to me like some people have forgotten about the "Wikipedia is not a beauracracy" part of WP:NOT. People that focus on making policy aren't the people focused on building wikipedia - and its hurting us. Neither policy nor that arbitration is based on consensus at all at this point - I had thought I had a decent amount of support.. but apparently the comittee didn't think so. I think I'm going to avoid jerkasses like JzG and Radiant as much as possible for now on - most of the stuff I edit has absolutely no verifiability (or "notability") problems anyway. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 10:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

It's hard to bury the hatchet, especially if one or more of the persons involved are hot tempered and quick to use some words - and other is more than sensitive to them - but with good faith, lots of problems can be patched. In the end, most of us share the same goal here. Unfortunatly there are times when no amount of good faith can help - but there are very few, in my career - almost three years here - I have found three at most, so it's not so bad (if you have a stomach, check <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Piotrus_0efc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Piotrus">the newest oneI am involved in...</a>).

<dd>It could if I were responding through <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> and decided you were the primary aggressor. That's my particular practice and not necesarily what another admin would do. What generally happens is I'll see a complaint at a noticeboard and if a warning has been removed then <i>so-and-so removed warnings</i> comes into the discussion. Until I actually investigate in detail it's a tossup whether the warning was issued appropriately and the deletion formed part of a pattern of rejecting feedback or whether the warning itself was frivolous. So sometimes I'll explain why the warning was earned and sometimes I'll delete it myself. Usually that buries the particular bone of contention. I might not be the best person to intervene in your case because this warning is related to a noticeboard thread where I was heavily involved. Yet I'll offer constructive advice to the extent that time allows.

<dd>Thank you again for responding. BTW, I always take <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> seriously, as you do. It appears we are in the minority. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 03:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really much sorry if my use of the word "nerd" irritated you. I confess that I did not realize this term could constitute personal attacks and the use of it is incivil. Please forgive me if I really did any personal attacks in your eyes - and observe the fact that I am also a contributor to the article, so if I was doing any personal attacks I was actually stabbing myself. Waiting for you reply at my talk page. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan">Der</a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan">yck C.</a> 15:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your kind reply ^^. In the past I just thought smileys are not widely accepted on wiki discussions, so I seldom used it. Moreover, next time try not spilling out guideline links when you encounter a conflict: referring another user to WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL implies you've defined him or her incivil and personal-attacking. Doing so could usually aggravate conflicts instead of defusing them. It would be much better if you said "May I suggest you to refrain from calling other editors 'nerds' as it is strongly derogatory" in the first place, suggesting that you're pointing the issue against the word "nerds" and not the my being incivil and personal-attacking. Much thanks that you really replied! --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan">Der</a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan">yck C.</a> 07:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, do feel free to warn users who vandalise pages in future. You will find a table of appropriate warnings at <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a>. If a user has continued to vandalise after receiving a level 4 warning, you should report them to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, which ensures that an available admin will block them as soon as possible. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a> 01:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
