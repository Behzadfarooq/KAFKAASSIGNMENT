<p>This article seems very informative but their information is a little bit off. Most people think "Fractures In Your Porcelain Fasade" was their first album when really it was "Suicide Notes And Butterfly Kisses." Also, does anyone know anything about their new cd? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:32, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your facts are off. "Fractures..." came before "Suicide Notes...", but neither was their first album. Their first album was entitled "Visions", and was released in 1999. -- <b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_5b0b.html" title="User:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#348017">Boa</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User_talk%7EBoadrummer_83eb.html" title="User talk:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#C85A17">Drummer</span></a></font></b> 09:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some information on the main page is wrong, I believe.</p>
<p>I recall watching Fuse a long while back, and Atreyu was the special guest on Daily Download. While talking with the show hosts, Alex verified that the band name was in fact taken from a character in "The Neverending Story". Something about it meaning never giving up and fighting for what's right, much like the character himself. Just wanted to point that out.</p>
<p>Yes I saw that too. I thought it was wrong on the page but did not say anything because they might of changed it recently. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:20, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Atreyu is a metalcore band trying to be a metal band for teenage girls.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So change it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Somebody has decided to stick 'nu-metal' and 'fashioncore' throughout the last few paragraphs. Im guessing it was someone who doesn't like the band, their newest album, or both. They are clearly not nu-metal, so im removing that word.</p>
<p>Fine by me. I never really understood the meaning of 'nu metal' anyways. What is nu metal? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 16:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>who put screamo back on there, along with post-hardcore . . .&#160;?</p>
<p>Atreyu is a metalcore band. They have been since they started out and still are considered a metal band. <a href="../../../x/x/n/User%7EXxNo.One.RunsxX_d3ad.html" title="User:XxNo.One.RunsxX">XxNo.One.RunsxX</a> 14:57, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they're a metalcore band, how the hell can they be a metal band? Those genres are quite mutually exclusive. 81.240.165.161 18:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I feel that they should be labeled as a modern rock band. There is nothing "metal" about their sound, however they do have a lot of the post-hardcore elements in there. Post and Core does not equal metal. 4.159.167.189 18:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no rock in their sound so metalcore is quite good but they aren't a metal band. Say that they are a metal or a modern rock band is the same thing to say that Linkin Park is a Gangsta Rap outfit.</dd>

<p>Am I the only one who realizes this song is a complete rip-off of the song "The Hive" by In Flames? The opening riff is almost exactly the same, and In Flames' song was released in '97, so I think we're looking at a rip-off. So don't delete it, it's important.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say it is a rip-off but maybe totally based on "The Hive", yes. But their are minor differences in the riff. But it does seem to be based and influenced by that song. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the band, but is the commonalities honestly needed? Yes. If you notice the resemblance, then it needs to be put in the Wikipedia article.</p>

<p>Many bands have songs that sound like copies of other songs in their reportoire, and people need to know these guys ripped off In Flames, the true-metal geniuses from Sweden.</p>
<p>The true-metal geniuses are extremely skilled musicians, and you have every right to throw your opinion onto an encyclopedia, since everyone agrees with you on every point anyway. There are NO differences in the riff, and the entire song is just that riff, so it really is a true rip-off...</p>
<p><br />
i wouldn't say it's a rip-off...so what if they stole the riff?..i mean listen to the lyrics of the song..it's awsome! there so many bands who take other band's songs..for example..half of Marilyn Manson's songs aren't written by him..they've been done by someone else before..not to mention,Marilyn Manson is awsome!..but Atreyu is still AWSOMEER!...what's really funny is the lyrics of the song got someone hardcore, and he said it makes me wanna have hardcore sex..don't ask me why,but he just said it.</p>

<p>Its kind of hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of my head (lol)... I put into the genre box that they are metalcore (in place of Screamo) as they clearly define themselves as a rock band that plays Metallic Hardcore, and they have goth tinged melodies and lyrics, no matter how bad fans or detractors of goth say. Screamo is a term standing for "screaming emotional punk" and it seems to be dominated today more by pop-punk artists who seem more into "making it for the man". Metalcore retains an underground attitude, but I understand in the double standard of the fact that Atreyu are now quickly becoming arena rock stars. I added a critics quote concerning their acoustic arrangement that cites them as a goth-tinged metal-hardcore group. Thank you. --Chris Cole, (not logged in).</p>
<p>I agree. I took Screamo off again. Leave it off. They're clearly bears. You people need to learn what Screamo really is, but I guess you cannot listen to music if the band doesn't have T-Shirts at Hot Topic.-MC John</p>

<p>Why are there mentions of certain facts but so little elaboration? It is written that Atreyu played repeatedly in the Southern California music scene but not where. There is very little biographical information yet so much time has been dedicated to organizing the discography that an imbalance has been generated between promotional and factual information.</p>

<p>Atreyu is not an emo-core band so who ever put it under there gener is dead wrong. so I am removing Emotional core from their gener. Atreyu is a straight up METALCORE band, and they are not trying to be a Metal band just for Teenage girls because their not gay.If anything they they are a metalcore band but also play screamo. so I will be removing Emocore from their gener and adding Screamo and I Sugjest that you all please leave it as I put it, because Im right about this. TRUST ME and will the guy who said "<i>Italic text</i>Atreyu is trying to be a metal band for teenage girls" please tell me where you got your info from.</p>

<p>Hah! Sugjest! That made my day!</p>

<p>I'm sure they are. Now obviously you suck the corperate cock and have no idea what Screamo is. Listen to Pg.99, Circle Takes The Square, Majority Rule, etc for actual Screamo</p>

<p>Another genre argument. They're everywhere. And Atreyu is trying to "be a band for teenage girls" because of their lyrics. Very, very pretty-boy like. If that's what makes them cool, then go for it.</p>
<p>They shouldn't change their image and their lyrics to suit girls. Even if their scene chicks or suicide girls, they should be themselves or else fans would not listen to them becuase they changed their image</p>

<p>I don't understand the point of the redirect page. If you've got the disambig link at the top of the page, there's no need to redirect from Atreyu to Atreyu (band). -<a href="../../../w/l/m/User%7EWlmaltby3_7843.html" title="User:Wlmaltby3">Wlmaltby3</a> 08:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's been three days; no one objected or commented on the redirect so I moved the article back to its original place.

<p>There's an entire section missing from this article. I know this, because I wrote the missing section some months ago.

If someone would be so kind as to fix this problem, that would be fantastic.

<p>A semi-new band from Orange Country, California. Their music from the newest album really reminds me of oldschool Metallica. They have a very unique sound that few bands seem to obtain which combines 3 genre's together consisting of hardcore,emo,and metal. Made up of Alex Varkatzas, Brandon Saller, Dan Jacobs, and Marc McKnight. Currently signed to Victory records, they have two released EP's(Visions, and Fractures in the Facade of your Porcelain Beauty), and three full-length albums(Suicide Notes &amp; Butterfly Kisses, The Curse, A Deathgrip on Yesterday). This is one of the few bands that are good enough to make me headbang like they do, while keeping a good set of singing mixed with awesome drum and guitar play. I suggest this band to anyone into metal/hardcore. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gotron (<a href="../../../g/o/t/User_talk%7EGotron_157f.html" title="User talk:Gotron">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gotron_40c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gotron">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<ul>
<li>anyone have a good theory (or better yet an answer) as to why brandon saller is using 3 bass drums in the Ex's and Oh's video? i dont think i even saw him touch the third one but it was definantly there</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So you he can pretend he's a good drummer. We all know he sucks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, when I saw them at the Taste of Chaos in Cleveland, he had three bass drums. I'd guess that he uses the third bass drums for some songs but not in Ex's and Oh's, and used his standard setup for the video. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKravitch_786a.html" title="User:Kravitch">Kravitch</a> 01:39, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I TOTALLY DISAGREE!!! Brandon Saller a freaken bad ass drummer, he's playing the drums while he's freaking singing, Why he didn't use the third bass drum i don't know but he's a bad ass drummer!!!! You should burn in hell for the comment you left Kravitch</li>
</ul>
<p>Brandon IS NOT a crap drummer!!! whoeva said he sucks well u suck S**t and have hearing problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a drummer myself, I know it's impossible to actually use the three bass drums in the way he has his kit set up. He has his floor toms right in front of where the pedal would be. My theory (a joking theory... :)) was that it was because their rival band, Avenged Sevenfold's drummer recently upgraded to two bass drums. But I doubt it's true. The third drum is in fact simply for show. --<b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoadrummer_5b0b.html" title="User:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#348017">Boa</span></a><a href="../../../b/o/a/User_talk%7EBoadrummer_83eb.html" title="User talk:Boadrummer"><span style="color:#C85A17">Drummer</span></a></font></b> 09:40, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A four-piece from Melbourne and originally called Atreyu (name change due to a Californian metal band), Shoot The Genie are Kristy on lead vocals and guitar; Claire on bass and vocals; Melissa on the drums and 'newbie' Daniel on guitar. They released the Fabulous Secrets Revealed cd (under the Atreyu name) in 2001.</p>

<p>As I'm not a follower of the band, I don't feel that I'm the one that should do it, but a LOT of that stuff about FFTL in the first section needs to be restructured, or gone completely. Are their feuds with other bands etc really necessary? It looks rather biased and/or catty, with all of the statements that are being released and consequently, posted here.

<p>Wow, I read a review about their "Greatest Hits" album recently and stated they eventually moved on to Hollywood Records. At first, I thought it was a joke but now looking on their site, they really did sign on to Hollywood Records. I really think this is a bad move on their part. I really don't know what to expect now. I know their contract with Victory was finished after the Hits album but what made them sign to Hollywood? <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurik_eab1.html" title="User:Furik">Jordan Cable</a> 17:53, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</p>
<p>If u think bout it though Hollywood is a major record company so they are probably getting more money and stuff. I think it doesnt matter what label they are on cuz Atreyu is Atreyu but as long as they dont turn soft (which is neva gunna happen) it doesnt matter. Atreyu is not gunna let a record company change the band and what they play so honestly it is probably better for them and it might be better for fans. <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirsten.html" title="Kirsten">kirsten</a> 13:28, 11 February 2007.</p>

<p>I know everyone likes to think their favorite bands are the image of perfection and undeserving of scorn, but why were the criticisms deleted? When a politician takes open shots at another politician, the quotations pop up on Wikipedia articles seconds after the words are uttered. Atreyu creates enough of a stir with an interview to provoke responses from the music community, and this ceases to be notable.. why? It had been sourced with an external link, so it wasn't an invention of an Atreyu detractor.</p>

<p>Can we get the Neverending Story Reference checked? The reasoning for the band's name has changed various times during the existance of this article, and has gone back and forth on the Neverending Story reference. Sometimes the article says a friend suggested the name (which may have been in reference to the movie) and sometimes the article says that they simply named themself after the character from the Neverending Story. If the former case is true, then credit should be given to the friend (and have a note making reference to the Neverending Story), otherwise if the latter is true we can just keep the article as is. I simply think we should double check the facts on this one...again. 202.216.122.215</p>
