<p>I've redirected the article for <b>Patent foramen ovale</b> to this page. At the time, I deleted the following text, because I believe it is untrue:</p>
<dl>
<dd>PFO can cause decompression sickness in divers because a proportion of venous blood carrying inert gases, such as helium or nitrogen does not pass through the lungs. The only way to release the excess inert gases from the body is to pass the blood carrying the inert gases through the lungs to be exhaled. If that inert gas-laden blood passes through the PFO, it avoids the lungs and the inert gas is more likely to form large bubbles in the arterial blood stream causing decompression sickness.</dd>

<p>If it is true, someone please re-add it with appropriate links or references. <a href="../../../k/s/h/User%7EKsheka_e2cf.html" title="User:Ksheka">Ksheka</a> 16:01, May 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the references. Part of the problem is "Why PFO?" The answer, from what I gather is that it's not just PFO. <b>Any ASD can cause this.</b> It's just that PFOs are either more common that secundum ASDs, or their more likely to be underdiagnosed until the individual develops decompression sickness. (I'm not sure which.) <a href="../../../k/s/h/User%7EKsheka_e2cf.html" title="User:Ksheka">Ksheka</a> 10:22, May 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have both a PFO and an atrial septal aneurysm. My doctor told me that PFO is very common: occuring in 20% of the population. So I can't see how this text could be true? -- "As a group, atrial septal defects occur in 1 child per 1500 live births." please reference. -- <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.195.36.86.html" title="User:69.195.36.86">69.195.36.86</a> 16:50, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are different statistics about different disorders. Atrial septum <i>aneurysm</i> is not an ASD nor a PFO. As for ASD, this is more symptomatic than a PFO, which may be clinically occult (and hence not included in the 1:1500 figure, because they are not being investigated) and often requires no management if the patient is otherwise well.</dd>

<dd>Note the article for PFO was merged into this one. If we're comparing apples-to-oranges the article should be clarified. Here is a study: in it are 50 control subjects; 18% had PFO, 8% had atrial septal aneurysm <a href="http://www.ccjm.org/pdffiles/Jabermin1101.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccjm.org/pdffiles/Jabermin1101.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. so i still don't know what the figure 1:1500 means.. perhaps this was only easily-detected defects? -- <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.195.36.86.html" title="User:69.195.36.86">69.195.36.86</a> 18:25, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I was suggesting. There is no point in trying to detect something if the person with that abnormality is well, and there is no need for intervention. If doctors were to screen the whole population for all sorts of diseases, a lot of <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_I_and_type_II_errors_c67e.html" title="Type I and type II errors">false positives</a> would occur, leading to unnecessary and dangerous interventions. If there has been a consequence (e.g. stroke or migraine), then screening for the cause would reveal the ASD/PFO/atrial aneurysm as a cause (warranting treatment).</dd>

<dd>The author of this section has not responded, so I will expand: <i>A less invasive protocol</i>; less invasive than what? <i>pioneered in recent years</i> probably means that it's just one group of investigators who uses this technique. <i>Some observers believe the protocol is on the way to becoming the Gold Standard</i>: some believe, is on the way, that comes down to that most don't trust this technique at all <b>yet</b>. <i>At least one clinical study</i>; which publication? <i>100% accurate</i>; what is the gold standard?

<p>This was covered by a recent review in the NEJM, which mentioned TCD. Frankly it sounds frightening.

<p>Ekko, you are suggesting we should screen the whole word for PFO. That is not what I said. The NEJM review (which I know well because I discussed it at the hospital <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_club.html" title="Journal club">journal club</a>) is about cryptogenic stroke. If a young patient has a stroke with no apparent cause, PFO is overrepresented when compared to controls. That suggests a causative role or common cause. If you're worried about GUCHies, there should be a funding increase! <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 23:53, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ooops! Sorry that my reply came out in a way that seemed aimed at you. It was not. My point was ment to be something like this: rather than a lenghty discussion about small differences in diagnostic tools the "educated layperson" reading wikipedia would probably be better off if we introduced the concept that a PFO is not <i>necessarily</i> something that should be looked for and closed. (I'm aware that there is indications like stroke, migraine and decompression sickness). --<a href="../../../e/k/k/User%7EEkko_b863.html" title="User:Ekko">Ekko</a> 12:01, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A pronosis section is gravely needed that sheds light on the very comforting reality that many children with ASD's undergo "Spontaneous Closure" of their interatrial septal lesion. One of the main predictors that a child's ASD may "Close" spontaneously is the significance of the child's shunt and age at initial presentation. A child initially presenting with a moderate sized secundum type ASD (6mm - 8mm), with little to no "Left to Right" shunting, may have a very good chance that the lesion will close on its own without the need for surgical intervention. This of course is not always the case, however, there is a marked trend in this scenario that should not be overlooked. With the exponential growth of the heart in young patients with ASD, there is some data to suggest that even in the presence of a clinically significant shunt, this still may not lower the odds of the child undergoing spontaneous closure of their ASD.</p>
<p><b>OF NOTE:</b> As the heart muscle develops, significant changes within the heart occur that cannot be adequately documented as these changes very from individual to individual. Further, the relavancy and frequency of these changes is difficult to analyze let alone assess (One would need a means of permanently monitoring the heart 24/7/365 with technology not currently available. This device would need to visualize the heart's internal growth over time and constantly. This to consisently mark internal (Literally constant supervision of the four chambers of the heart and components) physical evolution of a given heart's development and provide a means of measuring and logging hemodynamic characteristics over time. Yes this is science fiction, but a device like this could lead to a significantly better understanding of the heart, disease prevention, and the efficiency and effectiveness in the overall treatment of heart disease). So a 99.9% accurate prediction of whether a given ASD will undergo spontaneous closure is not currently possible.</p>
<p>What's most reassuring is the existance of trends related to spontaneous closure in ASD. These trends have historically proven to be relatively consistent markers in the likelyhood a child's ASD will in fact undergo spontaneous closure. There are exceptions to these trends so keep in mind that even if your child has a LARGE ASD (&gt;9mm), this does not necessarily rule out spontaneous closure in any way. Alternatively, a small ASD, while statistically more likely to close spontaneously, may also fail to close without surgical intervention.</p>
<p>So far, shunt significance, lesion size, and age combined, at initial presentation of ASD diagnosis seems to be an even more significant and consistent predictive factor in spontaneous closure of ASD's than lesion size (Though a large ASD will typically be associated with a significant shunt) alone.</p>
<p><br />
I will be glad to write more on this section and take this for action.</p>
<p>I have many solid medical references that I have acquired stating rate of incidence of spontaneous closure in secundum type ASD, age to rate of spontaneous closure incidence, lesion size at presentation to spontaneous closure incidence and various other relevant data. I will be adding this section hopefully shortly.</p>
<p>It's grossly irresponsible to cite this disease and not have a prognosis section. Prognosis does lend itself more to subjectivity, I know WIKIPEDIAns always strive for objectivity and completeness. No matter, a fact based study of rate of spontaneous closure for various ASD's from various credible references should be added to this article in my opinion. ASD in this article is portrayed for it's potentially devastating effects and not the more common scenario that many ASD's either close completely spontaneously or become Patent Foramen Ovale's.</p>
<p>Is it not unheard to hear of a person living into their 80's with an ASD. While this is anecdotal information, I have spoken with a very well known cardiac molecular biologist (Dr. Paul Grossfeld) who has stated this is actually quite common. At which point an ederly patient is actually referred to a pediatric cardiologist for treatment considerations. The typical scenario tends to be a person of advanced age suffering from congestive heart failure. Upon further investigation, an ASD the size of a "Golf Ball" is sometimes found and of course is the underlying origin for the CHF. An ASD CAN be a very serious condition and it can also be benign, I believe this should be illustrated more clearly in this article. Again, be it anecdotal, Dr. Grossfeld mentioned a few cases of olympic atheletes with ASD's. It should be noted to clearly, objectively, and agressively observe an ASD in children. However, surgical intervention, be it transthoracic or minimally invasive transcatheterization is often NOT required and this should be more clearly conveyed to the public.</p>
<p>A study of progressive Hemodynamic ASD clinical signifigance, at age of presentation over a (3) to (5) year period in children is another likely factor in determining the liklihood of spontaneous closure of ASD. These sorts of topics should be relevantly and suffciently covered in this section. ItalianDeception 10:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
