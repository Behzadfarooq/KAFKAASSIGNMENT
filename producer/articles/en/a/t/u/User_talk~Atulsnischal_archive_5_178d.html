<p>+++++MY COMMENTS++++</p>
<p>Dear user Rajib, please don't vandalize the articles I have worked on, instead of improving the articles you are just deleting the "reference list" for the article, this has gone on for couple of articles, you are systematically following the articles I worked on and vadalizing them, I will shortly be reporting you to wikipedia Administartors. Consider this a Warning!!!!. If you want to improve an article you dont take out its reference list. You could have contributed to <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife_of_Bangladesh_72d7.html" title="Wildlife of Bangladesh">Wildlife of Bangladesh</a>, I even asked for help on your page, but the article remains at square one after so long while you have had lot of time arguing with me and vandalizing my other articles. Please do not remove this comment from your page, let other be warned too of your great credibility and coopretaion.</p>

CAn somebody please talk to <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a>, one argument that started with him on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal_monitor.html" title="Bengal monitor">Bengal monitor</a> page has led to an ongoing onslaught on the articles I have worked on, instead of improving them, he is been removing Reference list from my articles, following the idea from another user <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a>, can you please talk to both.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion</span></h3>
<p>Hi Atul, The nathistory-india page may be revived. It would perhaps not have gone to afd if you spent some time on writing carefully. Would suggest that some time is spent on reading and studying the structure of featured articles. You will note for instance that the captions on most of these articles are short and precise. The body text should also be in the encyclopaedic style. Advocacy is not to be included (for instance a statement like "We should save this species" would almost invite an afd to your doorstep). Cite the best references, place material in context and do not add too many or irrelevant external links or see alsos. That should take you a long way. cheers. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 01:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Shyamal, I have a few things to say too</p>
<p>They started the deletion process because they said, <b>IT IS A NON-NOTABLE List</b>, which is of course not true at all as you and I both know.</p>
<p>Also People of all skill levels are welcome to edit and contribute to Wikipedia and such, it was basically an article that had the correct vision, but needed editing help, you know what I mean, a technical writer's touch.</p>
<p>This list itself is a new media thing and people have to still wakeup to such networking platforms like these and appreciate their contribution to society, unfortunately journalists have not yet realized the potential to do features on lists from time to time which would have been really very handy to quote. The paucity of Newspaper articles about the list was also the main issue as it could have established the notability in a second. There are several Wildlife and Conservation Journalists on the list though, just have not woken up to a new living and breathing thing.</p>
<p>Also 95% of the writers out there are not scientific writers, or technical writers, assistants usually take care of these little things for them.</p>
<p>And as far as contributions on Wikipedia go, people are supposed to help edit and rewrite articles here to improve their quality, correct spellings of others, punctuations, rearrange facts and paragraphs to provide a better flow, provide proper sources, ............ who ever gave you the idea the that the contributor who started the page / article needs to finish it. Over the years hundreds or thousands of people should help improve an article and update it from time to time and NOT put it up for deletion on the third day, this kind of behavior discredits Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p>Since I did lot of research on Asiatic Lion hence I noticed another short coming of purely scientific or technical writing, you guys do not hesitate at all to quote an article even though the article may have all nonsense in it, Asiatic Cheetah Diet is still quoted from a bad source with nonsense in it, the National Geographic article from 2000 on Asiatic Lions has nonsense that Asiatic Lions are highly inbred, but technical writers dont hesitate quoting such reputable sources and present it as gods own truth.</p>
<p>Now lets come to our project "Protected Areas of India" or Zoos, you guys are so busy technically writing and correctly quoting that you forget that basics like, how much is the ticket, how to reach, closest railway or airport, what is the best season to visit, what are the accommodations offered, are guides and rides / cars available, who are the contacts etc., any special clothing suggested (Snakes, mosquitos), etc. etc. are also import information that should be included and will be useful to the reader, there is ofcourse no need for us to sell a holiday package to them but a little reader oriented info would be definitely useful to include in an Encyclopedia. A little bit of thinking outside the box is needed for techies.......</p>
<p>I have already told you guys that I really appreciate your efforts, so don't think otherwise. I have even made an effort to tell India about it, here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0702&amp;L=nathistory-india&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=14871" class="external free" title="https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0702&amp;L=nathistory-india&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=14871" rel="nofollow">https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0702&amp;L=nathistory-india&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=14871</a></p>
<p>Thanks for your help though.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if my intent has been misread. I would like you to positively contribute but make some changes only in writing style.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regarding notability, there is a problem and it is recognized as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Systemic bias</a>. India in spite of so called advances in information technology is still caught in a folk culture and does not believe in putting information in writing. There is a comfort in oral tradition and now substituted in a visual tradition by lazily taking photographs with low information/volume ratio.</p>
<p>Regarding Cheetah diet, please make the needed changes. Not everybody is an expert on Cheetahs, so please add but cite published information. I am sure your own research papers may be worth citing.</p>
<p>Regarding lion inbreeding: as a person who has studied enough of population genetics formally, I can tell you that both the American view and the Indian study need to be placed in context to the reader. Real world science is not as objective as you might think although the philosophy aims to make it so. A low genetic diversity can be caused either by a historical population bottleneck or inbreeding. The data is clearly the same, but the interpretation is different. The American study claims that this spells disaster. The Indian study claims that this is the same level of low diversity as those of tigers and if one considered tigers to be in a better position then so are the lions. Hope my point is clear.</p>
<p>Regarding making wikipedia articles on locations into tourist guides - there are again some guidelines and one of them is that we keep material more on the subject and not include things like "how to" - but there are places for it [www.wikitravel.org wikitravel].</p>
<p>Further please note that there is no club here, we work as individuals. So I am not sure who the <i>you guys</i> refers to. No offence taken however. More than appreciation, I hope you can contribute usefully by focusing on the subjects. best wishes <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 07:29, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding articles to See Also section</span></h2>
<p>Dear Atul, I noticed that you have added a lot of internal wikilinks at various articles under the "See also" sections. Please note that you need not add every internal link to that section. Terms and topics mentioned and linked inline should not be duplicated there. Also, unrelated links should not be added. I have removed the duplicated wikilinks from these articles.</p>
<p>The same applies to external links ... you should not bunch together a huge number of tangentially related external links to every article.</p>
<p>Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, calling edits that adhere to policy, as vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karan_Singh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115266094" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karan_Singh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115266094" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a bad habit.

<p><br />
You seem to be complaining about my editing of articles you have edited. Well, I have found your (possible) misunderstanding of internal and external linking, overlinking, in most of the articles you have edited. Hence, I have gone through these edits and fixed them. Please take the advice I gave above against adding redundant links. Feel free to contact me if you need any further clarification. Thank you. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 07:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
