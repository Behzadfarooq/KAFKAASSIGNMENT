<p>Prisoners made numerous <b>attempts to escape <a href="../../../o/f/l/Oflag_IV-C_9ac3.html" title="Oflag IV-C">Oflag IV-C</a></b>, one of the most famous <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Army_5d6b.html" title="German Army">German Army</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner-of-war_camp.html" title="Prisoner-of-war camp">prisoner-of-war camps</a> for <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer.html" title="Officer">officers</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Army_5d6b.html" title="German Army">German Army</a> made Colditz a <i>Sonderlager</i> (high-security <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_camp.html" title="Prison camp">prison camp</a>), the only one of its type within Germany. Field Marshal <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring_6dc0.html" title="Hermann Göring">Hermann Göring</a> even declared Colditz "escape-proof". This was in part because of its lack of escapes during its term as prison camp in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, but mostly due to it being the only German <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner-of-war.html" title="Prisoner-of-war">prisoner-of-war</a> camp with more guards than prisoners.

<p>Prisoners contrived a number of methods to escape. They duplicated keys to various doors, made copies of maps, forged <i>Ausweise</i> (<a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_document.html" title="Identity document">identity papers</a>), and manufactured their own tools. <a href="../../../m/i/9/MI9_fc03.html" title="MI9">MI9</a>, a department of the British <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Office_e75c.html" title="War Office">War Office</a> which specialized in escape equipment, communicated with the prisoners in <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">code</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggled</a> them new escape aids disguised in care packages from family or from non-existent charities, although they never tampered with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> care packages for fear it would force the Germans to stop their delivery to all camps. The Germans became skilled at intercepting packages containing contraband material.</p>
<p>There was also a form of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_market.html" title="Black market">black market</a> whereby the prisoners used items from their Red Cross parcels to buy information and tools from the cooperative guards and townsfolk. Since the Germans allowed Douglas Bader to visit the town, he took <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> and other luxuries with him for trading. Flight Lieutenant Cenek Chaloupka traded goods for information and even had a girlfriend in the town. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Stirling_7946.html" title="David Stirling">David Stirling</a> later took control of the black market operations.</p>
<p>There was only one fatality during the escape attempts: British Lieutenant <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sinclair_%28soldier%29_7c5a.html" title="Michael Sinclair (soldier)">Michael Sinclair</a> in September 1944. The Germans buried him in Colditz cemetery with full military honours — his casket was draped with a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jack</a> flag made by the German guards, and he received a seven-gun salute. Post-war he was awarded the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, the only man to receive it for escaping during WWII.

<p>Most of the escape attempts failed. Pat Reid, who later wrote about his experiences in Colditz, failed to escape at first and then became an "Escape Officer", charged with coordinating the various national groups so they would not ruin each other's escape attempts. Escape Officers were generally not themselves permitted to escape. Many tried unsuccessfully to escape in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disguise.html" title="Disguise">disguise</a>: <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airey_Neave_c3ec.html" title="Airey Neave">Airey Neave</a> twice dressed as a guard, French Lieutenant Boulé disguised in <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drag_%28clothing%29.html" title="Drag (clothing)">drag</a>, British Lieutenant <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sinclair_%28British_Army_officer%29_7cc6.html" title="Michael Sinclair (British Army officer)">Michael Sinclair</a> even dressed as camp Kommandant Rothenberger, when he tried to organize a mass escape, and French Lieutenant Perodeau disguised as regular camp electrician Willi Pöhnert ("Little Willi"):</p>

<p>On the night of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, one of the French officers deliberately blew out the fuse on the lights in the courtyard. As they had anticipated Pöhnert was summoned, and while he was still fixing the lights, Lieutenant Perodeau, dressed almost identically to Pöhnert and carrying a tool box, walked casually out of the courtyard gate. He passed the first guard without incident, but the guard at the main gate asked for his token — tokens were issued to each guard and staff member upon entry of the camp guardhouse specifically to avoid this type of escape — with no hope of bluffing his way out of this, Perodeau surrendered.</p>
<p>Dutch <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculptors</a> made two <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> heads to stand in for escaping officers in the roll call. Later, "ghosts", officers who had faked a successful escape and hid in the castle, took the place of escaping prisoners in the roll call in order to delay discovery as long as possible.</p>
<p>Camp guards collected so much escape equipment that they established a "Kommandant's Escape Museum". Local <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photographer</a> Johannes Lange took photographs of the would-be escapees in their disguises or re-enacting their attempts for the camera. Along with the Lange photographs, one of the two sculpted clay heads was displayed proudly in the museum. Security officer <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhold_Eggers_f00c.html" title="Reinhold Eggers">Reinhold Eggers</a> made them a regular part of <i>Das Abwehrblatt</i>, a weekly magazine for the German POW camps.</p>
<p>There were also several rather inventive escape attempts:</p>

<p>In late 1940, British officer Peter Allan found out that the Germans were moving several <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattress.html" title="Mattress">mattresses</a> from the castle to another camp and decided that would be his way out. He let the French officers moving the mattresses know that one would be a little bit heavier. Allan, a fluent German speaker due to his schooling in Germany before the war, dressed himself up in a <i>Hitlerjugend</i> (<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_Youth_095a.html" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>) uniform, stuffed <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_reichsmark.html" title="German reichsmark">Reichsmark</a></i> in his pockets, and had himself sewn into one of the mattresses. He managed to get himself loaded into the truck, and unloaded into an empty house within the town. Cutting himself out of the mattress several hours later, when all he could hear was silence, he climbed out of the window into the garden and walked down the road towards his freedom. Along the 100 mi (161 km) way to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> via <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuttgart.html" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> he got a lift with a senior SS officer. Allan recalled that ride as the scariest moment of his life, "To be vulgar, I nearly needed a new pair of trousers." Allan had been aiming to reach Poland, but soon after reaching Vienna he found he was out of money. At this time the Americans had not yet entered the war, so Allan decided to ask the American embassy for assistance; he was refused. Allan's step-mother Lois Allan (founder of Fuzzy-Felt toys in the UK) was a US Citizen and he felt that they would provide sanctuary because of this. Allan had been on the run at this point for nine days; broke, exhausted, and hungry, he fell asleep in a park. Upon waking he discovered he could no longer walk due to his <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starvation.html" title="Starvation">starvation</a>. Soon after he was picked up and returned to Colditz, where he spent the next 3 months in solitary confinement.</p>

In order to get into position, both men put themselves into solitary confinement. After forcing open the door and picking the locks, they made their way to the courtyard where they climbed up to a narrow ledge. From the ledge they were able to jump to the guard house roof, and climb through an open window on the outer wall. Reusing their bed sheet rope they lowered themselves to the ground, where they were caught by a German guard.</p>

<p>Early in 1941, the British prisoners had gained access to the sewers and drains which ran beneath the floors of the castle. Entrance to these was from a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhole.html" title="Manhole">manhole</a> cover in the floor of the canteen. After initial reconnaissance trips, it was decided that the drain should be extended, and an exit made in a small grassy area which was overlooked from the canteen window. From here, they had planned to climb down the hill, and drop down below the steep outside eastern wall of the castle. Knowing which sentry would be on duty during the planned night of the escape, they pooled their resources and collected 500 Reichsmark for a bribe (100 of which were paid up front). This plan took three months of preparation. On the evening of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Pat Reid hid in the canteen when it was locked up for the night. He removed the bolt from the lock on the door, and returned to the courtyard. After the evening meeting, the chosen escapers slipped into the canteen unnoticed.</p>

The "Canteen Tunnel" one of the more spectacular escape blunders.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>They entered the tunnel and waited for the signal to proceed. Unknown to the prisoners, they had been betrayed by the bribed guard. Waiting on the grassy area was Hauptmann Priem and his guard force.</p>
<p>Pat Reid recalls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I climbed out on to the grass and Rupert Barry, immediately behind me, started to follow. My shadow was cast on the wall of the Kommandantur, and at that moment I noticed a second shadow beside my own. It held a gun. I yelled to Rupert to get back as a voice behind me shouted, <i>Hände hoch! Hände hoch!</i>. I turned to face a German officer levelling his <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vis_%28weapon%29.html" title="Vis (weapon)">pistol</a> at me."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind him were seven British and four Polish officers. On his order the remaining men backed up the tunnel to evade detection, but the Germans were waiting for them outside the canteen. Not wanting to give their captors any satisfaction the British burst into laughter as they came out, much to the bemusement of the guards.</p>
<p>Hauptmann Priem ends the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And the Guard? He kept his 100 Marks; he got extra leave, promotion and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Merit_Cross_90cc.html" title="War Merit Cross">War Service Cross</a>."</p>

<p>Nine French officers organized a long-term tunnel-digging project, the longest attempted out of Colditz Castle throughout the war. Deciding that the exit should be on the steep drop leading down towards the recreation area, outside the eastern walls of the castle, they began to scout for a possible location for the entrance. The problem was solved by Lieutenants Cazaumayo and Paille, who had gained access to the clock tower in 1940.</p>
<p>Their tunnel began at the top of a chapel's <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_tower.html" title="Clock tower">clock tower</a> and descended 8.6 meters (28.2 ft) into the ground using an old <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html#Dumb_waiter" title="Elevator">dumbwaiter</a> shaft. They found that the weights which used to hang down the shaft, and the chains, had been removed. This left an empty shaft which extended from the clock to the cellars below. After the previous escape attempts of Cazaumayo and Paille, the doors (one on each floor) which provided access to the tower had been bricked up in order to prevent further escape attempts. However, by sealing up the tower the Germans had in essence provided a secure location where escape tunnel work could be done without notice. The French this time gained access to the tower from the attics, descended 35 m to the cellars, and began work on a horizontal shaft in June 1941. This shaft work would continue for a further eight months.</p>

The "French Tunnel" discovered two days before completion.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The horizontal shaft towards the chapel progressed 4 m (13 ft) before they hit rock too hard to dig. They then decided to dig upwards towards the chapel floor. From here the tunnel continued underneath the wooden floor of the chapel for a distance of 13.5 m (44.3 ft). For this to be achieved, seven heavy <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak.html" title="Oak">oak</a> timbers in the floor, measuring 0.5 m (1.3 ft) square had to be cut through. Homemade saws, assembled from German table knives, were employed for this task. With this completed, the tunnel dropped vertically from the far corner of the chapel a further 5.2 m (17 ft). The tunnel then proceeded out towards the proposed exit with two further descents, separated by shafts in the tough stone foundations of the castle. The tunnel now ran a horizontal distance of 44 m (144 ft), reaching a final depth of 8.6 m (28.2 ft) below the ground.</p>
<p>Tunnelling continued well into 1942. By then Germans knew that the French were digging somewhere, based on the noise of their tunnelling reverberating through the castle at night. The French however were smug that its entrance was totally undetectable. However, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a> the Germans eventually searched the sealed off clock tower. Noises were heard below, and after lowering a small boy down the shaft three French officers were found. After searching the cellar thoroughly, the entrance to the tunnel was eventually discovered a mere 2 m (6.5 ft) short of completion. The French were convinced that they had been betrayed by one of their own countrymen but this was denied by the guards who demanded the French pay to repair the damage (estimated at 12000 Reichsmark).</p>
<p>The tunnel itself was a major engineering feat. It had electric lighting along its whole length, the power being diverted from the chapel's electricity supply. Not only did this allow the tunnellers to see what they were doing, it was also used as a system with which to signal to them the arrival of any sentries. The entrance to the tunnel in the wine cellar was concealed by five large stones covering a small door, which left little trace of any hole. Debris was transported from the working area by means of several sacks hoisted up the clock tower and disposed of in the castle's attics. The wine cellar was regularly cleaned and redusted using dust harvested from the attic, so as to hide the reddish clay dust which was not present in the cellar ordinarily.</p>

</div>
<p>In one of the most ambitious escape attempts from Colditz, the idea of building a <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">glider</a> was dreamt up by two pilots, Jack Best and Bill Goldfinch, who had been sent to Colditz after escaping from another POW camp. They were encouraged by two army officers, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Rolt_cd80.html" title="Tony Rolt">Tony Rolt</a> and David Walker, who had recently arrived in the camp. It would be Tony Rolt who would recommend the chapel roof, since he noticed it was obscured from the view of the Germans.</p>
<p>The plan was to construct a two-man glider part by part. The glider was assembled by Bill Goldfinch and Jack Best in the lower attic above the chapel, and was to be launched from the roof in order to fly across the river Mulde, which was about 200 feet (60 m) below. The <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runway.html" title="Runway">runway</a> was to be constructed from tables and the glider was to be launched using a pulley system based on a falling metal <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathtub.html" title="Bathtub">bathtub</a> full of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a>, using a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>-assisted acceleration to 30 mph (50 km/h).</p>
<p>The officers who took part in the project built a false wall, to hide the secret space in the attic where they slowly built the glider out of stolen pieces of wood. Since the Germans were accustomed to looking down for <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunnel.html" title="Tunnel">tunnels</a>, not up for secret workshops, they felt rather safe from detection. However, they still placed lookouts, and created an electric alarm system, to warn the builders of approaching guards.</p>
<p>Hundreds of <a href="../../../r/i/b/Rib_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Rib (aircraft)">ribs</a> had to be constructed, predominantly formed from bed slats, but also from every other piece of wood the POW's could surreptitiously obtain. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing.html" title="Wing">wing</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spar.html" title="Spar">spars</a> were constructed from floor boards. Control wires were made from electrical wiring in unused portions of the castle. A glider expert, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorne_Welch_d8fb.html" title="Lorne Welch">Lorne Welch</a>, was asked to review the stress diagrams and calculations made by Goldfinch.</p>
<p>The glider constructed was a lightweight, two-seater, high wing, monoplane design. It had a Mooney style <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudder.html" title="Rudder">rudder</a> and square <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Elevator (aircraft)">elevators</a>. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wingspan.html" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a>, tip to tip, was 32 ft (9.75 m), and it was 19 ft 9 in (6 m) from nose to tail. Prison <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeping_bag.html" title="Sleeping bag">sleeping bags</a> of blue and white checked <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a> were used to skin the glider, and German <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ration.html" title="Ration">ration</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millet.html" title="Millet">millet</a> was boiled and used to seal the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloth.html" title="Cloth">cloth</a> <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pore.html" title="Pore">pores</a>. The materials they had to work with caused it to weigh a mere 240 lb (109 kg). However the war ended before the glider was finished.</p>
<p>A replica of the Colditz glider was built for the 2000 <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> (UK) 3-part (150 minute total) "Escape from Colditz" documentary, and flew successfully on its first attempt with Best and Goldfinch in tearful attendance. It is currently housed at the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_War_Museum_7b10.html" title="Imperial War Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.

<p>Pat Reid claims in <i>Colditz: The Full Story</i> that there were 31 "home runs". It should be noted that he includes prisoners from the hospital and prisoners being transported, who were not directly under Colditz staff control. Henry Chancellor in <i>Colditz: The Definitive History</i> claims 32 escaped but only 15 were "home runs": 1 Belgian, 11 British, 7 Dutch, 12 French and 1 Polish. The difference is that Reid claims any successful escape by an "official" Colditz POW a "home run" where most other historians only consider escapes from the castle or castle grounds itself as a "home run". Also a subject of debate is whether or not Millar's escape should be considered a "home run", but since he is listed MIA (unofficially he is assumed deceased), Chancellor does not count him as such.</p>

<p>At the end of May 1943, the <i><a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberkommando_der_Wehrmacht_8bf6.html" title="Oberkommando der Wehrmacht">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</a></i> (Armed Forces High Command) decided that Colditz should hold only British and Commonwealth officers. Because of this decision, all of the Dutch and Polish prisoners and most of the French and Belgians were moved to other camps in July. Three British officers tried their luck by impersonating an equal number of French when they were moved out, but they were later returned to Colditz. German security gradually increased and by the end of 1943 most of the potential ways of escape had been plugged. Several officers tried to escape during transit, having first caused themselves to be transferred for that purpose.</p>
<p>Some officers even went so far as to fake illness and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_retardation.html" title="Mental retardation">mental retardation</a> in order to be <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repatriation.html" title="Repatriation">repatriated</a> on medical grounds.
