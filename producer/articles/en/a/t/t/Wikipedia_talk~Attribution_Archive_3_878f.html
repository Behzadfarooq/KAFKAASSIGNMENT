<dd>I feel like you're trying to address a case other than the one we have. I'm really talking more about something like Outpost Gallifrey (Which, until it stopped doing it, was the absolute bees' knees of Doctor Who news), or the Doctor Who Reference Guide (Still the best place for summaries, including summaries of some seriously arcane shit in Doctor Who). These are sites that nobody with any knowledge of the fandom disputes the reliability of it. If you have any knowledge of the subject, you recognize that the sites are every bit as good as a book on the subject would be. (And often better) And, as I've said many times, I have 0 doubt that there are other cases outside of popular culture that require the same sort of exception. The problem is that I just don't know whether the authoritative source on contemporary model trains is a website somewhere. Or whether somewhere out there is a massive and authoritative index of quilting patterns that every quilter worth her salt uses. What I'm looking for is some mechanism whereby we can identify those sources and let them in. My instinct remains to defer to ad hoc consensus of editors, as we should for any editorial decision that is tricky and subject-specific. I'm open to other ideas, but I think it's vital to this page that we have some mechanism to do this.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Perhaps the relevant criteria for the popular culture thing</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps the relevant criteria for the popular culture section is not popular culture, but rather "areas there is little controversy about." All the examples I've thought of that might require these exceptions are deeply placid subjects. Quilting. Model trains. Doctor Who. Fans and afficianados may be passionate, and there may be subjective debates within the area ("No, the sixth Doctor is best!") but there's no real factual disputes. ("Mariner's Compass was Hitler's favorite pattern") And certainly no real controversy with the outside world. ("Model Trains: Harmless Hobby, or Gateway to Hell?") The important thing, to me, is to let such topics about which there is not a bunch of raging controversies just waiting to happen play it a bit looser. Think of it as the opposite of BLP - "Nothing ever goes seriously and dangerously wrong with fly-fishing, so editors in that area should go ahead and use common sense." <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the policy does give leeway for a group of <i>Dr Who</i> experts or afficionados to accept a website as a source when they agree on its accuracy and quality. I see your concerns as being met by the clause which addresses such circumstances, by the undeprecation of reliable primary sources, by the scope the policy gives to commonsense, expertise, and judgement as final arbiters in assessing sources, and by, in a tight corner, the magic pebble of "ignore all rules". This policy really has become admirably tolerant, in my opinion, which I'm sure is the way to go. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:54, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a tough one, and one I'm not sure I feel qualified to judge. Within mathematics as a whole, I would not consider such self-published material OK, because there are a large number of cranks and lunatics. On the other hand, if we narrow to fractal mathematics, and particularly the Mandelbrot set, it may well be an area of hobbyists where such concerns don't apply. Also, I'm not sure the new PC clause is the most relevant one - is the creator of Buddhabrot a recognized expert? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've since fixed it to clarify that we are talking about materials vouched for by the community of experts in a field and not just anybody claiming to be an expert. Hope that helps. Also note the "unquestioned" part. Provide meaningful doubt and it is no longer unquestioned. Creationists doubt evolution. Most peope doubt Scientologists. Detailing criteria so the clueless can tell one from the other is worse than pointless for reasons expressed elsewhere on this page. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(&lt;---) It is a matter of common sense by editors making these choices and mutual material use within an expert community and acceptance of that community by societ in general. For example, society accepts some organizations expertise in maters of coin knowledge and many of those use some website for up to date data on coin value. Society vouches for that organization. That organization by its use vouches for that website for its price data. The flow of credibility is like that. The exact method of citing it is whatever makes the most sense in a given situation. Police use a chain of custody concept. Think of this as a chain of credibility concept where society as a whole is the ultimate fount of assigning credibility and each assignee can in turn pass it on to a degree. If the physics community agrees Dr. Smith is an expert on black holes and he has a blog that says something about black hole then we can say "Dr. Smith in his blog says ... about black holes." <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:21, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The definiton of reliable source currently reads "Reliable sources are credible <b>published</b> materials" (my emphaisis). The "Credibility established by the expert community" paragraph currently begins "When the credibility of a source...." So as it currently reads, the credibility of a particular publication must be established by the expert community, even if it is written by a recognized expert. So for example, if I want to quote from the <i>Film Developing Cookbook</i> by Anchell and Troup, published bo Focal Press, I can't use the corrections to formulas posted on Troup's website, because it's self-published and I can't find a formal review of the website.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An important use of this paragraph is to allow the reputation of an expert to carry over from the expert's publications by reputable publishing houses to self-published works that may not be important enough to be commented on by other experts in places where we can find the commentary. The present wording defeats that purpose. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:44, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The best sources</span></h2>
<p>From "Key principles"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In general, the most reliable sources are books and journals published by universities; mainstream newspapers; and magazines and journals published by known publishing houses.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this sentence needs improving. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most university presses are no longer affiliated with the university for which they are named. I would assume that books and journals published by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_Press_e6ea.html" title="Princeton University Press">Princeton University Press</a> are considered A-list sources?</li>
<li>What about academic presses other than university presses?</li>
<li>Don't we need to distinguish between</li>
<li>What about books published by known publishing houses other than university presses? Are these truly lower quality than magazines published by the same house or a house with the same reputation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, I have replaced it with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In general, the most reliable sources are peer-revised journals and books published by specialized publishers, such as university presses, for an audience of professionals or academics. Next are books, mainstream newspapers and periodicals published by other recognized publishing houses.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is half again as long, but I think that clarity is important, and that we have stated elsewhere that peer-reviewed publications are generally to be taken in preference to newspaper articles, particularly when specialized topics are considered. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 17:45, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I restored the previous version, as I am unhappy about the suggested wording. In particular the qualifier " for an audience of professionals or academics".

<dd>I don't think we can simply dismiss this issue with a [1] best [2] next-best [3] there is no more. Reliable Sources are more important to us, I think, than they are to any previously published Encyclopedia because articles are constantly evolving and because there is no other foundation to build a NPOV on. Reliable Sources are frequently discussed and are a cornerstone of our work. Editors accept (and I'm sure the public appreciates) stable references. I believe we need to view "reliable sources" as a spectrum, a continuous spectrum of increasing reliability with a bottom (note stapled to a telephone pole) and a top (consitution of the USA, perhaps). We need to specify the parameters which actually make a source of information <b>reliable</b> so that editors understand it is not simply "this is reliable, that is not", but understand the qualities which make a source reliable. It might be more than can be done in a policy because a policy is a statement of intent. But wherever we do it, we should do it throughly. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Material challenged or likely to be challenged"?</span></h2>
<p>SV, why the change to "Material challenged or likely to be challenged" as the primary criterion for using an inline citation? Is that supposed to sum up "substantial, surprising, or controversial"; if so, I don't think it does. "Challenged" implies that someone will think the information incorrect, and will be vocal enough to say something about it, implying that we need citations only when someone disagrees with what is written. There are many other reasons to have citations than the possibility of somebody thinking something is incorrect (research, ease of verification, sourcing an essay, etc.), and this wording should reflect that. At the very least, I would expect something like "At a minimum, material that may be or has been challenged should be accompanied by an inline citation." Better would be the previous wording (something like "At a minimum, any substantial, surprising, or controversial content should be accompanied by an inline citation.") --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">es</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 18:03, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For my part, I think that inline citation is not always appropriate, especially in shorter articles that have around three decent sources, all of which amount to a few pages, and all of which support one another. Accordingly, I object to the word "substantial" in the old version. I think that the current wording describes both actual and reasonble practice. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:24, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The way it currently reads "Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and quotations, should be accompanied by an inline citation" is better than adding "substantial".

<dd>Slim, is that for titles of sources or titles of foreign books and films?

<dd>It's not uncommon or unreasonable to translate titles which are in non-Latin scripts, but leave languages like French alone. But still, I wouldn't make any requirements here.

<dd>Except we don't. Some French film titles are translated, some not; some Greek (as another example) film titles are translated, some not (only romanized). Some of it has to do with whether or not they're exported to English film markets, so I tend to leave the issue alone; but still, we're not consistent on this, but we're also not terribly consistent with other foreign language conventions either, so this isn't really a big issue. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 03:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Film titles should be given in English where they have been translated and in the original language where they have not. This is so obvious as barely to need discussing, surely? This is not a Cantonese-language encyclopaedia and it should not be expected to become one.

<dd>The bible needs to be routinely used as a reference in Wikipedia. You do it all the time in history articles to source what historical figures are saying. For example, if John Knox calls Mary I a "Jezebel", you can give the bible reference; and the bible is a perfectly reliable source for <b>what</b> Knox said (while a particular history book or document would be the reference for the fact <b>that he said it</b>). There shouldn't be a problem with quoting sources that aren't in themselves reliable for the truth, so long as they are reliably published (usually there will be no shortage of sources to contradict them, if required). So I don't agree with the formula that authors of sources have to be reliable; it is the publication process that has to be reliable. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All WP articles are syntheses of publihed material; it is when material is put together in a way that serves to advance a position that we have a problem. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:28, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is that saying that you aren't allowed to produce arguments and you aren't allowed to advance a position is redundant. Advancing a position requires an argument (unless you're making a completely unsupported statement, in which case the problem is a lack of sources, not OR). There is no need to include the "advance a position" language since "argument" already covers all the cases we're worried about. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 18:04, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin, it was bad form here to split up Ken's post for a point-by-point reply; others can't participate without making it hard to see who the original poster was.</p>
<p>Regarding Ken's question about the difference between trustworthy and authoritative, I'd prefer to avoid using those terms altogether. I guess I'm the only one around here who feels this way, but I'd much rather defer to WP:RS for the definition of reliable sources, and just say here "Reliable sources are sources that meet criteria for reliability, as defined in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidelines." Otherwise, I feel we are going to get into debates over having to define what "credible", "published", "regarded", "trustworthy", and "authoritative" mean for various subjects, as well as arbitrarily elevate guidelines to policy level. People will challenge every one of those words: What counts as "published"? Who does the "regarding"? Where can I find some guidelines to weigh how "credible" "trustworthy" and "authoritative" a source is? Doesn't it depend on the subject area? (We've already posited that it does; e.g., pop culture). Providing those guidelines is what WP:RS should be for, IMHO. I don't see any reason they need to be defined here. Beef up WP:RS if need be.</p>
<p>Regarding the definition of original research and "I'm not making an argument", I would just add that it's not necessary for the argument to be explicitly stated, and that it's the editor's intent that matters. I propose stating it this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Original research is any analysis, synthesis, or extrapolation of material from any source (reliable or not), excluding simple calculations and logical deductions, with the intent to produce a novel interpretation or advance a position, even if that interpretation or position is not explicitly stated."</li>
</ul>
<p>I also propose defining original thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Original thought is any argument, concept, data, statement, theory, or neologism that is not attributable to a reliable source."</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these definitions deliberately avoid the term 'published', which I feel is part of the RS criteria. —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 17:07, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe one of the intents of this proposed policy is to eliminate the need for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, so references to it would not be a good idea. I also feel that any definition for purposes of this policy that differ from the general definiton should be flagged as such: "For purposes of this policy, original thought is any argument, concept, data, statement, theory, or neologism that is not attributable to a reliable source." After all, people have original thoughts all the time, and only publish a tiny fraction of them in reliable sources. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 17:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Using_Stormfront_as_an_example" id="Using_Stormfront_as_an_example"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using Stormfront as an example</span></h2>
<p>Currently Attribution is worded to say: (the website of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront_%28website%29.html" title="Stormfront (website)">Stormfront</a> would be an example of an extremist site) This is probably counter-productive from what is intended, as it inadvertently limits what counts as an extremist site. By listing a well known hate group/site, you inadvertently raise the standard against which all other extremist groups/sites are to be judged. This works to the advantage of most extremist groups, as it gives them a foil. Editors who support including material that originated from extremist groups simply say “the policy is designed to keep out the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis, neither of which describe group XYZ” even when group XYZ is clearly white nationalist in nature. For example: The main journal of White Nationalist thought in the US is the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Renaissance_%28magazine%29_3af2.html" title="American Renaissance (magazine)">American Renaissance (magazine)</a> or Amren. Even thought Jared Taylor the founder/publisher of Amren is a close personal friend of Don Black, the founder/ publisher of Stormfront, and much of the material in Amren can be found on Stomfront, Amren’s supporters will always claim the high road and scream loudly if you call Amren an extremist site. (I have already had this discussion more or less on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_nationalism.html" title="White nationalism">White nationalism</a> page, apparently it is a Paleoconservative publication, according to some)</p>
<p>In short it would be better to remove the example of Stormfront and leave things more open. By using Stormfront as an example, you have set the benchmark so high that most extremist groups can not reach it.</p>
<p>An alternative would be use one or more professionally maintained lists of extremist groups as a general point of reference. Such lists are not foolproof, nor all inclusive, and not every group listed would necessarily meet everyone’s definition of extremist, however, the only “harm” caused by being list inadvertently is that your group/website can not be cited directly. It simply forces editors to find an acceptable alternative source when citing facts. In my opinion, the “good” (having a vented source of extremist who where off-limits, thus reducing edit wars) of using such a list would outweigh the “harm” (legitimate statements would have to be cited using alternative sources).</p>
<p>Probably the most widely cited list at the moment, IMO only, is the SPLC’s list of <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp" rel="nofollow">hate groups</a>. It covers perhaps a couple hundred groups divided into seven categories, making it a good starting point. If a statement can be traced back to a group listed here, it’s a pretty safe bet that the source should never be cited in Wikipedia. (I have no connection what so ever to the SPLC) Thanks <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 09:34, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Brimba, the recommendation of the SPLC list could perhaps be placed on the FAQ page; the problem with it is that we don't control its contents; not everyone agrees with it; and it covers the U.S. only. What we need on this page is a clear example of a group "widely acknowledged as extremist," and Stormfront is a good example of that. Whatever Amren says about itself is irrelevant; what matters is what other reasonable people think of it. Also, we're not talking only about hate groups, but about extremist groups or people of any kind. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:37, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Due to the context, I read it as saying that some sites can not be trusted to be used a source for anything other than themselves such as gossip columns, promotional sites and extremely biased sites. Which makes sense. Every site has biases that need to be taken into account but only extremely biased sites need to be basicly ruled out.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">direct quotation of sources</span></h2>
<p>Forgive me if I'm missing something basic, but I'm surprised to find no mention in the guidelines of when quotation marks should be used when using material word-for-word from another source.

<li>Editor B objects on the grounds of plagiarism.</li>
<li>Editor A defends on the grounds of plagiarism that the material is sourced, and that since Wikipedia is a group project disclaims original thought, it logically cannot be guilty of plagiarism.</li>

It is beyond the scope of policy to spell out such specific rules, that belongs in guidelines, I believe.

<p>The phrasing, "Examples would be" is clumsy, so I tried rephrasing. I believe this version expresses the same intent, but more smoothly.</p>
<p>I note that Jossi reverted my note about being careful when doing calculations. I think some sort of caution is needed, because it is really easy to introduce new assumptions without realizing it.</p>
<p>A question: should we specially note the exception for original photographs and graphics? As I understand, NOR is interpreted loosely in such cases because of the difficulty of finding appropriate public-domain or GDFL-licensable illustrations? I have seen editors create a graph because of the complexity of fair use with respect to using the copyrighted version, and then worry about NOR. While I commend their concern, I think there is no objection to a graphic that is really just a good illustration of what the source is saying, and I think it improves Wikipedia to have it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unpublished photographs may be included as images in articles provided that there are no published photographs of similar quality that can be used under the GFDL and that the accuracy of the photograph can be readily verified, as by comparison to copyrighted, published sources. Similarly, original graphs of numerical data may be produced, provided that the underlying data is from a published source, the source is cited, and the graphic introduces no interpretation not already contained in that source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I can't imagine this being controversial, I have recently been reverted for another edit I thought non-controversial, so I will look for consensus. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 14:04, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a wide variety of opinion on Wikipedia regarding NOR as regards images. For example, a picture of a thing on a page used to represent that thing (blue jay, centipede, RAM chip). What is acceptable in determining if the picture represents that thing or not? We have people going to botanical gardens and photographing plants and bird watchers photoing birds in the wild and tech buffs photoing computer parts, OR? I don't think the needed conversations have even begun in earnest on the subject much less reached a consensus. I suggest we don't mention images at all in this policy, rather than prematurely make policy on something without any real concensus by wikipedians as a whole. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:40, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Copyright for an image is in the form of presentation, not the facts presented. The creative effort exists in the choice of form.

<dd>Agreed. I can think of some exceptions, but they would be rare, and done for clarity of presentation, not to prove a point. IAR may cover those cases.

<dd>Orignal images of well known objects is "original research"? Enact such a policy, and not only will your source of images dry up, but you'll need to delete most of the current collection. Images are but highly detailed descriptions of things, indistinguishable from a bunch of text (information content wise). "A picture is worth a thousand words", etc. Looking over this current proposal though, I get the impression that like the current policy, the "image exemption" will flow naturally out of it. It it can be shown not to be the case, then there is a bug that needs to be fixed, or this policy needs to die in committee. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 20:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about material that is verifiable but not attributable?</span></h2>
<p>I like that people are putting a lot of energy into making content policies clearer, as this is an area that newbies struggle with a lot. I like the desire to aid both the sincere newbies and established editors resisting POV edits. But one thing troubles me: what about material that is verifiable but not attributable?</p>
<p>It seems to me that a major difference between Wikipedia and traditional academic efforts is that at least for popular articles, our reader provide a vast fact-checking appratus of their own. For example when I look at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts_%28game%29.html" title="Hearts (game)">Hearts (game)</a> I see a lot of useful, unattributed information that I can personally verify to some extent.</p>
<p>Reading the current version, I gather content like this would be allowed to remain as long as it weren't challenged, but I'm a little worried that some well-meaning but rules-focused editor would go on a tear and prune back the Hearts article to the three sentences he could verify in his <i>Pocket Guide to Card Games</i>. Although I deeply appreciate the iron-sharpening-iron benefits of these policies on points where balance and factual accuracy are crucial, I worry that they might force us into a disservice to readers elsewhere. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>William Pietre wrote "I see a lot of useful, unattributed information that I can personally verify to some extent." I wonder what he means by "personally verify"? Does he mean rely on his own experience playing hearts? Unfortunately there are topics other than hearts were people might exaggerate or even misrepresent their personal experience.</dd>

<dd>One area I could see attribution through something other than a traditional publication is commonly available objects. If I want to write that a North American 120 V 15A grounded power plug has 3 prongs, I don't see any problem.

<dd>It is not a requirement that every Wikipedia reader have equally convenient access to references. Such a requirement would destroy Wikipedia, because many readers are children who have convenient access only to an Internet connection and a small school library.

<dd>All claims in Wikipedia articles must answer the credibility issue ("Who says so and why should I believe them") in a way understandable to the average English language speaker. For example "Everything on this page can be found in any physics testbook on the subject" at the bottom of a short article on a physics particle. Or "This article is from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica" at the bottom of such an article. The use of a game or DVD as a primary source in wikipedia is under debate at the moment and the solution is to tell the reader whatever you can concerning the credibility of the article and let's let best practices evolve without trying to prescibe what is best here and now. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:39, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We do well to remember that sometimes to IAR is best. There was a case of a Pennsylvanis covered bridge that was descibed by a written source as unused except for storage, yet can be seen from a nearby highway (it is now private) as having cars path through it. Sourcing objects "anyone" can see with their own eyes is something difficult to put in policy except to descibe it as original research and rule against it. Yet original research was properly used to delete a properly sourced claim about a bridge. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that's exactly the kind of case I'm thinking about. Or looking at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> I note that it doesn't cite definitions for the neighborhoods, or give proof that Lombard Street is "famously crooked". It's possible that those claims aren't sourceable, but any San Francisco resident can verify them. If I have to haul out IAR to get away with that, I happily will, but as long as we're looking at replacing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I was hoping that we could come up with an R that needed less I. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:59, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't agree with WAS 4.250 that relying on objects anyone can see with their own eyes is necessarily original research. At least in the case of manufactured goods that are sold widely, they have similar characteristics to books: they are all the same, and they are at least as easy to buy as books. They are marked with a brand, so their origin can be traced. Really, they have most of the characteristics of publications. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:27, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If all we have to say about an object is what can be gleaned by looking at one, then I would say that our article isn't very useful. An article on a three-pronged plug should discuss the evolution and usage of the device, which involves an understanding of electrical power and grounding techniques. While hundreds of Wikipedians could competently describe that in their sleep, we still should be able to find a source if demanded. For one thing, we all carry a lot of misinformation, even about our own fields. As for the appearance, what is the specification? What range of shapes and sizes are in use? That information is a pain to dig up, but that is the task we set ourselves when we joined this nuthouse. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree with all of that, but I don't think it quite addresses the point that concerns me. A relatively small portion of the world population can verify that "The Avenues" refers to a particular part of San Francisco. That fact may not be in any reliable source. But enough of the people who do know edit Wikipedia that I'm not worried about that being wrong. However I am worried, and possibly needlessly, that a shift in focus from verifiability to attributability would make certain articles worse even though I could well believe it will make a lot of articles better. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:09, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The policy should be framed not just to identify sources that are to underpin large portions of a new article, but also to identify sources that are suitable for writing one sentence in a large article, or to correct a minor error in an existing article. West argues "If all we have to say about an object is what can be gleaned by looking at one, then I would say that our article isn't very useful." That may be so, but the article may not be about the object; the object may only be mentioned in passing. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 20:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the covered bridge point, I have deleted things I know to be mistakes, such as saying that a building is in the wrong municipality. If compelled, I could dig up a source, but it usually suffices to say, "I live near there; that's wrong." One editor calls this "zero order verification," and it is a common practice. In the case of the covered bridge, odds are that it is on the local register of historic places, which would have records of its current usage. Shortcuts are just that, and should not be enshrined in policy. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:57, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No - you're absolutely correct. Especially since this is one of the major reasons we're redoing the policy.

<dd>Unfortunately, yes. I'm saying that there is a class of material that may be unsourceable but that is verifiable by a significant number of editors. Maybe a good term for what I'm thinking of is "folk knowledge". As I mention above, common local knowledge and popular card games are two examples where I think our articles go well beyond the sources I've seen, and beyond what I expect we could get from any source. I think it's related to the pop culture problem above, but different enough that I thought I'd mention it as long as we were on the topic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 22:10, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Take a real case. An editor posted something that I 99% believed, but sourced it to confidential documents. I strongly felt that the statements should be sourced to publicly-available documents. The reaction was, "I'm not here to do research for you," until I used WP:V as a club. I do not believe that I was being obnoxious, but I strongly felt that the statement should be verifiable. Maybe the 1% doubt just bothered me too much. How much doubt should an editor have (or claim) to justify insisting on a source? If we don't put the burden squarely on the shoulders of the editor adding material, we may never get sources. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that confidential documents were involved, it sounds like a different case than the one I'm describing, which is more about knowledge common among a sizable group. Perhaps the difference lies in an editor knowledgeable about the subject expressing doubt versus demanding attribution for its own sake? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 02:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are several aspects to a Reliable Source of information. Verifiability is one of them and Attributabiliy another one of them. <i>Verifiability, not truth</i> places that quality highest but attributability is important, too. For example, several anonomous websites can be easily verified for their information, but don't have any attributability at all. So neither quality by itself is sufficient. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this could be clearer about press releases. Under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> I had always thought of them as self-published sources, but this page pretty clearly excludes them. Could we make it clearer that they are questionable sources, perhaps by naming them? If we don't name them, then perhaps inserting "independent" before "fact-checking process" would do the trick. As an example of why this matters, consider <a href="../../../p/a/_/PA_Consulting_Group_2f6f.html" title="PA Consulting Group">PA_Consulting_Group</a>, an article written by in-house PR people sourced almost entirely from the company's own press releases. On the talk page, involved parties claim that the company has a great fact-checking process before publishing, and so are just fine as sources. However, as somebody who has seen the the press release process from both sides, this strikes me as true but missing the point: even if a press release is full of verified facts (which is certainly not a given), they are ones carefully chosen to put the subjects in the best possible light. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:36, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The chip companies involved were all top notch by the way (Motorola, Intel, you get the idea).

<dd>Whoa! AFD and CSD are not content policies, they are procedures for enforcing policy in extreme cases where a Wikipedia article cannot be made policy-conforming. If an article uses an extremely biased source, but other sources are available, the solution is to remove the problematic material, not delete the whole article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:07, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wouldn't this whole problem fit under a <b>questionable source</b> as source with "no independent editorial oversight".

<dd>Yes, but I think the sentence could be read different ways. That's why I opened by suggesting that we put "independent" before "fact-checking process" as well just to make clear that an internal fact-checking process isn't a substitute for independent editorial oversight. A good press release would have fact-checking and come from a company with a reputation for such, and would lack the other signs mentioned later in that paragraph. But it still would be a questionable source for anything other than the company's views. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:50, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary/secondary</span></h2>
<p>I'm minded to put the primary/secondary source distinction back in. If you look at the discussion above that was needed to decide on a press release, all that needed to be said is that it's a primary source and articles shouldn't rely entirely on primary sources (notwithstanding exceptions that may be made for pop culture).</p>
<p>A revert war was recently stopped by pointing out to someone that he was using a primary source to make an interpretive claim, and that was enough of an explanation. Without that distinction, I suspect we'd be discussing it still. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:28, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand why you would want to do this but I believe everyone would be better served if you simply described what you really mean to say (i.e. a source created by primary players as a opposed to a source created by independent parties). I believe the primary/secondary terminology is flawed as all newspapers when commenting on current events can be used as primary sources, and a presidential speech were it talks about historical precedents can be used as a secondary source.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 01:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But primary players doesn't necessarily cover it. The Bible isn't a "primary player."

<dd>The Bible was certainly created by primary players. Unless you are discussing the later translators, but they are still translating a document that was created by primary players.

Especially if you plan to link to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>, which clearly talks about things that you do not mean to include in this simplistic use.

<dd>But who those "primary players" who created the Bible is much debated, and basically not clearly known. The Bible as a primary source, however, is a clearly understood fact - the Bible says a bunch of things, and various secondary (and further removed) sources interpret it to mean various things as a result. "Players" is a terminology that will mean little to the reader, "sources" is a terminology that is well-established both on and off Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not trying to promote my own wording of "created by primary players". If someone can come up to with a clearer way to explain this I would be very happy. That said I cannot think of a single theory of authorship that does not include a person I would consider a "primary players", in either the actual events described or the promotion of the narrative as the "truth". If someone can come up with a better wording to describe this please suggest it. The problem with the term primary source is this. If you want to say "primary source" actually describes a <i>type</i> of document, and I dispute that (see previous disscussion above), the term encompasses any document that is written about contemporary events. Most all newspaper articles would be included in this. What you are really wanting to describe is not contempary works but works whose authors are too close the the subject to be trully reliable. I think the problem with these documents really stems from the authorship. And "primary source" includes closeness in time period as well as closeness of authorship--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 03:55, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What counts as a primary source depends on context and on the relationship between the researcher and the source. Most articles in the New York Times today constitute secondary source material, except perhaps for some op-eds and letters to the editor which may be written by people directly involved in an event. But in 100 years time, those articles will be regarded as primary source material about the state of the world in October 2006. Similarly, if I'm writing about the Arab-Israeli conflict and I use <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Morris_4202.html" title="Benny Morris">Benny Morris</a>'s books as a source, they're secondary sources; but if I'm writing about Benny Morris, the same material is a primary source.</dd>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Let's not re-invent the wheel, shall we? There are established definitions of what is a primary sources and what is a secondary source. One example (from bgsu.edu) <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/infosrv/lue/primary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/infosrv/lue/primary.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary sources are the "materials on a topic upon which subsequent interpretations or studies are based, anything from firsthand documents such as poems, diaries, court records, and interviews to research results generated by experiments, surveys, ethnographies, and so on." Primary sources are records of events as they are first described, without any interpretation or commentary. They are also sets of data, such as census statistics, which have been tabulated, but not interpreted.</li>
<li>Secondary sources, on the other hand, offer an analysis or a restatement of primary sources. They often attempt to describe or explain primary sources. Some secondary sources not only analyze primary sources, but use them to argue a contention or to persuade the reader to hold a certain opinion.Examples of secondary sources include: dictionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks, and books and articles that interpret or review research works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example (this one from Berkeley library guide):<a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/PrimarySources.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/PrimarySources.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What are Primary Sources? Primary sources enable the researcher to get as close as possible to what actually happened during an historical event or time period. Primary sources were either created during the time period being studied, or were created at a later date by a participant in the events being studied (as in the case of memoirs) and they reflect the individual viewpoint of a participant or observer.</li>
<li>What Are Secondary Sources? A secondary source is a work that interprets or analyzes an historical event or phenomenon. It is generally at least one step removed from the event. Examples include scholarly or popular books and articles, reference books, and textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also good examples of primary, secondary and tertiary sources in this page from JCU <a href="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 04:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not reinventing the wheel to say newspaper articles on current events are primary sources. Really it quite common for historians to use contempary newspapers articles as primary sources.

<p>It is clear that whatever the "real" or "correct" meaning of "primary source" is; we do not agree amomg ourselves what that meaning is or what its significance is.

<dd>I see little in common between the historian's notion of a primary source and the idea of a first-person account on a blog or a website, often also on Wikipedia called a primary source.

<dd>As for tertiary sources, they are a conceptual will o'the wisp to me: encyclopedias may base their texts on secondary sources but so do many books (popular history books, for a start), and yet we call the latter secondary sources. And some entries in encyclopedias are written by named authors who may have used primary sources in compiling their articles. So in my opinion we don't need the term "tertiary" at all. For all Slim Virgin's promethean work on these policies, I fear the eternal pecking of her liver by the quibble eagles if she attempts this particular semantic feat. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 15:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we are closer than we think.

We can keep the wording simple by explaining what a primary soure and a secondary source is, and how to best use these, as per the JCU article at <a href="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml</a> <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 17:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes. Also:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Reliable sources are credible published materials with a reliable publication process; generally meaning that their authors are regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand. How reliable a source is depends on context. In general, the most reliable sources are books and journals published by universities; mainstream newspapers; and magazines and journals published by known publishing houses. What these have in common is process and approval between document creation and publication. As a rule of thumb, the more people engaged in checking facts, analysing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Material that is self-published is generally not regarded as reliable, but see below for exceptions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Relying on experts <i>or</i> relying on a reliable publishing processes for credibility while at the same time not being prohibited from use of primary sources for verifyability <i>should</i> be sufficient for anything Wikipedia should actually be standing behind.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Professional expert</span></h2>
<p>(copied from SV's talk page) It was me that pulled professional out of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. There was discussion at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Old_popular_culture_section" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Old popular culture section</a>. I've pulled it out again, because I think it was a good change, but I'm commenting here too to let you know and generate discussion, although it's probably best to have the discussion there rather than here. If you want to put it in again, fair enough, as long as we do discuss it. My feelings are that professional is a hard one to quantify, and I think recognised works. The idea is that where fan research is recognised within the field, I don't see that it should be excluded. The internet has challenged many ideas, and the self published idea is one of them. Fanzines and fan published magazines have long been used as sources, The Comics Journal, for example, is one such reliable source which is also, basically, a fan published magazine. The internet has moved such publications, and potential contributors online, for example the newsarama website, would, years ago, have seen publication. I think we have to work out some issue here, and professional is a hard to define term. I think I said on the talk page, what constitutes professional? Does the blogger with adsense on his blog constitute professional? Anyway, there's a starter. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we want to make an exception for pop culture, that's fine, but we can't dilute the definition of a reliable source for other areas.

<dd>Why don't we simply include the pop culture exception paragraph (and add some of the examples that Phil gave, such as quilting, clock-making, where the key issue is that professional sources don't exist). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I don't see the problem that you're describing, that we weaken the barriers. A recognised expert is something that would have to be consensually agreed upon, and contentious instances wouldn't get through. That's the basis of how we work, that we build by consensus, and I think the guidance we have works to support the idea that you can't call anyone an expert as you fear. I think the addition of the term professional creates an extra barrier that isn't needed, and isn't always applicable, and is capable of misuse.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Sarfatti's research isn't used in certain articles, not because of his credentials but because of our founding principle, that we write from a neutral point of view. I think the insistence on professional experts may actually violate our founding principle of writing from a neutral point of view in certain areas. For example, Eddie Campbell's opinions are extremely useful to the comics field, and he is a recognised expert on the field, despite the fact that he self-published the main body of his work. The same is true of Dave Sim. Self-publishing should not be the bar to people's opinions, rather the credence to which their views are reported should be the issue.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The way we prevent people presenting information which unbalances an article by giving undue weight to an opinion is through our founding principle of writing from a neutral point of view. It's not through our reliance on professional experts. It can't be, since Wikipedia is compiled by people who very clearly aren't professional experts. The goal, as I understand it, is to that the "wiki process" is the final authority on content. I think we should be allowed to utilise expert opinion where people are recognised experts in their field.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The newsarama website is supported by advertising, I fail to see how one differentiates between that and a magazine which is supported by advertising. The internet has changed the forums in which people can publish their views, and I think that we need to recognise that fact. Experts are people whose views are given credence. We shouldn't allow the bias of which views commerce wants to support challenge the idea that we write from a neutral point of view. If people are afforded recognition, then we should represent that recognition. Andy Bleck's work on early comics is widely regarded in comics scholarship. He has given talks at conventions. That he has never received any money for his work seems an arbitrary reason to refuse using his work as a source. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The merging and streamlining of the policies is not supposed to be a complete rewrite of them. It's one thing to introduce an exception for pop culture, but if you want the criteria to be changed for all subject matter, then it's a major change, and I doubt it would get community support.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's precisely because we're not written by professional experts, for the most part, that we have to rely on other professionals as sources. If any group within any field can decide that someone is an "expert" within the terms of our policy, even though they've never been paid for their work as experts, we would be radically changing what kinds of sources could be used. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No. That's what we have the neutral point of view for. Our attribution policy allows people to verify we have presented information correctly. Whether content belongs in the encyclopedia is dictated by the neutral point of view policy, which this should support, but not trump. Writing from a neutral point of view is a foundation issue, and should not be superceded by this policy. Verifiability and no original research were built to support the neutral point of view policy, not to supplant it. If any group within a field can determine who an expert is, we cannot, without breaching point of view, refuse to reflect that. We should, however, present that information, where it is within context, with due weight.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you do misunderstand it. My point is that self published websites don't meet the reliable sources guidance.
