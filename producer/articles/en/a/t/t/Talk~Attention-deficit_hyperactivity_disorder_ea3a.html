<dd>Unlike <a href="../../../a/l/z/Alzheimer%27s_Disease_232b.html" title="Alzheimer's Disease">Alzheimer's Disease</a>, ADHD does not cause obvious structural changes in the brain. Alzheimer's is a progressive, destructive disease, while ADHD is a lifelong disorder whose symptoms sometimes actually disappear or be reduced over time. ADHD requires more finesse to diagnose, and diagnosis always involves taking a detailed history not only from the subject, but from individuals close to him or her (e.g. teachers, parents, spouses), and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuropsychological_test.html" title="Neuropsychological test">neuropsychological testing</a> is secondary. Alzheimer's is generally diagnosed primarily through neuropsychological testing.

<dd>Are you talking about my comment regarding ADHD or the one above regarding Alzheimer's? The one regarding Alzheimer's is the internationally accepted standard based on ICD-10, the WHO, the AMA, and many, many other objective sources. True, the multiaxial scheme is supported by the DSM, but it is the standard in behavioral science. The DSM is the leading international standard for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. Just because it is published by the American Psychiatric Association doesn't mean it isn't international. It is based on extensive international research, and is generally considered THE authority on pathopsychology/psychiatry. Even the World Health Organization had a hand in editing it. The use of the diagnostic criteria increases agreement among psychological and medical authorities. Edward Bauer intentionally reverted a factual statement to a non factual statement without providing a reference. Of course he couldn't provide a reference because there is not any reference that demonstrates that ADHD is a neurological disorder. In short, he didn't provide information that was verifiable and neutral. I notice also that you reverted it previously to this factual inaccuracy after someone else fixed it, but you didn't appear to have malicious intent, or an agenda, you just appear not to know that this is not a neurological disorder. Any person editing Wikipedia should AT LEAST know what they are talking about. Having an education is a good way to achieve this; in fact, it is the BEST way to achieve this. If not, they should not revert articles when people who know what they are talking about fix the factual errors.--<a href="../../../j/k/h/User%7EJkhamlin_516a.html" title="User:Jkhamlin">Jkhamlin</a> 20:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is strong evidence that ADD/ADHD is neurological in nature. It can be observed on PET scans, it is primarily genetic in origin, and it is incurable. Edward Hallowell, M.D., a psychiatrist specializing in ADD, has written "...Most practitioners in the field now agree that the characteristic problems of people with ADD stem from neurobiological malfunctioning" (<i>Driven to Distraction</i>, Edward M. Hallowell &amp; John J. Ratey, 1994). I support a discussion in this article of the neurological/neurobiological components of ADD/ADHD, and placing it more prominently than the very bottom of the history section. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 20:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is simply incorrect. It is not primarily genetic in origin. You can say that all day long, but that doesn't make it fact. Can you give me the locus of genes that cause it? They have found some genes "associated with it." Sure, twin studies show a stronger correlation, but that doesn't prove causality, and it doesn't demonstrate main effect. It can have a genetic influence and still be 100% behavioral. There also is not strong evidence that it is incurable. Many people respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy, and despite pharmaceutical industry claims, there is no evidence that this continues into adulthood. In fact, 45% of behavioral professionals disagree that this is even a legitimate disorder, but it is objectively covered only in peer reviewed and edited sources like the DSM, which, I would point out, exactly matches the ICD10 criteria. Many things can be observed on PET scans; that doesn't make them neurological in origin. In fact, the patterns characteristic of ADHD are not significantly different from lack of sleep. In addition, sleep has many diffent levels that manifest themselves differently in PET scans; this doesn't mean they are neurological disorders. Correlation is not causation. There is nothing linking the PET scan findings with a neurological cause for ADHD. That is why you cannot find anything objectively peer reviewed that will make this conclusion. The book you mentioned is a pop psych book written by two physicians, not an objective, peer reviewed, collaborative international work like the DSM. It is fine to discuss in the article that the opinions of a handfull of experts are that this is neurological, and this discussion is present in the history section where it is appropriate, but that is not objective, and thus the article should NOT state this neurobiological hypothesis as objective.--<a href="../../../j/k/h/User%7EJkhamlin_516a.html" title="User:Jkhamlin">Jkhamlin</a> 21:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All this discussion is pointless because the majority view of the scientific community is that ADHD is a true disorder and citations galore can affirm that this is the majority view within that community. That is all that Wiki requires for the article. We also know that ADHD is the most highly inheritable disorder out there and that it's more heritable then height and intelligence. Recent twin studies have indicated genes may have as high as a 97% influence in determining who gets ADHD.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in the notion that ADHD behaviour is strictly seen as behavioural characteristic caused by the environment. A small but vocal group has always strongly argued that point, be they alternative medicine practitioners, Scientologists, or anyone else who has a stake in discrediting or treating ADHD. Yet the argument doesn't hold. For instance, a sense of humour would be associated with genes but <i>wouldn't</i> be considered a disorder because it doesn't impair with life functioning. There is a very wide body of evidence that shows that those with ADHD are impaired with life functioning, in fact that is a criteria of diagnosing the disorder. ADHD has been the most widely studied disorder ever with over 6000 studies looking at this disorder.</p>
<p>This all reminds me of arguments against global warming. Yes, we have no direct causational link to man and global warming but a wide body of evidence allows us to make that association.</p>

<dd>I think you're overreaching your point a bit. You mentioned "citations galore" can prove your point of view, but that is not all Wikipedia requires; it requires a balancing of all the major points of view (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and that the citations actually be <i>provided</i>, not just alluded to. I have not read anything suggesting ADHD is "the" most heritable disorder, and a few twin studies are not enough to prove the genetic link; many well-designed twin studies, as well as other methods such as adoption studies, would be necessary to prove 100% heritability. I think <a href="../../../j/k/h/User%7EJkhamlin_516a.html" title="User:Jkhamlin">Jkhamlin</a> does have a point in noting the behavioral aspect of ADHD; for example, I think we can all agree that environment has a large effect on symptoms and functionality. Also, though I cannot refer to any source, I strongly suspect that many other behavioral disorders have been studied more thoroughly than ADHD, including depression and schizophrenia. That's just my intuition though. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 03:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you really believe there are a lot of scientists actively looking at many possible environmental causes of ADHD? Now that would be reaching.... You are right that you can mention other theories in a Wiki article although they shouldn't be given undo weight if they are a minority viewpoints. Dr. Russell Barkley does a nice job of summarizing the genetics of ADHD including the twin and adoption studies. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> ADHD is also the most studied disorder in child psychiatry, need I cite that also?</dd>

<dd>Sure I have no problem accepting that environment can play a role in how someone with ADHD manages their life. Good intelligent parents with great advocacy skills can do a lot for an ADHD child. But that's not the point of this discussion is it now. How many posts have we had recently in the talk section trying to refute the validly of the disorder ADHD? And none of the posts have amounted to more then a hill of beans. Have you stopped and pondered the possibility that all of those scientists may be on to something?</dd>

<dd>Apparently you don't understand the scientific process, Scuro. This all works by something called null hypothesis testing. This is the best way we have to study things, but it is not perfect. One way it is not perfect is that it lends itself to preconceptual science. All of those studies are done with the preconceived notion that ADHD is real. The ones alleging that it is neurological are done with the preconceived notion that it is neurological. Both of these lend themselves easily to two logical fallacies if you are not a well trained sceptic: 1. Petitio Principii, or circular reasoning, and 2. The fallacy of the complex question. For instance, stating that it is neurological because it responds to medication and it responds to medication because it is neurological. You seem especially quick to accept science that supports your view, and equally quick to reject that which does not. The overwhelming evidence so far has been that this is due to principles described by the behaviorist school of thought. The overwhelming consensus is that, although it responds to medication, it is a behavioral disorder, not a physiological nor anatomical one. And, you don't know what you are talking about when you say that it is the most studied disorder, or more genetically influenced than height and intelligence. You lose all credibility when you make outlandish statements like that.--<a href="../../../j/k/h/User%7EJkhamlin_516a.html" title="User:Jkhamlin">Jkhamlin</a> 22:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>On the genetic factor in the etiology</b></p>
<p>Lack of an identified locus for a responsible gene does not disprove a genetic basis for a disorder; this is a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denying_the_antecedent.html" title="Denying the antecedent">logical fallacy</a>. Furthermore, many disorders with a genetic basis likely arise from the interaction between a number of genes, and possibly from these genes' interaction with environmental factors (for example, see <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/huntgene.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/huntgene.cfm" rel="nofollow">this NIMH document</a>).</p>
<p>Based on the above, I propose discussing in some detail the view, now largely mainstream, that ADHD is a neurological condition with a genetic basis. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 21:12, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is why only people who know what they are talking about should be editing articles. First of all, just because they can pinpoint areas of the brain involved in this behavior doesn't demonstrate that this condition is cause by organic damage or defect. Otherwise, as I pointed out before, following this logic would mean that sleep would be a neurological disorder caused by brain damage. Your second reference is a fringe minority of the scientific community, by far not a majority. Just because they make provocative statements like "mounting evidence" doesn't mean there really is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I checked those other five references. Here is how you should understand that: Just because evidence of organic damage or defect CAN cause ADHD type behavior doesn't mean it DOES cause ADHD type behavior. There is an emerging disease that is still hypothetical and quite controversial call Morgellon's Disease. It is thought to be caused by a species of <i>Bacillus</i>. Almost every person suffering from this disease has ADHD. Does that mean that ADHD is an infectious disease? No, of course not. Correlation is NOT causation. Just because you can find some comorbidity doesn't mean you found the cause.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lack of a locus doesn't prove it's not genetic, but it certainly demonstrates that there is no evidence that it is, and until such loci are revealed, we cannot say that the main effect is genetic. Now, certainly, it appears that there is some genetic influence based on twin studies, etc., but that is by far the least of etiological causes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It most certainly is not "largely mainstream" that ADHD is a neurological condition with a genetic basis, it is still a fringe belief mostly held by pharmaceutical companies.--<a href="../../../j/k/h/User%7EJkhamlin_516a.html" title="User:Jkhamlin">Jkhamlin</a> 23:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pardon the pun but the question for some seems to be if neurological means the brain or the body. The brain is part of central nervous system. The Merrian Webster dictionary defines Neurology as, <i>"the scientific study of the nervous system especially in respect to its structure, functions, and abnormalities".</i> Neurology is not limited to the disease model as the NIND's website so clearly demonstrates. ADHD specifically impacts brain function down to the neuron level while impairing the ability of larger brain structures to function normally. We also see this when we similar symptoms to ADHD due frontal brain injuries. Now if someone doesn't believe this theory they are welcome post other theories with citations in the article as others have already done. These theories would belong to the minority viewpoint.--<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 20:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're interpreting neurology too broadly. Check out <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurology.html" title="Neurology">neurology</a>, which defines this as the study of <i>disorders of the nervous system</i>, which matches Merriam Websters definition. Brain <i>involvement</i> does not prove a neurological link, or we could call any behavioral or mental disorder neurological. Yet some clearly do not meet the criteria of being neurological, such as dissociative disorders. Actually, every behavior, including maladaptive ones as well as reflexes, and even <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enteric_nervous_system.html" title="Enteric nervous system">much of the working</a> of the GI tract, originates in the nervous system. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 20:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a little tricky but those behavioural disorders which have clear genetic links such as BiPolar and ADHD would be considered neurological brain disorders as noted previously. People have assumed that such disorders fall strictly under the umbrella of Psychiatry but those lines in the sand were arbitrarily drawn from previous models of mental functioning where all behaviour was thought to be caused from internal conflict and interaction with the environment. We know better now.</dd>

<p>This is very simple. What ADHD is, is defined by the DSM. The DSM does not define as ADHD as neurological. It's a mental disorder per the APA. I suggest to make the article more accurate, someone should list all the criteria from the DSM. Then be clear that when we are talking about ADHD, we are talking about a DSM-defined disorder, and what people speculate outside of the DSM is not official... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dareu2move (<a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDareu2move_b0ef.html" title="User talk:Dareu2move">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dareu2move_6a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dareu2move">contribs</a>) 02:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>It was not Psychiatrists who first clinically described ADHD. Rather George Still did so in three lectures before the Royal Academy of Physicians in 1902. George Still coined the observed behaivour of 20 children that he was clinically observing as, “volitional inhibition”. Throughout the century clinicians and researchers believed the disorder to be neurological in nature and used terms such as "minimal brain dysfunction", "Hyperkinetic impulse disorder", and "hyperactive child syndrome" to describe the disorder. It wasn't until the 1968 that Psychiatrists finally incorporated the disorder into the DSM2 based on psychoanalytical model of Freud and they first called it, "hyperkinetic reaction of childhood". Even though the average layperson's understanding comes from the the DSM, scientists have always had an interest in the disorder and continue to study the disorder. Recent neurological studies of ADHD using MRI, PET, SPECT, ERP, QEEG technology was not done by Psychiatrists. In fact this research has led to a greater understanding of ADHD and the specific areas in the brain where differences are noted between ADHD subjects and controls.</dd>

<p>The original purpose of the DSM was to take disorders that often had different names, or had differently defined symptoms, and to standardize the language and diagnostic criteria. In my opinion, it was not designed to be a SCIENTIFIC document, but to facilitate science by having everyone on the same page when doing research. If you look at the introduction to the DSM, specifically the history (I have the DSM III-R), you will see that this publication has changed with changing theoretical frameworks, and with politics. For example, homosexuality used to be a psychiatric diagnosis, but, due to pressure from special interest groups was removed. In Appendix A of the DSM III-R, proposed diagnostic categories needing further study are listed. Self Defeating Personality Disorder (which I believe may be a viable diagnosis) was not included in the DSM IV as a result of women's groups lobbying against it due to fears that this would be used by defense attorneys in rape cases to impune that the rape was the woman's fault. Appendix E has a detailed analysis of historical changes to the current edition. Other changes were made to coincide with the ICD categories. My point here is that while these labels have a history and a common usage, they are often somewhat arbitrary in their origin. I don't personally care if a disorder is "psychiatric", "mental", "behavioral", "neurologic", or whatever. I am a psychiatric nurse who has worked in the field for over 20 years. I have often told my patients that a diagnosis serves two purposes: to get the insurance company to pay, and to give the practitioner a starting place for treatment. I find this whole discussion to be non-productive. What a person needs is to have an accurate diagnosis so that they can get effective treatment and improve their lives.

<dd>It's good that we are "blowing your mind". Did you read the post where it was stated that Psychiatry didn't even codify ADHD until 1968 while research on the disorder started in 1902? I know Baughman and Breggin wants everyone to believe that ADHD is a made up disorder by the <a href="../../../a/p/a/APA_7388.html" title="APA">APA</a>. They have written so much about this, but really it is malarky. In fact, that argument was the gist behind the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritalin_class_action_lawsuits.html" title="Ritalin class action lawsuits">ritalin class action lawsuits</a> where Breggin was an advisor for council of the plaintiffs and Baughman was a cheerleader in the background.

So who is there audience? Scientologists eat their stuff up, right wing organizations and zealots love them too, and interestingly enough Muslim fundamentalist organizations have bought into their message...</dd>

<dd>Again you missed points made previously. ADHD will never be a brain disease because there is no pathogen. The environment or agents from the environment does not cause ADHD. A wide body of evidence points to the conclusion that genetics plays a highly significant role as the main cause of the disorder. We are born with it. As to the checklists validating ADHD...wrong once more. Any Doctor can diagnosis ADHD, with or without the use of a checklist. A checklist is only one tool used by a skilled practitioner to diagnosis the disorder. And a skilled practitioner also wouldn't simply only use a checklist to diagnosis the disorder. Finally when our national scientific organizations label the disorder as neurological, how can you simply discount that so quickly? Oh I forgot, Breggin said that the scientific insitutions of the US have all been bought off by the pharmaceutical companies.</dd>

<p>I really feel like people are missing the point. When a person is diagnosed with ADHD, it's because ADHD has a checklist and description used for diagnosis. Other instruments may be used to diagnose it, but the diagnosis they are seeking to confirm is * DSM *. Outside of the DSM description you are not dealing with ADHD- because all of the brain research, the med research, the behavioral research- all of it- uses the DSM definition of ADHD. So when you point at someone and say, "he has ADHD" the reason we know this is similar to someone else who is also diagnosed with ADHD is that both use the DSM for diagnosis.</p>

<dd>Are you implying that there is more information in the DSM relavent to ADHD then can be obtained on the internet. I live next door to the university library and have read the DSM section on ADHD atleast 4 times recently. Neurology deals with the central nervous system, the -ology suffix translates roughtly to study off. I do not know what these terms mean to you but, where do you think the chemical reactions behind something 'mental' are taking place?

<p>I have access to the DSM4 so what's you point? That you have special knowledge about the disorder because you have your own personal copy? Or are you suggesting subjective bias on our part due to ignorance? I'd say that bias and ignorance is a double edged sword. Several people have made many important points in this discussion area but it's like some haven't even read these posts. We simply get the same mantra repeated over and over again like a broken record. That is a display of dogma like Breggin/ Baughmans's viewpoint on ADHD which NEVER changes. Read their literature from 1990 and it is identical to what they write in 2007 even as science has told us so much about this disorder in the last 30 years.

<p>Look up the definition of mental disorder in the DSM. Look up ADHD, which is a mental disorder. Compare them. Mental disorders are complex entities that largely lack reliability and validity. The arguments are articulated throughout the scientific literature, but consider a child diagnosed with ADHD who is moved to another school and whose ADHD no longer needs treatment. Since the behavior (not lesion) is not causing problems anymore, they could eventually undiagnose such a kid.</p>
<p>Consider multiple sclerosis. The social context matters ZERO. IF you scan their head and they have lesions, they have MS. A trained neurologist can find reason to suspect that in a 5-min neurological exam and can confirm it with MRIs. Now that's a neurological. You will notice that social context matters zero and that reliability is very high.</p>
<p>These things are different so they are called different things. One is a mental disorder. The other is neurological.</p>

<p>"neurological in nature", is the exact text within the article which seems to offend some and which some have tried to delete. What does Neurological mean? Again, the Merrian Webster dictionary defines Neurology as, "the scientific study of the nervous system especially in respect to its structure, functions, and abnormalities". The brain is part of the nervous system, brain functions are impaired. How can one not accept that ADHD is not neurological in nature? You would either have to say the disorder is a FRAUD like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Baughman_c3d8.html" title="Fred Baughman">Fred Baughman</a> does, or you would have to believe that ADHD is caused by other regions of the body besides the nervous system, or finally you would have to believe that brain functions are not impaired. But...again, it doesn't matter what we believe because there are numerous highly reliable sources that state the majority view and that majority view is that ADHD is neurological brain disorder. Where does this majority view come from? Not from anecdotal stories about children being moved from school to school but rather this majority viewpoint is based firmly on the overwhelming and wide body of evidence of scientific research. Call this a joke, nazism, or what not...but it keeps zealot and crackpot minority viewpoints from overwhelming Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I will defend the inclusion of "minor" contributions that ring true because the uniformed may first turn to Wikipedia for information.

<p>This is so simple.</p>
<p>ADHD is a mental disorder. You can look up the disorder in the definitive textbook of mental disorders, the DSM.

<p>No this is not true. This speaks to why ADHD is controversial and why it is a mental disorder and not 'neurological'.</p>
<p>For someone to have a mental disorder, the symptoms MSUT be negatively impacting their life in some way. Their social context MUST be examined. If a child is hyper, or has the entire checklist of symptoms, but they are homeschooled and have patient parents, and no one is bothered by these symptoms, then you shouldn't diagnose ADHD. No matter how closely they meet the criteria!</p>
<p>A disease like MS which is neurological- well they could care less about social context. If you have the signs and lesions then you have the disease. It doesn't matter at ALL how it impacts your life.</p>
<p>Being designated a 'mental disorder' rather than a 'neurological disorder' says nothing about the severity of the syndrome (schizophrenia is a mental disorder and is NOT treated or diagnosed by neurologists).....but it is the most accurate way to portray it.</p>

<p>In my personal experience with ADD (I have it, and it runs in my family), it seems to present itself less as a general lack of focus, but a tendency to hyperfocus paired with the inability to prioritize and/or cognitively select the subject of focus. When I was younger, I tended to have the typical 'daydreaming' scenario in class, where my mind just wandered everywhere. Now I have more of a tendency to focus intently on things, but not always what is appropriate or rational. Instead of working on a proposal I have due (which cognitively should have a very high priority), I can spend endless hours on Wikipedia (significantly lower priority, but still requiring a high level of focus). Instead of paying attention in a lecture, I may instead work on deriving an extended proof for a problem for a different class, and thus completely miss what's going on in the present class. I have heard others referencing ADD as a hyperfocus disorder as well as an attention-deficit disorder. Perhaps this is something for the researchers here to discuss. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.89.197.101_6b9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.89.197.101">129.89.197.101</a> (talk) 12:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>If you are looking for consensus scientific opinion, then here it is. ADHD is a mental disorder. That's why it is in the DSM. People can suggest that it is neurological and research should continue on these fronts but if it was a MAJORITY opinion that ADHD was neurological, it wouldn't be in the DSM.</p>
<p>All opinions are not equal and just because you can find a scientist who says something on the web, doesn't mean it is true.</p>
<p>I'm done with the broken-record stuff, but bottom line is that the people writing this page don't seem to understand what a mental disorder is, and that seems awfully important. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_146.201.100.221_7c94.html" title="Special:Contributions/146.201.100.221">146.201.100.221</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/6/User_talk%7E146.201.100.221.html" title="User talk:146.201.100.221">talk</a>) 16:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>This all goes back to the instance that ADHD only exists in the DSM4 and the Psychiatrists who "made up" the disorder. Some insisted that it couldn't be "neurological in nature" if it was only a "shopping list" of symptoms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've got no problem with ADHD being listed in the DSM4. Different groups with different perspectives want to call ADHD different things. Some want to call it a behavioural disorder, others a neurological disorder, and yet still others want to call it a developmental disorder. Some use a combination of those terms. In Europe where they use the ICD-10 of WHO, and the DSM4 is not used, it is called hyperkinic disorder and placed in the broader classification of conduct disorders. For the longest time the ICD-10 viewed the symptoms as being caused by organic brain damage. It doesn't really matter so much who describes ADHD. Simply we have a long documented history of patterns of impaired behaviour with ADHD. It was first clinically described in 1902. Psychiatrists didn't make up ADHD in 1968 when it was first encoded in the DSM2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That consensus statement of 2002 supports the notion that ADHD is "neurological in nature" and that is why the consensus statement was originally used as a citation for those three words. This was the segment from the opening sentence that was deleted several times and which started these many discussions on the subject. Some were strongly opposed to the inclusion of those three words. This is what all this has been about. Some still want those three words removed but there is ample and highly reliable and citable support for those three words. For me also I hope this is the <i>last time</i> we kick this particular can.</dd>

<p>Oh, it makes sense now. If you take an international consensus statement signed selectively by clinicians who treat ADHD as a biological disorder, maybe THEY do define it as neurological. But that international consensus statement is by no means an unbiased document.</p>
<p>The NIH consensus statement from 1998 defines ADHD a "behavioral disorder" <a href="http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf" class="external free" title="http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf</a> ...the word "neurological" does not appear in the text of that document.</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys used the International Consenus statement as one of fact!!! That's the opinion of only those who see ADHD in a certain way. It's an ADVOCACY document.</p>
<p>THe NIH review above does not even use the word 'neurological.'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>St. Peter is doing the tour of heaven for all the newcomers. He shows them the pearly gates, god's throne, and the stables of the horses for the four horsemen. After several hours of touring they enter the backlot of heaven where there is a larger building with many rooms. St. Peter shhheshhhs everyone as they walk by the building. After they are a safe distance from the building one of the new comers asks St. Peter why they had to be so quiet near the building. St. Peter replied, "that building holds all the religious zealots in separate rooms and we have to be quiet because they all think they are the only ones here in heaven".</p>
<p>Okay, ADHD is a behaviour disorder period. It doesn't exist outside of the DSM4. It was made up by Psychiatrists who were in cahoots with the drug companies so everyone could get rich. No one can be trusted, they have all been corrupted by drug money...Wikipedia too!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>That's a good joke but I think people are missing the point. It doesn't minimize the severity of ADHD, or say much about drug companies or psychiatrists to say that ADHD is a mental disorder. It's just a fact that NIH calls it a behavioral disorder and that all the research cited throughout the piece uses the DSM definition of ADHD, therefore what else could it be referring to?</p>
<p>If ADHD is not the existence of the DSM symptoms, what is it? Those criteria are the only thing that make it possible for it to be reliable- not that it is in actual practice, but that's another issue.</p>
<p>It's not 'JUST' anything...! Schizophrenia is serious and it's a mental disorder- it's not considered a neurological disorder. Same thing with major depression, PTSD, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder. None of them are 'neurological' and they are as serious, actually more so, than ADHD.</p>
<p>'Neurological' sounds good but is not correct.</p>
<p>If you all are using the international consensus statement signed by the proponents of medication treatment of ADHD, I thin that's a huge error. Not just for this part of the entry but any part.</p>
<p>And between the NIH consensus statement and the DSM, I think it's very clear that ADHD is a MENTAL DISORDER, period.</p>

<dd>Funny that talks in the discussion area about ADHD being "neurological in nature" has now been used to characterize the article as "not being stable". Good one! We have consistently argued that ADHD is "neurological in nature", over a lengthy period of time.

<p>User:68.35.248.242, the consensus statement that you refer to is not the consensus statement used as a citation. The consensus that you referred to of 1998 is titled, "Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)". The consensus used as a citation from 2002 is called, "International Consensus Statement on ADHD". The 2002 document makes a strong case that ADHD is real, in the brain, and that there is a good deal of neurological evidence showing the genetic contribution to the epidemiology of the disorder. Specifically from the document, "This is why leading international scientists, such as the signers below, recognize the mounting evidence of neurological and genetic contributions to this disorder". --<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 12:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, work... Too much time has been spent on fruitless discussions with masters of the red herring. In defending the notion that ADHD is neurological in nature I've learned a few things while researching. ADHD and Tourettes have some differences. One of the major differences is that ADHD appears to have some heterogeneous populations within the definition and that makes it difficult to make difinitive declarations about the disorder. For instance one can get the diagnosis if one has had a brain injury. There also seems to be a distinct population known as "SCT". One term that is used by researchers is "neurodevelopmental". I like that better then neurobehavioural because not all ADHD fits the disruptive behaviour profile.</p>
<p>Thanks for example of the Tourettes page, I'll use it as an example for further edits. I'm still kind of green with regard conventions of Wiki. --<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 16:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tourette's populations are not homogeneous either&#160;:-) Notice how the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors is dealt with in that article. The non-genetic factors impacting upon the genetic vulnerability to the condition are more strongly proven in ADHD than in TS, but it is still a neurological condition nonetheless (both are, with environmental impacts). At any rate, I agree about the time wasted on some issues, when this article has massive deficiencies that need to be addressed, including undue weight to speculative items while the serious research isn't even covered. I'm going to be traveling for three weeks, but let me know if I can help after that. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 16:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe you are incorrect. Here is why.</p>
<p>The viewpoints of others are irrelevant to what I am saying and I believe those that author and edit this site frequently write off any criticism as coming from a radical point of view and do not stop to consider the validity of claims. I am not Fred Baughman.</p>
<p>If you go to the NIH Consensus Statement on ADHD (at <a href="http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110html.htm" class="external free" title="http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110html.htm" rel="nofollow">http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110html.htm</a>) you will see that it defines ADHD. This is the National Institute of Health's definition of ADHD.</p>
<p>The Internation Consensus Statement on ADHD is simply the point of view of some ADHD researchers. Indeed, some of them are very prominent. But it has a clear bias. They cite no evidence to demonstrate an empirically-driven change in position from 1998 to 2002.</p>
<p>To say that NIH's conclusions should be discarded in lieu of this open letter is very interersting and difficult to justiy. On what basis would you conclude that NIH is wrong (the word 'neurological' does not appear in the text of the document).</p>
<p>It seems to me that scientific consensus is important when it supports people's point of view, but when it doens't, other sources are quickly found.</p>
<p>Neither the 1998 NIH statement nor the DSM define ADHD as neurological. Yet it still defined that way here on the basis of this open letter.</p>

<p><br />
You say, "I believe those that author and edit this site frequently write off any criticism as coming from a radical point of view and do not stop to consider the validity of claims".</p>
<p>Where does this validity that you speak of come from, I ask? Certainly we are not to take your unsupported thoughts and insert them into the article? Find the references from national institutions, respected publications, or respected members in the field. So far we have no support for what you say. Since there are no references why is it not correct to classify them as controversial especially since many of the ideas stated originally can from Scientology and the Antipsychiatry movement?</p>
<p>I'm not even going justify your NIH comments with a response because you are once again playing games by totally ignoring the 2002 international consensus statement when you made any of your conclusions. How can you so blatantly ignore such evidence even when it has been pointed out to you directly several times?

See Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigenetics.html" title="Epigenetics">epigenetics</a>. As far as I am aware, epigenetic occurrences with ADHD has not even casually been made.

<p>I've ignored no evidence. I've made the point before but my post was deleted. There is a difference between NIH, the DSM, and an open advocacy letter authored by scientists with a certain point of view. It's appropriate to note what they said, somewhere in the article, but to think that they have the accurate definition of what ADHD is- in contradiction to NIH and DSM- makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>There are levels of evidence. Certainly that letter goes down the list from DSM and NIH. I am concerned that people editing his page seem to think that just because a letter says it is authoritative, and it is available on the web, it is.</p>
<p>In fact DSM and NIH should be used as authoritative sources and alternate points of view might be noted.</p>
<p>The problems with evaluating evidence can be found throughout the article, but the fact that it leads off with a definition contradicint NIH and DSM is a pretty big problem. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.35.248.242_c89d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.35.248.242">68.35.248.242</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.35.248.242.html" title="User talk:68.35.248.242">talk</a>) 21:55, 15 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>"neurological in nature" is cited by an excellent source in the article, that is all Wikipedia wants. Period. As Wikipedians that is all we should care about. There is no debate because once again we have no citations for any other viewpoint. I welcome new viewpoints that can be referenced.

<p>I feel like this page really needs an editor to visit it.</p>
<p>To restate the issues that have been re-stated again and again:</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) defines what ADHD is- there are hundreds of experts that come to a consensus. This consensus document does not say that ADHD is neurological in nature.</p>
<p>Also as referenced above, the Consensus Statement from the National Institute of Health in 1998 did not conclude that it was neurological, and there has not been any great findings from 1998-present in terms of etiology. (The DSM definition for instance, did not change).</p>
<p>People keep inserting that ADHD is a neurological disorder because it involves the brain. There is a consensus statement from pro-medication advocates that calls it such but this document is simply an open letter and has no authority.</p>
<p>At present ADHD is a mental disorder. This is how it is classified in the DSM, in abnormal psychology textbooks, in graduate psychopathology courses, etc., etc.</p>
<p>There has been constant back-and-forth over this VERY simple point and people keep inserting statements that are speculative. Informatoin can be found on the web that says that ADHD is neurological but this does not mean this is scientific consensus or factual.</p>
<p>Someone should revise this page so that includes the DSM definition and the NIH consensus information is great also. If they want to include the statement that some people think it is neurological, fine, but the governing body in charge of defining the disorder, and the largest health research organization on the planet- neither find that it is neurological.</p>
<p>You're grossly misleading anyone who visits this page.</p>

<i>To restate the issues from the perspective that the phrase "neurological in nature" should be left in the article.</i></p>
<p>-several editors over a period of time have deleted the words "neurological in nature", in the opening sentence of the main article. The only citations given for doing so was the DSM4 and the 1998 document entitled, "Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)". Both documents are used to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD. They are not authoritative or summative documents about the nature of ADHD.</p>
<p>-four excellent citations are used in the article to support the contention that ADHD is "neurological in nature" which includes the 2002 International Consensus Statement on ADHD which states, "This is why leading international scientists, such as the signers below, recognize the mounting evidence of neurological and genetic contributions to this disorder". Three other citations come from highly respected national mental health institutions.--<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 12:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already commented waaaay above that the distinction between the two sciences is often arbitrary and artificial. You are finding more significance than there is for this situation. Also, the main reason you are getting so much resistance with this is because you are trying to change the wording as an attack on the topic of ADHD. Maybe that's just my wild speculations for your motives, maybe I'm not assuming good faith, but looking at your contribs I'd bet you're here to push a POV <i>far</i> more than actually improve the article. The POV pushing is obvious, that's why we revert you.

<p>I'm not a scientist, but I do understand that a significant factor in the discussion and editing of the ADHD article centers on making sure that the information contained therein is as scientific as possible. As I understand the scientific process, peer review by persons with expertise in the area in question is significantly important. As I read the discussion (I'm new to this aspect of Wikipedia) I found myself wanting to know the credentials of each participant to help me weigh what they had to say. Are the statements and edits in the article coming from actual peers (authorities in the medical field) or by people who just have a well-educated (and definitely better educated than me) interest?</p>
<p>As one who wrestles with ADHD on a daily basis (I have it and so does one of my children), I have a strong desire to see this article meet the highest standards of scientific credibility possible. As the son, brother, and brother-in-law of pediatricians (one of whom is an expert in genetics research), I understand that medicine is indeed a science and that science constantly reviews what it knows in light of new information and research. A biology professor friend of mine confirms that true science is never afraid to say, "Here's where the limits of our knowledge are. Beyond this, we don't know ... but we're trying to find out."</p>

<p>Every statement that I have made can be backed up by summations of peer reviewed evidence. I don't cite every point that I make because it is time consuming. If you do look at the article, some of the statements are not definitive. This is because we don't know some things about ADHD and because the diagnosis of ADHD may encompasses two or more conditions. --<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 16:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Acknowledged. As I reflect on what I perused that prompted my previous comment, it seems to me that most of the debate I read centers on 1) exactly where the limits of the scientific data are; and, 2) proper interpretation and implications of the data we do have. Having said all that, even though it is no longer considered GA, it is still very informative. 66.191.222.123 17:52, 20 March 2007 (UTC)MoDrig3</p>

<dd>What are the limits of scientific data? There is an abundance of evidence that indicates ADHD is a real disorder which significantly impairs those with the disorder. The exact mechanisms of the disorder are unknown at this time but again there is an abundance of evidence that indicates that the disorder has a very strong herditability factor...even more so then height or intelligence.</dd>

<p>You answered the question about limits in your response: "The exact mechanisms of the disorder are unknown ..." I just glanced through the course link you gave. I look forward to reading it at length in the future.</p>
<p>As the owner of an ADD brain and the father of a teenager who wrestles with ADD as well as Asperger's Syndrome, OCD (focus-shift, not ritual behavioral), and a non-verbal LD I will continue to reference this article regularly. I recommended it in a talk I gave last night to our local NAMI chapter on my personal experiences with ADD.</p>

<dd>The exact mechanism for all disorders are unknown.
