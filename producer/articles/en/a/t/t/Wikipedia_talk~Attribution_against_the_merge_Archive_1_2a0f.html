<p>(Adding comment at top) For more than one reason, I've decided to request that nobody except myself edit this user page. Everyone is welcome to post on this talk page. People are still very much welcome to submit material to go on the page -- just post it here on the talk page and I will try to develop an essay based on it. I hope soon to move the contents to policy space as was done with SlimVirgin's essay. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 21:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>In brief: If you're against the merge, go ahead and edit!</s></p>
<p><s>Details: You may change the headings of the sections, but try to keep the number of sections and length of each section reasonably small; more detailed information can go in subpages in my or other user's userspace.</s></p>
<p><s>If you are in favour of the merge and in favour of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> as the merged version, you may not edit this page. If you are against the merge or against some aspect of how it's being carried out, you may edit here, except that I reserve the right to impose additional restrictions including restricting or banning specific individuals. Individuals should respect the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> rule, except that as the user whose user space this is in, I am not limited by that rule but can do any number of reverts. I intend to try to set aside personal biases and help develop this page into a balance, concise summary of the anti-merge positions including positions I don't personally agree with. Some of the things I write into the page may be my personal views, and some of the things I write into the page may be views I don't agree with but that I believe one or more other users agree with. Feel free to comment on these rules here or on my talk page. Users are also free to use this as a regular talk page to discuss the main page.</s> --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do realize how <i>wrong</i> this is, don't you?... If this were just your own personal rant page I would not really mind ... as a sub-page of your user page you can say what you want... however, since you have also asked others to come here and comment at this page, it is more than just a personal user page. As you have advertized it, it belongs to the community... and, thus, should be subject to all of the rules of wikipedia. To say some people may not edit, when you have invited them to do so is not the wikipedia way. It also comes across as being <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>

<dd>It is supposed to present arguments against the merger. You seem to support the merger.

<p>At the top of this page, it says "This has been copied from User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy."</p>
<p>Then in the first section, it says "For more than one reason, I've decided to request that nobody except myself edit this user page."</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out what these two statements mean together. Which of the following three is being said?</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedians other than Coppertwig should not edit <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_Stability_of_policy_67e2.html" title="User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy">User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy</a>. Nor should they edit <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_against_the_merge_5e43.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge">Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge</a>.</li>
<li>Coppertwig made a copy of his page once, but now the two have forked. Wikipedians other than Coppertwig should not edit <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_Stability_of_policy_67e2.html" title="User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy">User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy</a>. But they are free to edit <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_against_the_merge_5e43.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge">Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge</a>, which is now the "active version" of this essay.</li>
<li>Coppertwig will be periodically copying his page over this one. Thus Wikipedians other than Coppertwig should not edit <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_Stability_of_policy_67e2.html" title="User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy">User:Coppertwig/Stability of policy</a>. And it is a waste of time to edit <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_against_the_merge_5e43.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge">Wikipedia:Attribution/against the merge</a>, since that page will be overwritten periodically.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an important question. The <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_Poll_410f.html#How_to_participate_in_this_poll" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll">How to participate in this poll</a> section of the page <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_Poll_410f.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll">Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll</a> points to this essay, and so this essay helps all voters understand the issues. It seems unfair for Coppertwig to be the primary source of information about this poll. — <span style="font: small-caps 12px times;"><a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a></span> <sup style="font: small-caps 10px arial; color: #129dbc;">(<a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawrence_King_1619.html" title="User talk:Lawrence King"><span style="color: #129dbc;">talk</span></a>)</sup> 21:48, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The argument about changing the meaning of links to the page comes from user Jimbo Wales. I wonder whether it would be better to mention the name and maybe give a quote (or at least a link to a quote). --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have provided some links and people can find who said them if they follow the links, but given Jimbo's wide range of comments and his wish to see consensus, I wouldn't mention his name explicitly; just my opinion. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudiovideo_858d.html" title="User:Audiovideo">Audiovideo</a> 01:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>In my opinion, eventually all the links directly from the page should be to organized versions of arguments, not to talk pages with many messages posted on them.

<dd>Change this to be an Appendix of the main page, so everything is on one page? Or shorten each subitem and make it a section of the main page?

<p>Your "false" and my "true" may coincide. But of course you've had that pointed out to you enough times now, and simply ignore it. The conflict on WP:V is between those who believe that there is an "objective" truth and those who more realistically believe "truth" is negotiated among people. Wikipedia reflects the latter notion, at least in principle. If you don't like it, you really need to consider whether you should find a fork that believes in a truth you're more comfortable with. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice point. Do you think we could usefully and simply include the breadth of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page in this policy definition? Does "Verifiability, not truth" <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_definition.html" title="Operational definition">operationally</a> mean "Verifiability, but represent faithfully the standard of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> used by the Reliable Source's profession"?

<dd>In reply to Grace Note: I'll try to do a better job of demonstrating my understanding (such as it is) of others' arguments. I think you mean that I may believe something is false while you believe that the same thing is true. Of course I realize that that kind of thing happens frequently. I'm sorry that I only have partial understanding of what you're trying to say next. You seem to be saying that there is a split between those who believe in objective truth and those who don't believe there is such a thing as objective truth. No, wait, I don't think that's what you mean. I think more likely you mean that everyone actually thinks there's a real world out there with specific characteristics, although we don't necessarily know what they are, but when doing things like writing an encyclopedia there's no use trying to get everyone to agree on what the objective truth is, so a subjective truth is negotiated instead. Sorry, that doesn't sound quite right either. The fact is, I don't quite know what you mean, or how specifically that applies to the wording of the policy. You think I might be happier on some other forum; actually, I like Wikipedia a lot.</dd>
<dd>Of course I understand that editors will often disagree about what is or is not true, and that the Verifiability or Attribution policy helps save a lot of time because people don't have to keep arguing about what is true, which is sometimes a short, effective discussion but sometimes goes on and on with nobody being persuaded of anything, but they can just see whether the material is in an acceptable source or not. I have no problem with that and am not trying to change that. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further reply: In a given situation, if there are no misunderstandings (as there often are), it's possible to establish to what extent each editor believes something to be true, and whether it's stated in an acceptable source. I think getting agreement on "OK, you believe it's false and I believe it's true" is fairly easy, probably easier than finding an acceptable source, and much easier than arguing until both editors agree on it, which could go on for several lifetimes if it's something like the existence of God. When there's disagreement, usually the editors insert prose attributions, and everybody is satisfied that the Wikipedia article is not asserting false statements. None of this logically requires that Wikipedia policy say any more than "whether it is attributable to a reliable source," period. Saying "not whether it is true" is unnecessary. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rednblu, that's a very interesting point. I think Wikipedia does quite well in that sense on scientific pages, particularly the technical ones. It presents the SPOV quite faithfully, mostly because those pages are written by practitioners. Few are going to find that exceptionable because, apart from blanket statements, few opposing viewpoints are available on specific subjects (what I mean is, many people do not believe that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, but they have not taken a view on <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplodocus.html" title="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a> specifically, so they are not represented in that article). Even if one thought that was problematic, I cannot see any hope of winning the discussion over it. I think that articles of that type have in any case a kind of synthetic truth. They are written in the language of science about science. The language of science can be taken as axiomatic for those articles. If you allow the language of science to be axiomatic, you allow the articles as true so long as they follow from that language. If you do not allow it, you do not allow that the articles are true. I think we should state that explicitly though and not pretend otherwise.</p>
<p><br />
Our pages on "pseudoscience" are presented in the same light though, which is problematic, and I know that you have written about that. The same is true of pages on religion, which is presented from a rather nonneutral position. In neither of these areas is it as clear that we are using a particular language or standard as an axiom. We seem to be writing from a much broader reference point.</p>
<p>The position of most of the policy writers here creates a de facto operational definition of truth, without stating that openly (which is something I take issue with in the discussion on reliable sources at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_and_undue_weight_ff95.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources and undue weight">Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources_and_undue_weight</a>). Ultimately, we take the position that what the MSM reports, what scientific papers state and academics write is, if not true, <i>correct</i>, and anything else is not. I don't think a truly NPOV encyclopaedia can take any stand on the truth, and our policies on NPOV and sourcing are poor in this regard <i>if our aim is truly to be neutral</i> rather than to reflect the status quo wisdom of the day. For me, this devalues Wikipedia, making it simply a poor man's Britannica. But most editors here seem quite happy to be poor man's encyclopaedians, and run scared from vision or challenge. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coppertwig, I am saying that we cannot address objective truth because no such thing exists. I think you have entirely missed my point, which is that you cannot legislate against including "false" information if there is no way to measure what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>Here is an example. The article on the battle of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Englefield%2C_Berkshire_01be.html" title="Englefield, Berkshire">Englefield, Berkshire</a> said (before I corrected it) that the Saxons were led by King Alfred. They were led by Aethelwulf, a local noble. But were they? There are sources that say so, and I can attribute my edit to them (if I have to; naturally, facts like this are rarely attributed in Wikipedia). But if someone were to reinsert that the forces were led by Alfred, what then?</p>
<p>Have they included "false" information? I cannot know. My sources say Aethelwulf but I don't <i>know</i> that. It might be me who has inserted false information.</p>
<p>I recognise in your reply that you are trying to suggest that the policy should emphasise that I need only be able to attribute my claim. Which I agree with. But you are claiming elsewhere that we should not be explicit that we do not make claims to truth. I think it is <b>essential</b> that we do not.</p>
<p>Think about my example. Think about what it means for it to be true that Aethelwulf led the Saxons. There must be an "objective reality" (we'll allow that for argument's sake). There must have been events in Englefield in 870. But who owns the truth about it? What if Aethelwulf wrote a memoir? Would that be "true"? How can you know? See my note to rednblu above: where our articles are based on subject-specific quasi-axiomatic languages, there is a possibility of referring to the "truth", so long as the "truth" is understood to be wholly dependent on the axioms in question. Otherwise, it is pointless to talk about it <i>at all</i>, except to warn as strongly as we can that we are not dealing in it here.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

This is something that is present in RS, is absent in ATT and ATTFAQ, and that Rednblu considers important to have in any replacement for RS.
