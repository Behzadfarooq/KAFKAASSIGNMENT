<p>Throughout the centuries, widely varying human <b>attitudes toward wolves</b> have been highly-charged and often colored by fear and misunderstanding.

<p>In many ancient <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">myths</a>, the wolf is portrayed as being brave, honorable, or intelligent. The best examples of such portrayals are demonstrated by some of the stories of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas_3e71.html" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a>. Elsewhere, the wolf was revered as the totem animal of Ancient Rome (see <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulus_and_Remus_a434.html" title="Romulus and Remus">Romulus and Remus</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/p/Lupercalia.html" title="Lupercalia">Lupercalia</a>). In <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_society_0982.html" title="Proto-Indo-European society">Proto-Indo-European society</a>, the wolf was most likely associated with the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrior.html" title="Warrior">warrior</a> class, and the word itself was subject to <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo_deformation.html" title="Taboo deformation">taboo deformation</a> (the Latin <i>lupus</i> being an example of a mutated form of the original <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_language_3a39.html" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European</a> <i>*wlkwos</i>).</p>

Depiction of a werewolf.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The wolf has typically assumed a more negative image in legend, however, including in most of modern western folklore. Specifically, the wolf has often been portrayed as a creature to be feared. Two iconic examples of this image are the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bad_Wolf_6701.html" title="Big Bad Wolf">Big Bad Wolf</a> and the <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werewolf.html" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> (a human that transforms into a wolf by means of magic or a curse, and who is shunned and reviled by the rest of society). <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_mythology.html" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a> prominently includes three malevolent wolves, in particular: the giant <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenrisulfr.html" title="Fenrisulfr">Fenrisulfr</a>, eldest child of <a href="../../../l/o/k/Loki.html" title="Loki">Loki</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angrboda.html" title="Angrboda">Angrboda</a> who was feared and hated by the <a href="../../../%C3%A6/s/i/%C3%86sir.html" title="Æsir">Æsir</a>, and Fenrisulfr's children, <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skoll.html" title="Skoll">Skoll</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hati.html" title="Hati">Hati</a>, who, according to legend, will devour the sun and moon at <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnarok.html" title="Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a>.</p>
<p>Despite their often negative image, wolves have periodically been credited in mythology, fiction, and reality with adopting, nursing, and raising human <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral_children.html" title="Feral children">feral children</a>, with the most famous examples being <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulus_and_Remus_a434.html" title="Romulus and Remus">Romulus and Remus</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/w/Mowgli.html" title="Mowgli">Mowgli</a> of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jungle_Book_c746.html" title="The Jungle Book">The Jungle Book</a></i>, respectively. In Mongolian mythology, the Mongols believe that they are descended from a male Gray Wolf and a white doe. In fact, the Mongols' greatest hero <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> called his people 'Clan of the Gray Wolf'.</p>
<p>In Central Asian nations such as that of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongols.html" title="Mongols">Mongols</a>, the wolf is a revered animal. The shamanistic Turkic peoples even believed they were descendants of wolves in Turkic legends. The legend of <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asena.html" title="Asena">Asena</a> is an old Turkish myth that tells of how the Turkish people were created. In Northern China a small Turkic village was raided by Chinese soldiers, but one small baby was left behind. An old she-wolf with a sky-blue mane named Asena found the baby and nursed him, then the she-wolf gave birth to half wolf, half human cubs therefore the Turkish people were born. Also in Turkic mythology it is believed that a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Wolf_07d4.html" title="Gray Wolf">Gray Wolf</a> showed the Turks the way out of their legendary homeland <i>Ergenekon</i>, which allowed them to spread and conquer their neighbours.<a href="http://www.byegm.gov.tr/yayinlarimiz/kitaplar/turkiye2003/content/english/434-435.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.byegm.gov.tr/yayinlarimiz/kitaplar/turkiye2003/content/english/434-435.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.discoverturkey.com/english/kultursanat/h-nevruz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discoverturkey.com/english/kultursanat/h-nevruz.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://turkmeniya.tripod.com/id13.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://turkmeniya.tripod.com/id13.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>From colonial times right up through World War II, the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilderness.html" title="Wilderness">wilderness</a> was perceived as something to be conquered, settled, and cultivated, as through <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifest_Destiny_e614.html" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> or by man's inherent worldly right. Wolves, for a time, were partially valued for their fur, but in the majority of circumstances (and in some instances today), they were viewed as wholly worthless and decidedly despicable creatures. Humans destroyed the vast majority of their habitat and food source in North America, replacing forests and prairies with <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farms</a> and wild <a href="../../../u/n/g/Ungulate.html" title="Ungulate">ungulates</a> with <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a>. When the wolves preyed on what little of their natural prey was left, hunters complained; when they then began preying on the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, ranchers, of course, complained, too.</p>
<p>Eventually, American society's perception of the wolf was one defined by indifference, misapprehension, or outright hatred. With few vouching for them, wolves and other predators were destroyed en masse, resulting in a so-called "hunters' <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise.html" title="Paradise">paradise</a>" free from competing predators. To accomplish this, there was no limit to the extent hunters and trappers were willing to go in order to kill predators in large numbers. Besides <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trap.html" title="Trap">traps</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trapping_%28Animal%29_45f7.html" title="Trapping (Animal)">snares</a>, and other mechanical methods, hunters would line carcasses with <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">poison</a> (usually <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strychnine.html" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>), which would then kill the animals that preyed upon it. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpse.html" title="Corpse">corpses</a> of affected animals would then themselves become poisonous, which tended to result in a rather long chain reaction of death. Essentially, wolves, like many predators during that time, managed to garner an incredible amount of hatred for a great variety of reasons, many of which were unfounded or embellished so as to fuel public cynicism and expedite the wolves' removal; and, indeed, they were removed from the contiguous 48 states almost completely over the subsequent decades (a small population in northern <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> was the only exception to the otherwise successful extirpation campaign).</p>

<p>In the early twentieth century, some significant research performed in the blossoming young field of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> led to an important realization about the relationship between predators and the land. <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldo_Leopold_d9dc.html" title="Aldo Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a>, a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botanist.html" title="Botanist">botanist</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forester.html" title="Forester">forester</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> of the early twentieth century (who is now world-renowned), was at the forefront of this new science. Early in his career during the first quarter of the twentieth century, he encountered a pack of wolves in the mountains of the southwest. He described his encounter thus:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">We saw what we thought was a doe fording the torrent, her breast awash in white water. When she climbed the bank toward us and shook out her tail, we realized our error: it was a wolf. A half-dozen others, evidently grown pups, sprang from the willows and all joined in a welcoming melee of wagging tails and playful maulings. What was literally a pile of wolves writhed and tumbled in the center of an open flat at the foot of our rimrock.
<p>In those days we had never heard of passing up a chance to kill a wolf. In a second we were pumping lead into the pack, but with more excitement than accuracy; how to aim a steep downhill shot is always confusing. When our rifles were empty, the old wolf was down, and a pup was dragging a leg into impassable side-rocks.</p>
<p>We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.</p>

Encounters similar to Leopold's were being repeated throughout North America. Early ecologists were the first to recognize the fundamentally flawed rationale behind the creating of the "hunters' paradise." It soon became apparent that overzealous deer, lacking predators, could cause unimaginable devastation to a landscape by browsing every edible bush, tree, and shrub, thereby preventing new growth from ever reaching prominence and ultimately reducing entire ranges to a state of utter desolation. In other words, <i>"...just as a deer herd lives in mortal fear of its wolves, so does a mountain live in mortal fear of its deer</i>. (Leopold)" Eventually, the deer herd itself would starve of its own inordinateness.</p>
<p>After Leopold's death, the groundbreaking research of wolf scientists such as <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farley_Mowat_6ff7.html" title="Farley Mowat">Farley Mowat</a>, <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._David_Mech_bb1f.html" title="L. David Mech">L. David Mech</a>, and Adolph Murie helped to shift the wolf's image to that of an intelligent and affectionate creature essential to the proper functioning of a conventional North American <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecosystem.html" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. This awareness widely exposed the beneficial nature of wolves, and helped lead to their eventual endangered classification and subsequent <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reintroduction_of_wolves.html" title="Reintroduction of wolves">reintroduction</a> efforts. Accordingly, while the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a> of wolves as malicious, wanton killers and vile, worthless beasts still has influence in certain circles, a significant portion of the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public.html" title="Public">public</a> has developed a more positive opinion of wolves as interesting, valuable, and noble animals. Society as a whole has begun to realize the morality in attempting to make up for centuries of undue persecution, and knows of the justification behind trying to bring some ecological integrity back to the American landscape.</p>

<p>Since the late 1960s, wolves have been officially protected in the U.S. in some form or another by a national endangered species bill, the latest of which is the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973_32cc.html" title="Endangered Species Act of 1973">Endangered Species Act of 1973</a>. Additionally, in a somewhat novel development, they have been allowed to naturally propagate in the upper <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a>, and have been reintroduced to areas in <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. In <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where they are not protected by the Act, their populations continue to be controlled (usually by aerial hunting) in an effort to increase yields for hunters.</p>
<p>Today, organizations such as the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Wolf_Center_63cf.html" title="International Wolf Center">International Wolf Center</a>, Defenders of Wildlife, and <a href="../../../w/o/l/Mission%7E_Wolf_372a.html" title="Mission: Wolf">Mission: Wolf</a> continue to attempt to educate people about the true nature of wolves, and such action has proven helpful to past reintroduction efforts, especially in places like <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowstone_National_Park_578c.html" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>.</p>
<p>The large amount of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> done on wolves in the last half <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century.html" title="Century">century</a> has also helped to educate people in a way that helps them to realize how <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociologically</a> similar humans are to wolves, and how people have little to fear from these naturally cautious, complex animals. Biologists L. David Mech, Rolf Peterson and Luigi Boitani have arguably been the three leaders in contemporary wolf research.</p>
<p>This onslaught of pro-wolf <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity.html" title="Publicity">publicity</a>, including that which has been procured from nature <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentaries.html" title="Documentaries">documentaries</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">books</a>, has undoubtedly played a role in changing attitudes for the better. Such mediums tend to emphasize the wolf as an affectionate, devoted parent and fraternal animal that is deserving of our respect and protection as integral members of our global <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity.html" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.</p>
