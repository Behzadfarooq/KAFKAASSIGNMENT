If nobody comes up with one for a few weeks, this entry should probably be moved to "<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-at-law.html" title="Attorney-at-law">Attorney-at-law</a>". There is already a page of that title now, which had a redirect to "lawyer" instead of here - which is an even worse imprecision - I changed that one to redirect here in the meantime. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 01:42, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur that the correct usage is with hyphens. I am also appalled at how bad the text of this article has become since someone split it off the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">Lawyer</a> article (as anyone can see from the history of the Lawyer article, I originally drafted much of this text for that article). Now that I have thoroughly researched and rewritten Lawyer, I may have to fix this one next!</dd>
<dd>Here is what I am planning to do in a few weeks: (1) Change unlicensed practice of law to unauthorized practice of law, which is the dominant usage among professional responsibility experts; (2) Move all the U.S.-related stuff to Lawyers in the United States; (3) Move all the Indian-related stuff to Lawyers in India; and (4) rewrite this article as a very general and brief article about attorneys at law in general and how that usage died out in the U.K. and many Commonwealth nations (because the position of solicitor was seen as more prestigious) but became the dominant usage in the United States and several other nations where the legal profession fused early on.

<p>I have deleted language asserting that the Juris Doctor degree does not confer the title of "doctor." The article on Juris Doctor has been infected with this kind of material for some time. Let's leave it out of the article on Attorney at Law.</p>
<p>I'm going to make an assertion here: There is no such thing as a doctoral degree that does not confer the title of doctor. To state otherwise is in my opinion nonsensical. The edit wars on these kinds of things in the Juris Doctor or related articles detracts from the reliability and reputation of Wikipedia in my view. Let's keep this encyclopedic.</p>
<p>And let's keep edit wars about whether a particular doctoral degree "really" is or is not a doctoral degree out of the article on Attorney at Law. Please leave that battle -- if (sigh....) it has to be fought -- in some other place than in this article.

<p>I removed the link to lawyers.com. There are many online directories of attorneys using search engine optimization to battle for the top spot.

<p>How to Find a Lawyer and How to find an Attorney There should be Wikipedia articles on each of these two topics with suggestions to contact the local bar association as well as the professional bar association which covers the type of problem (for example the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the American Bankruptcy Institute, etc). The Wikipedia articles should link to this Attorney-at-Law article and to the Lawyer article as well as to Wikipedia articles on Bankruptcy, Immigration, etc. Some consumers will need this sort of help. I would try to set these up myself but am too new here to do this. ````</p>

<dd>No, that would be against a ton of Wikipedia policies. Wikipedia is purely descriptive ("this is how something is") not prescriptive ("this is what you should do").

<p>I added some information on certification of specialists, using Texas as the example. One thing I am not sure of is: Of the 8,303 board certified specialists in Texas, are any considered <i>inactive</i> members of the Texas Bar (i.e., are any part of the 11,000 inactive members, and not part of the approximately 77,000 active members)?</p>
<p>Also, for what it's worth, many thousands of the 77,000 active Texas Bar members are not currently engaged in the practice of law (i.e., they retain the active Texas Bar membership even though they're working in a field unrelated to law practice).

<p>This article has been getting worse and worse over the past two years since it was split off from a section I originally drafted in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">Lawyer</a> (trace the history back to 2004 if you don't believe me). I am at the library this afternoon with a pile of excellent books on the American legal profession, so I'm going to start fixing it.

<p>The phrase "Attorneys in private practice and small firms (who can't afford to litigate every little issue) v. big firms (who can)" is clearly POV in its wording. <a href="../../../t/m/r/User%7ETmrobertson_4dc8.html" title="User:Tmrobertson">Tmrobertson</a> 06:57, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
