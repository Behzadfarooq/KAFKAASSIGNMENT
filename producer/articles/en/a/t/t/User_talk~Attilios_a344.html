<p>Thanks for the kind words, and it makes me glad to know there are others out there interested in Argentine comics. I have a question that, as I'm new here, you may have a clearer idea of than I do: How many categories and sub-categories should exist for Argentine comics? In light of the small number of articles extant in the english wikipedia for the sub-category Argentine comic strips, would it be best to merge them into Argentine comics? Especially since there is no corresponding sub-category for Argentine comics books? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteventity_bd23.html" title="User:Steventity">steventity</a> 19:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Attilios,</p>
<p>I've noticed that you have made two new articles for Slavic gods, <a href="../../../p/e/k/Peklenc.html" title="Peklenc">Peklenc</a> and <a href="../../../o/z/w/Ozwiena.html" title="Ozwiena">Ozwiena</a>. I would like to see sources from which you have taken these deities, because I have personaly never heard or read anything of them, and from information presented in the articles, it appears to me as (sorry ofr being so blunt) as pure rubbish. Please understand that Slavic mythology is, due to sparse historical or archeological evidences, imensly fertile ground for development of <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fakelore.html" title="Fakelore">fakelore</a>. I'm trying my best to improve the overral very low quality of Slavic mythology articles on Wikipedia, and it realy doesn't help my efforst if unrefrenced articles on very suspicious "Slavic" deities keep springing up. --<a href="../../../h/i/e/User%7EHier0phant_0a29.html" title="User:Hier0phant">Hierophant</a> 18:50, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is quite possible that someone in fact would come here and add such stuff, not nessecarily inventing it from scratch, but simply repeating some older invention; this is the essence of fakelore. A lot of Slavic mythology articles here are a production of various Slavic neopagans and/or romantics who use Wikipedia to advertise their own agendas. They also may have good intentions, but use completly obscure or unreliable or perhaps even, as you put it, "standard" books on the topic. Dividing fakelore from historical Slavic mythology is a matter of controversy even amongst the experts themselves, so the least wikipedia should strive is to demand ANY refrences whatsoever for topics concerning Slavic deities; most cannot even produce that. Thus, it would be wise to think twice before translating such unrefrenced articles from other versions of wikipedia. I'm strongly inclined to nominate these two for deletion. --<a href="../../../h/i/e/User%7EHier0phant_0a29.html" title="User:Hier0phant">Hierophant</a> 19:35, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Attilios, of all the maps in <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_Map_aac4.html" title="User:Attilios/Map">User:Attilios/Map</a> which would you like reworked first? I like the Livonia one, myself, but you no doubt are looking for some before others. It generally takes me a week or 2 for a map, so don't expect anything soon (unfortunately).

<dd>Two questions:
<ul>
<li>In what article will the new Livonia map be used? I like to try to tailor each map to an article (or articles) and use the same names as used in the article etc.</li>
<li>What is the source of that map I am reworking? I like to include my sources on the Wikipedia Commons page.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Well, I'm done with the map and I think it turned out well! I also found quite a large number of articles that could use the map. I would be happy to translate it into Italian (or any language) if I had the help. Hope you like it. As you may know from my other maps, I am not able to include all the detail of the paper maps, primarily due to the lack of resolution available onscreen. Let me know of any errors or improvements. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapMaster_75f4.html" title="User:MapMaster">MapMaster</a> 23:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Attilios, I have translated the Livonian Confederation map into Italian (see map at right). Could you review this for accuracy?? Perhaps you could also check my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it:User:MapMaster" class="extiw" title="w:it:User:MapMaster">Italian User Page</a> to ensure that it is grammatically correct. Any additions or corrections would be appreciated. Grazie, <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapMaster_75f4.html" title="User:MapMaster">MapMaster</a> 21:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the edits to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pizza_Tapes_44a5.html" title="The Pizza Tapes">The Pizza Tapes</a>. It looks better than it did before. Half of what you did I forgot to do, and the other half I forgot about. Looks better now, even though I spent a lot of time on it (and even taught myself how to make music sample in .ogg formatting) there's still little bits here and there.

<p>Atilios,</p>
<p>Sorry to revert your flag "move" on the French communes templates, but the pretext for your change was all wrong - there are no "standards" on Wiki. I do understand that the flag "down there" has yet to be adopted elsewhere, but please give it a chance. I'm just getting used to it myself. In fact, this solution seems much less awkward than putting the flag <i>in</i> the template, and there's something to say to the discression of its placement... if you have a better suggestion please suggest it, but until then please give the "new design" (and he who made it) a chance. Thanks and again apologies. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family:Futura, Helvetica, _sans;color:#ddd7a3;font-size:95%;">THE<span style="color:#aba67e;">PROMENADER</span></span></a> 22:29, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Copyrighted images, especially with restrictive licenses like 'must display copyright and url', don't allow readers of the wikipedia to reuse them in other works as fully PD images do. It's a nice image, but somebody could easily make a free version of it without any restrictions, and we've got plenty of Fw 190 pictures as it stands. If it was released into the public domain by the creator, then there would be no problem, but instead he's granted wikipedia exceptionally limited rights to display it. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricg_f5fa.html" title="User:Ericg">ericg</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricg_b3f5.html" title="User talk:Ericg">✈</a> 16:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I refer to the edit by WmLGann, 13:49, 27 October 2006 in the article <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coimbatore.html" title="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a></p>
<p><br />
I am particularly concerned with the following edits:</p>
<p>No. 1</p>
<p>"is one of the major industrial cities in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>" to</p>
<p>"is an industrial city in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>. "</p>
<p>No. 2</p>
<p>"It is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai and the fourth largest city in South India." to</p>
<p>"It has the second largest population in Tamil Nadu after Chennai and the fourth largest in South India."</p>
<p><br />
The objective of both the edits is not clear.</p>
<p><br />
Coimbatore is one of the largest industrial cities in India. The annual export alone, from this region is over US$ 1 billion. <a href="http://www.coimbatoreit.com/city/industrial_ethos.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coimbatoreit.com/city/industrial_ethos.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The city is well known for its heavy industrial activity.</p>
<p><br />
Coming to edit No. 2, a city when being sorted among the largest cities, is usually sorted based on the population. The highest populated city in any country is the biggest city in that country. In that case, though the edit by WmLGann is not miscommunicating, it does not make any sense or it does not improve the article in any way.</p>
<p><br />
So I kindly request you to revert it.</p>

<p>You removed my comment on Michelangelo's Last judgement, which mentioned that from afar the last judgement looks like a human skull. Have you actually looked at the last judgement from afar, focusing on the broad outlines? The arches up top represent the brow, the "puddles" just below the eyes, the light patch in the center the nasal cavity, and the watery area towards the bottom the mouth. It's pretty hard to miss, and I can't imagine Michaelangelo accidentally arranged the "light" and "dark" areas of the mural in that form.</p>

<p>Hi Attilios. You have a fantastic idea, I'm competant at drawing original material but by far what I'm best at is reworking old hand drawn diagrams into clean/modern pieces of computer generated graphics, such as those you have in this ageing text book. There are a few key things which is that a.) I dont speak italian, so any text needs to be translated for me preferably on the diagram itself to avoid confussion. Otherwise I'm very happy to do it, wikification of older text book images is a great idea. My email (which is probably an easier way to send scanned images over) is nick-daines&lt;at&gt;hotmail&lt;dot&gt;com. I look forward to seeing what diagrams you have. Theres no rush at all, as since my wasp diagram has been on the front page I've had a flurry of image requests, plenty to keep me busy until you get the book.

<p>Hi, again. Congratulations for the FIFA World Cup! Well, I know that, but I don't see problems upgrading the layout of the filmographies templates. Wikipedia is a mutant encyclopedia.

<p>Hi from England,<br />
You seem to have made a mistake, or our browsers or screen resolutions create odd effects. You say on my Talk Page:<br />
<i>"Be careful when you move images, like in John Cabot. Your last move created unpleasant blank spaces... Ciao and good work!</i><br />
Not so, there are no white spaces in my placement of the Cabot statue (I’ve been back in the History and checked). I have Internet Explorer Version 6 on a screen resolution of 1024 by 768. I've been placing pics on WP since January 2003 so I'm very aware of whitespace and highly experienced in placement of pics (over 1500 pics off my camera on WP so far). So it's a mystery!! Could differing screen resolutions produce the effect? I've moved the pic up again but not quite so far. Is it OK for you now?

<p>All I knew about Gonzaga was that he had been in command of the Spanish cavalry. I had assumed that this meant he was Spanish himself, but if he was Italian, fair enough. The same applies to Madrazzo and Baglioni; Oman only specifies their commands, not their nationalities.</p>
<p>(As for using Oman, per se: despite being quite old, he is almost universally cited as the best secondary source available for reconstructions of the battles during this period.)</p>

<dd>Thanks! Particularly for the names of more minor figures, there's an obvious potential for error, as they tend to be mentioned once (sometimes in a footnote) in the source; thus, my knowledge of them is extraordinarily limited (assuming even that the source doesn't mess up the name to begin with). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 23:52, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I'd like to help you but I'm not so proficient in biographical history, however if you have any problems with understanding you can count on my help, and my advice. In some cases I can also use some polish books about history - I have some of them in my "domestic library". If I can give you some advice - sometimes you can chceck the source in polish language with online translator: <a href="http://translatica.pwn.pl/index_i.php?a=001" class="external text" title="http://translatica.pwn.pl/index_i.php?a=001" rel="nofollow">PL-EN, EN-PL</a> - the english engine for <a href="http://translatica.pwn.pl/" class="external text" title="http://translatica.pwn.pl/" rel="nofollow">Polski-Angielski, Angielski.-Polski</a>. I know it's not a good way to write any translations, but sometimes it can give you some clues when you are confused about meaning. Huh... I'm also a newbie with TranslationProject - but I think it could be the best way to do some practise. So what kind of problems do you have. And what do you whant me to do, because my english grammar is poor&#160;;) ... <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonteChristof_18aa.html" title="User:MonteChristof">MonteChristof</a> 15:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't underestimate it's importance! Although it is not very old, it is the spiritual centre of the Catholic church for a very large region.</p>
<p>As for all the wonderful works of architecture that you mention, well, you and I will just have to do our best! I will take a loook at Milano and some of the others, add to them as much as i can. I must say that I find it much easier to write about buildings that I have seen like the cathedrals of Milan, Florence, Siena, Orvieto and the churches of Ravenna and Venice than to write from book research!</p>
<p>But i am familiar with many of the Venetian Churches and about 8 churches of Florence, not to mention having been to 40 churches of Rome in 4 days..... but our pilgrimage didn't count because we never got to the Basilica of St Pauls outside the Walls. I've been back to Rome since then and looked at quite a few of the titular churches.</p>

<p>Hi, I just noticed that you made a large edit to <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a> a few days ago. There were a couple of problems with the edit. First, you used this format:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walkinshaw_4b7e.html" title="Tom Walkinshaw">Tom Walkinshaw</a>, British businessman</li>

<li>1950 - Carlo Verdone, Italian film director and actor</li>
</ul>
<p>The second problem is the redlinks. Since Carlo Verdone doesn't have a Wikipedia article, we can't include him on those pages.

<p>I'm confused. At <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenchen.html" title="Grenchen">Grenchen</a> you made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grenchen&amp;diff=91608645&amp;oldid=90283847" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grenchen&amp;diff=91608645&amp;oldid=90283847" rel="nofollow">an edit</a>, saying <i>coat fixed</i>. But when I look at that article, I see that the coat of arms has now disappeared altogether. What were you trying to achieve with this edit?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Edit to add:</i> I see Docu has now fixed it. But the question above still stands.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is required is to place the image within the <i>imagepath_coa</i> field of the {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Swiss_town_e9a1.html" title="Template:Infobox Swiss town">Infobox Swiss town</a>}} template. Then you can see both the name and the coat of arms (if the latter exists). I suspect the reason for Docu's recent edits to the template were to try to get some sense of consistency about this template and the articles that reference it. Historically, the municipality articles were in a mess: some used a <i>coat</i> field, some <i>imagepath_coa</i>, and others made use of either one of these and placed the coat in the <i>subject</i> field. Now we at least have the potential for some consistency. As I said, all that is required is to identify the municipalities that aren't displaying the coat of arms correctly and edit them to make use of the <i>imagepath_coa</i> field. I can do this once the database dump started on 30 November has completed. (It will probably take a few more days.) Then I can run a Perl script against that dump and identify the remaining municipality articles. I'm not expecting very many, but we will see.

<dd>Sure, I understand how sometimes new messages can become lost&#160;:) Grove has recently been thoroughly updated, and is considered <i>the</i> source for music topics. I was only using google as a secondary way of looking at the issue. The disparity is so huge, I see it as a fairly valid result. If you look at the rules for naming conventions, the deciding factor is <i>generally</i> what the vast majority of English speakers use. Thus, rather than "Nippon", we have an article on Japan, etc. Also, since he was a 16th century composer, it's not surprising that his name sounds outdated to you. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 19:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could you please point to a modern Italian source which uses your preferred spelling? Just because it is the current spelling <i>in general</i> of this name, it does not necessarily follow that it would be considered correct for <i>this composer</i>. It is my understanding that many times in compound words, it is not unusual for combined consonants such as nm to become a double mm, I saw it all the time when I took Latin. Lastly, the journals <i>Early Music</i> (1999) <i>Journal of the Royal Musical Association</i> (1992), <i>Journal of Musicology</i> (1991) and others, use the double-m single-t spelling. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 21:21, 4 December 2006 (UTC) &lt;-- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 16:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've come to that conclusion!</p>
<p>The reason why I left Raphael in is that someone previously put in Leonardo, Raphael and Micky-boy. Now, I removed Leo because all he did was doodle on paper. But I left raphhael because he did actually build things, he WAS employed as an architect for a time, and I don't want to ride rouughshod ovver other people. I havve already been moore or less accused of that!</p>
<p>Buggga this kkeyybbboard!</p>
<p>Annyway, if we go sticking in alll the lesser known bbods, there won't be enough room! I think that all the non-Italiann Renaissance things should each have there own page.... that way the person who contributed the Hungarian things will be happy,, Gian who writes so well about English buildings will be happy. Someone cann finnish the Spanish thing and more than six lines on Portugal. Renaissance Arch. in Ggermany needs its own pagge. And sooo on/.hat do you think? otherwise it will be blown oout of all proportion. I would ask Gian first.</p>

<p>No, Attilios,, this is about clarity,, OK. It's about being able to find your way around a big article easily. It <i>needs</i> the dates bbecause that is how you make simple direct comparison. Comparison is a key tool in learning. And my liittle three-name lists are similarly learning devices and a guide to what is in the section immediately below. I can dispense with the little lists if you insist bbut <i>put the dates back!</i></p>
<p>We are not going to be <i>that</i> pedantic about style. If it is a passing reference, then thhe date is not necessary. But these are not passing references.</p>

<p>The dates are <i>necessary</i> to the article. No-one wnts to hop back and forwrd between articles just to find out something as simple as a date. I don't bbelieve that the rules say that dates <i>muust not</i> be included if there is a page on the person. If there is such a rule then it would be a stupid and impractical one.</p>
<p>Now, Pleeese don't invit people to edit the Michelanggelo, Romano and Palladio bits, just as I am in the middle of writing them! That would be a conflict and a nuisance. I'm going to finish those three <i>right now</i> if you will jjust get out of my hair for a little bit and let me get on with it.</p>
<p>Re- the very poor Italian- I am aware of my own shortcomings in this area. I really need someone like you to correct my Italian. One problem is, of couurse, that I gget information from old English books, or sometimes from books written in Italian and badly trannslated. it doesn't hhelp at all. With regard to the San Francesco building- my book clearly said that it <i>used to be called that</i>. That is the sort of thing I mean! it can be a simple ignorance of Italian or local practice!</p>

<p>One book says Tempietto, the other, by a German, says Tempio. BF says Tempio. Thanks for fixing it!</p>
<p>And yes, you are quite right about Palladio of course, he is the other one that has to go in! Do you want to go hunting for a good wikicommons pic of Palazzo Tè while I write the next bit?</p>
<p>Ive got plenty on Paladio actually, but I've been using a bnice little dictioary of the renaissance bbecause it puts a lot of basic facts in a small compass and is easier to use for the biographies than sifting through a volume as big as an encyclopedia, evenn if they do have lots of distractingly pretty pictures.

<p>So just explain this- is it the Tea Palace for drinking Tea (because it's just a sort of single storey thing in the garden where one <i>might</i> have tea parties, or is it really named after the island and if so, at what point did the name go wrongg because my Italian sources have the Tè? I'm happy to leave the grave off. I never know which way they go anyway. It's one of the things I'm hopeless at! (But I do write good poetry).</p>

<p>Attilios, I have searched for some rule pertaining to the use of dates and can't find one.</p>
<p>But having examined other articles my conclusion is as follows-</p>
<p>if the dates of the persons life is of no particular relevance to the particular article, then you leave them out, eg.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The last of James’s three male favorites was <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Villiers%2C_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_28db.html" title="George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham">George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham</a>."</li>
<li>Simon's poetry was inspired by the music of <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a>.</li>
<li>"Raphael entered the studio of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perugino.html" title="Perugino">Perugino</a> in 1499."</li>
</ul>
<p><b>But</b></p>
<p>When the person to whom one refers is introduced with a heading and is the whole subject of the paragraph- their work being absolutely integral to the understanding of the article and the article is framed as <i>an historic progression</i>, <b>then</b> dates are not only desirable but necessary.</p>
<p>I am reinserting them, because these are not mere passing references to the people- the work of these people is the <i>whole subjject matter</i> of the article.</p>
<p>I am sure that you can understand this, and that your persistence is really making me very cross. I realise that one can look up all the details of these people elswhere, but that means continual cross-referencing which continually interupts the flow of the article. That is not stylistically desirable. A surfeit of intternal links is not encouraged if the material can be neatly encapsulated. Dates help in this way because they give a precise time frame.</p>

<p>Oh, I keep getting into trouble from other people for putting in too much about Italy. It seems hard for them to understand that Renaissance architecture actually <i>began</i> in that country!</p>
<p>I will now edit your additions into flowing English and hope that people do not complain! I think that I will have to write a brief summary of Renaissance Architecture in Italy for this page, then remove the more detailed info to another page called</p>
<p>Renaissance architecture in Italy or Italian Renaissance Architecture. Which one is best?</p>

<p><b>Certosa</b> is wonderful! I must read the whole page. But for now, the first picture, of the facade is on the wrong side! This is not artistic layout. This building must face <i>inwards</i>. There are two solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>it is possible to use some control to make the table of contents go to the right. But this has some problems.</li>
<li>perhaps a different picture could be put first. With the beautiful facade put on the left, further down so it looks in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can I rearrange this page??</p>
<p>Oh yes! What about Santa Maria della Consolazione, Todi. Is there anything on that one yet?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I don't think that we ought to extend the discussion of the different regions of Italy any further on that particular page, because it's already very long.</p>
<p>What it needs is for there to be written a brief paragraph on Germany and another paragraph on the Lowlands. I will have a look at my handy Banister Fletcher and I have just found another good book on my shelf which has information about Germany. It also has some very good, well translated writing which I have been enjoying!</p>
<p>I have at last found an old picture of the Laurentian Library. It was all brown and stained so I scanned it and cleaned it up digitally. I'm quite pleased with it now.</p>
<p>When I was first there, many years ago, there were two horrible rude people! The door was open so I walked up the stairs and stood on the landing, looking in. So a man came along and without speaking to me, shut the door straight in my face. So I knocked on the door and a woman opened it, exactly enough to poke her nose and one eyeball through. So I said "I am a student of architectural history. May I please look through the door?" She said "No you cannot!" and pulled her nose out. But then she remembered that she had noticed I had a camera so she stuck her nose through again and said "No fotografia! and pulled her nose in quickly before it got broken.</p>

<p>Dear Attilios, thank you for your corretcions! very good. I have made some things more clear. I put back the bit about Cosimo being a banker, because, if you read, you discover that the picture illustrates 3 seperate points!</p>
<p>The Tempio is back also, with more explanation. Thank you for the correction.</p>
<p>Also-</p>
<p>I have put into the Introduction a subheading which may not be correct style but you will see it and observe that it is there for the ning-nongs who don't understand! It says-</p>
<p><b>Italy was the home of the Renaissance.</b></p>
<p>Did you like what I did at San Marco's. I'm glad you wrote that article because on the Fra Angelico page someone wanted to link it to St Mark's Venice! People do not bother to check the links, if it goes <i>blue</i> they presume it is alright.

<p>No! you are perfectly correct! It wasn't Freddi with the schnozzle! That was Freddi from Urbino! And honestly truly, I have drunk no wine! We are not so civilised here as to drink wine with every meal, partly because the alcoholic content of Australian table wine is rather higher than is usual in Europe. Pity.

<p>I have made a few changes to the infobox, so it should now work. The problem with the government type is that it only accepts certain things. At the moment, we say that a duchy is simply a monarchy (which is technically correct). It is not possible to display more than one flag, but you can change the "flag" text underneath to say "Flag (1700)", for example.

<p>Sant'Antonio's is a very special place for me. I have written a poem about it. The first time that I was there, I was feelling very miserable, and all a sudden, something like a lttle miracle happened. (It was a remarkable co-incidence but a co-incidence that required a llot of preparation on the part of the people who made it happen.) There was a service in the chapel whhere the Saint is bburied. I was walkingg along the opposite side of the building feeling very depressed when suddenlly a great choir bbegan to sing the Te Deum. They sang it to an English tune, which we always used when I was a child at my tiny wooden parish church in a little village 70k from Sydney. Of all pieces of Church music, this is the one that I have sung, almost every day of my life since I was a child. So I felt as if they were singing it especially for me.</p>

<p>Hi Attilios! I haven't sent the poem yet! I also haven't done Donatello yet!</p>
<p>There is a problem with writing large articles about major subjects - every time you turn your back someone removes something important or adds something ridiculous. I keep putting out spot fires. Do you know about spot fires? In this country, every year there are fires in the forest ( which we call "the bush"). They are "Bushfires". Every year around Christmas, there are huge blazes, sometimes with a front of many miles, particularly when they are in mountain ranges which have deep valleys which are almost inaccessible. One of the things that happens is that little pieces of burning leaves and twigs float down and start 'spot fires' here and there. Luckily it has been pouring rain all day, so maybe we will have a fire-free Christmas, at least on the coast. Anyway, I have check some other articles for spot fires.

<p>are you having a holiday? I hope you have your camera!</p>
<p>I'm working on Michelangelo a bit and need a translation. Someone has put this in:-</p>
<p>"The <i>Ignudi</i> (singular: <i>ignudo</i>; from the Italian adjective <i>nudo</i>, meaning “naked”) are the 20 athletic, nude male figures ...... Most of the figures are surrounded by a huge garland of oak leaves, and clustered about them are thousands of acorns resembling the penis, or "prickhead", in Tuscan slang (testa di cazzo). The most likely reason for their abundance is that <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Julius_II_790c.html" title="Pope Julius II">Pope Julius II</a>, who commissioned the work, was of the della Rovere family ("of the Oak"): they function as, perhaps, Michelangelo's allusion to his patron."</p>
<p>What I want to know is this:-</p>
<p>Are these acorns commonly known by the slang "testa di cazzo" or is this an association made by the writer?</p>
<p>My feeling is that, although the acorns <i>do</i> look like penis heads the inclusion of "prickhead" and so on in the article is irrelevant <i>unless</i> either they (or the Pope) was commonly called "testa di cazzo". Actually, I can't imagine anyone referring to Pope Julius II as a dickhead- he would have them dealt with!</p>

<dd>Hi,</dd>
<dd>Sulla WP:fr lavoro tra l’altro sui comuni italiani. Nell’estate scansa abbiamo migrato tutti i comuni italani verso la WP francesa.</dd>
<dd>Generalmente, ogni comune italiano aveva una stemma. Ma…sea questa stemma era in fair-use sulla WP:it, sea era in GFDL su Commons.</dd>
<dd>Prudenti, abbiamo scelto di montrare solo le stemme su Commons&#160;; le altri sono nascoste.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alcuni giorni fa, ho visto che la stemma di Castelforte era con GFDL sulla WP inglese (la tua immagine). Immediatamente ho meso l’immagine su Commons (forse troppo presto&#160;!).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hum…. C’è un piccolo problema&#160;: forse su Commons, l’immagine non è in GFDL, bisogna chiedere a (chi&#160;?) se….</dd>
<dd>Vorrei avere una risposta «vera» per l’utilizazione delle stemme italiane (un sogno?).</dd>
<dd>Ho lasciato un messaggio su <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#Coast_of_arms_for_.28Italian.29_towns_or_communes" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#Coast_of_arms_for_.28Italian.29_towns_or_communes" rel="nofollow">Commons</a>.</dd>

<p>Hello, today I noticed that there was no article for <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rollatini.html" title="Rollatini">rollatini</a>, so wrote one.

<p>I've removed the same report twice now, like many admins I tend to list the reasons in my edit summary so it can be worth checking there before relisting. Since the user hasn't revandalised since you warned them, you misrepresent the vanadlism one of the 4 items was perhaps sneaky the other 3 bits were not. The user doesn't regularly vandalise so we have no reason to believe it is the same person and blocking.

<p>No problem, when I get back from a meeting tonight, I'll try to do the other boxes. In truth, I shouldn't have marked the predecessor to Alexander Sforza as "none", I knew that it had numerous periods of Papal State rule, but I didn't realise there were actually previous Lords of Pesaro. In fact, researching it there was a Malatesta dynasty of some seven Lords. However, I'm pretty sure that none of them have a Wiki page, so all I can leave is a dead link to the previous Lord. I get my info from <a href="http://www.hostkingdom.net/regindex.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hostkingdom.net/regindex.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, btw; it's a really useful site. If you can think of how to make a page with little-to-no info except a succ. box to put in it, feel free to make them, or give me some hints. I made some Monarch stubs for Princes of Wallachia a year or so ago, but with so little info they just didn't seem right. Well anyway, I leave it to your more-experienced judgement.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting that, btw. I do odds and ends when it seems sensible, occasionally I work hard on a project when I have the time, but I've never had feedback before. It's always nice to know that people out there are noticing my work. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalastur_21ee.html" title="User:Falastur">Falastur</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalastur_0afd.html" title="User talk:Falastur">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falastur_ec85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falastur">contribs</a>) 19:25, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I have been working on straightening out some articles on Saints, and am appalled at the stuff that get copy-pasted from the Catholic Encyclopedia. I noticed that you had a some interaction with the content from this wonderful resource ... I was wondering about a template to put on article that are obviously entirely or mostly cut-paste jobs. I am relatively new here, so I thought I would follow the conversation trail to you and ask: 1) have you seen such a template, or 2) how would I go about getting such a thing created? I simply don't have time to do a re-write for every blatant catholic encyclopedia article I come across.

<p>I saw your edits to this article where you changed the unit of measurement. It is normal to alter so as to provide BOTH units of measurements, ie "The pugio was 12inches (30cm) long", not simply to change and remove the previous unit of measurement. Please change your posts to include both units of measurements, otherwise this becomes a matter of regional disagreement and you might spark an edit war!

<dd>I'm not quite sure what to do next. I'm tending to think that I would like to continue to do maps of Italy (rather than Germany), perhaps because I am beginning to understand the Italian historical "landscape", and also to provide map consistency within Wikipedia, but I am not sure. I would certainly love to see the old maps you have. Given the detail in those maps, I do think that you are correct and that we would need to create sub-maps .

<p>Hi. I have weighed in there. I must apologize for not answering to your previous query until now: I was trapped in a series of endless debates on two pages I created, and they took all my time on wiki. It looks like the articles have been reviewed by now, and I'll give them an extra look when some of my Romanian detractors will leave me be. For now, it's gotten quite heated on a certain talk page for a Romanian article, where I have been accused of being "pro-communist" (interestingly, an article I had just created was under attack at the very same time for having an "anti-communist bias"); one user is basically asking another how to "get rid of me". This had the gift of reducing time I allocate to other issues, and of making it more likely that I take longer breaks from editing. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 09:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for your kind words. Well, the issue is getting quite complicated, but perhaps you can weigh in on the absurd situation I have summarized on <a href="../../../v/l/a/Talk%7EVladimir_Tism%C4%83neanu_ada6.html#Facts_vs._fiction:_the_tags_and_the_scandalous_reasons_behind_them" title="Talk:Vladimir Tismăneanu">Talk:Vladimir Tismăneanu#Facts vs. fiction: the tags and the scandalous reasons behind them</a> (I encourage you to read the article and perhaps look over comments brought up against it). I feel that tags are being used against an NPOV text to <i>introduce</i> POV, based on the fact that the issue is relatively unfamiliar to the average editor, and that allegations against Tismăneanu have mostly been made in Romanian (I have translated some of the most relevant parts of the debate in that section). In case you want to look into it, I thank you in advance. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 11:40, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have fixed it! I made a nice little picture for the little space, so you can see the detail, and put the big pic further down. We cannot have a large horizontal picture getting in the way of the text! The layout offended my artistic sensibility! I hope you will be happy now!&#160;:) Guess what....

<p>I enjoy this. I recall a paleobiologist who was befuddled by the focus on massive dinosaurs; and indicated he was interested in the whole past, from flora to lesser fauna, studying the entire spectrum. The 1911 Brittanica had as its Renaissance megafauna, Raphael and Michelangelo; it is fun to illuminate what is now lesser known. And to note how later decades and centuries of Italian art were even more diverse and equally probing. Please continue to correct my grammar. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECARAVAGGISTI_a816.html" title="User:CARAVAGGISTI">CARAVAGGISTI</a> 18:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ciao, Attilios. At some point in the last week, I randomly decided to overhaul this entire article that you started. I just wanted to let you know that I'm shooting for Featured Article status and that I've got enough references to do it.

<p>First things first-</p>
<ul>
<li>Attilios! You are worse than Nero! You threw me to the lions at Castelseprio! Oh,my goodness! I made myself very unpopular over there!</li>
<li>I'm glad you like the new Leonardo page! Now I need someone who knows a lot more about Leonardo's inventions etc. to add to it!</li>
<li>I will take a look at what you have written elsewhere and get back to you, but I hope that it is at least 50 miles from Castelseprio.</li>
<li>I am quite passionate about Piero della Francesca. Someone made a comment about his faces. Do you know, when I went to Arezzo, I realised that the face of Piero's painting is highly regional. The man that served us at the restaurant was the model for Jesus at the Baptism (in Londodn) or so it seemed.</li>
<li>Incidentally, the <a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Cross_2696.html" title="True Cross">True Cross</a> and the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Tree_a16b.html" title="Jesse Tree">Jesse Tree</a>. Someone had muddled up the two ideas and really made quite a mess at the beginning. People were too polite to say that they were not the same thing. But never mind! I came along and sorted it out and put up the stuff from the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Legend_89a2.html" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a>. There are people around who only want info if it conforms to their thinking. They delete legendry information as spurious, even if it is clearly labelled "legend"..... anyway, I included some of Piero's pics.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Tree_a16b.html" title="Jesse Tree">Jesse Tree</a> I deleted a lengthy religious discussion that was almost a sermon. I hope the man forgives me, because he has a data base of Jesse Trees and is really enthusiastic. It is hard to impart "style' to some people, as you have discovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sooo... about my Section references: <b>Maudsley, Kimberly and Mangerton</b>, <i>A Concise History of Pterydactyl Remains in the Upper Megalong and Gross Valleys by the Intuitive Method</i> ISBN 22-66-77-44 etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this is that you simply cannot keep everyone happy. Some people want a million inline references which I cannot do because I read and inwardly digest several writers' words of wisdom on the subject and then lump it together. To reference the section is a much more accurate way of citing than just adding the names of ten books at the end of the page. But, if you really insist, I can leave out the words Section reference: (but I'd rather leave them in.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm coming over to your side of the world, in a week's time. So I probably won't be online very much!</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep up the good work..... and do try to keep out of fights!</p>

<p>User Sean D Martin has been vandalizing the article on Stephanie Adams, due to a personal problem he has against her, as clearly seen when you google him along with her name. I and a few others have corrected what he vandalized, but ask that he be banned from editing the article on Stephanie Adams.<br />
____________________<br /></p>
<p>In response to the above <b>unsigned</b> comment: User Sean D Martin has <b>not</b> been vandalizing anything. <b>All</b> of the edits made have been specific, minor, resulted in more accurate information and have been accompanied with a clear explanation of why the change was made. <b>None</b> of the edits has insulted Ms Adams or impugned her reputation in any way.</p>
<p>In response anonymous posters have reverted the article back to something <b>less accurate</b> and <b>more self serving</b>. These posts have been accompanied by personal attacks against me. I strongly suspect (and a little research into the IP addresses used supports) that this is Ms Adams using her usual technique of multiple aliases and anonymous posts to attack anyone who says anything not wildly complementary of her.</p>
<p>If anyone actually reads the edits I've made they will see that they are as I've described them. Specific, accurate and neutral. ONly someone with the viewpoint often ascribed to Ms Adams would see these as vandalism. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_D_Martin_c2b8.html" title="User:Sean D Martin">Sean Martin</a> 21:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)<br />

Because the Malcolmlow, who has done all the work and has the information at hand is perfectly accomodating.</p>
<p>Meamwhile, There is this regular battle over Leonardo! One nice long letter demoshing the article for the fact that six commas were missing and two sentences were in a different tense to the previous ones. Another one who decided that one could not say that "Leonardo was generally considered to be one of the greatest artists to ever have lived." This, of course, is a fact. Not that he was the greatest, but that it is the way in which he was/is pperceived. So then I had to find ten quotations to support the sentence.....</p>
<p>Every time I turn my back someone demolishes the article.... and they are nearly always people who mean well! Someone has just reverted an edit that I made, specifically to keep people happy! Oh well! "Back to the mighty conflict" (in the words of an old English Hymn.)</p>

<p>Hi. It seems that I have overseen the template:MedalTableTop, which is appropiate enough for my medal tables. Sorry for changing the template:MedalTop! However, the latter should be a more general one than a specific one like for Olympics. Anyway, just keep it! I myself better change my templates from MedalTop to MedalTableTop, which is easier.

<p>Hi. I am writing to you because you seem to be online at the moment and have heaps of discussion on your talk page. Not sure if you're an admin or not but either way you probably know your way around here. I'm trying to access the list of contributions for user JSPugh. Using my normal process for doing this, i.e. copying their username, going to 'my contributions' and then pasting their username at the end instead of mine, i get no results. This can't be the case, because i know for a fact he has edited the article <a href="../../../x/a/n/XanGo_f948.html" title="XanGo">XanGo</a> recently. Any advice?

<p>No, non mi arrabbio, ma avrei comunque un appunto... quando scrivi a qualcuno, ricordati di firmare... poi ho pensato a guardare nella history dell'articolo, ma se firmavi ti trovavo prima. In quanto al conflitto di interessi, posso anche capire, ma resta il fatto che Armenia pubblica quegli autori, tra cui me. Che la cosa l'abbia scritta io o un'altro penso abbia un'importanza relativa dato che un fatto e non una promozione (non ci sono frasi altisonanti o altri elementi discutibili... solo una mera lista). Mi auguro solo che questo precedente non impedisca che un giorno io venga citato comunque in quella lista perché un'altro wikipediano NON collegato a me decida di aggiungermi... D'altra parte uno qui scrive di cose che conosce, per cui i miei articoli riguardano Roma, Ostia, la zona dove abito, i personaggi fabosi che ho conosciuto o altri elementi di cui ho esperienza diretta a causa del mio lavoro (editori, giornalisti, ecc...) Il mio obiettivo è portare nella Wikipedia inglese una migliore conoscenza dell'Italia e di sfatare alcuni miti (come gli spaghetti con le meet ball, ad esempio). --<a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejudicibus_5e96.html" title="User:Dejudicibus">Dejudicibus</a> 20:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Attilios, Greetings! I am the "jerk" who did most of the work on the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Savio_4607.html" title="Dominic Savio">Dominic Savio</a> article.&#160;:-) I admit you are several times more experienced than I on Wikipedia, and I bow to your experience here. I had been labouring under the delusion that I had been neutral while writing the article. From your comments, I gather I have failed. I would be grateful if you gave me a few suggestions on improving the article. Thank you.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<dd>As I said, I'd love it if you could please indicate to me instances of the POV and the Pietism, so that I can change them. I did a major rewrite of the article, since it had previously been tagged with "expert" and "accuracy dispute" tags. You can see the previous version of the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominic_Savio&amp;diff=89728304&amp;oldid=89722170" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominic_Savio&amp;diff=89728304&amp;oldid=89722170" rel="nofollow">here.</a> Though I was named after him, (long story, don't think you'd be interested), I was fairly sure I had been neutral on the article. (It took me three entire days to do it, making sure that I was neutral.) I don't see how I can avoid "Catholic language" on the article, since Dominic Savio's only claim to notability stems from the fact that he was a "Good Catholic", and that he was "pious". Now, should I downplay that in the article? If he had a habit of praying before the Eucharist daily, for instance, am I to say that he didn't? Or am I to leave it out? Or am I to avoid words like "Eucharist", "Prayer", "Mass", "Priest", "Sodality" etc, since non-Catholics might also be reading the article? If sports terminology were used in an article on a sportsperson, or political terminology in an article on a politician, wouldn't that also be, by your definition, a form of "POVism" and "Pietism"? After all, people other than sportspersons or politicians are also expected to read those articles. I thought the meaning of NOPV was that all points of view are to be represented with due weightage, fairly, proportionately and without bias. Regarding proportion, in Dominic Savio's case, the only Point of View he is worth viewing from is the Catholic Point of View. From any other viewpoint, he is a nobody. From any other point of view, there is nothing to write about him. I have been fair to the subject. There is nothing negative about the subject in the article because there are no stories in circulation that cast him in a bad light. There are no alleged scandals revolving around his life, for instance. None of his friends have been recorded to make a statement saying "Dominic was not all that pious." or anything of that sort. I am sure I have been unbiased on the article. For instance, you will notice that I have never once made statements about Dominic Savio on my own, (e.g: "Dominic Savio was a famous/great/popular/pious saint.", or "He is one of the greatest Catholic Saints of the nineteenth century" ) and I have only reported what others (St. John Bosco, various Popes, Dominic's friends) had to say about him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I should stay away from the article, and let someone else do the cleanup, since the subject is too close to my heart......</dd>

<p>Tranqui non ti prendo per rompipalle, non ti preoccupare! in effetti ci ho pensato pure io se non fosse troppo.. riconosco siano manifestazioni di secondo piano rispetto a mondiali e europei ma alla fine non sono proprio la coppa del nonno.. boh..<br />
Un policy potrebbe essere di tenere conto di queste manifestazioni nel medagliere se non lo appesantiscono troppo e -di conseguenza- se sono rappresentative del livello raggiunto dall'atleta. Ad esempio mettere tutte le 50+ medaglie di rosolino ti do ragione che non ci sta molto!<br />

Faro' tesoro del tuo consiglio e cercherò di abbandonare il mio amato &lt;br&gt;.. Dai per il medagliere ci sto a fare cosi, però allora aggiungerei nel corpo dell'articolo una subsection tipo <b>Other achievements</b> e farei una tabellina. che dici?<br />
In caso affermativo, se ci metti le mani per favore non cancellare le medaglie ma commentale solo..<br />

<dd>Thanks for your prompt response. I think I should have asked a bit more clearly.... The edit summary that you used on the edit was "rvv", which I believe stands for "reverting vandalism". Since I didn't see any vandalism, I was confused. It is also possible that you were using "rvv" in a different context or as a different abbreviation. Can you please clarify? By the way, the standard abbreviations for edit summaries can be found <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_legend_cb74.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary legend">here</a>.

<p>Ciao Attilios! I have a quick question for you. Back in December, you moved <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altichiero.html" title="Altichiero">Altichiero</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altichiero_da_Zevio_55c6.html" title="Altichiero da Zevio">Altichiero da Zevio</a>. The reason you cited was "more used spelling." I'm wondering what evidence you used to draw that conclusion. When I'm looking at predominant usage, my first point of reference is the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" class="external text" title="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" rel="nofollow">Getty Index</a>, which I think is very reliable and authoritative. They list the preferred name as <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altichiero.html" title="Altichiero">Altichiero</a> and list <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altichiero_da_Zevio_55c6.html" title="Altichiero da Zevio">Altichiero da Zevio</a> as an alternative. I'm interested in what evidence had you going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Toward getting a better understanding of what the best strategy is for determining most common name, I started a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Visual_arts_99ab.html#Artist_naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Visual arts">discussion thread</a> on the topic. Your thoughts are welcome. Cheers. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 01:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Such categories also stress ethnicity, not only a nationality. By the way, is there any field concerning nationality/ethnicity in Italian Census? I doesn't know situation in that region perfectly but I had one friend there, and he told me German-speaking locals don't consider themselves as Italians. Such people should be certainly added to some category which would group them together. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 16:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ciao!&#160;:) It is also a possible way to go, both the new category and the existing one. I still would like to know how majority of these people consider themselves.

<li>Actually I am not British! Secondly I imported several non British castles to that page. Thirdly I chose the best images to demonstrate what I was going to say in the text to explain the evolution of castles both politically and architecturally, i.e. the fact that northern French and English castles have great similarities for political reasons, as do castles in Italy have affinity with others in various parts of Europe, while the Moorish, Spanish and Sicilian castles have a similar relationship. Then we come to the influence they had on revival castle design in South America, and why that differed from the romantic Gothic employed at the same time in Northern Europe. Then we could have crossed to Australia and seen how they adopted the Scottish baronial to suit their climate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_A_Lawson#Larnach_Castle_1871" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_A_Lawson#Larnach_Castle_1871" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and again in New Zealand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargill%27s_Castle" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargill%27s_Castle" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, not to mention the castles of the Crimea. Sadly one was never allowed to get that far because some people insisted on pretty pictures designed to include their favourite holiday snap, or suit their partisan tastes.

<p>I've always appreciated your contributions to articles I (mainly) wrote. This time however I have a question. You've changed Florentine to Italian, while I've tried to avoid this word in my historical biographies of painters and sculptors. In my understanding, Italy as a nation came only into being in the 19th century. Therefore, Florentine should be preferred. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 10:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Apart from the historical point, as I'm sure you know it is standard art historical practice to use Venetian, Florentine, Sienese etc to describe those cities with major schools or distinct traditions of painting. These is important information, which you do not replace - often when you do this it is not obvious from the rest of the lead. In other words, you should <b>at least</b> change to "Italian painter from Florence" or "of the Florentine school". I take it you don't deny the existence of these different traditions. I am raising this issue at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Visual_arts_99ab.html#.22Italian.22_or_.22Florentine.22_etc_artist_.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Visual arts">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Visual_arts#.22Italian.22_or_.22Florentine.22_etc_artist_.3F</a> to try and establish a policy on the matter.

<dd>(<i>answer to your reply on my talk page</i>) I can see your point but still I don't agree. Would you call the de <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">Medici</a> Florentine or Italian rulers, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_II_of_Prussia_4cf3.html" title="Frederick II of Prussia">Frederick the Great</a> a Prussian or a German king, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_van_Eyck_4e03.html" title="Jan van Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> a Flemish or a Belgian painter&#160;?

<p>Ciao Attilios. Much like my recent question about <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altichiero.html" title="Altichiero">Altichiero</a>, I'm wondering about your move of Bartolommeo Carducci to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolomeo_Carducci_6774.html" title="Bartolomeo Carducci">Bartolomeo Carducci</a> and what source you used to establish this as the "correct spelling." My preferred source is the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" class="external text" title="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" rel="nofollow">Getty Union List of Artist Names</a> which lists Bartolomé Carducho as the preferred name with both the single and double-m Bartolomeo versions as variations.</p>
<p>Given that this is the second time that I've asked about this kind of naming convention-based move, I beseech you to cite at least one reference when giving a reason for the move. I think it's worth trying to establish some reliable standard sources and the Getty List has a pretty strong foundation for its decisions on preferred name.
