<p><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allison_Hayes_1a95.html" title="Allison Hayes">Allison Hayes</a> stars as Nancy Archer, whose husband Harry (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hudson_c97d.html" title="William Hudson">William Hudson</a>) wants the US $50 million she recently inherited from her father so he can abandon her and live it up with his young <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress_%28lover%29.html" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a> Honey Parker (<a href="../../../y/v/e/Yvette_Vickers_0ea4.html" title="Yvette Vickers">Yvette Vickers</a>). After catching Harry flirting with Honey during a Friday night dance at a local bar, Nancy encounters a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship.html" title="Starship">spaceship</a> carrying an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture.html" title="Extraterrestrial life in popular culture">extraterrestrial</a> thirty feet tall who, we later learn, needs <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamonds.html" title="Diamonds">diamonds</a> to power his "<a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a>," as the craft is called throughout the movie. (The film was produced about two months after the launch of <a href="../../../s/p/u/Sputnik.html" title="Sputnik">Sputnik</a>, and was co-featured with the <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Corman_0b8b.html" title="Roger Corman">Roger Corman</a> film <i>War of the Satellites</i>.) Nancy wears one of the largest "rocks" of all, the priceless Star of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> diamond. The local sheriff initially scoffs at Nancy's tale, but humors her because the taxes she pays afford him and his deputy a comfortable salary. Harry sees what he regards as his wife's relapse into alcoholism as an opportunity to have Nancy committed to an <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric_hospital.html" title="Psychiatric hospital">asylum</a>. The next afternoon, having summoned a psychiatrist to examine his wife, Harry agrees to drive Nancy, now seductively dressed in tight-fitting toreador pants, through the desert in search of the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien</a>.</p>
<p>At sunset they find his satellite. Nancy pounds on the hull of the ship and, finally vindicated, shouts, "It's real! I'm <i>not</i> crazy!" thus rousing the interplanetary traveler inside. Finding the creature impervious to bullets, Harry flees, leaving Nancy at the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant.html" title="Giant">giant</a>'s mercy. The alien intends his victim no personal harm; he only wants the Star of India. In seizing the diamond he scratches her throat, but then takes the unconscious woman back to home and leaves her on the roof of the poolhouse. Her doctor explains she has apparently been exposed to some kind of radiation.</p>
<p>Egged on by Honey, Harry schemes to give Nancy a lethal dose of a "<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serum.html" title="Serum">serum</a>" with which she's being treated. Approaching her in the dark with Nancy's private nurse surreptitiously following him, he discovers that Nancy has grown to an enormous size. Nancy's doctors want to operate to stop her growth, but they need Harry's permission to begin the procedure. Imagining his wife to be incapacitated, he leaves home and spends the evening drowning his sorrows in a bar with Honey while awaiting Nancy's demise. Doctors manage to sedate and restrain her massive form as the sheriff and the Archers' butler follow the giant's footprints and discover his satellite. When they attempt to reclaim the stolen diamond, they are chased away and their car demolished before the spacecraft takes off. By nightfall Nancy is too large to restrain. Wrapping sheets around her body, she escapes by tearing the roof off her own mansion. "I know where my husband is!" she exclaims, heading toward town. "He's with that woman! I'll find him." Cornering the cheating lovers, she rips the roof off the bar in which they're hiding and hurls a beam onto Honey, killing her. She then picks up Harry and carries him away like a <a href="../../../r/a/g/Rag_doll.html" title="Rag doll">rag doll</a> (which is the prop that was actually used in this scene). The sheriff fires a <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_gun.html" title="Riot gun">riot gun</a> at an electrical <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">transformer</a> as she passes it and she falls to the ground, electrocuted along with the husband she only wanted to herself.</p>

<p>The movie was remade in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_film.html" title="1993 in film">1993</a> as <i>Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman</i>, starring <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Hannah_58f0.html" title="Daryl Hannah">Daryl Hannah</a> in the leading role. Although it was a low-budget production, the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s_in_film.html" title="1990s in film">1990s</a> special effects were sufficient to make Hannah a convincing <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giantess.html" title="Giantess">giantess</a>. Whenever she gets angry, she starts to grow. And this movie is a little more revealing. One memorable scene showed her using a swimming pool for a bathtub, whilst talking to her normal-sized husband (played by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Baldwin_11f7.html" title="Daniel Baldwin">Daniel Baldwin</a>) on the poolside. The movie also had a strong <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> undercurrent; the heroine's "<a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlargement_%28in_fiction%29.html" title="Enlargement (in fiction)">enlargement</a>" is a metaphor for her <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">emancipation</a> from the men who previously had controlled her life. The ending had also been changed.</p>

<i>Attack Of The 60 Foot Centerfold</i> parodied the original film.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1995, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Olen_Ray_95ea.html" title="Fred Olen Ray">Fred Olen Ray</a> produced a parody entitled <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_60_Foot_Centerfold_6f47.html" title="Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold">Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold</a></i>, starring J.J. North and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Parks_0b20.html" title="Tammy Parks">Tammy Parks</a>. Beyond the basic premise, the plot had little in common with the original movie, being concerned with the side-effects of a beauty-enhancing formula on two ambitious girl models. The movie was deliberately farcical and made on an extremely low budget; the illusion of size-difference was achieved using <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_perspective.html" title="Forced perspective">forced perspective</a>, unlike the earlier movies which used composite imaging.</p>

<p><i>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman</i> was most recently released as part of <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_Comics_47b4.html" title="AC Comics">AC Comics</a> Gargantarama DVD available at accomics.com. <i>Gargantarama — Giant Women In the Movies</i> is an original production which examines the phenomena of <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giantess.html" title="Giantess">giantess</a> women in fantasy cinema. Giant women is a popular fantasy often explored in the pages of <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_Comics_47b4.html" title="AC Comics">AC Comics</a>' <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femforce.html" title="Femforce">Femforce</a>, Giantess and Big 'Uns. This is the video equivalent showing fantasy scenes of well-endowed women such as Anita Ekberg, Joy Harmon and J. J. North (among others) as giant women on the silver screen. This production is the precursor to an all new giant woman video coming from Galaxy International in 2006 and includes special effects test scenes showing how to make an actress into a giantess. Run in its entirety is the 1958 cult sci-fi classic <i>Attack Of the 50-Foot Woman</i> starring Allison Hayes, which was not previously available on DVD. Special added attraction is a new 22 minute production, THE AMAZING COLOSSAL WOMAN starring BRENNA BARRY as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garganta.html" title="Garganta">Garganta</a>. Initially designed to be a three-minute trailer to display giantess effects, this production was expanded as a homage to the low-budget sci-fi thrillers of the 1950's. To make it even more retro, it is released in glorious black and white.</p>
