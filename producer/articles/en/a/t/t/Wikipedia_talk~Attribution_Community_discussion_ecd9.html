<p>This discussion is not sufficiently widely advertised. One thing that is needed and that is missing is prominent proposed-merge tags on WP:V, WP:NOR and WP:RS, with links to this discussion.

<dd>Blueboar, do you really think an edit summary of "...he can't add merge tags because the pages are locked... so all he can do is (over) complain" is helpful? Maybe you might consider that a number of people here believe these merge tags should be installed, and that the fact that they are being resisted is really ironic, given that we are all here right now because they weren't used the first time around? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:28, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The chief argument for this was that they had an extensive area of overlap. It is more efficient to state the same policy in the same place, once. When they diverged, as they did from time to time, the result was two somewhat different policies on the same issue, of equal authority.</p>
<p>As a lesser advantage, "verification" in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> was not the common meaning of "verify": confirming the <b>truth</b> of what Wikipedia asserted; but checking that Wikipedia's statement could be attributed to a reliable source, and was therefore not original research.

<li>When I first heard of the proposal to merge V and NOR into one combined Policy my initial reaction was negative. Especially since part of the proposal involved also shifting RS (which I have been involved in heavily) to a FAQ page. I was sceptical, thinking that this might be an backhanded way to slip policy changes past the watchful eye of the community, under the guise of simplification. While I did not get heavily involved with the drafting, I did pay attention to the discussion about it. After a while I discovered that my fears had no basis. The folks who drafted this really did mean it when they said they did not intend to change anything. Before too long I found that I had changed my mind... this actually was a <i>very</i> good idea. While V, NOR and RS seem to be seperate concepts, they actually overlap in many areas... Perhaps not in wording, but in concept. Changes to one greatly affected the others. We even had times where they were in direct conflict - two policies saying opposite things about the same idea. It now makes sense to me to have them combined into one Policy to avoid such confusion. Not only was this merger good... it should have been done a while ago. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I fully agree with the merger. The concepts expressed in the two policies are both part of the same basic idea that everything we report here be based in external confirmable reality. Simplifying redundant policies into cohesive single pages is an excellent idea and should be done often to avoid both inconsistency of policy and inadvertent <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a>. If nothing else I hope we keep the rewording from "verifiability, not truth" to "attributability, not truth", because the first was oxymoronic and meant "truth, not truth". --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 23:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I disagree with merging these two. No original research, and no novel syntheses, is different form verifiability. Something can be verifiable from impeccable primary sources but still be original research because it is compiled <i>entirely</i> from primary sources, and Wikipedia is not a publisher of first instance. The value of WP:ATT is in taking the examples and putting them in context, showing how - well, <i>attribution</i> is necessary and how it should be done. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:34, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Yes</b>. Of course. The policies are intimately related; after all, Original Research is essentially an argument or synthesis that cannot be Verified to a Reliable Source. Combining them clarifies the relationship between them, and helps avoid policy (and guideline) divergence. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:24, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>YES! Until now, it's been impossible to clearly articulate and enforce NOR or RS. People followed V, but almost never NOR, and rarely RS until now.

<ul>
<li>Yes, indeed. People were always complaining about the policies being spread over two pages — three pages if you count RS — and in addition newbies got confused about how the word "verifiability" was being used. This is much clearer, and it was a very popular move. I've received more e-mails in the last few months saying this was a good move than over any other single issue since I've been at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, but now that is has been done, I think the more important questions are should ATT totally subsume V and NOR (and possibly RS), should ATT just go away, or should ATT be a summary policy and the others more in-depth explorations? I lean toward the third option. I can't see a rationale for completely undoing ATT. A lot of good faith work has gone into it, and while some of us weren't entirely happy with the process, that's kind of water under the bridge at this point. The real challenge will be to have separate documents that actually agree with each other. I don't think this problem is insurmountable at all. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 01:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. WP:V and WP:NOR should not have been merged. At one time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Verifiability&amp;oldid=2335833" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Verifiability&amp;oldid=2335833" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> had instructions for how Wikipedians should verify article content. The instructions for fact-checking by Wikipedians stressed the importance of multiple unimpeachable sources to support statements in encyclopedia articles. Of course, that was bad news for POV pushers, but WP:A now tells us that only for certain "exceptional claims" need editors think about comparing multiple reliable sources in order to check facts. This change does not help editors keep garbage out of articles and improve the encyclopedia. There was never any problem in having WP:V and WP:NOR discuss similar issues from different perspectives. WP:V should go back to its roots and serve as a resource for guiding Wikipedians in their fact checking work. WP:NOR is needed for examples that define the distinction between trying to slip unpublished research into Wikipedia and doing the kind of analysis of sources that Wikipedians must do in order to produce an encyclopedia. Merging the two pages only serves to weaken and dilute those important functions. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 02:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>YES, there has not been a single refutation of my <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Very_logical_merger:_proof" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">proof</a>, so the merger is a good idea. More seriously, attribution doesn't mean you should not compare and contrast sources... but in any case, I'm very glad that this merger has highlighted (although it's irritating that it is being blamed for) the role of truth in more recent versions of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> than those cited above.

<ul>
<li>Let me start from rephrasing my very first objection I ever made w.r.t. WP:A. I am afraid that this section title is a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_question.html" title="Loaded question">loaded question</a>, and vaguely (I am sure, inadvertently) stated, too. Yes, the <b>pages</b> were merged. But the <b>policies</b> were not. The renaming them from "policies" to "key principles" is merely a bureaucratic trick. Of course, there was much trimming/cleanup done in the process, but if right now you cut WP:A into two pieces along the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visible_panty_line.html" title="Visible panty line">VPL</a> (er..., "visible partition line") and rename "key principles" back into "policies", will it make any difference? IMO one of the core troubles is that the two WP:NOR &amp; WP:V had their long lines of evolution, and significantly shifted in essence, so that their meanings and purposes are no longer immediately deduced from their titles, and this confuses new generations. This happens all the time with many technical terms in all natural languages (take the word "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a>"). Their contents grew over time until it became evident that the two bushes turned into one thicket. Naturally, many felt that something should be done. But I have an impression that <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_jokes.html#Army_NCOs" title="Russian jokes">instead of thinking and deciding how to proceed</a>, the merge itself and the discussion of what is to be done run in parallel (and the first draft of VP:A (whose structure I like more) differs from the result drastically).</li>

<dd>After this long rant, let me answer to the "correct" question: <b>Should the policies WP:V and WP:NOR be merged?</b> — <b>YES</b>, but... <small>(to be continued...)</small> (and to the original one: yes, it was a useful and instructive exercise) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 04:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>YES - As a result of creating Wikipedia:Attribution, the debates at AfD began to move away from the subject test of whether a topic was important or famous enough to include in Wikipedia towards the objective test of whether there was sufficient <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source material</a> to include a <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attributable</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">encyclopedic</a> article about the topic. Instead of telling newcomers that Wikipedia doesn't want their article <u>and</u> thinks the topic is unimportant (which really gets newcomers upset), the AfD focus began to move towards yes, the topic is important, but there is not enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source material</a> to include an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attributable</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">encyclopedic</a> article about the topic.

<li>yes - easy to understand policies are important - it means more people will follow them. if it is possible to merge these two into an new, easier to understand one (which, as far as i can tell, has been achieved with WP:ATT), then it should certainly be done. to be able to accurately summarize one's policies in as few sentences as possible seems to be a good goal for any policy maker. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 09:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm undecided. I agree with the valid point made above that "attribution" is a more accurate wording than "verifiability", as "verification" usually refers (outside Wikipedia) to determining the <i>truth</i> of an assertion, rather than attributing it to an external source. Therefore, the famous Wikipedia doctrine <i>"Verifiability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion"</i> makes little sense to many non-Wikipedians. However, it might have been better to simply rename <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and keep <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as a separate policy. Although they do refer to two sides of the same coin - original research is, by definition, the <i>absence</i> of attribution - it's sometimes clearer to refer to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, especially when explaining things at AfD. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 09:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. My initial reaction to the announcement of the merger was skepticism and a bit of dismay at not having known about it before. However, the more I thought about it (and looked at the result), the more I liked it. As long as reliable sources remains independent (as it really is an independent issue), I don't see any big problems with merging verifiability and no-original-research, except that it will take awhile for everyone to use the new jargon.

<li><b>Yes</b>. I was also taken aback at discovering that there'd been a change, but once I'd realised that it was only a change in organisation, I thought that it was significantly better. In fact, I'd be dismayed if it changed back permanently. More than half my time is spent removing text that's simply placed in articles without explaantion o source (and often having to argue with people who don't have time for explaantions or source-finding, but have plenty for acrimonious protests); the simpler and clearer the policies and guidelines are, the better.

WP:BOLD should apply here as well... 5 months seems more than adequate, simply because someone didn't send every registered wikipedia member a personal invite on their talk pages does not mean that adequate warning wasn't given. Furthermore, even if the process of creating the new page irked some people, it has no bearing on whether or not the results of the process (i.e. the new page) is beneficial to the project. That is the only thing that matters: Does the new ATT page significantly improve the project. It does. That's all that matters to me. Plus, as a tacit verification of acceptance, the new page seems to be being used in many places.

<li>I am one of those editors who does not offen comment on policy pages, and didn't really follow this discussion when it (the merge) was happening. That said, the merge seemed logical to me. I tell someone "We can't have OR" and they wonder, "How can I show that this isn't OR", the answer: provide verification. So they post something from their website. No, provide verification from a reliable source. It just made sense to me to take out the overlap under the heading of attribution. Also, as others have pointed out, we don't actually verify (go and check each source -- especially print sources), we merely expect the information to be attributed.

<li><b>No</b> - firstly, they are distinct, secondly, many people do not know what "attribution" means while "verify" (root word) and "no original research" and "reliable sources" are common words and commonly understood. I didn't even know about the discussion despite 12 months of activity on Wikipedia and regularly reading many of the policies, and I don't doubt others were in the same boat - I heard about it by accident from another admin a few weeks after it took place, and even now most people on AfD debates don't seem to know they've been merged. I do tend to favour harmonising the policies to create an overarching Attribution framework, but keeping the others as core policies much as we have parent and child Wikiprojects.

<li><b>Aye</b>, all the relevant pieces can be better displayed in one place. Taking the long term view, editors don't just figure out the minutiae of policy and how it is applied from reading the policy, they also get there by observing and being involved in day-to-day editing, therefore seeing how it is applied and how others interpret it.

<li>WP:ATT (with an accompanying FAQ for detail) is better; it is more concise and easier to absorb (for new users especially). Since this is a core concept and policy, it can only be a benefit to the project to communicate it all in one way and one place. (Yes, the topics, to any reasonable approximation, are one concept.) Make the replaced policies inactive and leave their redirects pointing at them (with links to ATT at the top of the page, obviously). Incorporate any detail in WP:RS that is not captured in ATT in the ATTFAQ.

<li><b>No</b>. On the surface, all three existing policies do fall under the heading of attribution, and I'm all in favor of merging policies in the spirit of clarity, conciseness, and avoiding instruction creep. However, I think there are fundamental areas where the policies do not overlap, and even contradict one another, that have not been resolved to my satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll give an example. Back in July 2006, I wrote an article on the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke_chess_problem.html" title="Joke chess problem">joke chess problem</a>. It was a notable topic, for sure, and I took care to cite references for all the chess problems in the method that is conventional for that field. So it fulfills the criteria of verifiability and reliable sources without question. What about original research? There I have misgivings (though not enough to contemplate deleting it). I'm not aware of any article that has discussed the "joke chess problem" as an independent subject in the past; basically, I collected six or seven problems that have individually been identified as jokes by others. Arguably, then, it's synthesis of cited material. So does it violate Wikipedia's inclusion policies or not? Under the old split policy, we have multiple factors to consider, and when they are all weighed together, my opinion (which is of course biased) is that it's not so much synthesis of published material, as rather collecting related items under a single article title. When making this judgment, it's helpful to treat the OR question separately from the verifiability question. If someone makes a judgment based on a unified attribution policy, he/she might come to delete the article as "synthesis" without appreciating the relevance of the sources and the nature of the relationship between them.</p>
<p>I can also envisage the opposite kind of case, where there is no original research (for example, it's a patently obvious phenomenon such as the monthly lunar cycle) but the verifiability of details in reliable sources (such as an astronomy journal or book which discussed the monthly lunar cycle) might be hard to find. In that case also, where two policies seem to contradict, I'd prefer to leave it to the judgment of editors how to reconcile them, rather than trying to make a blanket merger policy. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 00:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really think this is an argument pro or con merging. A discussion about joke chess problems would be the same under the current set of policy pages as under the new proposed policy. As it is I'm unsure about these types of pages. Reluctantly I'm in favor but only if NOR is really kept to a minimum. It would be my preference that such an overview of chess joke problems would (first) published in some chess forum than in an encyclopedia. On the other hand, especially for popular or fringe topics that may restrict too much. So, if this page were in AfD, I'd give a small <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESander123_7c7c.html" title="User:Sander123">Sander123</a> 14:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Yes.</b> As someone who has been translating the policy to a smaller Wikipedia (ro.wp) for quite some time and who has been doing his best to explain the policy to many users, I understand how frustrating it is that you can never talk about original research without talking about verifiability and reliable sources. I had always wondered why they had to be separate in the first place. Original research is <i>defined</i> through verifiability --- look at the nutshell in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> ---, and how can a policy be fundamental if it's built upon another? I believe that "No original research", though very important, can only be a part of a wider policy, call it "attribution" or "verifiability" or whatever. I certainly welcome the merger. — <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdiJapan_10e9.html" title="User:AdiJapan"><font color="#0000C0">Adi</font><font color="#8080FF">Japan</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAdiJapan_6c19.html" title="User talk:AdiJapan"><font color="#4040FF">☎</font></a> 01:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yes.</b> Splitting policy over multiple, small, partly overlapping pages is a bad thing. Only if the topics are clearly separate should a new page be made. Here it is only confusing.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Yes.</b> NOR and V are difficult concepts to explain, as many have observed above in this section. The nutshell statement of "All material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source" explains the policy much more clearly. "Attributable" is a much better word than "Verifiable", especially when contrasted with "True". The change is a big step forward, IMHO. --<a href="../../../j/d/l/User%7EJdlh_4644.html" title="User:Jdlh">Jdlh</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/l/User_talk%7EJdlh_a32b.html" title="User talk:Jdlh">Talk</a> 08:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>No.</b> This is one of those situations where there is no "right" answer. Clearly all the WP policies could be merged into one single article WP:* and editors who did something wrong could be told "you violated *" or "you violated * section 3.1." But V, OR, RS, NPOV, AGF etc. are all part of the Wikipedia culture and language. There are zillions of discussion pages where these terms are used. I think is is better to leave these bits of jargon unchanged even though there is overlap. It's more helpful to keep continuity then to strive for some perfect policy organization.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 10:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No.</b> While I would support merging WP:RS into WP:V (and WP:Attribution is a better name for the resulting page), yet I am strongly opposed to merging WP:NOR into it. Firstly, in principle: WP:NOR refers to a different class of problems. It is possible to violate WP:V/WP:A without violating WP:NOR, and technically it is possible the other way around, when the attribution is a reference to OR. Secondly, in practice: these policies are invoked in talk page discussions, and they are often invoked to deal with different situations. Merging them would obfuscate such arguments, robbing them of strength and clarity. It is better to refer to the specific policy, pinpointing: <i>this</i> is what is being violated here; rather than to refer to an all-inclusive, complex piece of legalese. WP:NOR should stand on its own. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 10:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Probably</b>, but I do have a problem with the continual rewriting of fundamental policies. Those of us who have views on this but would rather be writing an encyclopedia than arguing policy find we keep getting dragged back in to re-fight battles we thought were one. In my case, it seems like twice a year I have to waste significant time making the case for three different issues: (1) that you don't throw away a reference just because a URL is broken, (2) that for many topics the best references will not be in English and (3) that the "no original research" and "reliable sources" rules are intended to prevent us from including dubious material, not to turn turn this into a timewasting game in which people spend all of their time finding overt citation for the obvious rather than writing new content. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:32, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yes</b> V is important and unambiguous. OR was widely abused in wikilawyering, since it was no ill-defined. Original was the problem word.

<li><b>Yes</b> It is much better to have the policies combined. The merged document looks much clearer. A writer now needs only refer to one document, to understand that all statements should be attributable, as opposed to three. Much more efficient. Makes understanding the policies easier.

<ul>
<li><b>Yes</b> WP:V is a positive "what is OK " while WP:NOR is a negative "what is not OK" on a similar topic. It makes sense to me to have them combined in a single policy for ease of interpretation. It can be confusing to have to look at two or more policies to determine what is appropriate. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 05:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I can see value in both approaches, the two policies were different lenses viewing the same thing, Wikipedia consolidates and aggregates existing knowledge rather than adding to the corpus of knowledge in its own right. In that sense, two policies saying the same thing could be abused and has the potential to be confusing. However different people respond better to some communications than others and saying the same thing in a different way improves the probablility of understanding. That said there is an issue of readability, where the article takes up more than a couple of screen lengths it's not easily screen readable and from a policy perspective that reduces the probability of compliance. On balance and in the interests of policy rationalisation I'd tend to support the merger of WP:V and WP:NOR however the merged policy should call supporting material to provide the editor with background and explanatory material, aiding readability and utility.ALR 08:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

We have a spam blacklist and we need a sources blacklist for unreliable sources that are frequently cited by Wikipedians.

<li>I have to quibble with Jossi's statement a bit... I would say that the <i>concept</i> of having reliable sources <i>is</i> policy - as it is mentioned as being a key concept on <i>all</i> of the policy pages we are discussing. What isn't policy is the guideline page: "Wikipedia:Reliable sources" - that <i>page</i> is only a guideline ... this is an important distinction. One problem with V and NOR was that while they mention the need for reliable sources they don't really give an explanation of what that phrase means or how to determine what a reliable source is. The WP:RS guideline was created to fill in this omission. The ATT Policy, on the other hand, <i>does</i> give a clearer explanation of what we mean by Reliable Source(especially when you add in the attendant FAQ page). So... I would say that the <i>CONCEPT</i> of RS should indeed be part of ATT. The ATT/FAQ page should be worked on and eventually promoted to a guideline status firmly under the ATT banner. If we keep ATT, then I do not see the need for the WP:RS guideline... However, if we go back to V and NOR, then we should keep WP:RS as a guideline to explain the concept. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No</b>. If they remain merged, RS is quite a different topic. Merging that with this loses is value, I believe.

<li><b>Probably not</b>. RS is sort of a HOWTO on the topic of fulfilling ATT / V+NOR. On the other hand, ATT should make more than a passing reference to the concepts of RS, and in fact, the <i>idea</i> of RS should be made plain in ATT as policy, while the <i>execution</i> of RS should be in the RS guideline. Merging the two promotes RS to policy status, and that promotion should have a discussion all to itself before such a merger takes place. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 00:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>No</b> I was torn about this, since ATT should include a requirement that sources be reliable. After some thought, and originally considering Yes, I came to a conclusion. What is really needed is 3 pages: <i>Why</i> we cite sources (WP:ATT), <i>How</i> to cite sources (WP:CITE), and <i>What</i> sources we should cite (WP:RS). These three pages should be internally cross referenced so people are directed to read all three, but since all 3 serve a different purpose, we should maintain all 3 seperately. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No</b>. Reliability is not doctrinal and should not be enforcable in the way that policy can be. Different sources have different levels of reliability subject to their own characteristics and the use which is made of them and even the topic area within which one is operating. Efforts to migrate RS away from a doctrinal and rigid approach were strongly resisted by some segments of the community, to the detriment of the support available to editors. WP:RS does need some considerable work, but it should be treated as a tool to support editors. Some topic areas suit a more doctrinal approach, others benefit from a more pragmatic and informed approach to source assessment.ALR 08:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yes</b>. In fact, between NOR and RS, RS is the one that should be merged with V first. If you need to unmerge, try unmerging NOR. Original research other than pure ideas requires verifiability and reliability, too, simply a different type (primary, secondary, and tertiary all being available to OR). That may cause some difficulty in merging the policy.

<li>Yes, but this means not much positive besides that some people did a good job. The questions remain whether this job was useful, whether the job of restructuring may be done even better, whether the job decreased the uncertainties of the original policies, and whether this version is mature enough to be declared a new/replacement/whatever policy `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 04:59, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes. The current text of ATT represents current practise and policy extremely well, and is much clearer than having text spread across three pages (V, NOR, and RS) that were time-consuming to maintain, and confusing for editors, particularly new ones. In addition, the titles of NOR and V caused confusion. Some people thought that "no original research" meant no research at all, which of course is absurd, and others thought "verify" meant they were expected to find out whether particular claims were true, rather than simply attributed. It was for both those reasons — ease of access on one page and clarity of title — that the move to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> was made and it turned out to be very popular. As I've said elsewhere, I've had more e-mails (positive ones) about this issue than about any other single issue since I joined Wikipedia nearly two and a half years ago. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, on the whole. In fundamental content there is little difference between this and the earlier policies.

<li>No. This is my answer to the question above, because this seems to be set up like a poll. Any discussion of this topic is supposed to take place at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Role of truth</a> at least for now unless the discussion is moved elsewhere. (I am relatively neutral about where the discussion takes place; I said it would be on this page; someone else moved it there.) However, I feel my answer to the above question belongs here. My answer is: No, it is not a fair representation of the policies; it contains a very basic, fundamental flaw: the new proposed wording at WP:ATT says "not whether it is true" without balancing this with a word such as "verifiability", thus it invites editors to knowingly insert false (but attributable) statements -- something the longstanding policies did not do.

<li>Further comment: The fact that multiple editors do believe it has made fundamental changes to policy indicates that WP:ATT's language does not have consensus yet, and these concerns should be addressed with discussion and resolution (and, this is not the same concern as to whether the merger of multiple policies into ATT is a good idea). — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 01:33, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Although WP:ATT comes close to representing present <i>policy</i>, it does not represent prevailing <i>practice</i>. The two diverge in that the policy is widely, though tacitly, interpreted as encouraging editors to tolerate unsourced but undisputed content, while challenging sourced but flagrantly non-credible content.

<dd>I have to disagree with the last few comments. The requirement that articles be backed by reliable sources is prominently stated in both NOR and V (and NPOV) ... there has not been an "elevation" of RS to policy status - it always <i>was</i> part of Policy. What <i>may</i> have changed is the emphysis and language used to define the term "reliable sources". That, perhaps, could be improved upon... but it is somewhat misleading to say that "ATT <i>elevates</i> RS to Policy". I have written more on this below. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Blueboar, at the moment nearly 50% of ATT talks about reliability, if ATT is a policy then that makes the discussion mandatory and enforcable notwithstanding the opportunity of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, if Reliability has not been elevated to policy then what's the content doing in a policy statement? The current wording in ATT itself appears to go further than V or NOR went in the past, taking in some of what was in RS. That's elevation in my book.</dd>
<dd>The relationship of the FAQ with policy or guideline is unclear at present, if it remains tied to ATT then it's policy, if it's not policy then it should sit in its own right as guidance. The wording of the FAQ does tend more towards guidance at the moment but it should have a clear place in the hierarchy, at the moment it doesn't.</dd>

<li>NO. As important as attribution is, it should never be used as a weapon to destroy an article. I see this happen a lot.

<li>I don't think so. The majority of (non-vandal) article edits I see are about accuracy, challenges to accuracy, and external sources used to justify edits.

<li>I disagree. First, I would argue that lists of things <i>should</i> be in most cases cited, one by one.

And these collections are <i>not</i> origional research unless there is synthesis; to use the example above, the list of Princeton University people, the list does not say "And because all these senators went to Princeton, Princeton must produce really awesome people" or, alternatively, "..., Princeton is obviously part of the dark conspiracy bent described <a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">here</a> bent on controlling the world" - THAT would be original research, and I think the section "Unpublished synthesis of published material" makes that distinction clear. The only quesiton is whether this would lead to thousands of vendettas against any uncited fact, because I agree that this might be harmful (see comments below). <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 13:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Although there is agreement to the principles, there is no agreement really on the detailed proper meaning of OR, or the definition of how much N needs to be sourced to justify a stub, or many other matters. The debates at AfD make this evident. There is therefore probably something to be gained by separating the principles from the details; just as the various subpages of N had the details, and just as the RS page can be seen as a more specifically detailed discussion. I think keeping the basic material together at one place will probably facilitate it. The literal following of JW's advice would delete half the encyclopedia. The use of it as a general principle is however very valuable. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Sort of</b> - I think I agree with DGG on this. It seems like the actual result of the old attribution policy (WP:V and friends) and this attribution policy is that you can't argue against deleting unverifiable information and win, usually - I think the difference at work here is whether to take this as a moral imperative: "I must destroy all uncited information," or merely strong permission: "If something seems problematic, and is not cited, I have full license to remove it, and doing so is probably a good idea." The former could be harmful, the latter is important - it puts the burden of proof on whoever wants to <i>add</i> information. I say this knowing that I'd probably have to put some work into citing things (lists of people <b>especially</b>) - but it's a good idea. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 13:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Aside from those, I believe unsourced <i>plausible</i> content should generally be subject to challenge rather than immediate deletion. Such content should be identified as unsourced using maintenance tags, an opportunity offered to source it, and then deleted if not souced after some reasonable period of time. This gives challenging editors a certain degree of discretion based on their view of how plausible the content is. In an edit dispute, challengers who think the added content is complete nonsense would be within their rights to delete it, and this means that contentious edit disputes should result in especially well-sourced articles, which is an appropriate outcome. However, an editor who's simply attempting to do clean-up should point out the lack of sources and provide an opportunity for sources to be provided. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 03:56, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Assuming the maintenance tag concept remains, it might be useful to have a template to implement maintenance tags that would have a way of identifying the beginning as well as the end of specific statements or parts of paragraphs which a challenger is claiming are unsourced. Sometimes in contentious articles one needs to identify something very specific and a tag that's only added to the end can be ambiguous as to where the unsourced part begins.

<li><b>No</b> Articles should be improved, not razed. If a statement is questionable, tag it and/or discuss it on the talk page, then possibly delete it. If it it looks accurate and bona-fide, let it stand until a substantiated objection is made; in the meantime look for references and urge other editors to do so. If deleting on principle is made policy, it will just give excuse to critics to maul articles without doing any work improving them: the easy road to take.

<li><b>Yes and No</b>. IMO, deleting an unattributed statement without warning is a violation of WP's "work together" ethic. On the other hand, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources", and such unattributed (or only weakly attributed) claims ought to be removed.<br />
But there is a "middle-way" that is compliant with both aspects of WP policy: Extraordinary claims could be flagged for a certain period (say, two weeks) but after which the problem statement could be removed without repercussions.<br />
Along these lines, I suggest a new {{extraordinary|auto-remove-after=xxxx|statement requiring extraordinary sources goes here}} to bridge the gap. -- <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFullstop_7a4f.html" title="User:Fullstop">Fullstop</a> 10:46, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Most will agree it is more harmful to succumb to the curse of traditional sources of information which is being limited in the available knowledge. Wikipedia is only useful if it can contribute more information with a more user friendly interface then traditional encyclopedias; this is the niche it must fill or be lost to history as a failed social experiment. Anyone can go look up something on Encarta if they wanted a more reliable source, but if you wanted easy access to an article on your local high school or why <a href="../../../2E/9/9/.999....html" title=".999...">.999...</a> = 1, you would be at a loss. Unique and not easily accesible information is what brings people to Wikipedia, and while it is nice for information to be sourced, deleting much of what makes Wikipedia great is a big mistake.--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorfer_9f56.html" title="User:Jorfer">JEF</a> 23:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>No</b>, I sometimes add {{fact}} tags where I know the information is true and uncontroversial, but where I feel a citation could be helpful to readers who want more information. Too many editors treat these tags as if they said "delete me"; a licence to remove information without really thinking about it. That is a simplistic approach, and to my mind, a bit of a cop-out. If we want to implement some auto-delete-after-a-certain-date policy, then that needs a different tag. {{Fact}} has a much richer set of uses than that. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 01:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No</b> Collaborative writing of articles demands that at some point, there will be unattributed statements in articles. {{fact}} is useful as a placeholder for statements that still need to be sourced. It could mean that someone is putting the article up first, with the intention of going back to add the source later. For example, in my case as a former U.S. Senate employee, there are certain factual or anecdotal things I personally know regarding how the Senate operates. Since it isn't always possible to immediately find an attributable source other than my own memory, {{fact}} is a useful placeholder and notifies readers that "we're working on it." That being said, I think "trust but verify" should be the standard. If an editor sees an unattributed source, maybe they should do more than add {{fact}} or delete it. If he or she has time, then verify the statement and add citation accordingly.<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 18:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No</b>. I think that my general outlook on the removal or deletion of any material holds water in most of these cases. Deletion (of articles or material from an article) should be reserved for material that <i>cannot</i> satisfy the requirements laid out for reliable, verifiable, attributed sources; not for material that simply does not <i>currently</i> satisfy the requirement. There's a big difference between an unsourced statement, and an unsourceable one. There are, however, in my opinion, exceptions to this general rule: I think that being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> in removing likely vandalism, hoaxes or contentious material about living persons is required for the smooth operation of the encyclopedia. In general, however, I think we should consider the long view, that articles tend to improve over time, and sources may not be close-at-hand for every editor. I myself have added statements without sourcing, hit up the library the next day and gone back to add the references. For sources that aren't readily availible online, the editing and the sourcing cannot be concurrent, unless you do the research first and then bring it home (or to a computer) to edit, which isn't the way most editors I know do their work, they write and source as they go. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 10:00, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In reply to tjstrf: No, that wording has essentially the same problem. The problem is that "not truth" implies two things: (1) true but unattributable material is unacceptable and (2) false but attributable material is acceptable. The second of these is undesirable. As far as the second item is concerned, it would be best to say nothing about truth, and let people use common sense and the status quo in trying to decide whether a Wikipedian writing a Wikipedia article means what that one says.</dd>
<dd>The word "verifiability" contains the idea of "truth" in its definition, so it negates the second item. If "verifiability" is taken away, something else needs to replace it; unless there is a consensus that when someone knowingly writes false statements into a Wikipedia article, as plain statements without prose attribution, they are actually helping to write the encyclopedia; is anyone willing to admit that they support that? And if so, what do you think the ultimate purpose of Wikipedia is? I mean, if you think the purpose of Wikipedia is to write a summary of what's in the literature regardless of whether it conforms to reality, then what is the purpose of writing such a summary? To complete homework assignments with the purpose of getting good marks regardless of whether one learns anything useful? To leave a record, after our civilization falls, of the falsehoods we believed so that some later civilization can learn from our mistakes? Or what?</dd>
<dd>I think the purpose of Wikipedia is to provide information that conforms to reality a large proportion of the time, and that requiring attribution is merely a method of trying to achieve that goal. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 18:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

People don't resort to an encyclopedia because they believe it offers information on a given topic that is "attributable", but because they believe they can rely upon it to be <i>correct</i> -- i.e., as close to truth as any accessible source can get. Since Wikipedia encourages readers to use it as they would an encyclopedia, it has a responsibility either to attempt to meet that expectation or to downmarket itself as a product (but so far I haven't seen any disclaimers saying, "You must check the footnotes for each statement you read in Wikipedia, and believe what it says only if you are convinced the footnote is of sufficiently high quality"). When a WP editor is constrained by policy to leave sourced but known falsehood <i>in</i>, while taking known but unsourced truth <i>out</i>, Wikipedia content will fail to pass the "smell test", and be useless for what readers come to it for. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 01:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree that the wording does leave the idea that: "(2) false but attributable material is acceptable." and this has bothered me, so I will speak out now that it has been brought up in this context. I understand that you can't claim truth without references, but you can't claim something you believe to be false is really true, just because you have references. And if you have a reference you believe is wrong, you don't have to include it (although I have seen arguments to the contrary). I think the concept of "verifiability, not truth" needs to be reworked. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 20:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree in principle with what Coppertwig is saying here, however, lets look at it this way. Consider this wording: "<i>Truth is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for the inclusion of information in Wikipedia. Where any statement of objective fact is added to an article, such statement must be attributed to a reliable source</i>" That seems to capture the essence of the "Verifiability, not truth" idea, without its inherent problems. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:13, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In editing articles relating to religion, I see aa great deal of value to the statement that the issue is not truth but attributable info. We can argue endlessly (for example) over whether the doctrine of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> is true; what is attributable is that it is a Christian doctrine that states X. People often want to make that case that such and such POV is "true" when dealing with religion articles, and the fact is that that point is irrelevent to an encyclopedia (in the sense that they mean). -- <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 02:04, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While we can argue about the truth of Trinity, there's absolutely no arguing about the truth of the statement "it is a Christian doctrine that states X". Correspondingly, the article should say precisely that and we should be relentless in making sure that no such article goes towards a presentation of the reality of Trinity. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 07:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've always had a problem with this wording. I understand the intent, but the "not truth" wording encourages trolls. It also fails to deal with what one is often, inevitably, up against on even moderately obscure topics: how to weigh conflicting evidence, which often comes down to what should be said in the article versus what belongs in a footnote.

<dl>
<dd>As far as I can tell, the word "verifiable" in Wikipedia has come to imply the word "attributable". I believe here people began using "verifiable" to mean "verifiable by a google search", and then this evolved into "verifiable using reliable sources," and finally this was shortened to "verifiable".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, whether Wikipedia says so or not, I can verify that I have ten fingers, I can verify that the sun rose today, and I can also verify that paper cuts often hurt. To people in the real world, these are easily "verifiable" facts. But they are not so easy to attribute to a published source, though; and crucially, one would not so easily claim these points to be "attributable".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there is a conceptual difference between "attributable to a reliable source" and "verifiable using a reliable source", it seems small. The important point I am trying to make, though, is that when you shorten the phrase "attributable to a reliable source" to a single word: "attributable", you get much closer to the implied meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, i think wikipedians use the word "verifiable" a lot, and i think it would make things much clearer if they used "attributable" instead. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 17:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If done properly, the fact that the source was seriously flawed would be apparent to the reader. The people who keep bringing up this complaint are ignoring that a statement does not magically "become attributed" in a vacuum: you actually have to say who the source is, and why they are relevant. Sure, under WP:A someone could hypothetically add "According to South American KKK divisional leader and political activist John Doe, the Native Peruvians are half-llama weremen who transform under the light of a one-quarter waxing moon." and be within policy (assuming John Doe had in fact made that statement), but the statement would be obviously ludicrous to any rational reader. This is the entire point of attribution: if we divulge who makes what claim, then people can make informed judgments between conflicting ideas. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 09:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me that a lot of the original intention of Wikipedia has been lost within the details of policy sticklers and constant comparisons to mainstream encyclopedias. Much of this is due to (somewhat recent) bad press due to article inaccuracy. I thought the original intent of Wikipedia was to build an online resource which would essentially have limitless capacity for the sum of all human knowledge -- something comparable to typing a query into Google and only getting hits relevant to what you were looking for. Since anyone can edit it freely (and pretty much anonymously), of course there lies a great capacity for abuse of the editing privilege. Perhaps if this aspect of things was a little less lenient, there would be more human resources available to do proper fact-checking and attribution research. Article evolution would also likely be a little more progressive if those who are quick to point out sections that are missing or require attribution would perhaps also care to add those citations themselves rather than simply complain about them. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 15:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I acknowledge that "verifiable" has problems, as detailed above. But "attribution" seems to have complementary problems. If I source some claim with "my neighbor, John Doe, address such-and-such, told me so", or even "I called Jane Dee herself and asked, and this is what she told me", by the <i>ordinary</i> meaning of "attribution" I have indeed attributed my claim, but it doesn't count squat for Wikipedia purposes, and rightly so. "Verifiable" alone is bad because one assumes that it is the content of the claim that must be verified, and it is not: we want the <i>attribution</i> to be a verifiable fact. But on the other hand, an "attribution" alone means nothing if it cannot be verified. What we need is a <b>verifiable attribution</b>.

<li><b>Yes</b> Because that is literally all this is. Often one editor adds info, and another comes back and adds a citation for it. The chance that they used the same source? Slim to none, but there has to be some attribution. Verifiability, in the truest sense of the term, doesn't always occur at Wikipedia. For example, when editors review articles for GA or FA, they don't interview the subjects, or visit the places, or watch the movies to see if the original sources are accurate in what they have reported. These reviewers only confirm that the article is well-referenced by established and respected sources. For the sheer volume of this encyclopedia, that is all we can realistically attain to. Attribution. Even if we <i>called</i> it something different that's all it would be. That's all it <i>can</i> be. And that, actually, is good standard in light of what Wikipedia seeks to be — a tome for broad human knowledge. Most <i>magazines</i> have a lower standard. --<big><a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d"><font face="Magneto">Esprit15d</font></a></big> (<a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEsprit15d_0875.html" title="User talk:Esprit15d">talk</a> ¤ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Esprit15d_a6e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Esprit15d">contribs</a>) 12:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are. I think, two questions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does JWSchmidt assert that these tools exist in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? (I read him as not claiming this; but it would clear the air to say so.)</li>
<li>If not, what would these tools be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, blacklisting of unreliable sources (short of extreme cases, like the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Enquirer_cab4.html" title="National Enquirer">National Enquirer</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a>) is insufficiently subtle. Often a source is reliable for one purpose and unreliable for another. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 21:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Indeed, I suggest that JWSchmidt's argument shows a certain bias.There is no source that is automatically reliable above all other possible sources in general. Any source can be challenged by one of equal or greater authority. And I do not think there is consensus that there are no purposes whatever where the NEnq could be used--it does document the existence of absurd beliefs.

<li><b>Yes</b> These are conceptually different ideas.

<li>What do you mean by "changes"? If we want to bring policies in line with practice, is that a "change in policy" since it changes the in-writing policy, or is it "not a change in policy" since it doesn't change the policy as practiced?

<li>I think a discussion of whether we should make changes to this policy/these policies is a <i>prerequisite</i> to merging the policy documents. There are two reasons for this: one, pure efficiency, as it seems silly to me to merge portions of policies that are going to be changed immediately afterwards; and two, it seems to me that it would be easier to change the policies while they're in the form most people are familiar with, i.e., separate. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 00:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>No</b>. There are many flaws with the current text of the policies, but top priority is to bring about the merger.

On the talk page, the creator of the article/list seems fairly open that it is intended to demonstrate something. To me, that is an exercise in OR, <i>even if each constituent fact can be sourced somewhere</i> (which is why it is not good to think that the OR concept is subsumed under something called "attribution").</p>
<p>I think there's been a tendency for us to adopt an overly lenient interpretation of the NOR principle. That overly lenient approach is being applied widely, and the written policies are not doing enough to dissuade people from it. The emphasis on verifiability and attribution tends to encourage it. I see a helluva lot of OR pervading Wikipedia, though it is not necessarily urgent to deal with it all except where there are also BLP issues involved. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 23:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I think it is ... and quite well, at that. And yet, and yet, I also think that it needs to be given more emphasis and maybe additional examples, because it's a point that a lot of valued, sincere and productive editors either find difficult or apparently just plain disagree with. I see many people, even during the current debate, give definitions of the NOR concept that are not consistent with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#Unpublished_synthesis_of_published_material" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT#Unpublished synthesis of published material</a>.</dd>

<p>Any structured list could be said to be "an unpublished synthesis of published material" unless it is taken straight out of a book - which would be absurd.

<dd>I think it was a mistake ever to have expressed the policy in a negative form: "No original research" is taken by many editors to mean "no research of any kind whatsoever"; e.g., the citation of primary source material is objected to as "original research", because, obviously, someone had to go look it up independently! If the policy is stated as a positive: "Sourced research" or "Attributable research", editors would not get confused, and also the essential identity of 'no original research' and 'verifiability' would be apparent. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 02:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The statement "Note the difference between unsourced material and original research: Unsourced material is material <i>not yet</i> attributed to a reliable source. Original research is material that <i>cannot</i> be attributed to a reliable source." is very problematic. How is an editor to prove that certain material has never been published by a reliable source, in any medium (paper, audio, video, digital, etc.) in any language? What it comes down to is really that unsourced material is information about which editors agree but have not (yet) sourced, and OR is material about which editors disagree which has not (yet) been sourced. For example, in <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluegrass_music.html" title="Bluegrass music">Bluegrass music</a>, article editors have agreed that the generational approach is not OR -- we are sure it has been written about elsewhere -- but we have yet to find a good citation for it. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 19:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>NOR definitely needs to be more clear on what is and isn't allowed. By their very nature, new articles take some form of research. Someone needs to decide to include it in Wikipedia, write the article, and find attributable sources for items included therein. College term papers and even scientific journals are all properly sourced (or should be) in way of facts. It is conclusions drawn from that research that defines whether it is "original research."</p>
<p>For example, I'm working on articles for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_U.S._Congress_88a3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Congress">Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Congress</a>. The original article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_committee.html" title="Congressional committee">congressional committees</a> was short. I helped expand the article by providing historical context on the committee structure. This required trips to the House and Senate websites, review of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Research_Service_5306.html" title="Congressional Research Service">Congressional Research Service</a> documents, individual committee histories, and the like. The bulk of the article is sourced, but is it original research? On one had it is -- I researched the topic and decided what to include in the article. However, on the other hand it is not OR, since the items in the article can be attributed to other sources. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Historical_Office_3255.html" title="United States Senate Historical Office">United States Senate Historical Office</a> did the analysis, I merely included and summarized that analysis in the article. The same is true for individual committee stubs, such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Pacific_Railroad_915b.html" title="United States Senate Committee on the Pacific Railroad">United States Senate Committee on the Pacific Railroad</a>. This committee existed in the 1800s and not a lot is published about it. Does it violate NOR if I went and reviewed <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Archives_ddd8.html" title="National Archives">National Archives</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Record_8502.html" title="Congressional Record">Congressional Globe</a> documents related to the committee to help draft the article?

<p>I think that original research has both been weakened and over-strengthened alternately by some users. Some of them seem to mean it to be only prohibiting gathering primary data and conducting your own conclusions (certainly OR, of course, but OR is more than that) others seem to deem it to mean that no primary sources of any kind should be used to attribute data. On one hand NOR is important as a hedge against the inclusion of falsehoods or POV research, on the other hand I think it's silly not to be able to make simple conclusions. I'd like to see an exemption for A) simple logic. A = B B = C therefore A = C sorts of things. Like the famous example of socrates (I forget where I saw it used, some policy or policy talk): Socrates was a man, all men are mortal, therefore socrates was mortal. Jones was convicted of murder, murder is a crime, therefore Jones is a criminal. if A is cited and B is cited or obvious (IE 'murder is a crime') it should not be forbidden to draw that obvious and simple conclusion. likewise, by the way I understand OR, to look at data and draw a summary is OR; meaning without an exception all non-copyvio plot summaries are OR. In addition, I don't think it ought to be forbidden to make simple calculations, as the policy says, but drawing obvious conclusions should also be allowed: EG, if politician A's popularity rating in his district is 30%, it shouldn't be forbidden to say "Politician A's is not popular in his district." <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 10:41, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to make several points in relation to NOR and the entry on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a>, which was discussed above (I am an involved editor, if only for the past week). I will try to keep discussion of the details of the entry to a minimum, while still giving enough information to demonstrate what I consider important policy considerations arising from the dispute. I apologise for the length of this comment, but hope interested parties will see the importance of the conclusions arising from this case study.</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe the policy against NOR is extremely important in relation to biographies of living persons, and I agree that there is a tendency for the policy to be interpreted leniently. But it is more than a question of leniency, and it is more than a matter of "good editors" not understanding the policy correctly. The problem is that <i>a good editor of one entry can at the same time be a bad editor of another entry</i>. What makes the difference?: the editor's perspective on the subject of the entry. Thus it is possible, for example, that an editor may be productive in relation to the entry on "intelligent design," working diligently to keep out original research, while at the same time utterly fail to see when they are themselves violating NOR in an entry on a person they consider a proponent of intelligent design. This problem will of course be particularly acute where the subject of the biographical entry is not very well-known and there are not many editors prepared to invest time and energy defending the entry (thus, even though more people hate George W Bush than hate Chris Langan, there are also more people prepared to defend the Bush entry from original research). It is extremely difficult to defend such entries from original research violations, especially when a group of editors share a similar antipathy for the subject of the entry, and thus can act in concert.</li>
<li>When a failure to understand the applicability of NOR is <i>combined</i> with a failure to understand that neutrality means more than merely a neutral tone, and <i>combined again</i> with a failure to understand the need to edit living-person biographies sensitively, and <i>combined still further</i> with a failure to understand the need for such entries to avoid controversy, a powerful cocktail results. <i>The outcome may be disastrous for the person who is the subject of the entry, and by extension this is disastrous for the Wikipedia project</i>. (All this occurred with the Langan entry, due to a confluence of factors I cannot go into here.)</li>
<li>Thus when User Jimbo Wales deleted the section violating NOR from the Langan entry (in brief, a section about a minor legal dispute between two High-IQ societies), this deletion was attacked as incomprehensible. How, they cried, could reporting what is said in court documents constitute original research or biased editing? Opposed editors could not grasp this possibility, even though they knew that Langan did not show up in court to contest the case, and thus knew that only one side was represented. They could not understand, in other words, how the editing strategy they were using was in fact <i>the very strategy used by tabloid journalists to justify one-sided but “factual” reporting of court cases</i>. In fact, of course, it is possible to factually report what court documents state, and still be engaging in original or biased research. Naturally they also could not envisage the possibility that their desire to include the section constituted bias or malice.</li>
<li>Additionally, they could not understand how factually reporting the contents of court documents <i>necessarily means selectively choosing what to report from primary sources</i>, and thus, in the absence of secondary sources, necessarily constitutes original research. Mr Wales stated very clearly that, lacking secondary sources about the case (since there is no evidence that the case has ever been discussed in any newspaper, magazine, TV news story, etc.), reporting about the case almost necessarily constitutes original research. From this, however, some opposed editors drew the conclusion that one must not ever refer to primary sources for an entry. They therefore claimed to have found a reason to argue against other material in the entry.</li>
<li>Also compounding these problems was the difficulty opposed editors had in <i>connecting the different pieces of policy together</i>. Thus they might see the point about original research, but fail to see the connections between this and policy regarding sensitivity toward living persons, policy regarding the need to avoid controversy in relation to living persons, or policy about what counts as notable and important in an entry on living persons. Thus the argument was put, for example, that if the Langan lawsuit was not notable enough for inclusion in the entry, then Langan himself must not be notable enough to even have an entry. By failing to see the interconnected nature of policy, opposed editors were able to permit themselves long-term serious violations of several policies.</li>
<li><b>At least two conclusions follow: Firstly, policy should be written to make clear that living persons have a <i>legal and moral right</i> not to be the victims of original research in their biographical entries</b>. When editors violate policy in relation to living persons, and especially when they do so by engaging in original research, they violate the rights of the person about whom they are writing. The seriousness of this should be made much clearer than is currently the case. At present, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">WP:BLP</a> states in its rationale that the information in biographies of living persons "can affect the lives" of such persons. The implication of such a rationale is that editors should understand this fact, and therefore use sensitivity and judgment when editing biographical entries for living persons. What the policy <i>does not</i> state is that living persons have a <i>right</i> not to be the victim of violations of BLP and/or NOR. The current formulation does not make clear that when an editor violates these policies, they also violate the rights of actual living persons. This allows editors to think in terms of their obligations to the Wikipedia project, rather than in terms of their obligations to actual living persons. This increases the chances editors will feel justified in resorting to NOR or other policy violations when editing contentious biographies. Hence my view that the current formulation is too weak.</li>
<li><b>Secondly, the way such policies are written should emphasise the interconnections between policies, to encourage editors to understand how it is the <i>constellation</i> of policies which really defines a policy situation</b>. When two or three or four policies are involved in a single issue, this amounts to more than the sum of the parts. This is particularly the case when a violation of NOR is combined with a violation of BLP. <i>If editors do not see the connections between NOR, neutrality, notability, sensitivity, and avoidance of controversy, then they really do not understand each one of these policies singly.</i> I acknowledge that the subtlety of this point is easily lost on editors (especially editors in dispute), but I do believe policy can be written in a way that encourages this understanding. It may be that merging policies is a way to make this clear, but merger alone will not suffice, unless the text of the merged policies also makes these interconnections very evident. It may in fact be the case that merging policy about NOR and about attribution in fact clouds the fact that NOR is more than a matter of attribution. I do not claim to have the final answer to this question, but I strongly believe that those who have invested energy in these important issues should keep firmly in mind the considerations I have pointed toward. <a href="../../../f/n/m/User%7EFNMF_20f8.html" title="User:FNMF">FNMF</a> 03:02, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assume that we are talking about how entire policies get approved, challenged/demoted, merged, etc. and not about how the wording of an individual policy or guideline gets changed? If so, I agree that a clear process is needed, and can see that Jimbo should be involved at some stage. Perhaps this discussion could be a template... A dedicated page for discussion and comment (to be closed after a given duration, at least full week, probably longer) followed by a straw poll (both well anounced on any related talk pages, at the pump, on the mailing list, etc), then an application to Jimbo summarizing the results of the poll... and finally the certification of approval or notice of rejection. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm floored by all this. "Jimbo suggested that for these type of changes, the process should be one that includes a checkpoint in which we seek Jimbo's input." I dunno. I'm as unclear on the structure of Wikipedia as I ever was, but that's no suggestion, that's a statement of intent. I feel like that bit in Star Wars when Solo says "That's no moon." I think I'm going to take time away. There's a lot been happening around here lately that has given me pause for thought. This is an admirable project, and it has been a pleasure to add what little I could, but ... thanks for all the fish.

<li>Although the words "mediator" and "moderator" begin with "m" and end in "or", they have different meanings. May I remind you the history of <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_%28council%29.html" title="Soviet (council)">soviet (council)s</a>, which have the same noble idea to give power to people, but only gave power to those whore "more equal than others". OK, may be the term "moderator" is too strong. What I meant is a role of a clerk in discussions, who keeps track of the suggestions and helps to stay on topic. In case you didn't notice, this <i>de facto</i> is already happening: someone refactors discussions, redirects them into subpages, arranges polls, archives subpages, etc. It is done on a volunteer basis, and may well be a "ritual" of assignment of a "clerk" is simply unnecessary. In case you didn't notice, I ended my suggestin with a question,let me restate it here: was the idea of <i>explicitely assigned clerks</i> discussed and rejected? My idea was to increase the productivity and decrease chaos in discussions. I may be wrong, but again, was this discussed? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 16:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The existing process is fine. Jimbo emphatically does <i>not</i> have the authority to demand consultation and/or approval during the policymaking process. Policy should be determined by a consensus of the community. If there is a consensus for change, then change should be made. Jimbo should, of course, be invited to participate in discussion and notified of any policy changes. But his opinions should carry no more weight than those of any other editor. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 10:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Does not have the authority? If anyone else but Jimbo would have undone the redirects, do you think we will be discussing this issue now? Of course not. The fact is that Jimbo has the respect of the community to afford him such interventions. Not only that, but now is is most definitively asking to be the the sounding board for all major policy changes, and be consulted to ensure that he agrees with the proposed changes. That is not a bad thing, IMO. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 12:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I am part of the community, and I am challenging his authority to make such interventions. He should be consulted in the same way that other active users should be consulted, but I have a serious problem with the idea that he has any authority to unilaterally change Wikipedia policy. Don't get me wrong; I have great respect for Jimbo as an individual, and would treat his views on Wikipedia issues with the attention they deserve. However, to draw an RL parallel, I respect <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<li>Jimbo has the power and prestige to act as God-King. He did so in requiring this discussion, and that probably was wise.

<li>What <i>should be</i> required is adequate notice in particular places. And <b>all</b> required places should be on Wikipedia. Discussion off Wikipedia may be useful to some, but on Wikipedia discussion is primary, so notice off wikipedia should be at most suggested, not required. Consensus should always be measured on Wikipedia, without regard to off Wikipedia discussion. Jimbo's participation should explicitly not be required; if he wants to participate he can watch the same forums that any other editor watches.

<li>I said that Jimbo "rules here", not that "owns WP". Yes, he rules: this policy change will finnally need Jimbo's approval, ArbCom elections are just to help Jimbo to know who to appoint, any admin or arbitration decision can be reverted by Jimbo... Yes, he has more power over WP's structure than a regular sysop. Those are the sad facts... --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 11:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Jimbo himself has said that he doesn't want that kind of power (although I can't find the source for that right now, I definitely remember reading it somewhere...). He wants the community to make the decisions. So why would we run policy changes past him? He can contribute that same as any other community member can, and because of who he is, we will sit up and pay attention when he does (although we won't necessarily agree with him -- a consensus may exist that he isn't part of). So why is a special process required? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:56, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not actually the source I was looking for, but Jimbo makes the point again in <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-March/065985.html" class="external text" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-March/065985.html" rel="nofollow">this mailing post</a>: he's happy just being a (trusted) member of the community. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I suggest clear guidelines for changing policy, setting out such things as how long to wait to see whether there are objections, with longer times for bigger decisions. I would like to see a tightening up of the definition of consensus: clear guidelines for assessing whether a given situation is "consensus" or not. Currently <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> says that sometimes people on both sides of a dispute each claim consensus.</li>
<li>I would suggest that "consensus" when disagreement is present require a list of how many supporters of the proposal there are, and how many disagreeing, and how each disagreement is handled: proposal modified in response; person changed their mind; person agreed to stand down to allow consensus; person seems to have lost interest and gone away (guidelines for how to determine this); sockpuppets or single-purpose accounts, etc. There may be other outcomes of disagreements that can be present and still declare consensus, but they should be carefully described in a guideline. A key is that there has to be enough discussion. A guideline could require that proponents of a proposal demonstrate understanding of an objection or clearly try very hard to understand, and state clear reasons in response and be willing to discuss further and explain the reasons further.</li>
<li>Guidelines defining consensus could apply to all decisions, and additional guidelines could apply to significant changes of policy or of policy pages, such as requiring merge tags for a certain length of time before merging policy pages, requiring notices in certain places etc. Guidelines could also describe what types of changes are significant changes requiring such notices -- with something open-ended such as "or any change of similar importance" to cover situations not yet imagined. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:50, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that proposal is quite misguided. WP:CONSENSUS is clear about how to test consensus: if an edit sticks, there is consensus for it. The idea that all participants would agree in writing to the same thing, rather than just abiding by it silently, contradicts everything I know about the nature of obstinate people. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 23:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(&lt;&lt;&lt;outdent) My reading of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> is that if an edit is put in once and sticks, then there is consensus for it. It doesn't say there's consensus for a version that's reverted to over and over again. That would be winning an edit war, not consensus. <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> stresses the importance of discussion: "While the most important part of consensus-building is to thoroughly discuss and consider all issues,..." --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am relaxed. I'm not trying to come off as any more intense that usual. If anything, I've been pretty chill all day long. My observation above is pretty simple, and doesn't make any new arguments, just reminds that some concerns have been raised and what they are. Not everyone thinks the discussion should be happening here instead of at the main talk page, and given that disputes are being shuffled off into the archives before being resolved, these concerns may have some merits. What's intense about that? I don't think the honest concerns raised should be dismissed as allegedly counter-communicative. They aren't.

<dd>I would argue that it is a bit too late to beat the drum of "not here". The discussion has been advertised widely and it is happening here, while the talk page of ATT is used to address editors' questions as usual. 30 odd comments in a short period of time in this page, and the use of "blatant", is what made me make that comment.

<dd>Agreed that the horse is already out of the barn, but I don't think that that erases the concerns; rather they simply shift, e.g. to something like "let's not forget that these issues have in some cases already been discussed at great length on WP:ATT's talk page, and that those conversations haven't simply gone away or become moot because this new page exists, not even after they've been archived for some reason."

<dd>The page is an excellent idea, in my opinion. It will take time to become known and for people who don't usually edit policy pages to join in. We need to be able to evaluate this discussion as the step before the poll, and that will be easier to do when the merger alone is being discussed rather than other things to do with the policy pages. Otherwise Jimbo would have to pick through threads to find out which bits were a specific attampt at consulting with the community on the merger. SMcCandlish is welcome to disagree with that, but I am surprised that he wishes to repeat the same opinion so often. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the question that keeps nagging at me. Not the discussion, but Wikipedia:Attribution. This is not a fundamental change, this doesn't affect policy, so what's the point in a) fixing something that isn't broke, and b) creating enough confusion that people <i>think</i> something new is happening? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The need for merging V and NOR was assessed necessary by those that worked in the proposal. This, in addition to attempting to fix RS, that five months ago, was most definitively broken to a point in which its value as a guideline and consensus about it was strongly challenged. WP:ATT simplifies the understanding of our policies to those thousands of contributors that join the project every month, and assist more experienced editors in content disputes by being able to point people to a well-written, and concise page that explains the principles upon which this encyclopedia is being developed. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 15:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>A valid question that should not be discounted. Perhaps there are other editors—like myself—who didn't get highly involved in the ATT writing because we didn't realize Wiki's most fundamental policies would be replaced/merged/changed/whatever without a much broader discussion and consensus. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 21:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do we get more of the above to join in the discussion? One of the things Jimbo said somewhere was that many fine and talented editors weren't consulted or did not know about the merger. I wonder if those of us who enjoy thinking and talking about policy (I do because it constantly refreshes and develops my editing ability) might consider contacting the various excellent editors we each know from article pages and asking them to come and check out this discussion. As things stand, this discussion might end up largely involving the usual interested parties and therefore not be seen as capable of achieving the broader consensus that Jimbo wants. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 16:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I love this idea. Especially since it would make such an excellent fundraiser for the Wikimedia Foundation. Even if we only fined each person who didn't edit a policy page 10 cents, that would still equal out to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the end. Even more if we counted IP editors. And if we counted sockpuppets as individual people we could get revenge on guys like Cplot simultaneously because they would suddenly owe us forty or eighty bucks. Maybe we could even make it an annual thing, where everyone who hadn't made a projectspace edit in the last 12 months was fined. Or maybe you meant to say finD them, not finE them? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 17:24, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Has anyone else noticed that there's a big section of actively editing Wikipedia Users who don't know what a "Bibliography" is? They've worked out a definition for themselves though. Kind of reminds me of the gamers who think a "role-playing" server is a special server set up for D&amp;D experts.<br /></dd>
<dd>Anyways, there's a bunch of articles out there with no attribution at all.

Eventualism says sooner or later someone (else) will get around to remembering how to do it right, but I think nower is better than later don't you? Seeing as we're all of us all excited about the mainstream media using Wikipedia as a resource? The imperialist oppressors did teach us how, back in junior high school and then again in freshman english. The alternative is to follow through on the threat at the bottom of every editing box.

<dd>I certainly knew nothing about the change, but frankly that doesn't bother me because, as has been stated many times, the change was not an alteration of policy, just a collation. So both the merge and the revert were correct in my mind, (the merge because the policies all relate to the same thing and the revert because it wasn't very well publicised) and hopefully they'll be re-merged again now that we all know about it. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 14:58, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes totally agree! As I said above on the first poll, I think the merger has brought attention to the long-standing wording in WP:V, which in fact says verifiability has nothing to do with truth and has everything to do with checking whether the attribution is correct. Having said that, there is an ongoing debate about the role of truth, and it is related to the discussion because people do confuse the two matters. I didn't want to make the introduction to biased, but I am making it clear here: the rule of truth has not diminished. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 18:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I strongly object to putting the role of truth section on the main talk page. Since this, not the regular talk page, is the page people have to follow to participate, putting it there has the effect of burying it.</p>
<p>I also don't think the question has been given a fair shake, either there or here. There *have* been examples where information that is attributable is (by any non-Wikipedia definition) provably false. The majority of the argument seemed to either assume that those examples don't happen, or assume that they happen very differently from how they really did. It's absurd to say "well, you can quote the debate, if it's disputed" or "well, surely the false information has got to be a minority opinion", when it wasn't disputed and wasn't a minority opinion and still false. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 19:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has nothing to do with this current debate... The policy statements dealing with "roll of truth" as you call it have been long standing ones on Wikipedia. This discussion page is about whether V, RS and NOR should be merged into ATT... and if so, how... not about what those policy pages say. <i>The merge does not change policy at all</i>. It simply moves them to a new location. Once we know which policy will be in effect... <i>then</i> we can argue about changing what they say about the roll of truth. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, Blueboar. The proposed merge page, WP:ATT, contains different wording with different meaning than the original pages it's supposed to be merging. This discussion focusses on that change in meaning that happens when going from "verifiability, not truth" to "attributable ... not whether it is true". This is a discussion that relates directly to the wording of the proposed merge page; my part of it at least is not about any issues that existed before the new wording was proposed. Perhaps someone could post clear instructions at the top of each talk page about which kind of discussion is supposed to go on which talk page?</dd>

<dd>It's an acute point. The period leading up to the decision to propose a new page (nothing to with me, I might say) was in my opinion one of dark days for the NOR and RS pages in particular. The pages were palpably badly written and RS had accumulated verbal and semantic débris to the point where it was actually contradicting and obfuscating NOR and V in places: yet it was no longer easy to improve these pages because custodial editors were assuming that each individual page was more or less untouchable. The result, in the opinion of some people trying to edit the pages at the time, was a horrible mess: here we had three pages that had become soggier and soggier, and even to attempt improving the wording of one of them required balancing the wording in the other two, leading to inconsistent discussions and (frustratingly) inconsistent and contradictory reversions on three different pages at once. Matters had sunk to the level where actual grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes were being restored to the pages (I could give plenty of diffs for that happening).</dd>

<dd>Although it wasn't my idea to propose a combined, shorter page to solve these problems (I don't have ideas like that, unfortunately), I immediately saw the advantage; and now I find it very helpful in article disputes to be able to refer to the Attribution page rather than taking a pick'n'mix of three different pages: the wording really does work, and I advise anyone who hasn't done so to try referring to the Attribution page during disputes. The page's superior usefulness as a policy tool in practice is for me the clincher in the present discussion—the proof of the pudding.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Should it be voted to keep all the pages as they were, I agree with you that it might be necessary to propose that some of the Attribution wording replace some of old wording in V, OR, and RS. No doubt that would be a laborious and piecemeal enterprise (but I would be depressed if a consensus defeat of the merger were to be interpreted as a dismissal of all wording on the Attribution page in favour of the older wordings}. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As Jimbo himself is directly involved and no one has given a good reason <i>not</i> to have the notice on the Watchlist page, perhaps leave it up for five or ten days, then take it down--that will give everyone absolute notification of this (per Jimmy Wales) very important discussion is happening... then, when it actually goes to a Wales-mandated Poll, the notice will go up again, to let all users know about it, so that all editors can weigh in. Everyone needs to be absolutely aware of this, and this... is the only reasonable way to do it. aside from people complaining that its annoying, I don't see a valid reason to not do this. why would we not want every eligible editor to see this? what can be gained for any sense of keeping this quiet? It should be known to everyone it affects (which is everyone!). If anyone can give a reason why every editor shouldn't have a chance to weigh in... then that is a reason to not do it. otherwise, it should stay up. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 02:18, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dunno, I would suggest leaving it up until the discussion is done, replacing it with a different notice each time a certain milestone is reached in the process. The current form includes a link that will dismiss the warning, so users who don't want to see it can get rid of it. Meanwhile, if we had someone who came back from a vacation <i>just</i> after the discussion was taken down per your suggestion they'd miss out on the notice. Frankly, for something as important and impactful as this I see no reason why we cannot just leave the notice up until the matter is resolved, especially considering how long the fundraising notice stayed up. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 05:26, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Also posted at the main talk page... I notice that there is a lot of confusion and disagreement about how RS fits into all of this... some people think that RS has been merged into ATT, some people think it hasn't. Some think that ATT elevates RS to Policy, others ardently deny this. I thought I would comment -</p>
<p>The problem is that RS has always been a unique case... falling into a grey zone between policy and guideline status. Both WP:V and WP:NOR discuss the need for reliable sources to back our edits... so, to some degree, the <i>concept</i> of RS has always been a Policy statement. Saddly, neither WP:V and WP:NOR explained what was <i>meant</i> by the term "reliable sources", or how to determine if a source was reliable or not - so a guideline page, "WP:RS", was created take care of this. Unfortunately, the creation of that guideline page put RS into a half in / half out status... on one hand editors could say "RS is Policy" since it is prominently mentioned in several Policy page... but on the other hand, editors could say "no-RS is only a Guideline. See, it says 'Guideline' at the top of the page". Those who wanted to inforce the <i>concept</i> as expressed on the Policy pages, edited the Guideline to emphisize its "these are the rules" nature, those who disagreed with this enforcement edited the guideline to stress it's "this is just guidance" nature. And so we ended up with a Guideline page that stated both "guidance" and "rules" ... Neither betwixt or between.</p>
<p>Now let's look at what happened with the creation of ATT ... some people have complained that ATT "elevated" WP:RS to Policy... others have complained that it "demoted" WP:RS to little more than an essay. But in reality it did neither. The conceptual, "these are the rules" side of RS was <i>re-incorporated</i> into the Policy discussion and made clearer, while the "this is guidance" side of WP:RS was shifted into the FAQ page, to be worked on and eventually made back into a guideline (I would recommend renaming it to something like "Determining reliability". This was not an "elevation" of WP:RS to Policy status... nor was it a demotion of WP:RS to something less than Guideline status ... it was a needed breaking up of something that had alway been a little bit of both.</p>

<dd>I would say that moving it into a policy and a FAQ made it harder to change, which is bad because the details are highly contentious. It is easier to work towards a consensus when it is in a separate guideline, not too strongly tied to a policy.</dd>
<dd>Also, the merge into Attribution neglects that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is at least as related to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as it is to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, if not more so. I am not neutral on this: those who see reliability as binary, the source is reliable or it isn't, would probably see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as being more related to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.</dd>
<dd>I, on the other hand, see reliability as a matter of degrees, which leads me to see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as more related to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Reliability can help distinguish between facts and opinions. (If a source is quite reliable and not contradicted by any sources of comparable or greater reliability, the statement can be reasonably stated as a fact.) Reliability is also a good way of gauging <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">proper weight and under weight</a>. Although still susceptible to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_countering_systemic_bias_ba79.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>, reliability is most likely our best way of determining the proper weight an opinion should receive. Reliability, as a way of measuring due weight, must necessarily be a matter of degrees, not binary on/off. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> currently discusses reliability as a matter of degrees, where you should look for the most reliable/reputable sources. If well-rewritten, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> could provide very good guidance on determining due weight.</dd>

<dd>It seems clear to me that the way that the RS material is included in ATT promotes RS to the status of a policy. I don't necessarily have a problem with this happening eventually - in fact, I think inclusion of some portion of RS as policy is a necessary change - but I think it goes far beyond the scope of the merger of NOR and V that was originally proposed, and I think it deceives the greater Wikipedian community to couch ATT as being merely the merger of NOR and V <i>because</i> of the inclusion of RS material in ATT. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 01:02, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I love Blueboar's explanation - now I understand what happened with RS. I would go one step further and not just rename WP:RS to "Determining reliability", but also WP:ATT to WP:RS. I think "reliable source" is the most intuitive term; this would certainly be the one we'd choose if we were creating the policy from scratch, and I think we can cope with legacy problems.</dd>
<dd>I don't see Armed Blowfish's distinction between gradual and binary policies as such a fundamental difference. Of course a binary policy is always easier to implement, but that's not a problem of the policy, but of the reality which the policy addresses. I think merging a gradual and a binary policy poses no fundamental problem in itself.</dd>
<dd>I agree with Dachannien's complaint about a communication problem; that's something that went wrong, but now that it has been posted for all to see we can focus on discussing what policy would be best. It would be foolish if we were held back by mistakes of the past. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 19:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Argumedblowfish's suggestion is very enlightened. Assessing source reliability is much more related to NPOV than ATT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribution is primarily concerned with making sure that statements on wikipedia fairly and accurately reflect that which is stated in the cited sources. The main difficulty with proper and fair scholarly attribution is to avoid misusing a source to argue a case that the original sources are not making, and this is covered by <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">WP:SYNT</a>.</li>
<li>NPOV is where we make judgements as to what sources merit inclusion and how much weight is given to each source. Judging how much weight to give each source is a more difficult matter and indeed much related to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit with this distinction is that it doesn't confuse arguments against reliability of a source with original research. For example, there is a serious problem when a reliable source copies uncited material from wikipedia (as happened with <a href="../../../s/a/c/Talk%7ESacha_Baron_Cohen_5472.html#include_Persian_descent" title="Talk:Sacha Baron Cohen">the Persian Cohen</a>) and then that very source is used to back up the false statement. <i>Finding evidence that this has happened is not original research.</i> Far from discouraging such assessment of sources, we should encourage it. The way I see it, the two-policy model makes much sense. In short, they answer the following two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What sources should be used and what weight is given to each source? (WP:NPOV)</li>
<li>Are the sources represented accurately and fairly without our own interpretations added? (WP:ATT)</li>
</ol>

<dd>I don't know what is the best way of getting this started. I can tell you that the logic of what you are saying is excellent, but input from editors with years of experience would be very helpful as what is good organization of policy can't be assessed by its logic alone. I would be very interested in hearing what people think about Armedflowfish's original idea. (My presentation takes the idea a bit too far by almost implying that Reliable Sources should not be covered in WP:ATT, which is a perhaps too extreme, so please comment on the original idea). --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that the issue of source reliability doesn't sit well with the enforcable nature of policy, so it would be useful to represent it in a manner which is more flexible, and useful to editors.</dd>
<dd>Different sources have different utility subject to the context in which they're being used, and we can move between merely citing a source in support of a statement, through qualifying the statement and citing the source through to a prose description of the source and identification of how it's being used.</dd>
<dd>I'm generally opposed to the concept that some sources get a free pass based on what they are, rather than how editors are intending on using them in an article. Broadcast media, internet media and print media all have sources which at left of arc are completely unreliable for most purposes through to a right of arc where they are generally reliable for most purposes, but each suffer from vulnerabilities based on their generation process, editorial style etc.</dd>
<dd>Personally I believe there is more value in providing editors with a set of tools to allow them to evaluate sources and represent them appropriately in text. I am very concious that is a minority opinion, with most of the active participants in this policy area being more comfortable with doctrinal statements, so I'm not convinced that there is likely to be much support for empowering editors in that way. I think there is an issue there, we know that RS was widely ignored in the past and it was mainly used as a tool in disputes rather than as a tool to enhance article quality.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I fully understand the position that Armedblowfish is taking, in that the current doctrinal approach tends to favour a developed western academia based view of the knowledge contained in WP. That is apropriate for some topics, but it lacks the pragmatism needed for other topics and the globalised view required for yet more.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think coming up with an alternative formulation is a useful exercise.</dd>

<div style="text-align:right; font-size:80%">Your <b><a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" class="extiw" title="wikimedia:Fundraising">continued donations</a></b> keep Wikipedia running!&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>

<p><br />
I think that the reason that this is a banner on your watchlist is the large number of users who were surprised by this. I participated in the discussions in the early phase (but have been busy off-Wiki for the past several months), and many prominent Wikipedians were there. But many prominent Wikipedians are now objecting, who weren't there--and I believe them that they were unaware of this. This despite the fact that this proposal was discussed, at various times, in the Signpost, at the village pump, on the mailing lists, on the talk pages of the other policies, etc. Perhaps an error was made in not putting {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}} in places.</p>
<p>Notice was also placed on <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User talk:Jimbo Wales</a>, I'm certain. (I fully realize the sheer amount of stuff that goes there, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if Jimbo never read it).</p>
<p>As Jimbo points out, Wikipedia is a huge place. We can't have a centralized place for All Discussions Of Interest To The Community which everyone who wants to participate in policymaking ought to read--it would be unweildy. So stuff is often hashed out in a dedicated space--and when the results of such discussions are promulgated--others show up ask "why wasn't I informed"--and in some cases suggest that underhanded backroom deals are going on.</p>
<p>Maybe we should forget about <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and go fix <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">WP:POLICY</a> instead. &#160;:)</p>
<p>How to handle this so most people who care are both informed and happy (a necessary conditition for consensus), I don't know. I know I've been on the other side of the coin--and seen edits I've done reverted due to a recently-created policy I've never heard of before. Real-world communities with participatory political systems (I won't utter the "D" word) that are far smaller than us tend to form legislatures in order to deal with this sort of stuff; I'm not sure the Wikipedia community wants to necessarily go there.</p>

<p>Errm. This may seem a bit off topic, but I think it lies at the heart of some positions in this debate...</p>
<p>I've been involved in several arguments about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Some influential editors decry the "fetish-like attachment" to citing many facts. They say that cites do not prevent bogus info from being introduced, etc. They often say "Why should Wikipedia articles look like freshman research papers?" End of story: They want references at the bottom of the page, and as few cites as is reasonably possible in the article text.</p>
<p>I on the other hand think that cites make it physically possible for me to <i><b>actually verify</b></i> any one of the many assertions that have been made in the text; I can't do so without knowing which assertions come from which source, and from which page in that source.</p>
<p>Errm, isn't there any way to make an option at the top of a page to toggle on/off any and all citation templates? That means all cites would have to be done via template rather than via simple text, but that may be a smallish price to pay for an everyone-gets-what-they-want solution...</p>
<p>Surely there must be technical probs, or this would have been done, I think...</p>

<dd>2. Is there already policy on this issue?</dd>
<dd>3. If the answers to the above are 1. yes and 2. no, I note that this bothers me, too. The FIRST LINE of today's featured article is "Ian Thorpe is a former Australian freestyle swimmer who is regarded as one of the greatest freestyle swimmers of all time." It then goes on to provide sourced evidence that would, IF we allowed statements such as "regarded as the best...of all time", allow Thorpe to be the poster child for such statements. So he'd make a good test case -- is there a better way to say this? A NPOV way to say it?

"According to Source A, X was the world's greatest Y." Or, if a poll, "According to Poll A, 82% of B people polled consider X to have been the world's greatest Y." If you can, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Let_the_facts_speak_for_themselves" title="WP:NPOV">discuss some facts</a> that might cause people to believe that X was the world's greatest Y.</dd>
<dd>Of course, if Source A is Mister Joe Bob's Myspace blog, no one cares. You would be giving Mister Joe Bob's opinion <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>.</dd>
<dd>I hope that helps. Personally, I think <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> should strive to further explain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>, but that might be a radical idea.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps the fact that relative newbies wouldn't know where to go to address this issue -- AND the fact that I have now been directed to three totally different places to answer it -- says what it needs to about both the importance of the current community discussion...and the need for whatever we decide to include, as a judging criteria, serious consideration of whatever ultimate solution would be as accessible and clear as possible.</dd>
<dd>For example, I find that ChaChaFut's/Blowfish's suggestion above makes a first sentence in an article goes against that same instinct towards clarity, as it makes that sentence both unnecessarily bulky and, in the case of true field-toppers as Thorpe, too citation-heavy to be effective (which of the hundreds of sources for that statement would you pick?

<dd>(edit conflict) I posted this here because I wouldn't know where else to go with this, hoping for some input. It's also a question of NPOV, of course, but in this case, attribution seems to be the catch. I believe that "one of the greatest" and "<i>the</i> greatest" are subtly distinct cases. And die-hard fans are often hard to convince, in my experience. They tend to insist precisely on this statement of "widely considered the best/greatest", and whenever they come up with any kind of RS, they simply reference the assertion and treat it like the truth. Incidentally, I happen to believe that users should be educated as to this distinction between <i>viewpoint</i> and quoting. Is this difference between the two mentioned in any policy? Or do you have any suggestion where to go with this concern? —<a href="../../../k/n/c/User%7EKncyu38_cddd.html" title="User:Kncyu38">KNcyu38</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/c/User_talk%7EKncyu38_40a0.html" title="User talk:Kncyu38">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kncyu38_7ccf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kncyu38">contribs</a>) 02:37, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo requested "a poll to assess the feelings of the community as best we can, and then we can have a final certification of the results". Thats asking for a poll to gauge concensus, which is what is underway shortly... are you saying it would be best to run the poll through a few times to bulletproof the concensus? The problem from my understanding of how it went down--note, I <i>support</i> the ATT policy--is that not "everyone" got a chance to be informed/contribute, and he wanted that. Is it a bad thing for giving a maximum number of editors a firm voice in deciding this now for good? - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 04:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above header gives my opinion.

<p>What if a newcomer is trying to accustom themself to the rules?

<p>it is just a pain to have four articles because you go and read one article then you have to go and read three more articles that cover the same if not similar material. if the articles were merged then one nice straightforward article to read.--88wolfmaster 23:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, when I first came here to Wikipedia I wasted a lot of time just reading through pages of policy that could have all been put into one. It's really annoying that I go to read about a policy or guideline and the page I'm reading has me go to another page, then that other page to another page. Sometimes I end up not finding the answer to the question I had in the first place because I end up going from one page to another.

<p>And why do you assume it is <i>simpler</i> to have all the policies mixed up? Actually it is simpler to have each policy on its own page rather than trying to create a confusing compilation (<i>It slices! It dices! It peels potatoes!)</i>. When you are discussing an OR problem on the talk pages, you want to link, unambiguously, to the WP:NOR policy; when you are discussing lack of proper references, you link to the WP:V policy. This is clearer, and far superior than pointing to a convoluted page that mentions a lot of different policies.

<p>In four pages we can partition how we want to read it, if it is all merged we feel the need to read through the whole page, one big super page is unlikely to solve the problem.

While I see <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a>'s point, I think it's "attributable" that's the bad word. "Verifiable" is a relatively strong word, with the concept of truth at its root. The connotation of "verifiable" is of checking something against a trusted source, and finding it confirmed to be true. "Attribution", on the other hand, is a weak word: all it means is that you saw something somewhere and can point at the source. I can see a whole new generation of editors who see references to something called "<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>" and respond indignantly when their contribution is challenged, "but I <i>attributed</i> it!" (to a blog, to somebody's home page, to a gossip site, to a fan site, to a conspiracy forum). There's nothing innate in "attribution" that implies "attribution to a reliable source"; you have to actually <i>read</i> the policy to know that. I agree that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is very good policy... but with a terrible name.</p>
<p>I support a community consensus endorsing the new policy, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, but I don't think it's too late to come up with a better name, since if we don't, I fear endless explanations based on the misleading single word "attribution". --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 03:56, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Verifiability was no better, as it apparently led to widespread confusion over the role of truth in our articles and its catchphrase "Verifiability not truth" was oxymoronic.

<dd>The reliability of the content can only be as good as the reliability of its sources so I feel you are really nitpicking. If you have a claim that the United States government is responsible for September 11th and you source it to Rosie O' Donnell's blog then the reliability of the statement depends on the reliability of Rosie O' Donnell blog. It is true that reliable content will sometimes be sourced to unreliable source, but unreliable sources ultimatly drain reliability from even reliable content like if you sourced the sky being blue to The National Association for the Advancement of a Blue Sky (I made this organization up but you see my point).--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorfer_9f56.html" title="User:Jorfer">JEF</a> 16:07, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not nit-picking, I agree that the reliability of content can only be <i>as good as</i> the reliability of its sources, but sometimes it can be even worse. Please look at the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Talk%7ESacha_Baron_Cohen_5472.html#Persian_Mother.3F" title="Talk:Sacha Baron Cohen">Talk:Sacha_Baron_Cohen#Persian Mother?</a>, I think we should take this kind of arguments against the reliability of a source very seriously, as more and more people are starting to use Wikipedia as a source. Another example, on the article about <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> we had cited Adherents.com stating that 75% of the world's scientist believe in God. After tracing the sources two-three steps back, it turned out this was actually taken from a poll in the Italian magazine <i>Class</i>, clearly not a reliable source for this statement at all. There are times when we should dispute the reliability of a source by such meta-analysis, but this is different from original research that attempts to prove that a source is wrong by refuting its content. In any case, I might be totally wrong, but I'm not nitpicking, I think this is a serious issue. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 20:29, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your looking at Original Research as being different because of how the original researcher is trying to put in his viewpoint, but you need to look at it from the view that Original Research is based on an unreliable source and that is the Original Researcher. Wikipedia is a reflection of experts viewpoints on material because experts are considered the most reliable source. Wikipedia since it is based on reliable sources and not content is one step behind academia because it needs to wait for verification from reliable sources. Eventually the original research will make it into Wikipedia once it has been backed up by respectable sources. Ultimatly, sources are not what is being refuted; content is. Wikipedia as an encyclopedia is a reflector of knowledge and not a creator of it. It is not a forum to introduce new ideas, so unlike academia, it requires reliable sources because they indicate that an idea is already accepted to a degree that it would be appropriate to include in Wikipedia. To sum it up, Wikipedia is limited to reflecting the current body of knowledge by it being an encyclopedia so it uses reliable sources to gauge the acceptance of knowledge the figurative body. The problem lies with sourcing of original research and not with original research itself as all knowledge that humans have gained were at one point original research.--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorfer_9f56.html" title="User:Jorfer">JEF</a> 01:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even when discussing this problem, it still comes back to reliable sources. You proved that The Guardian was not a reliable source in this case and thus the content needed to be removed. The reliability of sources is something that can be looked into because it is something that can change. If the Guardian article was written before the Wikipedia article then it is more reliable than if it written afterwards. The confusion of what constitutes original research on Wikipedia is a big reason the articles need merging into as one document titled <b>Reliability</b> or <b>Sources</b> as someone suggested. Adding your unexplored reason as to why <a href="../../../2E/9/9/.999....html" title=".999...">.999...</a> does not equal 1 is original research while originaly researching the reliability of a source does not constitute original research as the Wikipedia guideline defines it.--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorfer_9f56.html" title="User:Jorfer">JEF</a> 22:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, now I'm confused why I disagreed with you. I'm just worried that if this policy is called Reliability, then having a section called NOR inside it would confuse this distinction.

<li>I <i>do</i> like the name of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. The trouble with "verifiability" is that, in normal usage outside Wikipedia, it implies "something which can be shown to be true", making the famous Wikipedia dictum "verifiability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion" a near-oxymoron. "Attribution", on the other hand, is a more accurate description of what we do, which consists of ascribing every controversial statement to a reliable external source. Obviously, it would be impossible/impractical to check every statement for its <i>truth</i>. But it's highly possible to check every statement for its <i>origin</i>, if sources are cited. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 18:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But I'd like to get back to Black Falcon's point above. The distinction between demanding reliability and determining what it really means is important. I think this is why Blueboar (<a href="#A_look_at_WP:RS_and_how_it_fits" title="">above</a>) proposed to rename RS to something like "Determining reliability". If we did this, we could rename WP:ATT to something like Wikipedia:Attribution to a reliable published source or even Wikipedia:Rely on published sources. WP:RS then could become a disambiguation page to account for the fact that we have used "RS" in both meanings historically. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 19:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The content policies are about content of articles, not content of talk pages, where individuals sign their posts. There's nothing wrong with checking up on whether a source is unreliable because it was published after the same unsourced statement appeared in Wikipedia. I would call that original research, and I would say that there is nothing wrong with that sort of original research appearing on talk pages. Another kind of original research that can appear on talk pages is research to determine that 75% of the sources say one thing and 25% say another. You can do this as a Wikipedian by counting books in the library or whatever. You can't quote those numbers in the article, but you can state them on the talk page and use them to guide which POV gets more prominence in the article. Saying that something is "not original research" just because it obviously should be allowed on talk pages is stretching the definition unnecessariy. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I generally prefer smaller singular policy pages. The nutshell looks good, but then comes the second principle: 2)Wikipedia articles must be based on reliable sources, and this line: <b>"In general, <i>the most reliable sources are books and journals published by universities</i>, mainstream newspapers, and magazines and journals that are published by known publishing houses.</b> I assume you mean "books and journals published by university press publishers," not "books and journals published by universities," as not all university press publishers are a close part of the university they are affiliated with in name. Even our article on <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_presses.html" title="University presses">University presses</a> gets this right. I would like to have seen such a sweeping policy change have really been dug at by a large portion of the community such that basic details were correct--no, I haven't researched it, but I didn't write the policy. This is not a small detail way down in the article, this is prominent, the second principle tells Wikipedia editors to go to <i>reliable sources</i> and then mistates the reliable sources. University presses are subsumed in the last part of this also, as they are known publishing houses. It is requested on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> that the page not be changed, however I suggest that this sentence be corrected to say "books and journals published by university press publishers," as I think is intended. This should also be changed elsewhere in Wikipedia on reliable sources.

<p>Think! What is the primary use of these separate pages? As quick references in edit disputes, primarily as justification for rejection of material. Compare the likely understanding of a new editor when his material is removed with a pointer to WP:No original research versus WP:Attribution. The only people who could love this monstrosity are those who spend more time arguing about policy than writing articles --can't we find a separate project for them to work on so they don't interfere with the rest of us?

<dd>he has a point! The laudable desire to have a small number of official policy pages collides with the need to have quick and succinct policy pages newbies can be pointed to depending on the case at hand. This can be alleviated by having shortcuts to h2 sections of the big unified policy page, but that isn't really all that different from having the different points on individual pages. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 11:25, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly each side of the idea can make strong arguments for their own sides, but in the end, what matters the most is that the policies work together, nomatter if they are on one or three pages.

<p>I have had no previous involvement to this discussion. Some time ago, when I read that several of the "classic" WP policies had been merged into <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>, I immediately thought it was a great idea. Now I hear that the merger has been called into question. Discussion is always good, but I for one think it will be best for WP if the merger is upheld.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear</li>
<li>Strong</li>
<li>Intuitive for new contributors (i.e. a good guide) and passive onlookers (i.e. a good PR tool)</li>
<li>Will further NPOV by promoting valid individual POV's that can be backed up with stable and reliable sources, and even pertinent quotes.</li>
<li>Will ultimately lead to the documentation through footnotes of nearly every claim made in WP articles.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a> is the best way to summarize and clearly state the closely related policies that will ultimately make WP into not only the largest organized body of knowledge ever assembled, but a highly reliable one as well. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a> does this far better than "no original research" or "verifiability" and the like.</p>
<p>I suppose nothing I've said here is extremely original since the discussion has apparently been going on for quite a long time, but I wanted to make sure there would be a voice for those of us who see this whole thing as both positive and sensible. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 12:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Will ultimately lead to the documentation through footnotes of nearly every claim made in WP articles." This is the first time Ihave heard this argument.

<ol>
<li><b>Clarify what is this page for</b>: URGENT. At the beginning, this page was to discuss <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>-related changes and now we're discussing the way policies should be made and whether Jimbo likes voting or not. Please, we should define the topic and stop any unrelated discussion. If not, the whole talk page and discussion will have been useless.</li>
<li><b>Define methods</b>: After defined what is the topic, define the way it will be discussed and how discussion-derivate changes will be applied (vote, poll, or even <i>de facto</i>... something!).</li>

<dd>I also think it was nice to have this notification posted in the watchlists. Very good idea and effective! I must admit that I wouldn't have taken notice of the discussion otherwise (although I know I should!). Now to the point: without being able to follow all the arguments and counter-arguments, my first impression is that <b>merge</b> is the correct solution. In law, all the jurists know that too many laws spread around are a bad think. No lawyer can find them, and ignorance or semi-ignorance is the final outcome of this chaotic situation! I see the merge here as some kind of "codification" that brings together poilicies spread in 3 pages. If this codification is done correctly, it results in coherency and better access to the policies.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 17:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we have both WP:ATT, and separate small pages with the policy broken into parts for newbies? I think that if I posted something and got directed to WP:ATT in response to my post (now reverted), I would have left. However, I did get pointed a number of times when I first started editing to various little policies, that I could read briefly and comprehend and apply and see where I went wrong and how to correct it for future edits.</p>

<dd>I think it's important that if we have separate pages (WP:ATT; or WP:V, WR:NOR, etc.) we make it quite clear that in case of conflict, one group of pages will be the authoritative one. For this it might help to have a "derivative policy" header, to say that WP:ATT is a summary of the authoritative policies at WP:V and WP:NOR or that WP:V and WP:NOR are elaborations of the authoritative policy at WP:ATT.</dd>
<dd>I really don't care much which way it should go, but given the dynamic nature even of policy pages, we need something like that to deal with the inevitable contradictions that will emerge if both sets of pages are kept active in some form. To say that one set is a former policy and is retained for historical reasons leaves the implication (especially with the big red X) that what is on those pages is no longer valid. That doesn't seem very hepful at all.</dd>

<p>If one of the middle options is chosen, one concern is the people might be ignored if they make suggestions for changing policy on the talk pages of the subordinate pages. In order to help prevent this from happening, I'd like to make the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> becomes the definitive policy, I think <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_44f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability">Wikipedia talk:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia talk:No original research</a> (and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WT%7ERS_bc01.html" title="WT:RS">WT:RS</a>, if that stays merged as well) should be substed into <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution</a>. This will also help split-up the conversation, as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> is very hi-traffic. Anything discussed on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> would most likely be of interest to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> contributors anyways.</li>
<li>If <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> stay the definitive policies, suggestions for policy change made on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> should be copied over to the relevant policy talk pages, with appropriate messages explaining that the discussions were moved.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes, of course, that one of the two middle options on question 3 (see links above) is chosen.</p>

<p>The policies to be merged may be similar (that's why they're in the same category,) but they are <i>DEFINITELY</i> different, and they ought to remain separate policies. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 22:47, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How are they different? Fair scholarly attribution implies that you cite your source, describe what was in the source fairly and you don't use the source to draw your own conclusions or argue a case that can't be traced back to the cited sources. If everything must be attributable, then that immediately leaves no room for original research. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 23:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure that's true - take poetry, one could cite lines of poetry in support of a contentious interpretation, it would be "verified" but still original research.

<dd>Bear in mind that even if they are different, the different facets can still be highlighted in that same single location; see for example the vast collection at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which are based around the same starting few words but address a whole range of different policies from what WP is used for/as, censorship, and politics of editing. That's a whole bunch of different policies... but they're easy to find and keep track of if required, because they're all in one place. Handy. Different, yes.

</dd>
<dd>Agree with Firien, but I will still continue the argument, because the poetry example clearly violates ATT. You have essentially two choices and both violate ATT:
<ol>
<li>You are falsely attributing your interpretation to the source, which is in violation of ATT, because the material must be "directly and explicitly supported by the cited sources", or</li>
<li>you are distancing the interpretation from the actual poem, in which case your interpretation simply lacks attribution, and hence is a violation of ATT.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>But take the case, where you cite Darwin <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacy_of_quoting_out_of_context.html#Absurd_in_the_highest_degree" title="Fallacy of quoting out of context">out of context</a>, then you are again falsely attributing it Darwin, but the quotation is verifiable and it isn't original research; it's just dishonest and bad attribution. Currently NPOV has to deal with this issue, but it really should be part of our culture of honest scholarly use of sources, and I see ATTRIBUTION as taking us in the right direction. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 01:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with this and most mergers. I think Wikipedia policy is too complex, too lengthy and has too many holes in it. I often find myself encountering contradictions in the policy.

<dd>This may beg the question of whether most other people would miss it too. I hadn't even thought of that until now. Cf. my idea somewhere else that if the "make ATT the main page and have the others be explanatory side pages" compromise goes through, that the other pages should turn into FAQs about those aspects of ATT. That would probably fix this "huh? what FAQ?" problem, since the shortcuts are all over the place and would continue to be used when people didn't want to refer to the precise policy language at ATT.

<p>Not sure if this was brought up here, but I'm reminding of and somewhat expanding on the issues I <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Whatever_the_heck_this_mess_turns_out_to_be.2C_please_keep_this_stuff..." title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">brought up here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, the old policies had this small problem: People interpret "The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material" as "la la la, I can't hear you, I don't believe you". The policy is obviously meant to be "you, as an expert, should provide a published source for anything you add, or any of the facts you agree to be correct"; however, it's misinterpreted as "It's the adding editor's job <i>and no one else's job at all</i> to add the sources, and everyone else's job is to remove things that aren't sourced", which is obviously incorrect and harmful - but it <i>does</i> happen.</p>
<p>WP:ATT does clarify this a little bit: the FAQ says that the best practice is to add sources first, then remove it, and the WP:ATT itself admits not everything <i>in practice</i> is sourced. I'd definitely like to see some of this clarified further in the resulting policies - to reduce the amount of articles that get dragged to AfD just for the lack of sources, and to make it clearer that adding sources is <i>everyone's</i> job.</p>
<p>This is an interesting issue that intersects both the verifiability requirements and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>, and regrettably if we slip too much to either side the results are equally nasty; we can't be <i>lax</i> about this and obviously need to take sourcing <i>seriously,</i> but that doesn't mean we have to be utterly <i>paranoid</i> and <i>uncooperative</i> about things either. We need good wording for the burden of proof and applicability and adding of the sources that encourages proactivity rather than destruction and disbelief. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first question is simple enough: do you support the proposed merger or not. Yet some hotshot included the <i>helpful</i> hint, smack at the beginning: <i>You do not have to support the merger in its entirety to vote "yes"</i>. Why this particular wording? It would have been just as valid to say: <i>You do not have to oppose the merger in its entirety to vote "no"</i>. As it stands, the hint encourages middle-of-the-roaders to vote YES, even it they mostly oppose the merger; thus biasing the poll. I suggest removal of the biased hint. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 12:31, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Policy is all very well and good, but WP:A also needs to outline how the policy needs to be implemented.</p>

<li>What to do when another editor removes such tags without fulfilling the need for proper attribution.</li>

<dd>This policy, like WP:V and WP:OR, is enforced by discussion on the talk page and removal of unattributed content when appropriate. I think there is a deeper issue in your question, though: the idea that this is some sort of quasi-legal policy with objective requirements. It is not; attribution must be interpreted on a case-by-case basis by editors keeping the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">goal</a> in mind. Exactly what constitutes appropriate attribution will vary greatly from one article to another and from one sentence to another. Citation tags can be helpful in starting a discussion, but a "tag and forget" mentality only leads to a backlog like the one at {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 13:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I wasn't clear. My issue is not with the need for attribution, but with the need for <u><i>proper</i></u> attribution.

<dd>WP's definition of a reliable source <i>is</i> (reasonably) objective. Its one of the best I've seen.</dd>
<dd>My question is hence with respect to the "Enforceability?" of the WP:RS/WP:NOR/WP:V bits in WP:A. For example, is it permissable for an editor to remove {{unverifyable}}/{{<a href="../../../o/r/_/Template%7EOr_f8cf.html" title="Template:Or">or</a>}} tags without resolving the issue? And I'm not speaking of month- or year-old "tag and forget" tags, but within hours.</dd>

<ul>
<li>WP is also in dire need of a policy to inhibit insidious linkspamming through the use of refs. Policy already prevents linkspam in the "External links" section, but this doesn't adequately cover spamming through citation.<br />
--<br />
Take for example, the hundreds of articles with references to "cais-soas.com": This site has no academic legitimacy whatsoever, and although it has no affiliation with <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOAS_2fab.html" title="SOAS">soas</a>, purports to do so anyway, so leaving the casual observer with the impression that the site is a legitimate academic resource. Further, it "copies" articles and images without attribution or permission from reputable sources, so giving its own theories/platorm (which then appear amongst the legitimate ones) credibility. While cais-soas.com is a particularly bad example (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=cais-soas.com&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=cais-soas.com&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">200+ articles in the main namespace</a>, and again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns6=1&amp;search=cais-soas.com&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns6=1&amp;search=cais-soas.com&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">about as many in images</a>), I'm certain that the owner of that site (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Changing_username/Archive20#Surena_.E2.86.92_ParthianShot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Changing_username/Archive20#Surena_.E2.86.92_ParthianShot" rel="nofollow">present username</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Surena" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Surena" rel="nofollow">confirmed socks</a>) is not the only one doing this.<br />

Be that as it may, IMO, a spamdexing ref <i>should</i> automatically disqualify as an valid source, particularly in cases of "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>" (which is however a guide and not a policy). The question is, can such a policy (within the framework of WP:A) be made? And how could such a policy be phrased?</li>

<p>I understand that Attribution is a pretty close approximation of the exiting policies of V, NOR and RS. I understand that only needing to explain one policy to new editors instead of three would make life simpler. I am sympathetic to these ideas.</p>
<p>However, I am worried the merger would lead to rationalizations of "Well, I attributed my statement, so I am in compliance with your core policies. Leave me alone." All sorts of things can be wrong with the attributed statement, including a source link to the poster's original research. Taking time to explain a level of policy nuance, required by covering three distinct policies, is well worth our trouble.

<p>Here is what we are the voting choices:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1.The original pages become inactive. Wikipedia:Attribution serves as a unified policy on their subjects.</dd>
<dd>2.Wikipedia:Attribution remains as the canonical policy, but the original pages remain active to describe the concepts in greater detail.</dd>
<dd>3.The original pages serve as the canonical policies (or guideline in the case of WP:RS), but Wikipedia:Attribution remains active as a condensed summary.</dd>
<dd>4.Wikipedia:Attribution becomes inactive. (Parts of it that reflect consensus are integrated into the original pages.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Options 1 and 4 are cut and dry (all or nothing) and options 2 and 3 are compromises. This being said we really should be debating whether we want to go with 2 or 3 because it is in the best interest of wikipedia.--88wolfmaster 16:17, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok...think about it. Wikipedia editors have always referred to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> when dealing with content policies. These policies have been embedded into our brains for the several months (years, for some people) we've been editing articles. Furthermore, we have regarded these rules as <i>seperate policies</i> for a <b>very long time</b>.</p>
<p>As we are working on merging three policies that were previously regarded as distinct, we must assess the possible consequences that this might have on all Wikipedia users and anons alike. For example, this merge would cause confusion among established users that:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't participate in Wikipedia activities, such as gnomes</li>
<li>are inactive, semi-retired, on wikibreak, on vacation, serving in the military, etc.</li>
<li>don't read the Signpost, don't look at their watchlists, or were not notified of this discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we need to consider the several anons that edit Wikipedia frequently. Anons don't have watchlists, and the notice above my watchlist was the only indication I had about this discussion. This may cause confusion to them as well.</p>
<p>Are there any other possible consequences to this change? That's something to ponder. All I'm saying is...be careful with what you're doing. No matter how well-intentioned your actions are, this policy change may cause more problems than good results in the end.--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup> 16:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally never viewed V and NOR as separate concepts, but apparently I am in a minority there. The original formulation switched the olds shortcuts to the relevant section of the new page, so older returning members who cited <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> would have promptly found out about the new name. Also, if we're thinking about how it would affect things in the future, we must weigh the potential benefit to new users. The smaller number of policies will make there be less reading before one understands the basic principles, and therefore a lower entry bar. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 16:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To a certain extent, it does have to be all or nothing. Not because there isn't any way to have an in-between option, but because this is a case in which the perceived benefits from each side are found at the extremes of the scale. If the end result is maintaining <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> all as separate and active pages, then we not only made our policy complexity even worse, but also increased potential confusion to new and old users alike, and the entire effort became counter-productive. The "happy medium" compromise here would be one that made nobody happy and would probably be the worst of all possible options. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 16:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There will be no confussion just because people don't read policies!

RS is not even mentioned just because is a guideline, but I wouldn't recommend to merge a guideline into a policy: guidelines should be obvious derivatives or simplier-version of a policy. NPOV, instead, is one of the most known and mentioned policies in arbitrations and never have heard that someone considered it a part of ATT. A merging of non-related policies into a BIG Wikipedia Policy could turn itself in an unsolvable trap in which abusers could refuge themselves.

<dd>Countries dont merge laws because they create said laws at different times (just look at the Constitution of the US certain aspects were combined upon creation and others were later added were not merged with them because of their later add date. Outdated laws remain on the books because removing them would require another law.) But, Wikipedia isnt a hard copy (its not set in stone) its a constantly changing constantly adapting reference source. That being said their needs to be one unified policy (WP:ATT) and the orginal pages need to be kept in a more detailed guideline capacity.--88wolfmaster 19:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I understand that this encyclopedia constantly needs to adapt to new ideas. However, we need to plan on our transition as well. Don't forget that when a government introduces a new law, it gives a certain date as to when the said law begins to be enforced. That way, civilians and law enforcement personnel would be adequately informed about the change. Likewise, I think that we should develop a method to minimize all possible confusion to all Wikipedians <i>as much as possible</i>. This includes assessing possible consequences to returning users, anons, and readers. (This might not be relevant, but some policies do affect the rarely-editing readers)--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup> 20:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, now that I think about it, would it be possible to have multiple messages regarding the progress of this transition on places other than the watchlist?

<p>This is not a question from me. It is more of another food-for-thought issue. I still view this site from an inexperienced editor point of view. When I first joined, simple changing of a few things per article here and there was no big deal, but everything else was overwhelming. I did not know where to ask questions on certain issues because, unlike a single chat room, you have this whole world and one specific article is the right place to ask. It felt (and still does at times) like trying to find a single grain of sand on a beach but you do not even know which one you were looking for but hope you might recognize it when you see it. What I am trying to say by all of this is unlike standard articles which you try and keep shorter, when dealing with a <b>WP:</b> or <b>Help:</b> article, isn't it more efficient and easier on those who actually need the help/understanding to combine all of the same general ideas in to the same single article?

Everyone post "support" or "oppose" in bold and then explain briefly why they support or oppose it. Limit explanations to 4-6 brief sentences to make it easy to sum up.

It really doesn't change anything and really doesn't matter, so I would suggest keeping all of the pages, because why not? the only real argument for keeping them is that it's easier to link to a page rather then a section, but thats really reaching, as for redirection I see no good reason too (although also no reason why not to either...) --02:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Option a: Wikipedia:Attribution remains as the canonical policy, but the original pages remain active to describe the concepts in greater detail.</dd>
<dd>Option b: The original pages serve as the canonical policies (or guideline in the case of WP:RS), but Wikipedia:Attribution remains active as a condensed summary.</dd>
<dd>Either of these options allow new users to learn wiki policy while not necessarily forcing old users to have to adapt to a single new policy. this would make these sets of policy be straightfoward and concise.

<p>I have a rather pedestrian reason for wanting to keep the policies separate: the forcefulness of the name "no original research". It's a powerful negative command. "Attribution", even if substantially identical in terms of policy, just isn't as powerful (neither is "verifiability", even less so than "attribution", perhaps). Like I said, pedestrian. But if the merged policy is substantially the same as the separated policies, I say keep them separate so we can keep directing editors to the page with "NO ORIGINAL RESEARCH" emblazoned across the top. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 02:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Accoring to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, “Original research (OR) is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material, which appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation." ” This is not in any way related to what we ordinarily call research; it is intimitely related to lack of attributability of the facts or conclusions being added to the article. The terminology "no original research" was appropriate to the problems the policy was initialy trying to address, but now the terminology is just confusing. Worse yet, although editors are encouraged to perform source-based research (in the ordinary sense) on the talk page in order to determine NPOV, they sometimes get confused by the title of the NOR policy.

<p>Back on the original subject of this section, I was also considering whether we should merge or not for that reason, but I think we are better off merging. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> are all so closely related that if someone really does need to be directed to one of them, there is a good chance they need to read the other two anyway. The desire to have a greater impact on someone when trying to deal with a dispute is secondary to making sure our policies are more concise and readable for the sake of newbies, so that they aren't jumping from article to article in order to find out what they need to know. <a href="../../../s/x/e/User%7ESxeptomaniac_2337.html" title="User:Sxeptomaniac">Sxeptomaniac</a> 17:09, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have found that, when dealing with a new editor for the first time, it often helps (and is polite) to write out the full policy name the first time you point to it and put the short form in parens (like this: "No, you can't include that statement ... please see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> (usually abreviated as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>)" ... from then on you can just use the short form as they now know what it means.</dd>
<dd>Anyway... to get to Jersyko's original comment... prior to Jimbo requesting this discussion, the short links: [[WP:V]] and [[WP:NOR]] were redirected to the relevant sections of ATT. Thus, we could still use the powerful negative command: "No original research" when needed. The title existed, just in a new location. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Isn't part of the motivation for merging the idea that "no original research" is somehow a misleading statement, however? (see CMummert's comments above) That makes me think that it's possible that WP:ATT is an attempt to phase out the phrase while keeping the substance of the policy, and I'm not particularly fond of that idea. Addressing Sxeptomaniac's thoughts, I agree. But that could be accomplished by creating a summary style page, like <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, on our content policies at WP:ATT (or elsewhere), couldn't it? Anyway, I don't have remarkably strong opinions on the whole thing provided that the substance of our content policies remains substantially the same. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 18:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I think original research would remain an active part of the wikipedia vocabulary. With section redirects there was no harm in linking to WP:NOR either! What CMummert is saying is that NOR is misleading because the NOR policy includes far more than just what we would ordinarily consider <i>original</i> and <i>research</i>. So, yes, the slogan "No original research!" would continue to have an important role, but attribution tries to capture more of the idea that you aren't allowed to include mundane unoriginal speculation either.

<p>Isn't the point just that the hypothesis has to exist <i>independently</i> of the speculations of Wikipedia editors?

<dd>Actually hypotheses do require research. Hypothesis formation is an important part of the standard hypothetico-deductive method described by <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>; hypotheses are formulated only after surveying the existing body of data, and that process is certainly part of the process of conducting research. But a better point to make is that we have just created the very fact that we now rely on, which is an act original to us, not one that happened independently of us.</dd>
<dd>NOR is meant to stop us going down the path of entering into our own hypotheses, theoretical constructs, inferences, etc., as opposed to reporting knowledge-claims and opinions that exist independently of Wikipedia (a narrow exception is where there is some independent source for a notable claim about Wikipedia itself, but even then the independence of the source is important). Even the act of reporting (with a citation) the claim "P" and reporting (with another citation) the claim "P --&gt;Q" and putting them alongside each other, pointedly inviting the reader to use <i>modus ponens</i> reasoning to deduce "Q" is entering into original research. We need to find a source for the claim "Q". It might seem innocent, but there could be another source somewhere - something not yet included in the article - that denies "P", and we must be careful about that possibility if we find ourselves we are about to lead to the reader to infer something that cannot itself be attributed to an idependent source. We are just <i>not</i> here to report, or even to issue pointed invitations to readers to infer, things that are not themselves in independent and reliable sources. NOR puts us on guard against doing that. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm inclined to believe I understand what lies at the heart of NOR, but thanks for explaining it so elaborately. I meant hypothesis more in the sense of the FSM "theory", which of course has about as much to do with an actual <i>theory</i> as Wikipedia itself has to do with academic discourse. It doesn't take any empirical data and no deductive step to just hypothesise away (or <i>presume</i>). <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacies_of_definition.html" title="Fallacies of definition">Fallacies of definition</a> gives a modest example of how well NOR really works as a policy. See <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_definition.html" title="Circular definition">Circular definition</a> for a reference.</dd>
<dd>Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't our judgement as to which sources we trust very much based on our preexisting knowledge?

<dd>In answer to the last bit. <i>Absolutely!</i> NOR and NPOV and the other policies were never meant to cause paralysis or lead us into ruminations about radical epistemological scepticism. They were meant to allow for an element of skilled editorial judgment in selecting sources, giving due weight, etc., etc. (which is one reason why I take with a grain of salt the common claim that academic credentials are <i>totally</i> irrelevant to editing here).</dd>

<dd>At first glance, I'd say that "reliability" as a term promises all the pitfalls of "verifiability": too many people would think it referred to the reliability of the information rather than to the reliability of the published source. "Sources" applies to the sources themselves, not to the editorial act of referencing them (attribution). Attribution is in my opinion an excellent title, cleverly covering in one word all aspects of avoiding original research and verifying and sourcing information. Its only disadvantage is that it isn't catchy—but I don't suppose "verifiability" and "no original research" sounded catchy before we got used to them. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a></dd>

<dd>I'll say it again here, but is there a problem with having a longer, less ambiguous name such as Wikipedia:Attribution to a reliable published source? Although there seems to be a high demand for short, one-word titles, i believe there will inevitably be some ambiguity in any one word title.. nevertheless, it seems "Attribution" is the closest one.. then a redirect to the longer title will further clarify matters. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 12:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stop me if this has been covered before. My concern is that writing WP:ATT to give such prominence to WP:RS causes increased risks of systemic bias, and it works against NPOV. That's because my own simple take on NPOV is about "being fair to the evidence" and "being fair to the subject". If we elevate the prominence and status of WP:RS (previously a guideline) then that tends to squeeze out evidence from sources of weaker reliability, even where minority viewpoints or aspects of balance only exist in such types of evidence. My example is an article I was editing yesterday - a living public figure probably most famous for an extra-marital relationship with a President. (No, I'm talking about a Mexican. My notes are <a href="../../../r/o/s/Talk%7ERosa_Luz_Alegr%C3%ADa_95e6.html" title="Talk:Rosa Luz Alegría">here</a>.) English-language international sources for the relationship easily meet WP:RS and quite frankly they're all biased (i.e. not NPOV about this individual - she's cited for one angle only). My feeling about NPOV and being fair to the subject makes me want to find attribution for the claims about her status as a pioneer in public service; but that kind of evidence is more likely to be lower down the hierarchy of reliability, in Spanish, and maybe not internet-accessible. So I feel there are increased risks of bias, worldwide, if we push editors too hard towards WP:RS as a priority above NPOV. The balanced answer for WP:ATT would be to emphasise instead that sources must be <i>fit for purpose</i> and keep WP:RS unmerged as a guideline, supporting both ATT and NPOV equally. <a href="../../../v/s/e/User%7EVSerrata_26de.html" title="User:VSerrata">VSerrata</a> 07:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Our policy on which sources are useable as a reliable published source for a claim is widely and energetically debated among long time contributors with general concensus on general advice; but the experts agree that it boils down to specific claims on specific sources evaluated by research by wikipedians into both the claim and the source. Unfortunately, you can't write most of common sense or expertise into policy and so the editorial judgements needed for many cases simply can't be reduced to a page or so of policy. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 07:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the specific case you mention, I would think that Spanish-language sources would probably be considered <i>more</i> reliable than at-a-distance English-language reports. Internet accessibility is irrelevant to reliability (although I realize that there are editors who have trouble acknowledging this fact). And WP:NPOV remains Wikipolicy; RS is not being "elevated above" it. So, unless these sources you have in mind are <i>completely</i> unreliable, I suspect there will be no trouble in adding them. (And if they <i>are</i> completely unreliable, I suspect you would have trouble with them in any case, as WP:RS is, and has been, one of the most accepted of WP's guidelines for quite some time, considered by many to be more of a clarification of WP:V than something separate.) Bottom line, though, I don't think the problem is as big as you suggest, because RS is merely being elevated to <i>the same level</i> as NPOV, not above it. NPOV remains absolute, indisputable policy. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 11:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I don't think RS is being "elevated" at all. Both WP:NOR and WP:V (as well as WP:NPOV) clearly state that reliable sources are a must. Thus, the <i>concept</i> of RS has been Policy for years. WP:ATT does not change this, it simply restates it in a clear way. Yes, some of the language from the guideline WP:RS has been incorporated into ATT... but that language expresses exactly what V and NOR have <i>always</i> said. The bulk of WP:RS has been copied over to the ATT/FAQ... with the idea that it will be worked on and promoted back to guideline status. A guideline that will explain why the policy is the way it is and help editors determine if a given source is reliable or not. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

RS was called a guideline and so was second-tier in at least two senses. The redrafted ATT is now the first pillar, merging "WP:V, aspects of WP:RS and WP:NOR", and it will be pushed strongly towards editors. In my mind, that certainly elevates WP:RS to first tier - so I disagree with <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a>. It does change the relationship between RS and NPOV. What I want is policy + guidelines that allow editorial judgement (like <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> says) to match claim and source. It's problematic that the word "bias" is missing from the text of WP:ATT. The draft goes wrong for me precisely when it emphasises "books and journals published by universities ..." etc. because each of those is still open to bias. In my mind, a balanced NPOV article quite possibly uses a blend of sources of varying reliability and bias. So that same point in ATT is where a reminder about NPOV and minority views would sit better - still using sources that are <i>trustworthy, or [are] authoritative in relation to the subject at hand</i>. As I still see it, demerging WP:RS is the neatest answer for now. <a href="../../../v/s/e/User%7EVSerrata_26de.html" title="User:VSerrata">VSerrata</a> 15:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps I am missing something... No one is suggesting that NPOV be demoted in any way. All that is happening is a merger between NOR and V. We are simply going from three pillars to two pillars without a change in the status of any of the concepts involved. To me people seem overly concerned that RS is being elevated... I just don't see that. RS was always a key concept in V and NOR. RS has always been a key concept in NPOV. This hasn't changed. All of these policies state that material we added to articles has to be backed by reliable sources. So where is the difference between what NOR and V say and what ATT says? Where is the elevation? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:57, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I'm confused. Neutral point of view is covered by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and attribution is covered by <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Adding information on NPOV to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> would be redundant; it's already covered by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>! Bias is properly discussed in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, not <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Reliable sources, on the other hand, are implicit to V/OR, and are quite properly discussed in ATT/V/OR policies. I also think you're reading too much into the necessarily-arbitrary order in which the five pillars are listed. NPOV is not secondary to ATT/V/OR/RS; it is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia, and is non-negotiable! Anyway, it might be helpful if you mentioned some of the sources that you'd like to use that you are afraid will be considered unreliable. It might help us get some perspective on the matter. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 00:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A - That's helpful. The essay itself says "Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements." That rebuts <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a>'s comment above. Before people want to sign off on the concept of the new ATT, I'd suggest doing a walk-through. What will newbie editors see, in what order? Are we helping them to see the big points, or are we putting up too much clutter of lawyerly detail in the wrong eye-catching places?? My points on ATT are basically that: (1) both the first and second pillars matter, so we should avoid RS clutter while we introduce concepts; and, (2) bias is a concept that deserves an early-ish introduction. <a href="../../../v/s/e/User%7EVSerrata_26de.html" title="User:VSerrata">VSerrata</a> 07:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>B - On wider issues than drafting this version of ATT I suspect I've spotted an underlying problem. Maybe we can blame the physicists for it! The kind of minority viewpoint that often seems to be in policy editors' minds for NPOV, as mentioned in the essay, is something like <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>. That has one kind of matching of source and claim (<i>many-to-one</i>), with multiple viewpoints on the same claim. My concern, in say a biographic article, is much more <i>one-to-many</i> in matching sources with different aspects of a subject's life in the absence of a published in-depth biography that easily meets WP:RS. That requires more recognition of bias, and systemic bias. Try looking at <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Gomwalk_9651.html" title="Joseph Gomwalk">Joseph Gomwalk</a> as another example that needs tackling. What are the messages we are giving out to editors in the way that policy pages say what's most important? <a href="../../../v/s/e/User%7EVSerrata_26de.html" title="User:VSerrata">VSerrata</a> 07:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion at the poll about how to frame questions, the nature and utility of polling on policy in general, and whether to be simple about things or unpack every option. However, this page has already provided an informal poll <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html#Should_WP:V_and_WP:NOR_have_been_merged_at_all.3" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">here</a>, and I'm wondering whether we might not use it rather than waste further time on trying to agree on a poll design. I see an approx. 2.5 to 1 support for the primary merger of V and NOR. It's not a nose count, of course, and it will be up to Jimbo to weigh arguments against one another (if and when this is presented to him). But if we take this result along with the acclaim ATT received when it went live, I see broad (though not unanimous) support for the primary merger.</p>
<p>Which brings us to RS. Here I don't see consensus, but a split. At the risk of redundancy on already long page, could someone <i>briefly</i> outline the arguments for why RS should not be merged if V and NOR are merged. Others can then respond, and perhaps we can get this done. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:08, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Already explained above, but I can play the keep asking the same question time and time again game&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>If ATT is intended to be policy that makes it enforcable, therefore needs some fairly clear cut boundaries for editorial decision making, admin actions in the event of breach and creiteria for the dispute resolution process. Reliability of sources is not absolute but depends on the characteristics of the source itself, the topic area it's being used in and how it is being used in relation to the topic and any other sources being used.</dd>
<dd>Reliability is an inherently subjective issue. Topic areas which are reasonably stable can be supported with a more doctrinal approach; this source is <i>reliable</i> or <i>acceptable</i> whereas that source is not. Topic areas which aren't stable, particularly more current subjects don't respond well to that treatment, they end up with a choppy style, never actually getting through the editorial process to make them readable or useful to the reader.</dd>

<dd>I think subjective is the wrong word. I think what ALR is trying to say is that reliability cannot be determined merely by following a set of rules. There are, to any set you can think of, a lot of exceptions. Hence 'guideline' status is more appropriate than 'policy' for a page on techniques for evaluating sources. I'm not sure I agree with it myself, but it is a convincing argument. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 16:53, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let's also say <b>bias and systemic bias</b> in addition to the policy v. guidance issue. Merging WP:RS into ATT as the "first pillar" of Wikipedia is in tension with the idea of recognising bias and dealing with it. WP:NPOV itself says "NPOV requires views to be represented without bias. All editors and all sources have biases." (And as another editor said recently <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_and_undue_weight_ff95.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources and undue weight">elsewhere</a> "Because we have defined only certain sorts of sources as "reliable", we end up with articles that are heavily slanted to the point of view of that type of source.") Especially for newbie readers, what's presented in the first pillar shouldn't pre-empt discussion of bias in the second pillar. We need to give the principle of reliability - <i>trustworthy, or [are] authoritative in relation to the subject at hand</i> - but not full-detailed text without and before the discussion of bias. <a href="../../../v/s/e/User%7EVSerrata_26de.html" title="User:VSerrata">VSerrata</a> 10:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>RS should be kept as a user-friendly <i>guideline</i> to "ATT reloaded" (=ATT+V+NOR). A guide for people, as it is currently, and not turning it into a policy only to merge it with ATT. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 10:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One thing we need to do is separate the concept of RS from the page WP:RS... there is a difference. Since the <i>concept</i> has always been part of NOR, and V... it should be part of ATT as well. We can argue about the language later. That leaves us with the question of what to do with the <i>page</i> WP:RS...</dd>
<dd>The problem that I see with Neigel's comment is that I don't think the current version of WP:RS <i>is</i> "a user-friendly guideline"... I think it is a pseudo - half policy/half guideline. Yes, it <i>says</i> it is a Guideline, but it is <i>used</i> by the community as if it were Policy. It also reads as if it were a Policy. It contains very little <i>guidance</i> and a lot of "these are the rules with the following exceptions" type statements. Many of these statements started off as quotes taken from NOR, V and NPOV... but they have been edited over time, and have taken on their own live. Some have even evolved to the point where they conflict with the original statement at NOR, V, and NPOV - the very statement they originally quoted.</dd>
<dd>Now, these "Rules" type statements are often a subject of debate ... we all have differing opinions as to what is reliable and what isn't... but, I think that such statements should be argued about on Policy pages... they should not be in a Guideline page to begin with (except as a direct, attributed, quote from Policy... as in "Wikipedia's Policy on Verification/Original Resarch/Attribution/NPOV states that: &lt;quote&gt;"). Thus, I support the fact that ATT incorporates the sections and statements of WP:RS that deal with "rules".</dd>
<dd>The next question is what to do with those portions of WP:RS that actually are "guidance". These definitely should be in a guideline... and improved upon. I have suggested (above) creating a new guideline called "Determining Reliability" or something. The guidance parts of WP:RS would be incorporated into that. Let's leave the rule making to Policy, and use Guidelines for guidance. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, yes: WP:RS needs a re-write... Maybe, Blueboar, you're right: I'm more on favor of keeping the <b>page</b> WP:RS; it is always useful a comment like yours for clarifying one's ideas... thanks! A rewriting of WP:RS would include, in my opinion:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Changing the "policy tone" to a guideline "tone". I believe WP:RS' Section 8 ("Convenience links") has the right tone to use.</li>
<li>Section 4: "Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons should be removed immediately and should not be moved to the talk page." (that's the whole section 4!) --&gt; A guide to search on biographies and living persons that also explains the current policies.</li>
<li>Merging Wikipedia:Reliable Sources/examples into <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I never noticed that subpage before; it's great, but in the wrong place. WP:RS should include the subpage's content... (or replacing WP:RS by the Examples subpage? The best guide is an example) --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 13:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think what I'm saying here is similar to Blueboar's ideas, but I'll restate it because there may be some difference. We may need a separate non-policy page on the evaluation of sources, but if we do it <i>shouldn't</i> attempt to <i>define</i> the phrase "reliable sources" as it is used in policy, because that just ends up with it becoming incorporated in policy by reference, which defeats the porpoise of having it as a separate page. Whether that separate page should be <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTFAQ_f277.html" title="WP:ATTFAQ">WP:ATTFAQ</a> or something else, I don't know -- but it should <i>not</i> be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, as calling it by that name encourages people to read it as defining the term, which we don't want. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 17:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>1) Include discussion of the importance of the <i>concept</i> of Reliable Sources in ATT, (or in V and NOR if the consensus is that ATT is a bad idea)</dd>
<dd>2) To the extent that a definition of what Reliable Sources means is needed, include that definition in the relevant Policy Page. (Note: I think the current version of ATT does this well, but I could see others wanting further discussion on the language - we can address this after we determine the status of ATT. I would also include a similar section in NPOV since the <i>concept</i> of reliable sources is also a key component of that Policy. The language used to define the concept does not have to be identical between the Policies, since each Policy applies the term "reliable source" in a slightly different way ... as long as they do not contradict each other we should be fine.)</dd>
<dd>3) <b>Do not</b> redirect the Wiki-link WP:RS to that section. (I think doing this is what convinced so many people that WP:RS had been "elevated" to policy, when that was not the intent)</dd>
<dd>4) <i>For the moment</i> - leave WP:RS in place... but check it to be sure that what it says is in sync with ATT and NPOV.</dd>
<dd>5) Write a proposed guideline named: "Determining Reliability" (WP:DR?) - focusing on giving <i>advice</i> to help the editor determine whether a given source is reliable in the context of the article they are editing. This new guideline would incoporate some things from the existing WP:RS guideline, some things from ATT/FAQ and some from the RS/examples page... but some of it could be completely new - as needed. Make it clear that WP:DR is indeed a guideline based on ATT and NPOV Policy. To the extent that the new guideline has to quote Policy, clearly state which Policy it is quoting.</dd>
<dd>6) Once this new proposed guideline is properly drafted, have a community discussion, similar to this one, to figure out whether it has community consensus and, if so, whether it should replace WP:RS or exist along side of WP:RS.</dd>

<dd>In principal yes I'd agree with that approach, however there is a need to come to a conclusion on the philosophical point of how we approach reliability. Tensions remain between those who see reliability as a movable feast subject to essential principles, cntext, usage etc and those who see reliability as a doctrinal statement where individual cases are stated.</dd>
<dd>Until that's resolved then any suggested material, DR is as good a name as any, is liable to end up in the same mess that RS has where it is neither one thing nor the other.</dd>

<dd>That gives two hours to decide the form of Q1, and possibly tweak it; this is unrealistic. The pre-poll on Q1 is strongly opinionated, and quite divided.

<dd>You know, looking at the squabbling about every petty detail in the poll makes me feel that opening this poll on April Fools day would be perfectly appropriate!&#160;:&gt;) Seriously, I would like to thank those of you who have been working so diligently on the poll while we have been focused on the discussion. I know that it isn't easy... figuring out how to fairly phrase each question on the poll (indeed, figuring out what questions to ask in the first place) is almost more contentious than the underlying issue. But there are at least a few of us that appreciate the effort. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I thought everyone knew that Sacharov had proven the existance of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, only to have his work censored by those Pasta hating commies in the Kremlin! - OK, seriously... you are both correct. Of course knowing the background of a source is important, and it can impact on it's reliability... depending on what the source is, how it is being used in an article, etc. etc. etc. It is a topic that should probably be discussed on any revised WP:RS (or WP:Determining reliability) guideline. But we can not just make a blanket statement saying THIS is unreliable and THAT is reliable about such sources. And we certainly shouldn't do so at the Policy level. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree; in Anglo-American terms, this is a question of fact, not of law. We should judge on a case-by-case basis; there are plenty of tendentious and partisan works published in the West. There are exceptions to Piotrus' rule, after all: Some Soviet historiography is on a sufficiently obscure subject that it largely escaped ideological pressures; and some questions (When was Charlemagne born?) are not ideologically important.

<p>I've been looking closely at the old pages and the new one - I think that it's good work that's been done and I'm almost ready to support the new language and the merger. My only real criticism is that the "this page in a nutshell" for the ATT page is <i>much</i> too brief. It's nice to sum things up concisely, but it really doesn't do justice to the substance of the policies. Can't we expand it to something that is still concise but more useful, and less likely to encourage the widespread misconception that original research is confined to uncited material (making NOR just part of verifiability)? I.e., just put in the points from the "old" articles (with any rationalisation needed to avoid repetition). If that were done, I think I could support the new arrangements. I still think we need more examples and explanation of "synthesis", and more discouragement of it, but that applies in either case. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The key question that I asked for months ago (but was somewhat ignored, at least in my opinion), which I still want answered, in a clear concise fashion is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the improvement in changing the policy?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there's no substantive change--no way that that will affect Wikipedia--then I could care less if the policy changes (even if it's less words, more words, polled, unpolled, etc.).

<dd>I don't think POLICY is being changed... the only change is where the policy is to be found. The improvement that I see is that by merging we go from having two policies that involve similar concepts to having one united policy. Having two has, in the past, occasionally resulted in conflict between them ... where one was edited to the point where it said something that directly contradicted what the other said. Having them on the same page will greatly reduce the possibility of that happening again. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with opinion; there was an explicit effort <i>not</i> to change any aspect of the policies as they were commonly interpreted before the merger. Also, there were two active talk pages where users asked questions (three if you count RS), in addition to the VP, which was a pain for everyone to keep up with. Presumably the talk page for ATT will be a unified place for users to get advice about these issues. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 16:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Let me be clear--I have no real problem with the attribution policy, but I don't think this is the end of wikipedia if the current, revised policy stays. It just seems like people are making a big deal over such a small perturbation, if any at all.</dd>
<dd>I do worry about attributable. There are times when cranks can put material into an article which they say is attributable, but they have no source. The attribution policy is bad in that it allows them to put it in in my reading. If there's conflict, who wins? If there "might be a source" what goes in the article? Either everything goes into an article (my fear) or nothing if there's a conflict.<a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlin_d492.html" title="User:Olin">Olin</a> 23:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can't just rename WP:V or WP:OR because the content of the pages uses the same confused terminology as the titles. So they would have to be rewritten and renamed. The goal of WP:ATT is exactly that - to simultaneously rename the pages and rewrite the text to have clearer terminology with the same meaning. Rewriting them separately would be no easier than writing WP:ATT once.</dd>
<dd>WP:ATT is very clear that the burden of evidence to keep material is with the editor who wishes to keep it; this is no different than WP:V. It's in the lead section of the policy because it is such a crucial rule. I am very sympathetic to the problem of fighting cranks, since I edit math articles and there are lots of math cranks around. WP:ATT gives you the same tools that WP:V did.</dd>
<dd>Of course it's not the end of the world - it's just a rephrasing of the same policy meant to make the policy easier to explain. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 01:39, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a heads up, but when doing the merger, I suggest that someone make sure that the language of the policy does not permit driveby reference spamming. Believe it or not we have managed to reduce the rate of spam insertion by 2%, and I have noticed in several search engine optimization forums frustration at the difficulty of inserting an uncontested spam link. Lets keep it that way. The new policy/guideline needs to be <i>very</i> clear that spam will not be tolerated, even if it is disguised as a reference.

<dd>Nothing to worry anymore. If you did not notice, the wiki software marks all external links in articles with the "nofolllow" attribute since a while ago.

Do note that at the time of insertion the spammer actually had <i>content</i> there. (I asked him and he told me he was the owner of the site, presenting <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues, and issues with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), we hashed out that it was not right for him to be adding the links. Then a few days later, the spammer filled up the page banner ads that reload every 15 seconds for maximum profit. (A few links were still on wikipedia).

<p>The criticism on the poll page is actually very good, in particular some of the points made by SandyGeorgia, although I'm covering all sorts of things here. At the time of writing the poll is very even ATT leads by 75-67, so I think it is beyond time to actually listen to the criticism as see if anything can be done about the concerns. To begin with, would something like the following change to the lead paragraph satisfy at least some concerns?</p>

<p>The writing could of course be improved, but the idea is to address some concerns that I have seen.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You can attribute to any source!</b> This I have seen surprisingly often. Either we need to rename this policy to "Attribution to reliable sources" or the colloquial "Rely on published sources". At the very least, the entire phrase should be bolded. Also, we might need an emphasis on NPOV and Undue weight having an important role on this issue as well.</li>
<li><b>You have marginalized truth!</b> Alright, we need to at least make the wikilink more prominent. Truth is great and all, but it is simply not a criteria that one can work with. Nobody includes material <i>they</i> think is false, we need policy to resolve issues when people disagree about the truth. In any case, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTTRUTH_148b.html" title="WP:NOTTRUTH">WP:NOTTRUTH</a> section explains this well, the link should be more prominent.</li>
<li><b>You have diminished notions of verifiability.</b> Ok, let's put back something to that effect, using verifiability in the sense implied by WP:V to verify the attribution, I tried this above.</li>
<li><b>You can use verifiable sources but still do original research.</b> We could try to make the relationship between attributability and original research more clear in the lead already, again I tried this, but the sentence is getting long and confusing.</li>
<li><b>We need a separate page to discuss the concepts in more depth.</b> If any concept of NOR need further explanation, it is the part about <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">WP:SYNT</a> that needs elaboration. Everything else is in my opinion very clear in ATT, much clearer than the different policies. And SYNT is of course no more confusing here than before, it is the same example! I think synthesis is a problem of false attribution, because one is essentially using sources in a context where the implied meaning can no longer by honestly attributed to the original authors.</li>
<li><b>You have elevated RS from guideline to policy.</b> No, the title is perhaps unfortunate, all the sections, except "redflags", are copied from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources" title="WP:V">WP:V#Sources</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Sources" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#Sources</a>, is there anything else in ATT that shouldn't be there?</li>
<li><b>The page is badly structured.</b> Uhm, (Mikkalai), if you think creating something people will agree with is an easy task, see the discussion that went into the poll&#160;:) This policy was a compromise. I could write a much better policy (in my own opinion), but for something like this to be at all be successful, it has to be begin life as almost a copy-paste of the current policy.</li>
<li><b>You should start from the goal not the procedure.</b> This is, I think, the best objection. This was Mikkalai's first objection, and Mukadderat has also elaborated on this. Personally I think they are right, in theory, but I think ATT is more useful in the field. I mean, yes, verifiable and accurate information is our goal, no original research is an independent decision, and so attribution is the primary means to achieve that goal, but it is only a <i>means</i> not a <i>end</i> in itself. I agree. But I think it is more practical to have a page on attribution, and if there are other means (I'm not aware of any) to reach the goal of accuracy, then those can be posted as exceptions, such as the straightforward logical deductions exception. The fact is that without original research there are too few significant methods of guaranteeing accuracy, other than using reliable sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, many people say NOR is a separate concept and so it shouldn't be subsumed, but I think <b>NOR is a very bad way to counter the real problems with "original research"</b>. What should fight pseudo-science is undue weight, and what should prevent defamatory material appearing on biographies is a respect for other humans (upheld by our policy on BLP). Even if this ATT is far from perfect, it is a significant improvement over previous state of affairs, so whatever we do, let's not go back to V and NOR, let's try to find a solution on how to improve, rename, or supplement ATT!

<dd>I do not like the idea that you can attribute to any source, from what I read, I could just put something up on the internet and cite myself. Bad idea for several reasons.

<p>First of all, just to clarify the two possible compromises I am suggesting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> becomes policy. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> are demoted to guidelines subordinate to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>, and may remain guidelines providing people bother to maintain them. Otherwise, they can be historical. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> remains a guideline, key points of which may or may not be included in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> depending on what people think of that.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> remain policy. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> becomes a summary with a status like <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, providing people bother to maintain it. Otherwise, it can be historical. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> remains a guideline, key points of which may or may not be included in the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> summary depending on what people think of that.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the record, I support the latter.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this addresses concerns about too many policy pages which could possibly be contradictory, since <i>not all would be policy</i> and would have a clear hierarchy. Another serious concern which some editors have about these compromises is the additional time that it would take to maintain all four. My answer to this is: let editors decide for themselves if they want to spend the time maintaining these. If people choose to maintain the pages, let them. If people don't bother, then demote them to historical.</p>
<p>We would also need to figure out what to do with the talk pages. In the the first possible compromise, it might be appropriate to subst <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> into <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a>. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> was rather hi-traffic, so this could be better for people with slower internet connections. Another possibility would be to redirect <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a>, and provide links to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> archives from <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a>. In the second possible compromise, it might be a good idea to move conversations from <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> which were more appropriate for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> over to the more appropriate talk pages, with notice left in both locations that the conversation was moved.</p>
<p>I hope I have addressed the concerns of some of those who were strongly opposed to middle solutions.</p>

<dd>I think demoting V and NOR to "Guideline" is a really, really bad idea... here's why... I see a distinct difference between Policy and Guideline. Policy should tell us <i>what</i> we can and can not do. Policy expresses "the rules" we should follow. Guidelines, on the other hand, should be guidance, telling us <i>how</i> to do things. V and NOR contain far too much in the way of "rules" for them to be guidance pages. Most people will continue to look at them as "rules we must follow", ie as Policy. Look at what happens with WP:RS... while it is "just a guideline"... most people think of it as if it were Policy. That leads to a lot of argument and confusion. Having V and NOR as Guidelines will also not solve the problem of having to watch three different pages to make sure that they don't conflict with each other. In my opinion we really do need to redirect them to ATT. I would keep the shortlinks... directed to the applicable section of ATT... they are usefull when we are discussing only one aspect of ATT.</dd>
<dd>However... I do agree that we need to figure out what to do about the Talk pages. I agree that these need to be kept in some form so that we can use them as a historical reference as to the intent and development of these concepts in Policy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:56, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see the difference between policy and guideline being more the degree of consensus and how often <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is needed, policies being well enough developed that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is very rarely needed. I think <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> supports this view.</dd>
<dd>I don't think anything should be redirected. At most, those which do not stay policy should be demoted to historical. We don't need to hide the fact that they were once policy, and since people who link to them probably meant the things that they linked to, this raises <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFACTOR_6166.html" title="WP:REFACTOR">refactoring issues</a>.</dd>

<dd>I agree that Guidelines are automatically subordinate to Policies. I think the difference between Armed Blowshish's view and mine is one of style not content. (ABF, correct me if I am misrepresenting your view), I think he sees guidelines as semi-policies that have not achieved a certain level of consensus, while I see them as advice pages on how to apply existing policy.</dd>
<dd>By the way... I do agree that WP:RS is just as much a NPOV issue as a WP:ATT issue. When including material in Wikipedia (especially one that could be contentious) the first questions relate to ATT: "Is what I want to add attributable to a reliable third party source?"... "Is it an original Synthesis?"... etc. If it passes these tests then we move to NPOV questions: "What weight should be given to the source and thus the material I want to add?"... "Ahould it be presented as a statement of fact or opinion?"... etc. ATT applies to "<i>Can</i> I include this material?"... NPOV applies to "<i>Should</i> I include this material and, if so, <i>how</i>?" <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A completely different sort of comment on the same general topic. I see a lot of <a href="../../../p/a/n/WP%7EPANIC_b042.html" title="WP:PANIC">WP:PANIC</a> on the part of ATT proponents, that we simply <i>cannot</i> have ATT and also have V/NOR/RS. I say "fooey". I say this because WP is <i>chock full</i> of guidelines, FAQs, essays and other interpretations of policy, and this causes no particular confusion or maintenance problem for us. For example, there are an almost innumerable number of such documents that all ultimately descend in one way or another from the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> policy, including everything from <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">WP:TEA</a> (and <a href="../../../p/o/t/WP%7EPOT_65da.html" title="WP:POT">WP:POT</a>), to <a href="../../../m/a/s/WP%7EMASTODON_5bf3.html" title="WP:MASTODON">WP:MASTODON</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROUT_3ce4.html" title="WP:TROUT">WP:TROUT</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>. Some are funny, some are serious. Some are longwinded documents, some are almost Zen-like in their simplicity. Some are so accepted they are almost policy themselves, some are little-known or even controversial. And it doesn't matter. WP is not falling apart. There is no confusion over the issue. The documents are not falling slowly out of line with policy. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:34, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Verifiability</b> should explain what a <b>Reliable Resource</b> is; thus the foundation of verification. However, <b>No Original Research</b>, in my opinion, has nothing to do with verifiability and reliable resources. Original Research can be verified, especially when published in parallel with an emperical journal.<a href="../../../n/i/u/User%7ENiubrad_16cd.html" title="User:Niubrad">Niubrad</a> 23:40, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All the various ways original research violates WP:ATT:
<ol>
<li><i>Is it unpublished original ideas by a Wikipedian?</i><br />
Well then it's not attributable to any published source.</li>
<li><i>Is it some pseudo-scientific theory on someone's blog?</i><br />
Well, then it's not attributable to a <i>reliable</i> source.</li>
<li><i>Is it presenting an novel synthesis by combining sources, and then making a conclusion not backed by the cited sources?</i><br />
Well then the conclusion isn't attributable to a reliable source.</li>
<li><i>Is it abusing reliable sources to present a novel interpretation?</i><br />
Well, then it is a case of false attribution! ATT requires material to be "directly and explicitly" supported by the cited sources.</li>

<dd>Well put, Merzul.

<dd>I don't think its that ATT doesn't <i>cover</i> NOR. To me the question is rather of increasing the chances that editors will comprehend the meaning of NOR and therefore edit properly according to its dictates. Let me explain, based on the entry for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a> (see the section on this entry above). Consider a minor courtcase involving the subject of an entry, a courtcase not reported by any secondary sources. This lack of secondary sources <i>already</i> means there are no grounds for discussing the case in the entry, however editors who wished to discuss the case made the following argument: because these editors only reported what was stated in documents tendered to court, therefore what they wrote was attributed to public documents, and could be included in the entry. They merely chose what they considered the significant portions of court documentation, and reported it <i>as</i> court documentation. These editors had great trouble understanding how this could be a "novel interpretation," that is, they had great difficulty understanding how what they considered simple, factual reportage was necessarily a <i>selection</i> from those documents, and therefore (in the absence of any secondary sources), an interpretation. It did not occur to them that such selective reportage is the very strategy employed by tabloid journalists every day. Now, of course, all this occurred before any merger, so it suggests that the problem of editors failing to grasp NOR obviously already exists. Nevertheless, it is important to ask whether this merger is likely to make this issue clearer or less clear. When editors are involved in disputes, it is easy for them not to see that they are presenting novel interpretations, and it is easy for them to claim that because they can attribute their statements to sources, and can write these statements in neutral language, therefore they cannot have violated any policy. The danger with a merger is that editors will feel more justified in believing that because they can <i>attribute</i> their statements (for example, to court documents, which are primary sources), and because they are merely reporting the <i>contents</i> of their sources, therefore they cannot be violating NOR, when in fact they are. This is not a definitive argument against merger, but I believe it is a question worth asking before embarking on this route. <a href="../../../f/n/m/User%7EFNMF_20f8.html" title="User:FNMF">FNMF</a> 01:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may have already been proposed, but if not, I'd like to throw another idea into the discussion. What if we cut out all the information about what constitutes a reliable source from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and just link to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>?

<p>And I do realize that that would make <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiabilty_ebeb.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiabilty">Wikipedia:Verifiabilty</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> pretty short. However, they are for the most part separate ideas, and should not be put together on a single page simply to make the policy page longer. One thing I've learned as a Wikipedian is that while some articles should be merged, some things are too different to be covered in a single page, even if that means we have a bunch of relatively short articles instead. —<a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemember_the_dot_d46e.html" title="User:Remember the dot">Remember the dot</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/User_talk%7ERemember_the_dot_109f.html" title="User talk:Remember the dot">talk</a>)</sup> 04:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
