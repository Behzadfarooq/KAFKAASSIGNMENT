<dd>One small attack doesn't justify using the word terrorism for the whole article though, unless you can prove all the bombs mentioned within the article were with intention to terify, or complying with any of the rest of the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">definitions</a>. Terrorism, or terrorist is a POV nightmare of a word to use. London underground attacks would be a better title for this article. To go further, I'd suggest that this article should be turned into a 'List of' style page rather than an article as you could pick any place to write an article on the attacks. For example the Europa hotel in Belfast has been bombed more than any other place in the world, yet still doesn't really deserve an article. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPauric_ee97.html" title="User:Pauric">Pauric</a> (<small><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPauric_5861.html" title="User talk:Pauric">talk</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pauric_afdf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pauric">contributions</a></small>) 17:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't see any of the IRA attacks being intent to injure, apart from perhaps bombs during the 40s or the early 70s, a couple of times when the organisation was under quite secterian leadership. As for the first two, I can't say as I don't know anything about the bombs, bit of a lack of information. To be pedantic, the Brazilian man shot could fall under this article, as there is suspicion it wasn't entirely a misinformation fault. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPauric_ee97.html" title="User:Pauric">Pauric</a> (<small><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPauric_5861.html" title="User talk:Pauric">talk</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pauric_afdf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pauric">contributions</a></small>) 18:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bombs left in public places have the inherent capacity to injure members of the public (i.e. "civilians or non-combatants"), even incendiary devices. The 1976 Wood Green bombing in particular could very easily have resulted in great loss of life, but for a lucky fluke of timing. As regards <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charles_Menezes_416f.html" title="Jean Charles Menezes">Jean Charles Menezes</a>, it notable that I did include it in my own page on the subject (in the links - I've actually held off contributing to this page until today), which someone else used as the basis for this page, although they omitted that particular incident. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 21:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Stop guessing and stick to facts. I will ask the question again as you avoided it last time - In ALL of the attacks listed on the page was it the intention to "cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants"? If not then I am going to change the page name as it is POV--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 21:55, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Stop being so disingenuous. I did not "avoid" the question at all. Nobody plants a bomb in a public place thinking that it can somehow magically explode or ignite, and yet fail to injure anyone who happens to be in the vicinity. In virtually every bombing incident listed, the placing of the devices in public areas were self-evidently a risk to members of the public or Underground staff. For example, if the train at Wood Green had exploded five minutes earlier or five minutes later there <b>would</b> have been passengers on board and some <b>would</b> have been injured or even killed. It was sheer luck that it was empty and in the process of reversing, but the car it was in was wrecked and had to be partly cut up before it could be removed. It doesn't take a genius to work out what would have happened had people actually been in it at the time. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 22:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree the name should be changed, terrorism is a weasel, controversial word that implies POV and is a terrible name for this article.

<dd>right - go through each of the attacks and if each one was ""<b>intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants</b> with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act." then we can talk - not sure why you would phone is a warning if you intention was to harm civilians!--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 18:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Plainly "the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act" is a given in every single IRA operation. All devices that didn't actually cause death or injury were placed on trains or in public or staff-frequented areas of the Underground, all of which posed a de facto threat of death or injury to members of of public and Underground staff. It's hardly rocket science. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 18:49, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Remember the criteria you set out yourself - <b>"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm"</b> - be neutral and not be biased in your assesment or were we are just going to have to get a mediator to settle it or of you really want to keep the list I could just remove the sections which are not terrorist.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 22:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's not kid ourselves. We're not talking about bombing trains stabled in sidings in the middle of the night, or incendiaries set to go off when stations are closed. Bombs left in public places cannot be divorced from a potential - and therefore an intention - to cause death or injury to members of the public.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I see that the title has now been changed to the woefully misleading "List of attacks on the London Underground" which - as I've already pointed out above, is so vague that it merits the inclusion of everything from WW1 &amp; WW2 bombings to vandalism. I was going to suggest a compromise of "List of paramilitary and terrorist attacks..." but will take a back-seat now and see how things pan out. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 23:18, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's just being silly. It's useful, not least for contextualising the 7 July attacks, which in some quarters were reported in terms which suggested the Underground had never been been bombed by terrorists/paramilitaries/whatever before. 23:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely all we need to do is not use terrorism in the title, but then in the particular articles put something along the lines of "often referred to as an act of terrorism" and give references, such as to the many newspapers, articles, etc. This is a practice suggested by <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWeggie_3196.html" title="User:Weggie">Weggie</a> in the <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omagh_bombing.html" title="Omagh bombing">Omagh bombing</a> article after <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> removed the word "terrorism".

<dd>Nick Cooper is the one that wanted terrorism included in the title and provided this reason - "On March 17, 2005, a UN panel described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act." if these criteria are proven then and only then should the term ever be used.

<dd>As I've said, personally I would favour "Paramilitary and/or terrorist attacks..." and let readers make up their own mind. Just plain "attacks" is far too vague, but I'm not bothered enough to get into the current ball-kicking contest with the title, although plain "Bomb attacks..." is another possible compromise. Oh well, at least Weggie hasn't turned up (probably needs a lie down after my work on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoot-to-kill_policy_in_Northern_Ireland_3ed8.html" title="Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland">Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland</a>). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 19:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have already changed it once and so has <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> so if someone else does it this time then that shows a clear concensus. In my opinion <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> only changes back to try and wind me up, as one day he just went around following what edits I made and then he would simply revert it - its interesting that he doesnt bother to discuss the issue - that speaks volumes--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 19:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would opose changing the name very strongly to anything including terrorism. The fact that Astrotrain refuses to engage in the talk page while changing the title name against the oppositon of more than one user may show bad faith on his part and I urge him to engage here before changing the name back again, otherwise further action(such an rfc) will have to be considered, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I started this article some time ago with the word terrorism in it. If you look up <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> on wikipedia it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terrorism is a term used to describe certain violent or otherwise harmful acts or threats of such acts. Most definitions of terrorism include only those acts which are: intended to create fear or "terror", are perpetrated for a political goal (as opposed to a hate crime or "madman" attack), deliberately target "non-combatants", and are not conducted by a "legitimate" government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion all the acts described were violent acts intended to create fear and with a political goal (the first two occasions are not really known, The suffragettes wanted women's rights, the IRA wanted the UK to give Northern Ireland and the muslim extremists wanted the UK government to pull out of Iraq), they all deliberately targeted non-combatants (public transport and it's users) and they were not conducted by a legitimate government.</p>
<p><br />
<b>I propose</b> to keep a redirect page from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_terrorism_7705.html" title="London Underground terrorism">London Underground terrorism</a> to this article. In this article a brief text will be displayed at the top of the page stating something along the lines of "Although these events can be construed as terrorsim, for the encyclopedic qualities of this article these acts are called attacks"</p>
