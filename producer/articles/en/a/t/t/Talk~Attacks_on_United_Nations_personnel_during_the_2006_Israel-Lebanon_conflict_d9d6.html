<dd>Hmm... what about renaming this article to 25 July 2006 Israeli attack on UN observer post in Lebanon, and focus only on this incident? I don't think the content (which is expanding, pending IDF investigation) will fit well into UNIFIL. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 01:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Disagree. This article will expand further as detail is moved to this page from the parent article, as other attacks possibly take place, and as the investigation/reaction to the attacks-investigation unfolds. Detail on this short period of UNIFIL in Lebanon will likely disproportionately dominate an article covering a much longer UN deployment in Lebanon. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 02:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Agree</i> This is a POV fork. Either this page gets renamed "Attacks on United Nations Personnel in Lebanon (1979-2006)" as a subpage of UNIFIL page, or gets put in UNIFIL, or gets titled 25 July 2006 Israeli attack on UN observer post in Lebanon as an incident page (which has been done before in wikipedia). As to the size of the UNIFIL article thats irrelevant as it is a small article, and in any case, we should have more details on the history of attacks on the UNIFIL before the current conflict. --<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerejota_902d.html" title="User:Cerejota">Cerejota</a> 04:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'd favour the renaming to "Attacks on United Nations Personnel in Lebanon (1979-2006)" and oppose the merge. More than 4 UN died, and there are also UN wounded from other incidents. Merge means it would disproportionately dominate an article covering a much longer UN deployment in Lebanon. Links to it should still exist on the conflict pages, casualty pages, etc. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 19:42, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did try to write a section on this, and there is also a small paragraph in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html#Attacks_on_United_Nations_personnel" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">parent</a>. I think its important to first quote what Kruedener said, then give opinions after. I also included his widows comment as they appear to give indication of previous attacks in that vicinity. On the talk for parent article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict#Attacks_on_United_Nations_personnel_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict#Attacks_on_United_Nations_personnel_2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> there was some discussion. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 02:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This seems to be quite a biased section - the title "18 July email" gives no real indication to the reader of the content; the email by the victim doesn't seem to be appropriately placed in "responses" as it happened before the incident; the "responses" in the section of the email include one interpretation of the email and then comments by the victims wife and a human rights group which do not relate to the email in the slightest. Additionally, the content of the email seems to be quite significant - ie there is not much room for scope of interpretation (by the Col. or whomever) of the last part clearly indicating that Hezbollah was fighting in close vicinity to the UN structure.... This should be put in an earlier section... Ely 12:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The relevant section which was seized on by MacKenzie and media is referenced. It was MacKenzie who made a fuss over one particular section- reason why email isnt quoted at length. The email was seized on after the event which is why it appears in responses. The subsection therefore concentrates on the media event that was "MacKenzie's interpretation of that email". Thats why I originally put it in its own sub-section apart from statements of fact regarding the airstrike event. It was all opinion and fuss.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The widow is quoted because like MacKenzie who gave his opinion, she has an opinion, and alludes to a pattern of attacks in the vicinity of the base which her husband had described in other communications. Note also that down this page there are details for a Finn, Colonel Rolf Kullberg, who also has an opinion on what took place. Everyone has an opinion but wikipedia needs facts im afraid. What makes the MacKenzie media fuss even <b>worth</b> remarking on in passing is the justification some felt it lent their political views on the actions of the IDF that day. MacKenzies opinion became their mantra.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The author of the email wasnt even talking about the airstrike events in question, just a general pattern of IDF repeatedly targeting the post in what he described as a tactical way. This is no big secret- take a look at some of the UNO press releases. Was the airstrike which destroyed the post on that day tactical or nontactical? That isnt a question the author, MacKenzie, the widow, human rights groups, or wikipedia editors can answer. It is being investigated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do agree the 2 last sentences are POV and unconnected to the fuss that was made of the email. A section about the investigation is needed instead. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 03:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Colonel Rolf Kullberg, a Finnish officer commanding Observer Group Lebanon (OGL), part of the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), told commercial broadcaster Nelonen on Thursday that he did not believe that the Israeli air strike on a UN observation post on Tuesday had been a mistake. - G3, 13:31, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However the Finnish authorities have responded with considerable scepticism to official Israeli reports claiming a map mistake as a reason, calling the explanation controversial and superfluous. -84.169.82.248 13:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the image that was there previously was sort of misleading- didnt indicate that the picture was taken <b>prior</b> to its destruction by the IDF. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.29.227.171.html" title="User:82.29.227.171">82.29.227.171</a> 14:34, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The pictures should be changed or clarified. To the normal viewer both pictures look to be the same thing, one a before, and the other and after. When in fact, upon closer inspection, these two pictures show either different locations or different views of the building. Either way it is misleading. Fineric 05:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>IMHO as an IP in the Englisch language WP, the Article <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attacks_on_United_Nations_personnel_during_the_2006_Hezbollah-Israel_conflict_0943.html" title="Attacks on United Nations personnel during the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel conflict">Attacks on United Nations personnel during the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel conflict</a> should be moved/modified/enhanced.</p>
<p>1st) The name is wrong, since the main article is named <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>. The name is too long, no living man ever will enter this name to get this article.</p>
<p>2nd) The article makes a mosquito an elephant. No misunderstandigs here, please, I don't question the relevancy of this article. I question the sense of the subject of the article, since in this conflict 7 died and 12 were injured, but in the 28 years of the existence of <a href="../../../u/n/i/UNIFIL_ef30.html" title="UNIFIL">UNIFIL</a> before, about 250 UN soldiers have died and a lot more than 12 were injured. Therefore I pledge to modify this article to include events happened after the installment of this UN mission in 1978 and change the name into UNIFIL casualities. Focus on the entire history of this mission, but not only on Ten Days in July. (Sorry, couldn't resist, Mr. Woodward!)</p>
<p>3rd) Of course, WP is about encyclopedia, not counting apples. Therefore, the information that Maj. Lang from Austria is survived by an 11-years-old boy and his mother is really a tragedy (WTF, they send soldiers there who are an only parent of a young child?), but the 249+ casualities before also had family members. What I want to express is, for instance, that this article tells through 3 pages about the Khiyam incidence, but the other three deads and the 12 wounded are handled within half a page. Of course, the incident earned widespread media echo, but a statement of Ehud Olmert, who <i>phoned Kofi Annan and expressed his deep regret over the death pf the four UN observers</i> including the rest of this paragraph is simply not important at all and should be discarded. (Since hundreds of years leaders excuse for having done bad things while they didn't give a shit about what happened at all!)</p>
<p>Please undertake the measures needed and appropriate for the article.
