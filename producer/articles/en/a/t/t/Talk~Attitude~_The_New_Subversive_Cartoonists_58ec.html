<p>I've reversed an attempt to merge, and it's being battled a bit, so here's the discussion - the books are obviously noteworthy on their own, and can easily be expanded, and they shouldn't all be here. I oppose this sort of action on these books. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I had no intent on "removing sourced material," as all the sourced material, I believed, was in the individual articles. I was incorrect, and I've since moved that material to those articles, so we're still talking a lot of information duplication. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, maybe actually reading the articles before jerking them around would be a good idea. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 19:42, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps if you hadn't just redirected them, it wouldn't have been a problem. It was somewhat of a bold move that you could have assumed would be somewhat contentious, no? I made a mistake, I owned up to it, I fixed it - the subject at hand at this point is whether merging is a good idea. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:44, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia! The Wikipedia community encourages users to be bold in updating articles, and merging is a normal editing action, and as such does not need to be proposed and processed. That said, five editors have already supported this merge, and you're the only one who doesn't based on your "putting the word 'obviously'" in front of your own opinions schtick," which, as usual, obviously aren't obviously obvious to the rest of the wikipedia's editors. So, OK, we have five editors for merge and one sloppy editor who can't be bothered to read articles before jerking them around and who has an admitted unfamiliarity with the subject matter who is against a merger because he thinks his opinions are "obvious." That's great! Meanwhile, I won't be wasting any more long hours at the library looking up sources for this topic just so self-proclaimed Captain Obvious can revert them out of the articles he apparently thinks he owns yet can't be bothered to read. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>What a coincidence, the D-word was what came to mind when I saw you ignore the opinions of five other editors and then remove seven sources I'd added to Wikipedia, but I find using the D-word to be uncivil. Since it seems you don't, I'm going to disengage from you, right after I delete your profane comment from my talk page. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, because your "Captain Obvious" comment was definitely worthwhile. Yes, please disengage from this topic, it's apparent it gets you too fired up. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know that reading comprehension, or even bothering to read at all, doesn't appear to be your strong suit, but I'll point out that "disengage from you" is pretty different from "disengage from this topic." Unless you are actually one of the Attitude books, in which case I stand corrected. In other words, I will continue to discuss this topic, but not with people who call me the D-word several times. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but my suggestion was that you disengage from this topic, since it's apparent that it's causing you much more stress than necessary, up to and including continuing to make false statements about fellow editors. <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPADE_225b.html" title="WP:SPADE">If you don't like my qualifiers</a>, fine, but considering the numerous statements you made about me, you may want to pick up a mirror. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the third book, sure, and without information on the first two that we have now.

<dl>
<dd>As previously posted, I like this merge. If in the future the page gets too big, we can split it off, but currently the series is best treated (IMO) as a whole. -<a href="../../../d/r/h/User%7EDrhaggis_9f0d.html" title="User:Drhaggis">Dr Haggis</a> - <a href="../../../d/r/h/User_talk%7EDrhaggis_8b40.html" title="User talk:Drhaggis">Talk</a> 19:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To merge it, however, is not how we normally treat a book series. Especially a series like this, which has three distinct topics, is better handled and referred to individually, regardless of consistency with other book series. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some book series have only one article, such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken_Soup_for_the_Soul_fe19.html" title="Chicken Soup for the Soul">Chicken Soup for the Soul</a>, our <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouse_Guard_f6ef.html" title="Mouse Guard">Mouse Guard</a>. Some do not. A numbered book series can easily be handled in one article. If the single article becomes unwieldy down the road it can be split then. I much rather have one full article then three stublettes. -<a href="../../../d/r/h/User%7EDrhaggis_9f0d.html" title="User:Drhaggis">Dr Haggis</a> - <a href="../../../d/r/h/User_talk%7EDrhaggis_8b40.html" title="User talk:Drhaggis">Talk</a> 19:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Chicken Soup may be sensible, given the lack of general distinctive qualities. Mouse Guard isn't a traditional book, it's a comic book series. What about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_of_Truth_bad9.html" title="The Sword of Truth">The Sword of Truth</a>?

<dl>
<dd>Yep some book series get separate articles, some don't. This is a numbered anthology series. When we have three articles worth of content, we split it, until then one serves. One complete article is better than three stubs. Do you really think we have enough content on this subject to warrant 3 articles? -<a href="../../../d/r/h/User%7EDrhaggis_9f0d.html" title="User:Drhaggis">Dr Haggis</a> - <a href="../../../d/r/h/User_talk%7EDrhaggis_8b40.html" title="User talk:Drhaggis">Talk</a> 20:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I do think we have more than enough content for three articles. It's working fine, and it's the general way we run the books anyway. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
