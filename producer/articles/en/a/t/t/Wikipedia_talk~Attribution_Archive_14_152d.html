<dd>Definitely a grey area. They generally have useful editorial control, with at least some degree of fact checking going on. But often it isn't good fact checking.

<dd>As the policy says, sources may be reliable in one contexts and not in others. IMO a newspaper is good as a source of <b>news</b> firsthand reported by their reporters, or <b>opinions of reputable persons</b> interviewed, or <b>articles signed by experts</b> in the domain. Any other information coming from a newspaper, if it is not attributed in it, is not reliable. Clearly, newspaper editors and reporters are not experts in math or physics, etc. The same applies to student newspapers: you must further look at the possible domain of its expertise. Clearly they are supposed to be experts in <b>local school news</b>, but any other info coming from them <b>unattributed</b> or not written by an expert in the relevant domain is dubious IMO. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 15:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">OR wording seems to go too far and to be self-contradictory</span></h2>
<p>The WP:ATT version of OR is pretty unclear and seems a bit excessive, at least in its more stringent interpretations. By my reading it appears to effectively ban the giving of examples that someone else notable didn't write, unless they are mathematical examples (meanwhile using other people's previously-published examples more than very minimally and with direct citation right at the point of usage would be a copyright violation under some jurisdictions' intellectual properly schemes).</p>
<p>For instance, '...an example of this type of redundancy is found in the phrase "get the cat off of the table", since the word "of" can be omitted and the resulting phrase, "get the cat off the table" has the same meaning.' Such simple examples are crucial for many articles, especially those on language concepts, yet the new WP:OR appears to label them a novel synthesis or new theory, when really they are utterly straightforward logical deductions from incontrovertible facts (which can be sourced, of course). Basically a strong argument can be made either way that this is basic logic and simple writing, quite appropriate for an article here, or that it is forbidden, uncyclopedic OR because the <i>example itself</i> didn't come from a journal or book, however closely it may follow similar examples in such sources. Given the "deletion fever" running high on AfD, I think OR's vagueness and seeming self-contradition - "no you can't come to any conclusions, oh, wait, actually yes you can, but only if they're basic logic, which we don't define here, or math" - is pretty likely to lead to inappropriate deletions of articles.</p>
<p>This section needs clarification.</p>

<dd>PS: The fact that the FAQ only has <i>one</i> annotation with regard to OR's meaning and applicability is a bad sign, and suggests that the entire concept needs some work before it will be of true value as a guideline. I imagine the talk page of the original WP:OR can provide a lot of FAQ fodder. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 21:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you mean. The problematic phrasing, as I see the issue, is the inclusion of previously unpublished "explanations", which would probably encompass examples. I think this can be removed without much issue. The word was added only a couple of weeks ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112072681" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112072681" rel="nofollow">(here)</a>, after the policy had consensus. I don't see any discussion about the change, and don't see why it was needed, so I'm going to go ahead and revert it. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I think this change was particularly wrong, and should have been caught sooner. The entire purpose of wikipedia, what we strive to achieve here is to write explanations in our own words of information other people have published. If we're forbidden from introducing new explanations, this goal is clearly unachievable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I noted in my edit summary, I can see how an unsourced 'explanation' would be used by some editor to advance a position, clearly violating OR. I would keep the current language, unless a consensus appears otherwise. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see a problem in adding simple explanations in clearly non-contentious issues, when not 'advancing a position'. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:59, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Policies must not forbid writing that is <b>sometimes</b> inappropriate, only writing that is <b>always</b> inappropriate. Furthermore, the part of the policy that has just been edited does not say anyting about advancing a position. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 23:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree about the non-contentious cases. I guess if there is a contentious case, where an example is used to advance a position, it could be shot down using NPOV and/or viewed as an 'interpretation', so it would be covered. BTW, 'synthesis' does use the words 'advancing a position'; I would think that 'creating an example to advance a position' is no less OR-ish. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to get my&#160;!vote in: I believe we <i>all</i> understand the point that "explanation" <i>can</i> be used to mean <i>theory</i> (or <i>interpretation</i>, etc.), but this does not mean that the word "explanation" needs to be placed next to "theory". It's just intuitively obvious. If some dork-o tries to defend a nonsense POV article in AfD with "but, I'm just explaining...", no one is going to buy that. Insisting on treating the word "explanation" like "theory" here has severe negative consequences because of the deep abiguity it introduces. And I have to say Gerry Ashton's point just above hits the nail right on the nose. One of the smartest things I've seen said on WP in a week or so. His second point is also right on the money - this is <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I know some people here feel a deep need that I do not understand to collapse separate policies and guidelines into longer, more (supposedly) melded ones, but enough is enough. Anyway, as I said in edit summary, JulesH is utterly right on this. Every article on Wikipedia is a "new explanation"; if it wasn't it would be a blatant copyvio. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 01:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't buy JulesH's reasoning, though I respect the intention. "Theory" has different - quite distinct - uses and is not a synonym for explanation. Explanation should be included if we are talking about no <i>original</i> explanations being permitted (and it was in the old NOR policy). JulesH's reasoning can apply to synthesis or interpretation - of course Wikipedia, like other encylopedias, provides syntheses, and interpretations, and explanations - but our policy is that these must come from attributable sources and nto be original to the editor. I don't see any controversy about keeping "explanations" when we are clear the point is whether or not they are original or attributable. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The key difference is that an explanation is a much lower level textual detail than a synthesis (which refers to how different pieces of information are combined) or an interpretation (which refers to the meaning derived from the information). Explanations would tend to be on a much lower level: a set of points that together can be used to understand the meaning of something. It's not quite on the level of words, but not far off. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 19:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Are examples explainations?</span></h3>
<p>One of the arguments about whether original explainations are allowed is whether examples constitute original explainations. For example, if I take material from two different sources, and both sources give examples, for the sake of conciseness and smooth flow, I might want to modifiy one of the examples to use one example throughout the article. If I'm writing an article about electricity, and one source uses a 6 V battery example while discussing resistance, while a second uses a 12 V battery while discussing current, I might want to modify the first example to use 12 V in order to make the article flow more smoothly. In my view, the revision of the values would be an elementary calculation. So I would like to know if <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> considers original or modified examples to be original explainations. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that examples can be a form of explanation, and in my opinion any example that is not based on reliably published sources could be viewed as OR. I would probably allow simple examples for non-contentious topics, like the one you mention, assuming they otherwise conform to published knowledge, but I would shy away from them, like any original interpretation or analysis, in contentious cases where used to advance a position. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Would you, therefore, support a change that restricts original explanations to those that do not advance a position that cannot be attributed to a reliable source?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consensus</span></h2>
<p>It is important that anyone who disagrees with <a href="#OR_wording_seems_to_go_too_far_and_to_be_self-contradictory" title="">the proposed change</a> be willing to discuss their objections here. SlimVirgin and Crum375 have reverted the proposed sentence, against the consensus on this talk page, but have not articulated here any reason for preferring the version without that sentence. We still haven't heard here, if I remember right, from anyone who supports the new, unqualified "not whether it is true" wording an example of a situation in which they think that wording would have a beneficial effect in comparison to not having those words.</p>
<p>Please do not revert the new sentence without expressing clearly here the reasons for opposing it. We're still in the process of trying to find a wording that consensus can be built around after the new, unqualified "not whether it is true" wording was proposed. We need everyone involved to state their opinion clearly so that we can search for a wording that everyone is reasonably satisfied with. Reasons have been stated for including the sentence "Not everything which is attributable is worhty of inclusion." No reasons have been stated here for not including this sentence.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to interpret silence as objection. If people have objections, they need to communicate not only the fact that they have an objection, but also the reasoning behind the objection, so that a discussion can continue from their in search of a wording that everyone can live with. I've noticed that some changes have been made recently to the policy without my having commented in advance, so I don't think taking silence as objection is the norm. We also need to consider the silence of those who used WP:Verifiability for many months, without seeing any merge tag on it, only a notice that it was policy. If such people are now reverting the new wording in various ways it should not be surprising. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. I don't even want to get started on the hijacking aspects; just not going to go there right now. To be honest, I'm smelling a whiff of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> around here. The revert rate is high and rather testy (or completely silent, which is even worse), even for a guideline/policy page, and often seems to be based on "just because I said so" rather than adequately explained reasons; I'm not just talking about today in particular and not singling anyone out; it's just something I've observed as a general, multi-party pattern ever since the merge of everything under the sun into WP:ATT (which I frankly think was an enormous mistake, but I and many, many others weren't even aware of this consolidation move. D'oh. I said I wasn't going to go there...) Anyway, as to editwarring, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> was like this in Nov. - Dec. 2006 and part of Jan. 2007, and the fights this over-control caused were really something (and not something good). That didn't get to be a rational guideline that had actual, cognizable consensus until around early Feb. 2007. Anyway, I agree vehemently that silence is not objection, with the caveat that silence for 5 minutes or even 5 hours doesn't mean anything at all. Silence for several days, however, can be taken as assent. If it turns out to not be assent, but just lack of attention, failure to understand the proposal, or considering it so silly as to not have been worth commenting on, that should become pretty apparent, and frankly shouldn't be very common. If it is common, then this means that the editors doing the testy reverts need to remember how to use a talk page.</dd>
<dd>All that said, I don't agree with the inclusion of the "not everything which is attributable is worthy of inclusion" bit. This concept is already covered elsewhere, and this policy for whatever it is presently worth or will be worth at some point, is not about overinclusion of irrelevant but true facts, it is about the requirements for inclusion at all. Completely different topics. <i>That</i> said, I think the point is a good one, and if it is not being made clearly enough where it should be made, then that situation should be improved. But as for this particular policypage, "no reasons have been stated here for not including this sentence" is no longer true.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Synthesis needs its own bulletpoint</span></h2>
<p>Per the recent edits of "What is Original Research?" we now have the following bulletpoint:</p>
<p><b>"[Material counts as original research if it] introduces an analysis, synthesis, or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments without attributing that analysis, synthesis, or interpretation to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article."</b></p>
<p>While this statement is perfectly in line with the policy regarding analysis and interpretation, it is <b>not</b> representative when it comes to synthesis. Take the dicdef of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikt:synthesis">wikt:synthesis</a>:</p>
<p><b>"the formation of something complex or coherent by combining simpler things"</b></p>
<p>Or to simplify, any collection of numerous things, in this case sources. When you consider this definition in regards to the policy, this means that the new bulletpoint effectively states that you cannot use any combination of sources in an article unless some <i>other</i> reliable source has used that <i>exact</i> same combination of sources previously. This is obviously wrong; Wikipedia is at its very nature a collection of information gathered from multiple sources. It is only when that combination of sources advances some position or induces the reader to draw a conclusion that it becomes OR.</p>
<p>To remedy this problem, I propose the above bulletpoint be expanded into the following two bulletpoints (or similar):</p>
<ul>
<li>introduces an analysis or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments without attributing that analysis or interpretation to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.</li>
<li>introduces a synthesis of published facts, opinions, or arguments that serves to advance a position without attributing that synthesis to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.</li>

<dd>How about replacing it with "that serves to advance a position that is not attributable to a published reliable source"?

<dd>This isn't a case of expanding on details or giving examples: this is clarifying that the definition does not apply in cases where it should not. Original Research, as we've always defined it in the past, is (among other things) synthesizing multiple sources in order to make a point that hasn't been published by a reliable source. The problem is that the current text doesn't include the restriction to unpublished points.

<dd>Note the removal of the language "that advances a position favored by the editor"; removing this language is the problem. Because the word "synthesis" has been left the new bulletpoint effectively states (as I stated above, don't know how I can be any more clear) that ANY synthesis, any "formation of something complex or coherent by combining simpler things", is Original Research. This does encompass the kind of synthesis we want to avoid -- the kind where there are unpublished conclusions drawn (or directed to be drawn) -- but it also prohibits anything that uses a combination of sources when that <b>exact</b> combination of sources hasn't been used by some other source previously. Effectively, removing the "advances a position" language and leaving the word "synthesis" in has made <b>all</b> of wikipedia Original Research, since every wikipedia article is "the formation of something complex or coherent by combining simpler things", i.e. making a coherant article by gathering information from multiple sources. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 22:01, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contentious topics</span></h2>
<p>This sentence sparked a question in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible. This means that we only publish the opinions of reliable authors, and not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read and interpreted primary source material for themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the case where secondary sources disagree with each other, and one group of secondary sources is very popular in the public media (or even among Wikipedia contributors)? I refer to cases where one side (frequently US liberals) claims that there is a "consensus" on any of many scientific questions.</p>
<p>Should Wikipedia <b>agree</b> with the Liberal POV here, and say that "there is no controversy ... there is a consensus ... etc."? Or would this be giving undue weight to one side in a debate?</p>
<p>How much of a majority must there be on a disputed topic, for the article to adopt one position on it as the "consensus position"? Is 80% to 85% considered consensus on scientific topics, as it is for afd and rfa votes? Would this mean that if only 10% to 15% of scientists in a particular field disagree with the mainstream, there views should be excluded from the article in question? (Or just marked as "minority views"?)</p>
<p>And if a particular viewpoint is deemed "in the minority", are editors required to delete any citations which support it? Would it violate 'undue weight' to cite a peer-reviewed scientific journal article which goes against the mainstream? If so, what percent of support among scientists must the mainstream view have, before all contrary views must (or may) be excluded from an article?</p>
<p>I would propose that 99.8% is certainly enough for that (i.e, 499 out of 500). But what if it's only 95% (i.e., 19 out of 20)? Where is the cutoff?</p>
<p>Or what if Wikipedia editors are unable to determine the percentage of support? Suppose all we know on some obscure (or deeply technical) matter, is that political advocates outside of Wikipedia are citing duelling studies? Passive smoking causes cancer! No, it doesn't! Antarctica is warming and the glaciers are melting! No, it's getting cooler and the ice is thicker than ever!</p>
<p>Do we just guess that it's 50-50? Or avoid estimating the percentage ourselves? Do we quote one side, which says "everyone agrees with me"? If we don't know, are we as editors allowed to leave it indeterminate? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 00:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Let's try and give an answer, anyways. We shouldn't be trying to judge the percent of agreement and disagreement, first off. If there is a "consensus agreement," that should only be stated if some secondary source states that some view has a "consensus." If the New York Times says "scientists have reached a consensus that global warming is real," then there is a statement about consensus that we can use. We basically have to trust secondary sources, else, who can we trust? Our own opinions have no bearing on this. Undue weight is not a problem if peer reviewed scientific journal are cited, it's only a problem when they aren't. A peer reviewed journal is a good source, so we can use it all we want. Now let's look at the possible downside of all this. Say global warming is mentioned in 1000 articles; 900 say it's real, 100 say it isn't. One could write an article with 10 refs from each, making it seem like it's more disputed than it is. There's nothing these policy pages can really say about this; this is where we have to trust our editors. It's an imperfect world, and we all just do the best we can. If an editor uses the fact that there's lots of reliable sources for each viewpoint to push their POV, it just has to be worked out in the talk pages. It may seem like using math to answer these questions is a good idea, but really it's best done through human discussion. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 09:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your response, Peregrine. I have a follow-up, too.</p>
<p>Whether JulesH and J Readings see the connection or not, the policy page says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia:Attribution is one of Wikipedia's two core content policies. The other is Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles; that is, content on Wikipedia must be attributable and written from a neutral point of view. Because the policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I hope you don't mind my asking a question that seems 'more' connected to NPOV. I'm trying to figure out how these 2 complementary policies relate.</p>
<p>Let me try to clarify my question, because it relates to a pattern of editing engaged in by many of contributors on dozens of topics (involving 100s of articles).</p>
<p>Often there is a dispute about a historical or scientific matter. Like, did the Holocaust occur? (Or, did events similar to Hitler's holocaust occur in other times and places?) There are many political controversies over the environment, like Alar, DDT, "greenhouse gases", etc.</p>
<p>Partisans in the 'real world' outside of Wikipedia cite sources to support their positions. We have pictures in Life magazine! No, those pictures were faked! China admitted killing 20 million! No, they never said this! DDT is dangerous to birds and people! No, it's safe enough to eat by the spoonful! (There are quotable secondary sources for each of these shouted examples.)</p>
<p>Enter Wikipedia. Since we have a policy on neutrality, readers would naturally expect to find verifiable sources which touch on these issues. All they have to do, to be really sure, is to "verify" the verifiable. E.g., follow the link and see if what the source really says - and the way the article summarized the source - are in agreement.</p>
<p>But what if an issue is so complex that it consists of multiple aspects, each of which is an issue in itself? It can be too much for average readers, and even too much for some highly educated ones. At some point, the temptation is to cite someone's evalution or assessment of the whole thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to (blank), scientists are unanimous about Alar (or DDT, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But what if sources which make assessments are in disagreement? Or what if they <b>state</b> that there is a consensus but don't <b>show</b> that there is one?</p>
<p>Or what if there is a question about credibility? Suppose a source does not only only make an assessment of the facts, but also recommends policy? Or what if a source is seen as (yes, that's a weasel word) beholden to financial or ideological interests? The group you cite accepts pro-industry funding! No, the group you cite accepts anti-industry funding! Your group is biased in favor of socialism! No, your group is biased against socialism!</p>
<p>It's not easy to determine whether a source is unbiased and objective. Is the EPA considered utterly impartial and completely independent of partisanship? How about the Atlanta CDC? Or agencies of the United Nations? What makes a source objective? The fact that it got broad international support from representatives appointed by governments?</p>
<p>One last question. Suppose prominent organizations run by governments or universities take a position on something; and they issue statements assessing a particular question; and these statements purport to present the "scientific consensus" on something. Suppose then that several individual scientists disagree (in public, or by publishing in peer-reviewed journals) on (1) the science itself and/or (2) whether there is a scientific consensus.</p>
<p>Do we:</p>
<ol>
<li>accept the assessments of the prominent organizations as <b>factually correct</b> and reject all dissenting views?</li>
<li>list the prominent organizations which assert that there is a consensus, but refrain from endorsing these assertions; and also list the dissenting individual views?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry this is long, but my question is about how NPOV and Attribution relate to each other on issues of historical or scientific controversy - particularly when sources assessing the matter disagree on "how much agreement or disagreement there is". --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, and anyway it's not clear what "be careful" means. Should contributors reject all 'claims of being silenced' out of hand? What if a scientific paper finally passes peer review after 3 years? Is this an indication of sloppy work on the part of the paper's authors? Extra scrutiny routinely applied to views which challenge the mainstream? Evidence that the paper is pseudoscience? Evidence that the journals are biased?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Wikipedia articles should try to answer those question, but instead refrain from trying to evaluate claims of 'truth vs. pseudoscience' and 'normal procedures vs. bias'.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, proponents of novel views often spend more time complaining about suppression than they do explaining the merits of their views. So the caution you quoted above has some merit.

<li>introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea;</li>
<li>defines or introduces new terms (neologisms), or provides new definitions of existing terms;</li>
<li>introduces an argument without citing a reliable source who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article; or</li>
<li>introduces an analysis, synthesis, explanation or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments that advances a point that cannot be attributed to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(I've just made a change which I hope won't be reverted, which is to reintroduce the old language in the last bullet point that specifies that something only qualifies if it advances an unpublished point.)</p>
<p>This definition is, frankly, a mess. Taking it step by step, interpreting each bullet point as a single sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Material counts as original research if it introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is just wrong. Huge numbers of pages on wikipedia introduce theories or methods of solution, and they aren't OR. The definition of "original" in the last clause is ambiguous; by at least one interpretation almost every page in wikipedia falls foul of this definition.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Material counts as original research if it defines or introduces new terms (neologisms), or provides new definitions of existing terms</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, defining a term is not OR. Defining a term to mean something that it hasn't been defined to mean by a published reliable source is OR.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Material counts as original research if it introduces an argument without citing a reliable source who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article</i></dd>

<p>This isn't quite so bad, but note that it requires attribution, not attributability, which contradicts the text of the following paragraph.</p>
<p>My proposed fix to this is to substitute this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Material is <b>original research</b> if it introduces, in a way which promotes a point of view or idea that cannot be attributed to a published reliable source, any of the below:
<ul>
<li>a theory, argument, idea, or definition, or</li>
<li>a synthesis of information from multiple sources, or</li>
<li>an analysis, explanation or interpretation of published facts, opinions or arguments.</li>

<dd><b>Strong support</b> as far as it goes. This entire section has been messed up and confusing for a very long time. In particular, defining "explanation" as OR means every article is OR, since all Wikipedia does is explain things; that's the very function of an encyclopedia. I realize that sometimes one can use the term "explanation" when what one really means is "theory, argument, idea or definition", but no one is going to be fooled by this, so there is no reason to include "explanation" in the littany in the present version. I would go further and also remove "synthesis" for reasons already covered elsewhere; the word is simply being misused here. Every WP article that cites more than one source is a "synthesis" under the most common definition of that word. It might be possible to use the word in a different, more explained way, however, such as "* a synthesis of information from multiple sources that results in such a theory, argument idea or definition". The appearance of "example" in the reworded verison above isn't nearly as problematic as in the "live" version because of the new version's qualifying lead-in, so I'll hold off complaining about it. In short, I think this new version solves a great many problems, I can't think of any that it introduces, and to the extent that it might not solve every problem with the original wording, that can be addressed later as the need arises.</dd>
<dd>PS: I would change "below" to "following", and change commas to semicolons before the two final "or" instances.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">"Material is original research if it promotes a point of view or idea that cannot be attributed to a published reliable source."</span></h3>
<p>Sorry, wrong phrasing. The idea may be well attributed, but a research which promotes is still can be original, and hence unduly pushing a POV. The correct way to say would be something like: <i>if it promotes a claim <b>in a way</b> unattributable to...</i>. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 16:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or promotes an idea that is not obvious and common sense (for example, stating that a character is male does not need to be attributed). The problem with the current wording is that it's attempting to satisfy Wikipedia's paranoia due to the public's criticism of its reliability, which leads to overcompensation. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 16:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Something I learned from Mikka's and Jules's analysis is that <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entity-relationship_model.html" title="Entity-relationship model">structurally</a> Wikipedia's primary concern is "verifiability." Hence, we have</p>
<ul>
<li>Material is <b>original research</b> if it introduces a claim that no published reliable source shows to be <b>verifiable.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Under that standard, we have the following results.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) The "facts" an angry spouse puts into an uncontested divorce statement would be "original research" even if you found the words in the spouse's court filings--unless you found a reliable source had published a report of what the angry spouse had claimed in the court filing showing those "facts" to be "verifiable." --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 17:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not exactly so. Two points: (1) a tangent one, but the one people tend to forget: "the 'facts' an angry spouse puts" are not OR, in the phrase "An angry wife said that...&lt;ref. to court filings&gt;" (2) <i>Per se</i>, " the 'facts' an angry spouse puts" are "dubius and biased source", rather than OR. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Okay, I think I've figured out this mental block over "synthesis"</span></h2>
<p>I did a little checking, and I've figured out (I think) where this whole "we need to use the word 'synthesis'" thing is coming from. The original <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy's wording was based heavily on several things written by your hero and mine, Jimmy Wales. In particular, let's look at this little snippet (emphasis mine) that was cited as the basis for the old "synthesis" section of WP:NOR:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and <b>synthesizing</b> them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history.</p>

<p>Seems all well and good, but here's the important bit that everyone seems to have overlooked: <b>the definition of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikt:synthesis">synthesis</a> is different than the definition of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesize" class="extiw" title="wikt:synthesize">synthesize</a>.</b> One is not just the verb form of the other. The difference is subtle, so I'll explain it clearly: <b>synthesis</b> is any new <i>collection</i> or <i>combination</i> of "things" that may or may not change the nature of the "things", whereas the process of <b>synthesizing</b> something is making something <i>new</i> out of a number of other "things". To simplify, <b><i>synthesize</i> means to make something new, whereas <i>synthesis</i> is the mere form of putting things together.</b></p>
<p>As far as I can understand it, the problem is that numerous editors -- not to single folks out, but SlimVirgin and Jossi in particular -- are applying the definition of the verb to the definition of the noun. The two are not the same, hence my objections to the current way "synthesis" is being used. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 23:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've lost track of the argument here. A synthesis is a putting together.

<dd>Quite realistically, the appropriate forum probably <i>is</i> the article's talk page, with the specific context of what the source is being used for. A given source is not necessarily always reliable or always not, it may be very reliable for certain areas and not so reliable outside its area of focus or expertise. Of course, if it's decided that a source is not reliable in a certain area it's been used for, that discussion could certainly be noted when discussing other articles that use it in a similar vein. Of course, there are some baselines (must be fact-checked/editorially controlled/peer-reviewed in some way, self-published sources should be used with great caution, etc.), that apply across the board. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 05:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mikka, the professor can be used even as a self-published source if he's writing within his own area of expertise and if he's a widely acknowledged professional expert in that field. He can also be used in his own article. Anywhere else, it's not allowed, and the amount of links you pointed out do look like spamming. Coppertwig's idea is a good one.

<p>Lately, I've been on the bad end of violating WP:ATT. The problem? I've been writing about a fictional source. I'm not saying that there should be a WP:ATTFIC right now (although it would certainly solve quite a few problems for me, heh), but something could be said about making an official policy that allows, say, the fictional topic's source material to be used without some people getting all uppity about it. Hell, at least one <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">featured article</a>, supposedly <i>one of the best articles produced by the Wikipedia community</i>, uses its source material for almost all of its citations.

<dd>It's a lot easier to step over the line into synthesis then you might think, when using only a primary source. "Darth Vader kills Emperor Palpatine in order to save his son, Luke." That may seem trivial and obvious, but "just from watching the movie", it is synthesis-you don't know what was going through Vader's head. (Nor just from the original movies is it even certain that Vader is Luke's father-he says so, and Luke and Leia believe him, but that's not actually <i>confirmed</i> until later additions to the canon storyline.) On the other hand, of course, "<i>Star Wars Magazine</i> states that Vader killed Palpatine to save his son, Luke" is perfectly alright-it's <i>attributed</i> to someone besides "The editor who wrote this here interprets it so". That's why we should always work mainly from secondary sources, not primary. It's too easy to step into synthesis, and what <i>can</i> be said without it is dry and obvious. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 04:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An NP-complete problem (not evident information, but easily verifiable)</span></h2>
<p>I have something I wish to add to an article that I discovered on my own. The crux of the problem is that while the information is rather nontrivial, it is very easy to verify on one's own. For those of you with an interest in computer science out there, it's analogous to an <a href="../../../n/p/-/NP-complete_3f4f.html" title="NP-complete">NP-complete</a> problem.</p>
<p>Specifically, I'm thinking about adding something to the article on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simlish.html" title="Simlish">Simlish</a>. When a sim leaves their house, they often say "dag dag". I noticed a while back that if you perform a <a href="../../../r/o/t/ROT13_94ab.html" title="ROT13">ROT2</a> on "bye bye", you end up with "dag dag". Such an observation would never reach a reliable source because it's too isolated and, after all, when was the last time you read a peer-reviewed article on Simlish? Nevertheless, once you see that the two phrases are so simply related, it seems quite obvious that the developers had that relation in mind. So which side to the argument wins out? Is it unconditionally shot down as original research, or is it instead so trivial a fact that it doesn't even need citation because anyone can instantly verify it? I'm more interested in learning how the NOR policy applies here than getting my observation "published". Thanks.--134.173.200.107 06:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This merger is a really bad idea</span></h2>
<p>Merging "Wikipedia:Verifiability with Wikipedia:No original research, while also streamlining Wikipedia:Reliable sources into a simpler FAQ at WP:ATT/FAQ" was a big mistake, and the result is completely incoherent. This needs to be reverted immdiately because it is just wrong. It is bad policy all around, and this is not the right way to make policy.</p>
<p>Verifiability and No Original Research are conceptually distinct: they are different things, not the same things. Reliable sources, too, is quite different from the other two, although arguably a subset of Verifiability. The resulting confusion is apparent in many arguments around Wikipedia, as editors are getting confused about two very different concepts.</p>
<p>There is no logical reason for the merge, as the information contained in this unified policy can be more sensibly separated back out into the two separate policies.</p>
<p>As a first step, I am removing the claim on this page that is supercedes the other two, and restoring the other two to their rightful place in the pantheon of Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 15:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take virtually no position on the details of WP:ATT. I think that it probably was a more or less accurate merger of the three separate policies. But merging three separate policies into one, even when that change is not intended to make any actual policy change, is not trivial and in this particular a monumentally bad idea. All over the site are hundreds or thousands of links to these policy pages, and the meaning of referring someone to WP:V versus WP:RS versus WP:NOR are overwhelmingly important to a coherent understanding of the arguments people are making. We must not merge these separate concepts, or we have no means of distinguishing them.

<dd>Fair enough. I don't really have that strong an opinion either way. Most attribution issues can be resolved with common sense. It is often better to engage with someone and explain things to them, rather than revert with a link to a policy page (the policy pages always confused me and still do - common sense always worked better for me - what is the best way to source this particular edit so that people will be happy with it and not remove it). Educating new users partly involves them reading policy pages, but also requires them to 'get it' by interacting with other editors. As regards the confusion with old links, the shortcuts were redirected to the relevant section, as you will have seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WP:V&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=111166694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WP:V&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=111166694" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Also, thinking back, I remember the concept of the three core policies being very easy to grasp. I would have been more confused if I'd arrived here and found the current set-up, so on balance I'm finding myself agreeing with what you are doing here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo, I have to take issue with your statement: "This radical change was made without any consensus at all. If people really want this, then they need to make a serious effort to get consensus, not just declare victory and make the changes"... The idea behind this merger was raised on all of the relevant policy and guideline pages quite a while ago... and was heatedly debated for a LONG time. As someone who regularly worked on the old RS page, and who originally opposed this idea, I was aware of it for several months before the merger actually took place. It was due to the extensive discussion and consensus building involved that I came around to supporting it. LOTS of people participated in creating this, and I feel that the result is indeed a reflection of consensus. There is not unanimity about the merger... but consensus does not require unanimity. Finally, if we reverted back to having three seperate policies we end up facing the same issue we have before the merger...

<dd>That's all well and good, but as someone who watched and checked the WP:NOR page almost daily for 6 months preceeding the supposed "consensus merger" I <b>never</b> was made aware that a new policy was being proposed. Now to be fair, I can sometimes be oblivious, but I would not overlook something like, say, a notice that there is a proposed policy merge in giant letters at the top of WP:V and WP:NOR. Not making it painfully and blatantly clear to everyone who even came <i>near</i> the WP:NOR and WP:V pages that a merger had been proposed was something I never would have expected, as is how the WP:RS guideline was suddenly elevated to policy status when the merge happened. I completely agree with Jimbo here: (not that my opinion exactly has much weight, but what the hell) the only reason this merger got so far is because a number of admins said "this is how it's going to be," and it's really hard for us common folk to find the nerve to go toe to toe with people who can ban you for "disrupting a policy page." -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 21:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sure this was a good faith discussion/"decision". But I think special care is needed changing policy structure in this way. All three of the talk pages gets endlessly clogged up with "what about this case" help type questions and are hard pages to watch continually "just in case" something radical is being cooked up. I think the change has made it worse and that given the importance there wasn't enough discussion/consensus. I was also bothered by the merger removing the archived discussions which are the best place to point people who ask help type guidance. HOWEVER there is a problem on WP that there is so much discussion if we all tracked everything none of us would write any articles let alone live...perhaps there needs to be some page somewhere where "important policy changes" get presented as green pages (in UK gov terminology) so everyone sees them when they are formulated without having to watch everywhere for the next bolt of lightening. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 16:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must also mention the defensive stance of some professional "policymakers", who probably have a special mindset to resist any changes. This is probably good (stability), but my several attempts at several times were rejected by the arguments which were basically "we don't like it". Please note that I was not even told that these issues were discussed before (they were not. I can read thank you). I suspect I was not alone who was brickwalled, so I strongly disagree that it was "consensus" and I would strongly recommend to change the attitude of "professional policymakers" to casual contributors treated as nuisance (that was my feeling). Please dont' read this as whining; I have a thick skin. I am worried that such an attitude prevents from expanding the circle of policymakers beyound tough and seasoned wikilawyers and thus narrows the set of points of view and moves away from true consensus. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am neutral about whether merging policies is appropriate, but I am not pleased that we are back to saying "Verifiability" when we really mean "can be found in a reliable source" and saying "Original research" when we really mean "can't be found in a reliable source".

<p>Okay, my extremely harebrained, tired-at-this-point-of-the-evening comment is simple: Duh, Verifiability and NOR polices <i>are</i> the same. NOR is essentially a corollary, an illustration, or a flipside, of what Verifiability boils down to: If we demand Verifiability through sources, then <i>by definition</i> we cannot have Original Research, which has no sources at all. If you <i>really</i> think about it, WP:NOR has no reason to exist at all, except to practically illustrate a special case of WP:V that will crop up a lot, and <i>has</i> cropped up a lot. Obviously the policies should illustrate special cases too (Just about every legislation has laws on "generally you shouldn't harm other people physically" and "don't you dare to go around killing people"), but whether we need a separate policy, that's another discussion at another time.<br />
Personally, I don't see the existence of WP:NOR and WP:V <i>alongside</i> WP:ATT a problem, however; if we have subarticles in the main namespace, who says we can't have "subpolicies" in the project namespace? Perhaps we could label WP:NOR and WP:V with a new template that says stuff like <i>"This page documents a <b>subpolicy</b> of an official Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Attribution</a>, and contains further discussion on the specific details of that policy."</i> I think that was more like the <i>idea</i> of the original WP:ATT merger, and Jimbo just got mad because something was marked <i>superseded</i> with a giant red X. *sigh* Please don't flame me. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wwwwolf wrote "Duh, Verifiability and NOR polices <i>are</i> the same." I'd say they are both right, depending on your point of view. If you use the terms as they are often used in Wikipedia, they are orthagonal: that which is not verifiable is original research. But in the world at large, verifiable is that which can be confirmed by any means, including interviews, travel, scientific experiment, and reliable publications. Original research is the creation of knowledge which has not been previously recorded anywhere. Not only that, original research is conducted by a researcher, and it is not original research to quote work that was conducted by another person. Wikipedia consistently disregards the distinction between an editor conducting original research, and an editor quoting original research conducted by someone else. Just because both instances, under some conditions, may not be appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia articles does not mean they are the same thing. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:43, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure you can hold both WP:V and WP:NOR up and look at them seperately, but you can also hold them up together and see how they overlap and affect each other. It was this overlap that eventually caused me to support this merger. With two (three, if you count WP:RS - which while technically only a guideline, was quoted by the community as if it were policy) policies covering overlaping areas, it was very easy for them to conflict. The editors contributing to WP:V could reach a consensus on how that guideline should be worded or applied in a given situation, only to find that the editors contributing to WP:NOR had reached a very different consensus on a similar situation. We have enough problems agreeing on Policy, we do not need to be having the argument on disparate pages. With only one policy, we get everything discussed in one location. Hell, I would actually take this merger a step further... I think we should Roll WP:NPOV in with these... and have one single all inclusive POLICY... We could call it "Wikipedia:Core policy". <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I think this points the way directly towards what is wrong with this. We might as well have a single policy for everything, and just call it "WP:write an encyclopedia". But there is a reason to have different policy pages, and a reason not to wrap everything into one big page. It is of course useful and instructive to compare these pages, and I am all for that. I really like the idea of a page which does that. But that does not imply that we should deprecate the old policies, which emerged organically for good reasons over many years, without a much more formal process to implement the change. Fortunately, so far, the merger has not resulted in a degradation of the conceptual separation. But putting different sorts of policies on the same page is bound to do that.</dd>

<dd>Jimbo, I can see that you aware that ATT is simply a merger WP:V and WP:NOR. But please note that WP:RS was never policy and most certainly did not have community consensus to remain as a guideline (check the history of that page). The effort we made over the last five months was to consolidate into a simple formulation the principles of NOR and V <i>without changing well established policy</i>. How do we evaluate consensus? by openly discussing a proposal over an extended period of time, seeking the involvement of as many editors as are willing, by engaging others via the En-Wiki mailing list, ad by moving slowly. We did all of that, and more. So, my question to you is: What did we miss to warrant an assessment of "I do not think we have consensus here"? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 20:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi... I would disagree with you on whether there was or was not consensus for the old WP:RS... Yes, there was a lot of disagreement over individual sections of WP:RS and how they should be worded (not dissimilar to certain sections of this Policy) ... but the idea behind <i>having</i> WP:RS was certainly consensus. It was a guideline that was quoted so often that it had an impact of a Policy. That said... I think this policy incorporates so much of what was said in WP:RS that it serves the same purpose. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't always agree with the ideas Jimbo has, but he's convinced me as well that this merge isn't the best idea. While I had no major objections at first, I was a bit reluctant about the merge. At first I thought it was just a reaction to the change itself, but now I have a little bit more faith in my reservations about the merge. I was also worried that this might not be getting enough attention, even with the advertising that had been done. It's really easy to be a dedicated editor who edits daily and still miss something big.</p>
<p>So maybe we can keep this page as an alternative intro or something to that extent, but I find myself agreeing with the concerns Jimbo has brought up. I know there's going to be a straw poll and some more structured discussion about this later on, but I just wanted to show my support for continuing discussion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I very much support a straw poll. In the meantime, after an excellent discussion with SlimVirgin, we hammered out a compromise until we can have a fuller discussion. What the pages say now is that WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those. My big beef with this merger is that we often need to send people to a page like WP:NOR which explains in a rich and persuasive way what the policy is about and why it is a good idea. This involves sometimes saying things which overlap with parts of WP:V. (They are not the same idea!) The combined page provides a handy way to keep policy consistent and have a tight presentation of what policy actually is. The separate pages can be more detailed and understandable.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 21:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

"Super" policy pages may have sections on each relevant matter but the talk pages are a dogs breakfast.

When they overlap a lot, and a merger is not thought suitable for whatever reason, is it not possible to have the talk pages merged? Or would that be too confusing. What I was thinking is that the talk page for <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> could also be the talk page for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? Also, regarding overlapping policies in general, Jimbo, are you aware of <a href="../../../l/a/p/WP%7ELAP_2025.html" title="WP:LAP">WP:LAP</a>? If more policy streamlining is going to happen, that might be a good place to advertise. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that would be unbearably confusing. The few places I see this (e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template_talk%7ERef_harv_d507.html" title="Template talk:Ref harv">Template talk:Ref harv</a>) I can see what the rationale was, but it is still confusing and jarring.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">It wasn't a proper process for a major policy change.</span></h3>
<p>User Jimbo Wales, I'm really glad to see your note: another user chiming in on the side of criticizing the action, which some editors tried to carry out, of merging longstanding policy pages.</p>
<p>My main concerns are that I'm strongly against some of the wording in this new, proposed policy, and that there was not a proper procedure followed for a major change in policy such as this proposed merge.</p>
<p>The discussion was not wide enough. Because there was no merge tag on, for example, Wikipedia:Verifiability during the months of development of Wikipedia:Attribution, many people who should have been included in the discussion were not aware of it and were not included.</p>
<p>In spite of the narrower scope of discussion, no proper consensus was ever achieved. People claimed that "there was consensus", but it's hard to determine what, if anything, was meant by that. Apparently it didn't mean that there were no objections; it didn't mean that there were no strong objections; it didn't mean that all the objections had been discussed; it didn't mean that the people objecting "consented" to the new wording; it didn't mean that there was any poll to count the number of people objecting or the number supporting the new wording; it didn't mean that the consensus wording was developed by allowing people to freely revert the wording if they didn't like it. Did it mean anything?</p>
<p>What actually happened was that objections were expressed; there was little or no in-depth discussion of the objections (at least one question was left completely unanswered, for example), and it was declared that "there is consensus" even though there were some disagreements. (See the "It doesn't look to me as if there was a consensus." section on this talk page for a list of some objections that were raised shortly before "consensus" was declared.)</p>
<p>Consensus is supposed to mean that disagreements are identified and recognized; there is discussion of the disagreements; there are attempts at compromise or at finding solutions that satisfy everyone; and finally that those who disagree are asked for their "consent" to proceed in spite of their objections. This didn't happen, even among those who were involved in the discussion.</p>
<p>There was a merge tag on Wikipedia:Verifiability for only about 8 days, I think. That's far too short a time period. People need time to notice the merge tag, and to go through the long archives of discussion to see whether their concerns have already been discussed, before formulating a response. Even ordinary article pages are suppposed to have merge tags for 2 weeks, I think. Policy pages need a much slower process.</p>
<p>I will still need more time, if it is decided to keep the new page, to think over various parts of the new page, compare it to the older pages and see whether there's anything I'd like to contribute, comment on or object to. However, I think the original purpose of the merge was to reduce the number of pages, so if the other pages are kept as user Jimbo Wales suggests (and he has a good point about the meaning of links to the various pages), then perhaps it makes more sense to demote Wikipedia:Attribution to historical interest. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 17:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I removed the section about the lawsuit as being (quite blatantly) original research of the sort that Wikipedia must avoid. This is actually an excellent example of what is wrong with original research in Wikipedia -- by drawing selectively on sources, the section gave an impression that is significantly at odds with the views of relevant parties to the dispute, so that WP:NPOV was badly violated.</i></dd>

<p>This seems to conflict with the idea of "original research" that is provided here. Citing primary sources <i>without drawing novel conclusions from the sources</i> isn't OR.

<dd>Guettarda, perhaps you misunderstood me because I was not clear. The issue is that original conclusions were being drawn. The result was a synthesis of facts that was significantly objected to by the subject of the biography. This is what is wrong with original research.

<dd>Citing primary sources needs to be done <i>with care</i>. Selective citing can be misleading. Citing sources is no good if you don't present a balanced picture. That, at the end of the day, is what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is about - presenting a balanced picture. The sources allow verifiability, but the editorial decisions about what weight to give each part of an article determines the <i>balance</i> of an article. Personally, despite the punchiness of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, the phrasing 'neutral point of view' can be extremely misleading, as people think it means being neutral, when in fact it means presenting all relevant points of view with the appropriate weighting. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is what is being done with the primary sources, not the sources themselves. The problem is that too often editors draw (or strongly imply) a conclusion based upon primary sources. That is clearly wrong. However, I don't think we can completely ban primary sources. In some cases (such as articles relating to Medieval history) they are the best and most reliable sources we have. They can also often be used reliably (and appropriately) as citations to back statements of opinion. The issue is agendas not sources. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 16:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Summaries of legal cases seem to be prone to selective quoting. I've seen a few articles which quoted parts of testimony without mentioning the rebuttal, nor the judge's instruction clarifying what parts of the testimony were relevant to which parts of the case. Arguments in a filing may not be found acceptable in court. If possible, better to use a case summary from a law journal. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 16:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh Christ, I might have known it was bloody Langan again - that man has attracted more vanity and POV-pushing edits than any ten other articles combined, I reckon. Anyway, I for one did not take part in the supposed ocnsensus to merge the three here because last time I looked there were a lot of people saying "nice in theory, but..." and it looked set to die a death, so I left it at that. Wherever the discussion was advertised, I did not see it. I saw the announcement but never thought to check the claim that it was based on consensus. I don't think having <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> separate is at all problematic, and if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> were to be merged back into an attribution guideline which referenced slimmed-down versions of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, wich lost all the examples in the process, I'd think Jimbo would be happy enough.

<p>The section is question seems to fairly reflect the sources, so no, it wasn't that there were novel conclusions drawn from the sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It was done upside down</span></h2>
<p>I looked into talk archives of the page and its history and I have to express an opinion it was done upside down from the very beginning. In my strong opinion the priorities of the "core principles" are out of logic.</p>
<p>The very groundlaying principle (judging by its title, not content) is <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b>. Wikipedia's <b>goal</b> is <b>not</b> to attribute everything to someone, <b>not</b> to ban kooks, <b>not</b> to straighten out POV-pushers. Its goal is to <b>deliver sound information</b> (I am not saying "correct information"; this was already discussed quite extensively: wikipedia itself cannot guarantee truth, strange as it sounds).</p>
<p>Now, what is the source of sound information? It is agreed that wikipedians are not. It is agreed that the only way to ensure this in wikipedia is by citing reliable sources. Hence <b><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is #2</b>. Yes I know it is a guideline now. It must be done into policy. Specifically, there should be 3 parts in it: (1) definition of RS, (2) list of types of sources 100% identifiable as reliable and (3) a procedure to identify exceptions and possible expansions of the RS types.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are the <b>implementation</b> and <b>corollary</b> respectively from the core 2 principles.</p>
<p>Before going any further, let's start from reaching the consensus about what is <b>at the very core</b>. I may be wrong in my opinion expressed above, but IMO the talks must start thusly. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. As I said above in a bit edit-conflicty way, WP:NOR is definitely a corollary of WP:V: If we demand sources, you can't publish sourceless research here. The giant big problem with having V/NOR/RS instead of just ATT is that we shouldn't really need to say the exact same thing in three different ways. But we <i>could</i> say it, just in case someone is confused, and refer to WP:ATT as the practical guide. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but the premise remains that the merger was discussed for over 5 months, and has wide support. Jimbo's comment does not detract from that.

<dd>If it's worth anything, I was at least as active as mikkalai during that time period, and was rather blindsided by the whole merger until essentially right before it.

<dd>I'm in "violent agreement" with that.

<p>And 'neutrality' is at the heart of the problem some people have with the phrase "NPOV". A balanced article is not the same as a neutral article. A neutral article avoids coming down on one side or the other. A balanced article uses reliable sources and editorial judgement to present relevant sides to an issue in the correct proportion and without undue weight. Sometimes that involves giving more weight to someone's criticism or rejection of something, and that can't be described as neutral. In other words, to get closer to real examples instead of generalisations, an article should present the 'mainstream' viewpoint, and the 'fringe' viewpoints would be present only as asides or footnotes. Due weight, following editorial judgement. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone had that intent. Indeed, the proponents of this seem surprised that so many people were caught off guard by this. This is the result of Wikipedia being extremely large now. I think that the work done was valuable: my objection is primarily to the merger, not to the policy work itself. My own view is that WP:ATT as a consolidated and authoritative policy page can serve to ensure policy consistency, but that eliminating the separate explanatory pages of what are, in fact, different ideas, is not a good idea. I do not agree with those who take a strong reductionist position that all of these policies are really the same thing... at least not unless we are speaking in a very abstract way that all of our policies amount to "be good and do good work".--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 05:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There seems to be an undercurrent of "I know what is right for Wikipedia and so do these other proponents, and we're just going to be recklessly bold and do it, and everyone else can go soak their heads" going on. The procedures for merging two or more pages are really, really simple, but weren't followed here, making it hard for me and some others here to say "oh, well, I guess it was just an oversight." The "surprise" that you note is possibly genuine but difficult to credit. How hard it is to slap a template on four pages? All that said, I don't disagree with "WP:ATT as a consolidated and authoritative policy page can serve to ensure policy consistency..."; I just disagree with the methods used to get us here. Worse could happen, I suppose; when it comes to the straw poll I won't be voting for a total revert. I just hope that my grumbles are understood and not dismissed as random noise.

<li>This is where it starts to go wrong. Wikipedia should aim to be reliable and accurate, and verifiability is the mechanism for ensuring that. Wikipedia is not Wikiquote, and attributing everything is not how Wikipedia got to where it is.

<p>Concerning point 4, the word "threshold": this is a good word, because it indicates that being attributable to a reliable source is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement.

<li>Please allow me to disagree. The word "threshold" is applied to a point within some gradual change of "something one". Like, "age threshold" or, say, within our context the threshold is the number of violated policies (attribution+"undue weight" is stil OK, but attrib+weight+"notability" violated together is a no-no, so the "threshold is 2", kinda <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_strike_rule.html" title="Three strike rule">three strike rule</a>).

There is a huge amount of articles created in early days of wikipedia when there was no such drive for attribution, and now they are under the threat of AfD or butchering by overzealous purists. In early policies I remember there was something about <i>"due diligence"</i> of fact checking before deletion. After all, this is a collaborative effort.

<dl>
<dd>Wrong. <b>Everything must be attributed</b>. I may only guess that the author wanted to say that "not every sentence must be supplied with an inline reference". It is quite possible that some text is based on some thick book, possibly not readily available. It is quite natural that someone at the first glance may question some phrases. To preclude a possible waste of time on discussions, it does make sense to provide <b>inline refs</b> "for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged" <b>in addition to</b> the corresponding entry in the "References" section.
<dl>
<dd>This point, and the above one, are more issues of editing practices. We don't want to discourage laissez-faire contributions from anon contributors, which dedicated long-term editors can later tidy up (wikify, format, correct layout, copyedit, and, gasp, attribute). We want to emphasise attribution without forcing people to include it everytime they write something. It is terribly tempting to write something and then leave it for someone else to tidy up. "Oh, no-one will challenge that. I'll come back and add some attributions later if anyone raises any objections". Of course, the right way to think about it is "If I could come back in 100 years time, would what I wrote still be here? Hmm. I'd better add some attributions if I want my contributions to be of any lasting value, and not merely swept out with the next bout of spring-cleaning." Personally, I agree, we should just make the rule that everything must be attributed, and then leave it unwritten that in reality people do add unattributed stuff that is only attributed and tidied up much later. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One of the better lines. Though I would say "reliable sources are required for attributed quotations and for ..." Attribution is simply X said "Y", and it is the source that matters. But if something is unlikely to be challenged because it is both accurate and uncontroversial then sources are less relevant. Take this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vysochanski%C3%AF-Petunin_inequality&amp;diff=6106578&amp;oldid=2499672" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vysochanski%C3%AF-Petunin_inequality&amp;diff=6106578&amp;oldid=2499672" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - I had never heard of the <a href="../../../v/y/s/Vysochanski%C3%AF-Petunin_inequality_3a90.html" title="Vysochanskiï-Petunin inequality">Vysochanskiï-Petunin inequality</a> as such before that date, but I would have changed 5/9 to 4/9 and 0.062 to 0.04938 even without a source simply because it was wrong. On the other hand the √(8/3) comes from the source (which took some time to find). If the article had required a source before it was written nobody would have written it.

<dd>Mikka wrote "a valid attribution would be one big thick book in the "References" section." This is very true, and I'm sure some inappropriate fact templates have been slapped on sentences because the person placing the template didn't have, or didn't read, the general references provided in the References section. At the same time, if one is writing an article on an advanced topic, such as integrated circuits, one might not feel the need to find a book on high-school level basic electricity to back up a fact that was too elementary to be mentioned in the integrated circuit texts. Such a basic fact would be attributable, but not attributed.--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 03:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I read the policy, there is no need to attribute the elementary, uncontroversial fact, neither with a footnote, nor with a general reference, until such time as it is challenged. I would also argue that not only is that what the policy says, but that is what the policy should say, because attributing incidental facts that readers of the article probably know already is mere clutter, and does not benefit the reader. (By the way, V = IR cos Phi is at least freshman electrical engineering, not high school, and does not come up much in integrated circuits, since they operate on DC rather than AC power.) --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 03:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Others may consider the term 'finger' to apply only to those four digits that are medial to the thumb, leading to the conclusion that humans have four fingers on each hand,</i>" while <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">Decimal</a> states "<i>It is the most widely used numeral system, perhaps because humans have four fingers and a thumb on each hand, giving a total of ten digits over both hands.</i>". Although extraordinarily rudimentary facts like that might not need refs <i>by themselves</i>, it's the act of putting it into context where refs matter. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 18:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Funny that my examples here hit the nail of the policy. After reading the above text in the article, I double-checked <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/finger" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/finger" rel="nofollow">with dictionaries</a>, and this is <b>not</b> what they say. The dictionaries say something like "One of the five digits of the hand, especially one other than the thumb." or "one of the five end parts of the hand, sometimes excluding the thumb". the key difference is that dictionaries say that in <b>certain contexts</b> (I guess when the distinction is important) we have 8 fingers, in others we have 10. A quick google check seems to confirm: when I want to play guitar, I have 4 fingers, but when I learn typing I have all 10 of them. In other words, the "Some English speakers" text smacks someone's interpretation, rather than fact. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 20:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pseudologic. Nothing is "because" here. Compare: "because the policies are complementary (i.e., cover complementary, i.e., different aspects)", they may be considered independently." Sounds equally plausible.

<dd>You're using an odd definition of "complementary" there. The Compact Oxford uses "combining so as to form a complete whole or to enhance each other". "Because the policies combine so as to form a complete whole, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another" makes perfect sense to me, and is totally logical IMO. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nothing is odd. "to complement" means to "add what is mising" ... "is often applied to putting together two things, each of which supplies what is lacking in the other, to make a complete whole: " (Random House <b>Unabridged</b> Dictionary). Further, what "complete whole" they represent? If you are thinking about this neat "two core content policies" phrase, there is also a bunch of non-core but just as important content policies, such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The sentence sounds plausible, becase the conclusion part ("should not.. in isolation") is basically correct. There is a poorly known law of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_logic.html" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a> which basically says that the statement "if all sheep are black then the Earth rotates around the Sun" is <b>true</b>. But surely you would not use such a sentence to defend Copernicus. In our case a truly cause-and-effect phrase would be something like this: "Because the policies cover different aspects of the same topic, i.e., of the content of wikipedia, they should not ...etc.", the key point here being "of the same topic", rather than an accidental fact that there are only two of policies (under a certain agreement of counting), so that they happen to complement each other. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 16:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To my knowledge, there is no real dispute about the core of what actual policy says. WP:ATT is intended to merely include everything that was in WP:V and WP:NOR, and the proponents of the merge did not suggest that it was part of a policy change. This is really about what is the best way to both (a) present the policy in a coherent fashion and (b) keep the policy concise and self-consistent.

<dd>This is what Jimbo wrote about the status of ATT: "What the pages say now is that WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those. My big beef with this merger is that we often need to send people to a page like WP:NOR which explains in a rich and persuasive way what the policy is about and why it is a good idea. This involves sometimes saying things which overlap with parts of WP:V. (They are not the same idea!) The combined page provides a handy way to keep policy consistent and have a tight presentation of what policy actually is. The separate pages can be more detailed and understandable."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm happy with that. One of the problems was the tag that was added to V and NOR saying they had been "superseded," and Jimbo felt this implied deprecation. He would like the pages to remain as explanatory texts of the separable concepts (and they are indeed separable), so that people who want a fuller explanation of them can go to those pages. This is the kind of creative compromise that's very welcome, in my view. There's no question of those concepts or pages being downgraded in any way. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:25, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not particularily interested in shaping policy or whatever, I'm just a rank-and-file editor that really needs these policies to be clear and concise. The text as it was would be quite fine if there weren't these questions still floating about the relations of the policies to eachother, or if there wasn't an obvious mismatch like I'd pointed out above. The new wording is better, so thanks for that. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 02:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are three fundamental, distinct, but interconnected doctrines: verifiability, NOR, and NPOV. Of course, "doctrine" has bad connotations, so we tend to call them "policies". Whether they need to be explained in three separate policy <b>pages</b>, or two, or just one (called "core policies" or something) or whether we indeed need more than three for some reason, is a secondary matter. There are three policies, however many documents are needed to describe them well. Personally, I think that one policy per document is least confusing and best reflects historical continuity, but a single document that summarises them all and explains how they connect, and points to the others for more detail, would certainly not hurt. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should add that there is no doctrine (or fundamental content policy) of "attribution". We often have to attribute for the purpose of providing verification or to help avoid original research, but attribution itself is not a fundamental content policy.

<dd>I would argue that WP:ATT is more maintainable, but at the price of being a significantly <b>worse</b> nomenclature. While policies like WP:V and WP:NOR are interrelated (as all of reality is interrelated), they are significantly different ideas and radical reductionists who see them as really being the same thing are, in my view, badly mistaken. When I say that something is original research, and when I say that something is unverifiable, I mean different things by those statements, as I am focusing on a different kind of deviation from good editing. WP:V and WP:NOR serve a valuable function in focusing on different sorts of things which come up. Reducing all policy to one thing is just not going to be helpful, since not everything is the same thing.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 05:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>* I begin with the idea that Wikipedia policy should help resolve and avoid conflicts among editors on what should appear on Wikipedia pages. But the current <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution</a> page does not help resolve the problems--because "attribution" is simply not the problem. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=116574162&amp;oldid=116574040#It_was_done_upside_down" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=116574162&amp;oldid=116574040#It_was_done_upside_down" rel="nofollow">Mikka says above</a>, the real controversies among opinionated editors are over "verifiability." For example, the scientists quite correctly keep cutting out from the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> page the perfectly-well attributed NPOV summaries of what reliable sources have said about evolution--if those assertions have no "verifiability." Burying and hiding the real problem of "verifiability" inside an "attribution" page gets us nowhere. Instead of running from the problems of "verifiability," we should be focusing our attention on clarifying the murky and self-contradictory text of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability policy page</a>. Attribution is merely one contributing factor to "verifiability." Weighting the sections of a Wikipedia page to favor realistically the views of the more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> is a wholly independent problem from "attribution" and should be dealt with separately. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not allowing original research</a> done by assembling perfectly-good attributions that support the editor's pet theory is a very different problem among editors and requires explanations quite different from "attribution." And the merger of any of these policies into the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution page</a> is simply a bad idea gone wrong--because the merger makes it more difficult to describe reasonable standards by which we Wikipedia editors can resolve and avoid the conflicts among us.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question about when to attribute, and proposed change...</span></h2>
<p>For me, it has always seemed that attribution of sources (henceforth: "referencing") serves 2 purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To back up that the claim is verifiably true, as reported in reliable sources.</li>
<li>To direct people to the source of the information, for the sake of further research.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, the phrase in the policy that is giving me trouble is "Editors should provide attribution for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged..." This seems to me to be a <b>bare minimum</b> standard, and not the goal for an article that is fully referenced. Later in the policy, it states "Material added to articles must be directly and explicitly supported by the cited sources." This seems in conflict with the bare minimum. To me, it seems that the "challenged or likely to be challenged" statement is being used as a crutch to avoid having to improve articles to the highest standards. Look at it another way: Wikipedia (like all encyclopedias) should only be a starting point for research, or as a casual source of information. If I make a statement like "The Foo Tower is 1475 meters tall", it is not likely to be challenged, and so one might think they don't need to reference it. However, lets say I was doing research on Foo Tower. Using wikipedia as a starting point, I would want to go to the original source of that information, for a variety of reasons. Lacking a reference, however, I cannot do that. From another point: referencing of this point should be easy. If you are reading a book/journal/website/whatever that says "Foo Tower is 1475 meters tall" why NOT reference the source? True, the statement is unlikely to be controversial, and thus does not warrent removal from the article, but in the case where articles are being improved to the highest standards (such as GA, FA, A-Class, etc. etc.) there is no compelling reason to NOT add the reference beyond "I don't feel like it". To sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wording of the policy needs to be changed to reflect that while controversial statements need to be cited or removed, even non-controversial assertions of fact should be ideally referenced.</li>
<li>Referencing serves more purpose than merely used to back up controversial statements. Chief among these is since wikipedia is a Tertiary Source, it should direct people to the Secondary Sources it uses so as to be more useful as a research vehicle.</li>
<li>Excellence should be the end goal of all Wikipedia articles, not just competence. Official policy should reflect that Wikipedia as a venture strives for that excellence in all of its articles. To recognize minimum standards is one thing, but one must also note that all articles should have as their goal the ideal standard. Referencing controversial statements is the bare minimum. Referencing all assertions of fact should be the ideal standard.</li>
<li>The best practice is to <b>write from sources</b> rather than memory. If I am looking at a source that has information I wish to add to wikipedia, there is no compelling reason for me to intentionally avoid citing that source. If the information being added isn't coming from another source, it probably shouldn't be added.</li>
<li>I understand that statements are added to articles with the expectation that they will be referenced later(I myself do this often), especially where an assertion of fact is so well referenced that it is commonly accepted. We should not confuse a practice done as an expedient when building an article with the final goal of the article. Our goal should always be full referencing, and to avoid mentioning that in the policy encourages mediocrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments anyone? I would like to see what others think, and ultimately, if there is consensus, to ammend the policy in a way that encourages excellence rather than mere competence. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 05:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we can get too fixated on reading doctrines such as verifiability in a literal way. There are limits to how much we can or should reference every single uncontroversial factual claim. If I write, "The Earth revolves around the Sun", or even "The Earth is the third planet from the Sun", in some context where it is necessary to make that statement, there is no need to cite an astronomy text for it, or to attribute it to someone as if it were a controversial viewpoint. The key is to explain our fundamental doctrines - verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view - in such a way that people will understand their intention and spirit, why we need them, and how they fit together - and will be likely to apply them according to their original intention and spirit. That means neither applying them in such a literal way that it becomes impossible to do simple things ("According to Copernicus, Galileo and others, the Earth revolves around the Sun") nor finding ways of reading their wording narrowly in order to evade their intent. No policy wording will be perfect at achieving these outcomes, but that's life. Good sense must always be applied. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It depends on the article. If you are writing an article on a modern astronomical theory unrelated to Copernicus's theory, and you mention, <i>in passing</i>, that the Earth orbits the Sun (revolves has another meaning in astronomy, by the way), then just linking out to the Copernicus article and other relevant articles is enough. But in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocentric_theory.html" title="Geocentric theory">geocentric theory</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heliocentric_theory.html" title="Heliocentric theory">heliocentric theory</a> articles, stuff about the history of the science - who published what and when, should be assidously sourced. Again, it is common sense really. Third planet from the Sun will be uncontroversial in most articles, but for some articles it will be a central point, such as the historical articles where the Sun is considered a 'planet' and the Earth was considered the centre of the universe. Apples and oranges, really. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>For a further point, take a simple, non-controversial statement like: "The atomic weight of Carbon is 12.011 g/mol." Does this need attribution? At first glance, it is likely to be uncontroversial, so no. However, we have another problem: there are multiple references that give atomic weights, and depending on the method used to calulate them, they do not neccessarily agree. Thus, it is important to say <i>according to whom</i>... Nearly every number, date, or other data reported in an article beyond the rediculously plain (such as the Earth's location in the solar system) is the work of someone who calculated or deduced it, and thus should be attributed. Attributing to the original source of the data isn't required (or even desirable) but it should be attributed to a reliable secondary source. Also, statements that are plainly obvious in one field of knowledge are not neccessarily so to the non-expert. We should consider referencing as more than just a means of avoiding controversy, again, it should be more about aiding research and directing readers to more indepth sources of information. Of a bigger problem is that asking if something <i>needs</i> to be referenced is really asking two questions:
<ul>
<li>If this statement is not referenced, should it be removed?</li>
<li>If this statement is not referenced, does it prevent the article from being considered high quality (Featured, A-Class, or whatever)?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Why does this policy only acknowledge one of these two, quite valid, questions?

<p>Given the merge was pretty much canceled for now, this page should not be considered policy because that gives us one additional (and divergent) page to deal with.

<dd>Hmmm, I don't think WP:ATT as policy was canceled, only the redirects of WP:V and WP:NOR into this. And both of those explain that this one is canonical. It seems unnecessary to make this change, as the status quo doesn't seem to be problematic in any obvious way.

<dd>The problem lies in policies that overlap and possibly become divergent. It confuses people, especially those people who need to read our policies. It may give people the impression that attributability is something very different from verifiability, when in fact it is not. If all are open to editing, eventually part of WP:ATT will contradict WP:V, leading to further confusion. Note that WP:ATT is not and never was a new policy; it was an attempted merge of existing policies. Unoding the merge obviates the need for this page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As my lukewarms response shows, I don't feel strongly and can live with either, but there already seems to be a thought around that "no original research" and "verifiability" are somehow the same thing, or parts of some underlying, more fundamental thing (which I think is seriously misleading). Having the page in its current form and considered canonical tends to encourage that, IMHO. But I'm a late player to have stumbled across this, by way of a different debate, so I'll defer to others. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arriving (back) at this late and trying to follow your posts, could I just ask for a clarification, Jimbo: you agree that this page is canonical now? Your first posts seem to say not, but now you suggest yes. When the merge idea was at the decision phase there was a lot of discussion about how to broadcast it; it seemed to me inevitable that with a 1000+ admins and tens of thousands editors in general, large numbers were not going to hear about it. But at the same time it <i>was</i> broadcast as best as people were able. Put another way, someone was always bound to be surprised, but what could we do given the size of this place?</dd>

<dd>I don't know if Jimbo will read my comment, but I'd just like to say that although it must feel as if Wikipedia has been around for ages, it is actually in its infancy. Some very clever people have been trying to make sure that the policy information is presented more cleanly and briefly and that ingrained difficulties (like that contained in the word "verifiable" and the duplications and obfuscations in the "Reliable Sources" page) are ironed out in this early stage of Wikipedia's evolution. Many organisations would pay a fortune (to Slim Virgin and a few other visionary thinkers behind this page who have a rare capacity to think conceptually and in detail across all the policies) to have their policies streamlined in the way that has been done here for free. Consensus will catch up in the end, I am sure. In my opinion a radical improvement—not in policy but in its expression and comprehensibility—has been achieved on behalf of Wikipedia by the Attribution page. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 12:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And to make it on topic, I agree with the point above that the part where it says "Together with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, the two determine the type and quality of material" but for a different reason. By referring to only the two, it ignores the fact that BLP also determines the type of information. To be fair, we do mention BLP in this policy so provided we emphasise enough that BLP is a consideration, I guess it's okay. I've tried to improve this by mentioning privacy. Privacy is an important, additional consideration which doesn't really have much to do with sourcing (obviously we need good sources) or negative material (someone's birthday or kids names is not usually negative material). <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Although everything in Wikipedia must be attributable, in practice not all material is attributed. Editors should provide attribution for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i> The burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material. If an article topic has no reliable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(My emphasis) As well as the FAQ entry that says that the <i>preferred way</i> to deal with the lack of sourcing is to try to provide sources, tag the problematic parts, and only delete as the last resort.</p>
<p>The way I saw it, the old WP:V policy was used as a cop-out: "I want this thing deleted. Oh, looks like this is like 90% of all Wikipedia articles, devoid of sources. That ought to do it. What? <i>I</i> don't need to look for sources anyway, that's the <i>author's</i> job! I'm just the guy who deletes stuff!" It's frustrating when people bring articles to AfD just because they don't have sources! I've seen articles survive AfDs because the sources were handed to the people on silver platter, then a bit later the nominator says "funny that the sources haven't been added to the article"! Oh, please have a nice cup of {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}, the people <i>did</i> already provide the sources!</p>

<dd>Agreed, to a point. The nominator <i>should</i> try to find sources, but that's out of courtesy so that people don't have to waste their time arguing against deletion when there were plenty of sources readily available. It's still the authors' responsibility to <i>find</i> sources, not the nominator's responsibility to prove that they <i>can't</i>. Because it's nearly impossible to prove that there are no sources for something, which doesn't mean we should keep everything on the grounds that there might be sources. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 14:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not having problem with stuff that <i>can't</i> be sourced; I'm more of having problem with people who say "well, I spent whole two minutes on this AfD nomination, I got 1,500,000 Google hits, but they're all probably worthless anyway.

<dd>On the other hand... at some point we have to draw the line ... I frequently surf around and find articles with no sources. If I know nothing about the topic, I can not add anything substantive to the article, and I usually don't know where to begin looking for reliable sources. My usual practice is to tag the article with an {{unreferenced}} tag and come back in a month or so... only to find that the article <i>still</i> has no references. At that point I nominate it for deletion. This usually results in a flurry of "Keep" votes from people who like the topic and think it is worthy of keeping, and my practice is to say "OK, I will withdraw the Nomination to allow people time to find sources". I then sit back and wait another month or so... at which point I nominate it again because <i>no one bothered to actually add any sources to the article</i> once I withdrew the nom to give them time to do so. I then Repeat this process a few times until the article is either fixed (a very rare occurance) or deleted (this usually takes a few repetitions). We say... "source, source, source" but do we really mean it? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But do you really think that adding {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} to an article will help? We have tens of thousands of articles with that tag, and one more won't get it any kind of additional attention whatsoever. And AfD is a place for deleting articles, not to ask for sources. Maybe we need a new page, Wikipedia:Request for sources. One could nominate an article there, and instead of the endless "Delete, no sources!" - "No, keep! There are sources out there!" discussion, the goal of a nomination would be to actually <i>find</i> sources for a certain article, instead of discussing whether there are possibly sourced out there. If no sources can be found, AfD might be an option. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConti_fae9.html" title="User:Conti">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConti_c57c.html" title="User talk:Conti">✉</a> 18:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Wikipedia:Request for sources": I also was thinking about suggesting to complement each policy with a request page, but on the other hand, there already are categories which list artciles tagged as problematic. The solution would be to create the corresponding WikiProject with a dedicated task force which would not only bug authors of ill-fortuned articles, but proactively search for references and pinpoint the problematic places by replacing the global "unref" tag with strategically placed {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}'s. This is what I usually do when I see an underreferenced article on AfD: If I am interested in the topic enough to vote to keep, I am also attempting to salvage it. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 18:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Backlinks</span></h3>
<p>When looking into the above section, I decided to double-check, whether there are any other misdirected redirects. After clicking "what links here" I was surprized to find that the policy is linked from thousands of articles, ranging from "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chirp.html" title="Chirp">Chirp</a>" to "<a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothes_hanger.html" title="Clothes hanger">Clothes hanger</a>" to <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yello.html" title="Yello">Yello</a>, and naturally failed to do what I intended to.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to suggest an impovement that will prevent certain templates from pushing their content into "what links here"? Something similar to the "noinclude" functionality, which allows us to put templates into categories without putting the tagged articles into these categories.

<dd>"Nasty" was applied to me. While I am carring out a reasonable dialog about merits of my criticism with a number of editors in this page, yet another, smaller group started from outright dismissing my opinion on the grounds that "it was discussed for N months by well-meaning editors in good standing" without minimal comment on merits of my suggestions. I read it as a polite way of saying "Bug off, you understand nothing here. Who are you anyway?". There is quite a few literary and movie plots that incorporate an episode where a true gentleman demonstrates an uncanny ability to dip a plain guy into a pail of excrements while wearing white gloves, and I see no reason to hide racial hatred to such an attitude. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

I do have disagreements with several other wikipedians in this talk page. But they actually communicate with me as with an equal and in the essense of the issues.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Don't change the policy, please</span></h2>
<p>Someone just tried to make an edit that would have changed the NOR concept. This was never the page to do this on, and now in particular is the wrong time to try it. One of Jimbo's concerns yesterday is that the shift to ATT might have had the effect, inadvertently or otherwise, of weakening V or NOR. That was always a concern of mine too, and of most of the other regular editors to this page, and we did our best to make sure it didn't happen. Jimbo wants to make absolutely certain that the move is nailed down and closely studied, so that no inadvertent changes slipped by people's attention.</p>
<p>The NOR and V concepts are absolutely fundamental to Wikipedia. If you disagree with them, by all means discuss it, but you can't change those parts of the policy without <i>clear and unambiguous consensus</i>, which doesn't include a failure to respond on the talk page. And it especially can't be done now, because of the upcoming poll. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mikka, what I meant was that the purpose of this page was simply to merge the two policies. There was discussion early on about adding a pop culture exception, which would have been a change, but it was never fleshed out to everyone's satisfaction so it got dropped, and we went back to a very firm "no change" policy, in order to gain consensus.</dd>

<dd>The core/derivative thing is easily answered. The NOR and V concepts are core and always were. Those concepts are now explained on this policy page, ATT. Jimbo has no problem with that. What he wants, however, is for the concepts to remain distinct in people's minds, and he wants there to be a page devoted to each of them that explains and expands, so that if any editor is confused, there's somewhere for them to go and read more. In other words, Jimbo doesn't want there to be any sense in which the concepts of V and NOR become deprecated, or look as though they might have been. I'm totally in agreement with him on that point. Where I disagree with him is over the poll issue, because I think it's going to get us nowhere, but that's a separate issue to do with process. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to troll again, but my question was "What was the goal of the <b>merge</b>?", rather than "What was the goal of this <b>page</b>?" Anyway, I've found one indication: <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Archive_1_88f9.html#Clarification" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 1">here</a>: <i>"A more sensibly written and simpler replacement for WP:V, WP:NOR and WP:RS."</i>. And I see that the resulting text is indeed simpler. (On the other hand, it does miss several items of the original policies, but let us skip this issue for now). But as I see there is <b>no replacement</b>. The next question is: in what way keeping both original policies and the new, simplified yet still a very detailed text (plus a FAQ too), contributes to the overall simplification of the total wikipedia's "Code of Law" or makes the life of an editor easier or what else? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 00:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Way back when this new policy nomenclature and its associated policy page was first proposed, a concern was expressed on Jimbo's talk page about "changing policy" with regard to language in it dealing with what is here being called "a pop culture exception" and in the debates about the exact language to be used was phrased any number of different ways, none of which achieved consensus. The point of the new nomenclaure "attribution" is that it better expresses the actual behavior being asked of contrbutors and avoids confusion some people had over their personal ability to "verify" a thing as true evrsus what we needed them to do which was to provide an attribution to a reliable published source. The point of the "pop culture exception" is that it merely <b>codified existing practice</b> (and was being justified and still is justified under IAR) and thus was not new policy nut merely recognized eisting policy <i>as practiced</i>. You know descriptive instead of prescriptive. So even <i>with</i> the "pop culture exception", ATT was never about <i>new</i> policy, merely new a new and better description of existing policy as it was (and is) currently practised. Anyway, I said this way back then on Jimbo's talk page and it is not our fault if people don't pay attention or if paying attention forget. I believe nothing was done wrong in the process creating ATT and it is a mistake to add bureaucacy to fix what doesn't need fixing. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 00:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I noticed the discussion of relative merits of words "att" vs. "ver". I agree with the arguments, but disagree with solution. As I wrote elsewhere, tomorrow I will try to outline my suggestion. It will not require any major overhaul or merge, only setting the priorities and goals straight and open (after my chats here I came to believe that the suggestion will not contradict to the persuasions of the most). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 00:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Someone just tried to make an edit that would have changed the NOR concept."</p>
<p>The change I made did not change in substance the concept of NOR. It changed the definition of it in use on this page, but as this page currently disagrees in important ways with the definition at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and the definition I substituted is more similar to the one at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> I felt the changes were particularly critical in light of the fact that both pages are now policy. We cannot have these two policies disagreeing with each other over such a fundamental point as what original research is.</p>
<p>"This was never the page to do this on,"</p>
<p>Then what page should it be done on? The error is one of the phrasing on this page having diverged from the meaning set out in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which this page explicitly is not supposed to have altered.</p>
<p>"and now in particular is the wrong time to try it"</p>
<p>I disagree. Now, being a time when (a) both policies have effect, and (b) many eyes are on this policy examining it for flaws that may influence them to reject it is <i>exactly</i> the time when it is required.</p>
<p>"One of Jimbo's concerns yesterday is that the shift to ATT might have had the effect, inadvertently or otherwise, of weakening V or NOR."</p>
<p>I don't see him expressing this concern on this page. Could you point me to where he said that?</p>
<p>"That was always a concern of mine too, and of most of the other regular editors to this page, and we did our best to make sure it didn't happen."</p>
<p>In case you hadn't noticed, I'm one of those regular editors, and have mostly shared this concern. But the problem is that the current version effectively defines <i>all</i> content on Wikipedia as original research. It says "Material counts as original research if it introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea." There is no restriction of that clause to theories, methods of solution or original ideas that have not been published in a reliable source.</p>
<p>"Jimbo wants to make absolutely certain that the move is nailed down and closely studied, so that no inadvertent changes slipped by people's attention."</p>
<p>Well, one did, and the edit I made was intended to <i>fix</i> it. Please unprotect the policy so that this change (which nobody has raised any objection to) can be reinserted. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:17, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See our guidelines on the poorly named "external links" section. "Further reading" is merely a better name for the "external links" section". At least it was. Lately I've seen some people try to draw a distiction, which I believe to be a mistake.

<p>I was afraid this would happen... as soon as we made NOR, V, and RS active again people started trying to change them. This is not the time to let these policies and guideline change. People need to see things in the version they were when the merge took place to decide if they agree with it or not.

<li>There is no consensus (and never was) on the new, unqualified "not whether it is true" wording.</li>
<li>The user who protected the page (Crum375) is a party to a currently ongoing content dispute on the page (the user reverted one of my attempts to address the problem about the "not whether it is true" wording, and this issue has not yet been resolved -- see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Role of truth</a>.)

<dd>Coppertwig, if you feel anything needs to change on WP:ATT, please try to achieve consensus here first. Whether the page is protected or not will not change your ability to modify the policy, since if you don't have a wide consensus here, you'd be quickly reverted anyway. A policy page is in general not a good place to edit war, and specifically now, when we are waiting for the straw poll and the status of the component pages to stabilize, any non-consensual changes would be counterproductive and disruptive. And by the way, I am not in 'content dispute' with you - I have not decided even on the merit of your changes - my only point is that a wide consensus is needed prior to making them. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed with Crum375 that editwarring is bad, but I don't feel a need to assume (bad faith) that Coppertwig will necessarily engage in editwarring. To the extent that the new material does not have consensus (which it evidently does not), it <i>should</i> be removed for the very reasons Crum375 gives. And something should definitely be done about the Policy tag, which is confusing to everyone; I think it should probably get the Disputedpolicy tag. Open to discussion about that of course. Anyway, I don't see any justification for the page protection. Discussion here and at the Poll talk page and at the FAQ talk page appears to be happening and to be reasonably civil. A whole lot has changed in the last 2 days, so maybe give people credit that they can understand this and behave accordingly? If editwarring resumes, I think it would be a lot more proper to go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> and have a disinterested party restore the protection. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm honestly trying to avoid disputation of this sort. I don't see that it has been very useful here thus far, and tempers have been getting out of control (see for example AGF and CIVIL and bordernline NPA accusations made against me at the Poll's talk page.) I'm not entire happy about the four or five or whatever months of policy formation that have not involved enough parties. But I think the point has been made pretty clearly, and the debate is no longer "was this done properly?", it is "what do we do now?" I share your concerns that some parties have been trying too hard to exert control over what this document says. But I now also believe that enough people who feel differently than those editors do that the problem will be self-resolving. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> had a similar problem back in Nov. - Dec. 2006, but since Feb. 2007 has been in vastly better shape. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would suggest that unprotection be done after some consensus for that is reached.

<dd>"Consensus" for what though? Three editors don't make a consensus to protect. At least three editors with the same disputes with regard to recently added changes indicates that the change hasn't earned consensus yet, so it should be removed for now. As this is presently the most-disputed policy/guideline page in all of WP, marking it with Disputedpolicy seems wise. What's there's left to fight about right now? I may be missing a big dispute somewhere - this is an awfully long page - but these seem to be the issues that are presently being raised, and which aren't matters that needs to wait for the poll. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice ideas. Let's explore these ideas for a second. How can we know whether there is a "consensus"? There seem to be four different and jarring concepts of "consensus" right here in this short exchange among us. Where is the clear and coherent policy guidance that would clarify for us what "consensus" means so that we could move on--instead of having to reinvent among those who happen to be here right now what "consensus" is? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 20:42, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wholeheartedly agree with SMcCandlish on this one, and I'm even going to take it a step further: protecting this page in its current form is having a vastly detrimental and at the very least disruptive effect on Wikipedia. I'm not assuming bad faith here; even if your motivations were pure as the undriven snow you have effectively saved a <b>highly</b> disputed policy in a format which both preserves (and effectively enforces) the most contentious of its sections, as well as leaving it in a form which does not <b>in any way</b> communicate the current status of this policy. (i.e. that it is disputed, currently being re-evaluated, and is not to be considered a final draft) At the very <b>least</b> there should be mention of the possibly massive overhaul that is being debated, as well as mention of the ongoing straw poll.

<dd>As it stands, the page is policy, and there has been no indication that that has changed; even Jimbo, who seemed to be objecting to the consolidation of policy onto one page, has stated that this is policy, and the other pages are merely an elucidation. There's no pressing need to modify this in any way, and in particular there is no pressing need for any fairly new editors to push change into the policies. This page (and the other policy pages) should remain protected until the straw poll is complete, so people are able to make rational assessments of existing policy, not try to judge a moving target. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I agree with that, entirely. Jimbo asked us to set up a poll to determine if there was consensus for this, and I believe the "Jimbo-SV compromise" is to treat ATT <i>and</i> V and NOR as policies, with different purposes, <i>in the interim</i>. This doesn't militate against putting a Disputedpolicy tag on ATT, since it is in fact hotly disputed. That doesn't make it a non-policy (though the poll outcome might). <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> was tagged as disputed for several months, because it was disputed, and that tag was removed after the disputes were resolved. Simple. Wikipedian. Good. &#160;:-) I also don't understand the page protection rationale. <i>All</i> WP pages are a moving targets and WPians regularly come to consensus about these moving targets. It's just how to we do things. No problem. And WP:ATT is highly unlikely to radically change; most of the changes I see proposed here are minor, if dispuatious, twiddles. No big deal really, even if people want to fight loudly about a couple of them. I think we could all use some <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">WP:TEA</a> and then just start with "what has or doesn't have consensus in the last version and talk about it? For the minor points that do have consensus, add them. For the minor points that don't have consensus, remove them. Then continue discussions about the contentious ones in talk until they get hammered into some form that everyone or virtually everyone is happy with.

<dd>I personally don't see a need to edit this policy until the poll has finished, and therefore agree with Jayjg that polling on a stable page is better than polling on an unstable one. This policy (and the others that were protected as well) should be unprotected as soon as the poll finishes tho. I am also concerned that some admins will see the protection as an "only admins are allowed to edit policy pages"-type of thing tho, and would therefore like to remind everyone that <i>no one</i> (and that includes admins) is supposed to edit protected pages. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConti_fae9.html" title="User:Conti">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConti_c57c.html" title="User talk:Conti">✉</a> 21:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that the current "stable" page seems to endorse the current revision.

<dd>"Completely non-contentious" could cover 80?, 90? percent of Wikipedia content. Would this source be appropriate for a good article? a featured article? or only the obscure articles which few editors are likely to visit? If, as you rightly suggest, an editor familiar with the subject matter uses good sense and decides this source is appropriate to use why should some random editor be able to come along and force it's removal? Or why should an editor working on non-contentious material be able to slack off and apply a lower standard of verifiability?

<p>I see this person's research is referenced several times in wikipedia. After brief googling, I see that it is possible to write a wikipedia article, in which, using solid references, it may and should be demonstrated that Brennan is a recognized expert in this very narrow topic. After that he will easily fit the provision that self-publishing of an expert are amdissible references in his field of expertise. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 06:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

If <b>P</b> and <b>Q</b> are both true, then <b>R</b> is logically true as well. For example, consider the following argument: All cats are mammals. All mammals are warmblooded. Therefore, all cats are warmblooded. If we provide a reference for the first premise (all cats are mammals) and different reference for the second premise (all mammals are warmblooded), would we be be allowed to use that as justification for writing within an article "all cats are warmblooded"? ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 01:24, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi UBeR, deductions are fine so long as they're obvious and don't serve to advance a position. If they do, you would need to find a source who made the argument in relation to the topic of the article.

<dd>Hi UBeR. To expand on SlimVirgin's response, it's important to note that in controversial cases, where facts and arguments are widely disputed, we need to be particularly strict about sticking closely to sources. For an article about biology, it would be perfectly acceptable to draw the conclusion about cats that you draw above, as this is a noncontroversial conclusion that is not in conflict with relevant sources. However, in a controversial case, such as reporting on a political dispute, it is not appropriate for Wikipedia to put forward arguments <i>even if they are logically valid and the premises are based on impeccable sources</i>. This is because Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia is to report on the debates that have actually occurred, not to participate in these debates or provide a platform for people to advance new arguments. This is why the edits to the article you were editing at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle_4743.html" title="The Great Global Warming Swindle">The Great Global Warming Swindle</a> were labelled as original research. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 01:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for both the question and the answer. The question effectively nails down the common misconception that it is not original research if you provide bits of data that are individually verifiable from separate sources, and then either draw or lead the reader to draw an essentially original picture as a conclusion (whether deductive or otherwise). The answer explains why we do regard this as original research unless the conclusion itself is either non-controversial or attributable to a secondary source. Basically, we are not here to conduct our own investigations but merely to report what is already "out there". For that reason alone, the prohibition on original research is not just a matter of individual pieces of data being verifiable. There can be grey areas ("How controversial is this conclusion?" might sometimes be a question) but if the conclusion drawn is somehow tendentious or potentially harmful to someone we definitely regard it as controversial. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difficulty here is that while it's easy to think of phrases like "All As are B" and "Jones is an A" as stone fact in formal logic, we rarely meet such an animal in the real world. We find that very few things are true of <i>all</i> "A"s -- there seem to be exceptions here and there. Then we find out there there are different views on whether Jones really is an "A" or not, different views of what it means to be a "B", and whether any A is a B or not turns out to be just someone's conjecture or opinion and someone else disagrees. So it often happens that when we put two people's opinions together to draw an inference, we end up with an original view that neither of the two sources (and perhaps nobody else) would actually agree with -- the person who thinks Jones is an A might have a completely different idea about what an A (or a B) is from the person who thinks all As are Bs.

<p>Arg, but it's a simple matter of substitution. We've learned this mathematically in grade school. For example, 1 + 1 = 2 2 + 1 = 3 (1 + 1) + 1 = 3 If we have references for the first two statements, we can logically write the third. A think there can be problems with implication and this rule. For example, take a pundit who has proclaimed, "All liberals are unpatriotic! I hate liberals. Anyone who is unpatriotic is un-American! balrgh blargh blargh..." By this nature, we could explain that the pundit believes liberals are un-American despite the fact he did not say that directly! In an attempts to figure out implication, because some things might be so obvious they are refrained from even being said directly, we come across a problem of synthesis.</p>

Obviously, this is against the mainstream <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific opinion on climate change</a>, in which it is believed humans are the cause of global-warming. What we are trying to write is the film "argues against the predominant scientific opinion on climate change as given in the peer-reviewed scientific literature[3][β] and recognised by the scientific academies of the major industrialized nations [1] and other professional scientific bodies." (You can read the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academy_c38f.html" title="Royal Academy">Royal Academy</a>'s reference on this as well as the G8 signatories <a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=20742" class="external text" title="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=20742" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) One comrade has pointed out, however, this is in violation of the synthesis policy because obviously the film never stated specifically "we disagree with the G8 nations' stance on global warming, but it's basically implied from the film. There have been constant edit warring, even by administrators who you'd think know better but don't, and most recently it has been fully protected.

<dd>To address your specific situation first, if the film only "basically implies" something, why should be presenting it any differently? The article should include only what is presented in the film. It's up to readers to decide what the film implies. To address your points more generally, it's a fundamental mistake to equate the imprecise language of everyday speech with the precise language of mathmatics or logic. Trying to apply formal logic to someone's comments is a futile endeavor. Your pundit example clearly shows the problem with attempting to synthesize a person's comments. Some people are fond of exaggeration and hyperbole, making it nearly impossible to parse their statement in a logical manner. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 20:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank for your explanation, ChazBeckett. One problem I think it's based off in climate related articles here on Wikipedia is that it is common for people to write "Scientist X goes against the mainstream <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific opinion on climate change</a>" (they often use that article for the basis of their claim), despite the fact Scientist X never stated that! Instead, Scientist X is merely presenting other data that argues against what most climate scientist agree as anthropogenic global warming. This issue, if in fact it constitutes synthesis, is widespread among the climate related articles. I think that in creating articles, such <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific opinion on climate change</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming.html" title="Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming">scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming</a>, which, in my opinion, are most likely POV forks, only foster to spread the idea of original synthesis. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 22:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Very logical merger: proof</span></h2>
<p>The merger was very logical and not just bunching together unrelated policies and here is the proof.</p>
<p>The first step is to ask how one can verify something to be true. Well there are two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By doing your own research. (WP:OR)</li>
<li>By relying on other people's research. (WP:ATT)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we have WP:V = WP:OR + WP:ATT.</p>
<p>Hence, WP:ATT = WP:V - WP:OR.</p>
<p>Now, we compute WP:V - WP:OR = WP:V - (-WP:NOR) = WP:V + VP:NOR.</p>
<p>And we have proven that <b>WP:ATT = WP:V + WP:NOR</b>.</p>
<p>It's one of the most compelling philosophical proofs I've ever seen... unless it's a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 02:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone doubts that there are relationships between the policies on verifiability and on not using original research - or that you could include both in one document if you wanted to. That's not really the issue, even if your proof works (which I rather doubt for all sorts of reasons, but that's beside the point). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The flaws in this logic:
<ul>
<li>there is no WP:OR policy.</li>
<li>who told you that - (-WP:NOR) = WP:NOR?</li>
<li>And yes there is a dichotomy with very interesting consequences and probably not what you expect: for your calculation to be true, you have to assume that WP:OR and WP:ATT don't have a common part, in other words, WP:OR (i.e., "your own research" (including the discussed one) doesn't have common sense&#160;:-) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 06:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Finally, in wikipedia <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>=<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eat_flaming_death.html" title="Eat flaming death">eat flaming death you nasty troll</a>, who distracts me from the most important work of screwing up wikipedia policies! `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a></li>

<dd>Well, policy statements are not quantities. Nor are they propositions. It's true in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a> that ~~ p = p, but this is not propositional calculus. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In other words, you are saying that there is no <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> in wikipedia policies. Well, this expains much&#160;:-) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 08:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not the case at all; these are different entities. In maths, two negatives make a positive. In policy, two bads do not make a good. Let's not be silly here... <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 10:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hehe, in the case you didn't notice the whole section from the very begining intended to be silly. By the way my phrase was, like, <a href="../../../h/a/_/Ha_ha_only_serious.html" title="Ha ha only serious">ha ha only serious</a>: the policies do not necessarily require logic: sometimes they are postulates. E.g. <i>wikipedia is .. where everyone can edit</i>. This is a postulate which does not require any logic to be stated. "WP:NOR" is basically a postulate in its core: wikipedia just doesn't allow you to publish your own musings (while blogs allow this; in fact this is their primary purpose). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 16:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These issues actually do arise in mathematics, particularly in statistics. See <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_the_excluded_middle.html" title="Law of the excluded middle">Law of the excluded middle</a>. A number of mathematical systems exist for coping with a world without such a law. See e.g. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionism.html#Truth_and_proof" title="Intuitionism">Intuitionism#Truth and proof</a> for a discussion of the issues involved and the way they are discussed in mathematical thinking.
