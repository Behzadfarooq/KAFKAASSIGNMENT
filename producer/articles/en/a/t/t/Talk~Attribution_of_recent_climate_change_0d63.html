<p>I think this entry is superfluous; the political aspects of anthropogenic global warming are just about identical to the political aspects of all (man+nature) global warming, since we can't do anything about natural global warming. A better place might be with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_gases.html" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a>. --TheCunctator</p>
<p>I also find it somewhat confusing; the Democratic party is said to consider anthropogenic global warming a huge threat, but then it goes on to describe how not a single Democrat politician supported the Kyoto protocols. And then there's that odd reference to Enron. I don't know if this article is biased in any particular direction, but it <i>feels</i> that way somehow.</p>
<p>To make you feel better, very few politicians supported Kyoto initially, regardless of being right or left.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Responding to the unsigned paragraph above</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Democratic support and non-support is puzzling (but real). Perhaps there is a political strategy involved. I'm not sure whether we should analyze and comment on the Clinton Administration's strategy, but the 95-0 Senate vote is a fact and should be reported.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad the bit about Enron came out: it was only breaking news, and really of a political or financial nature. This article should be scientific.</dd>

<p>This article seems to be totally focused on the US political aspects of an international issue, and in any case, if every single Democrat voted against the Kyoto protocols, then it is clearly not the case that "the Democratic Party" supports it. I think this article gives the Democrats much more credit for being progressive and pro-environment on this issue than they deserve. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulpatch_82fb.html" title="User:Soulpatch">soulpatch</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, but the Democrats didn't vote against it. The treaty never was submitted to the Senate for ratification. What was actually voted was a resolution -- not the treaty itself. If you check around, you'll see that Democrats are adamant supporters of the treaty, ratified or not. Go and talk to some people, or check out campaign literature or visit some websites. Or dip into Gore's <i><a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_in_the_Balance_1c12.html" title="Earth in the Balance">Earth in the Balance</a></i>. But you're right about the "more credit...than they deserve"; I think they only rode the issue to get votes in 2000. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></dd>

<dd>My understanding is that those who opposed the treaty, held that position partly because of China and India (and their rapidly growing economies) are excluded and because of widespread <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emissions_trading.html" title="Emissions trading">emissions trading</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Pearson_1357.html" title="User:Brian Pearson">Brian Pearson</a> 01:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, they point out that temperature measurements from <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_balloon.html" title="Weather balloon">weather balloons</a> show no warming whatsoever in the 1979 to 1996 period when land-based thermometers show record-breaking rises (they won't tell you that the longer-term balloon record from 1958 matches the land-based record well). Also, they present evidence that rising temperatures cause sea level to fall (not rise, as orthodox <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> theory predicts) although this is widely disbelieved. However, the oil corporation <a href="../../../e/x/x/ExxonMobil_c2ab.html" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> is one of SEPP's sponsors.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think the above 2 paragraphs are really relevant to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropogenic_global_warming.html" title="Anthropogenic global warming">Anthropogenic global warming</a> article. But where should they go? William, Martin, Eloquence, SEWilco, what do you think?</p>

Connolley</a> 19:27, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)) In some logical world, this page would hold the anthro aspects of GW. But in fact the GW page has most of the stuff, because you can't separate the two (ie, you can't quantify the anthro without some idea of the natural; and vice versa). So this page is doomed to be an orphan. Perhaps it should be reduced further.</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 20:37, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)) I agree. At the moment it (and anthropogenic global cooling) should just state the definition of the term and direct people to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> for details of all the issues. When the anthro effects can be identified, they can be described here.</p>

<p>If "<a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>" means not just any period in which the air temperature went up, but "the theory that emissions have been heating the air too much" -- then anthropogenic GW isn't really a separate article.</p>

<p>Yer right, boss. Our conversations are getting scattered all over the place. But since we are working together, that's okay. We seem to find each other's scattered comments okay.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen your classification scheme, so obviously my little attempt is amateurish. But hey, what can I say?

I've qualified S's recent addition to reflect that viewpoint. Presenting that paper in science as the-state-of-the-debate would be wrong.</p>
<p>Probably, that stuff is worth its own page: there is a lot of it, far more than just the science paper, and it can't all go on this page.</p>

In 1999 Njau published 5 other papers - all in Renewable energy (actually one other, in the well known Nuovo Cimento. Only he has ever cited it). One of them has never been cited by anyone, even him. Of the other 4, only one has ever been cited by anyone but Njau, and that only once. He is clearly a minor author peddling his pet theories, but no-one is listening.</p>
<p>The 2005 paper hasn't been published yet - at least Elsevier lists it for april <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=QuickSearchListURL&amp;_method=list&amp;_aset=B-WA-A-W-WA-MsSAYVA-UUA-AAAUBEYWEB-AAUDEDEUEB-EUCBZVEYV-WA-U&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_st=13&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f6c4c2378a16c567f46084d96cc86c45" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=QuickSearchListURL&amp;_method=list&amp;_aset=B-WA-A-W-WA-MsSAYVA-UUA-AAAUBEYWEB-AAUDEDEUEB-EUCBZVEYV-WA-U&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_st=13&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f6c4c2378a16c567f46084d96cc86c45" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> so I don't think it should be in there.

<p>Here's an example of the sort of rubbish he is writing:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A previous publication by the author predicted that global temperature patterns will switch from the sinusoidal (amplitude-modulation) state into which it has been since 1944 into a node-antinode (amplitude-modulation) state somewhere over the 1997-2012 period. Here we present record-backed evidence which shows that the state change just mentioned is apparently in the process of starting up. By its very nature, this imminent (node-antinode) state is expected to make global temperature vary significantly above and below a common mean which itself may be approximately constant or may at certain times undergo relatively slow drifts. Furthermore we present a historical example in which records of temperature-sensitive indicators show that at least some regional temperature patterns have at least once switched from the sinusoidal (amplitude-modulation) state to the node-antinode state under global climate conditions that were fairly similar to those of the present. Finally we propose possible physical causes of the latter historical switch from sinusoidal state to node-antinode state.</i></dd>

<p>1. The phrase "The current best answer is..." is incredibly POV and inappropriate for this article. While it is true that some people may believe that it is "the best answer", that doesn't necessarily mean it is and it certainly should be reported as fact when it is opinion.</p>
<p>3. It is absolutely inappropriate to discuss the issue of greenhouse gas emission in the second paragraph without including discussion of the fact that the majority of greenhouse gas emissions has taken place AFTER the reported increase in global temperatures. Anything else is POV pushing.</p>
<p>3. "A summary of climate research may be found in the IPCC assessment reports". That isn't either accurate or sufficient. The IPCC doesn't summarize all climate research, it creates its own summary. So this phrase must be changed to reflect this fact. I suggest something like "An IPCC summary of climate research may be found in their assessment reports".</p>

<dd>Here are some facts for you William: The statement "The current best answer is, roughly, <i>most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities</i>" is grotesquely POV. First of all, it fails to mention who is responsibole for deciding the "best answer". I'll assume that since you're such a big fan of this statement, that the IPCC is somehow responsible for it. However, the statement is unattributed. Second, the statement is completely subjective. Even if this is the IPCC's official opinion as to what the best answer is, then it still isn't an absolute fact it is opinion and, therefore, POV. In other words, it isn't relevant to the discussion and it is a clear violation of wikipedia policy with regard to POV - as you have been repeatedly informed. So, the real question is why do you insist on pushing unattributed POV when you know it is a violation of wikipedia policy to do so? --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 00:01, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Climate change is driven by BOTH variations in solar output and the continously varying tilt of Earth's axis, which at present is decreasing. Think about the effect that has on the amount of surface area that's in constant darkness from 24 hours to six months per year, and how that affects the net heat loss.

<p>Is there a better place to find out what has caused these regions to warm? Is there a ball of CO2 hovering over them?

<p>No citation is provided for the "indeed" sentence I deleted. The sentence is probably an erroneous statement of the idea of trying to explain all 20th century warming with solar and without GHGs. That would require enough solar in the latter half century to overshoot the warming in the first half. However, this explanation is not what the indeed text says, and the indeed text is false. There could be a "significant" increase in sensitivity to solar that compatible with the first half century, there is room for reallocation of forcing to solar there. That "significant" increase in sensitivity to solar would not be enough to fully explain the latter half of the 20th century, but more would be attributed to solar than the TAR, and probably even Stolt did. --<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 13:37, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>However, the models may have significant errors in their representation of surface albedo.

<p>To me this looks like more of his obsession with albedo in models. Havin looked at his refs, I don't see any of them addressing the question of model sensitivity to solar forcing.</p>
<p>As for stronger-solar-makes-early-20th-C inexplicable, I admit thats unreferenced but it seems obvious: if you can explain the T from current models, with no solar amplification, there seems to not too much room for solar amplification. Unless you turned down the solar forcing in the reconstructions <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dl>
<dd>No, you would turn down the GHG sensitivity. Since less solar would be being reflected into space, it would be contributing a larger share of the warming and the heat storage in the ocean. Note that Gregory in his climate sensitivity analysis, found positive forcing in the late 19th century that would already commit some warming in the 20th. Presumably with climate models without positive albedo bias, he would find even greater committed warming and solar heat storage in the oceans. Roesch addresses the positive albedo bias, the increased solar radiative flux absorption is obvious.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 14:37, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consider forcing, F = F_solar + F_GHG + F_volcanic, etc. Your position seems to be based on the assumption that T(t) is proportional to F(t) [neglecting commitment, heat storage, and other time dependent effects for now], and hence to get the right temperature history T(t) we basically have a specified total forcing history that we have to match. And consequently if F_solar is underestimated then F_GHG is probably overestimated, etc. Is this basically your logic? I.e. A fixed amount of forcing that needs to be partitioned among causes?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If so, then your problem is basically that attribution studies don't assume this. It is too hard and the models simply aren't good enough to make those matches without noticable systematic errors in both total T and F. So instead the focus is on how much each forcing has changed in time. Saying that ΔF = ΔF_solar + ΔF_GHG + ΔF_volcanic, etc, allows researchers to minimize the effects of any systematic errors that are present at both the beginning and end of their studies. For example, if albedo is 0.01 too high in 1900 and 0.01 too high in 2000, then F_solar is underestimated by ~3-4 W/m^2 at all times, but the associated error in ΔF_solar will be less than 0.1 W/m^2. Focusing on the change in forcing, as most attribution studies do, allows us to estimate the impact of that change even in the face of considerable systematic biases. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:58, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that a lot of past work has focused on how much forcing has changed in time, basically attempting signal detection. Signal detection is valuable on geologic time scales, with low frequency signals and a lot of data to analyze, but the thermal inertial of the ocean dampens high frequencies. If you want to attribute warming of the last 30 years, you can't assume that solar is contributing nothing to the temperature increase or the heat storage in the ocean, just because the solar pattern of cyclic forcing has essentially remained the same for that period. Solar forcing is at highs that have not equilibrated yet (recall the Solanki references), in fact the equilibration to this recent 60+ year long plateau of solar forcing was only just beginning 30 years ago because volcanic aerosol forcing actually was strong enough to override the solar and impose a period of cooling.</dd>
<dd>With the advent of models coupled with the oceans, that can impose conservation-of-energy constraints, the energy budget has to balance. Nearly everything in the models are highly parameterized. It is tough enough to do ab initio physics on large molecules, you are not doing it on a global climate system. The models are parameterized to the known observations, and the hope is that they become useful for gaining insight and making predictions. If the models are matching the record of heat storage in the ocean, and it is discovered they were doing while throwing away 10 to 20 watts/m^2 (orthogonal to the sun) of energy. They must have been getting that energy elsewhere. The GHGs act cheifly to blanket the earth, reducing the radiation of heat into space at certain parts of the spectrum and retaining that warmth in the atmosphere. They are the most likely place for the "correcting" error that balanced the energy budget. They work off of solar energy after all, with very little of the energy budget being geothermal, with less solar energy absorbed, the models had be parameterized to do a better job retaining it to match the temperature and heat storage. Of course, the budget can be being balanced elsewhere, perhaps modeling less negative feedback to counter the GHG forcing. The net result is a higher model sensitivity to GHG forcing than would result with proper attribution of solar forcing, and unfortunately less appreciation for the contribution of natural solar variation and more extreme predictions from GHGs scenerios.</dd>
<dd>You are wrong about attribution studies and underestimate the quality of our models, with the advent of coupled models they are balancing energy budgets and producing realistic qualitative climate behavior, this process of creeping improvements in the parameterizations will eventually yield tools of predictive value. The importance of spectrally correct parameterization of the albedo was just unappreciated until recently and the cumulative size of the errors in all the major models is a new result. When the albedos are fixed, there will be a big jump in credibility and a lot of interesting new science. The hope is that there isn't more errors of similar magnitude left to be discovered. The understanding and parameterization of the cloud physics, will I suspect be the final major frontier. Incremental improvements in realism will be the story after that.</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I am extremely excited about the science. Because the solar forcing is distributed so differently than the GHG forcing, this may explain some of the troubling problems the models have had replicating the multi-decadal climate modes and certain aspects of the ocean circulation, and result in better convergence of model results. Perhaps with these corrections, we will gain more insight into these aspects of the climate. The next few years should yield real insight into the climate, current, past and future. --<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 03:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>If you want to attribute warming of the last 30 years, you can't assume that solar is contributing nothing to the temperature increase or the heat storage in the ocean</i> - I don't understand this. There is no such assumption. Also, I reiterate my unanswered point that PB is reading too much into his refs: the assertion of a bias in sensitivity is his own, not in the refs <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 07:26, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there is that assumption. Dragons Flight proposed focusing only on ΔF. The solar activity is has not significantly changed in the last 30 years, so his approach would not attribute any warming to solar for that period. The bias is in albedo, unless you contend that the models will still match the heat stored in the ocean even after their albedo bias is corrected then, then they have an error elsewhere they have to correct to match the energy budget. But the conclusion of a bias in sensitivity can be arrived at by other means also. The models have different sensitivities, so most of them must be biased.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 08:52, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've reverted, cos your refs still don't support your text. You say <i>search the first reference for the word "bias", you will find what you seem to be missing</i>, well the first ref contains the word bias, but nothing I can see about climate sensitivity. So <i>Positive albedo biases due to inaccuracies in representing snow cover and desert albedos would have the effect of reducing model sensitivity to solar forcing.</i> seems to be purely your own; it shouldn't have your refs following it, pretending to back it up, cos they don't. Also, as DF has pointed out, the errors in solar forcing implied by the albedo errors are tiny, and (I think) don't rate a mention. None of the models are perfect <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 09:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I forgot I had written about sensitivity to "solar" forcing, I had been responding here as if I had written about sensitivity to "GHG" forcing. But how can you question this solar forcing statement at all. If the albedos are bias high, then more solar energy is being reflected into space than in the models than in the observations. Since albedo is a proportion, the higher the forcing is the higher the bias is. Negative results, unfortunately usually don't get publish. The biases reported in the abstract are significant. The values DF and I have been discussing are on the order of the well mixed GHG forcing, do you consider that insignificant?--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 09:34, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, the values you have been discussing, as DF says above, are less than 0.1 w/m2. Thats small. I don't know what you mean about "-ve results": a result that all model sensitivities were too high, or biased high, would be publishable.

<dd>No, DF and I were discussing the impact of an albedo error of 0.01. That was over 10 watts/m^2 orthogonal, or 3.5 watts/m^2 mapped to the earth's surface. I.e., equivilent to the GHG forcings.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 06:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, thats the *total* solar. You need to factor in, as DF did, the change in solar, which reduces your number by 100 at least and probably more <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 07:32, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The total solar is on the order 1364 watts/m^2, so that is not what DF and I were talking about. This is not about the "change" in solar, it is about the difference in solar reflected by the models vs the solar reflected into space as observed. We were analyzing the implications of a 0.01 albedo error. I don't think you have been paying attention to the discussion.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 09:36, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sigh. *total* solar is 136x; per unit area its 350-ish; albedo err of 0.01 is then 3.5 w/m2. But thats not the *forcing* number; what you then need is the *change* in the forcing; which is 1% of that.

Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 11:04, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the 3.5 watts is the globally averaged change in forcing (an increase in forcing in this case) to bring the models in conformance with the observed albedo. Of course, the actual changes will be locally much greater than 3.5 watts/m^2 in the land areas where the positive biases have actually identified. You have applied the 0.01 twice once explicitly, and then again as 1%--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 09:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, there are two separate 0.01's. The first is the albedo err (which we're talking of as assumed definite; I'm by no means convinced); the second is the change in solar forcing (??? 1% is far too large anyway, at least over 20th C). As DF wrote above: ΔF = ΔF_solar + ΔF_GHG + ΔF_volcanic. Since pre-industrial, ΔF_GHG is about 2.4 w/m2; ΔF_solar is... about 0.1. If you care about attributing to the various components, then the models, presumably, introduce an error of ΔF_solar*albedo error. The F_solar*albedo error is subsumed elsewhere. <i>the 3.5 watts is the globally averaged change in forcing (an increase in forcing in this case) to bring the models in conformance with the observed albedo</i> is a component that doesn't matter for attribution, because its a constant <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 18:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it does matter, because the extra 3.5 watts/m^2 extra radiation that was being reflected into space was energy the models were erronenously finding elsewhere since they were matching the energy stored in the ocean. In other words, they were finding that energy to store in the ocean with an error elsewhere in their model. The models are constrained by observations, and one of those observations is the energy budget with energy being stored in the ocean, i.e., the rise in sea level. The new observations they have to match is the globally averaged spectral albedo, and hopefully also the local albedo details.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 22:46, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, there is an extra 3.5 (lets say). But its a constant.

<p>There most certainly is uncertainty in Detection!

<dd>My reading of this concern is that, while detection might be 'easier', in that statistically significant results are more readily obtained, even a statistically significant result is still subject to uncertainty (or "a margin of error", even if that margin of error is statistically small). There still exists uncertainty in many (most?) relevant areas of climate science and ignoring that uncertainty risks assigning certainty to an inherently uncertain understanding of a complex system. Statisticians understand the nature of statistics. Many others don't and might interpret words like 'consensus' and 'statistically significant' as meaning that there exists absolute certainty where uncertainty still exists. Hope this helps.

<p><br />
Attribution goes beyond whether any human contribution is estimated to be zero or non-zero. If the human component were non-zero but very small, then arguably the optimal response might be to do nothing (as warming might happen at roughly the same rate over much the same period anyway). If any human component were relatively very large, then that might be suggestive of the need for a response to any anthropogenic forcing, with the magnitude of the response positively related to the magnitude of the attribution (as action might make an important difference over meaningful timeframes if any athropogenic contribution were estimated to be relatively very large). On this reading, there does not seem to be a consensus surrounding attribution, although the IPCC use of the word "most" appears to imply that there exists a consensus that any human component is &gt; 50%. Does anyone have references for supporting evidence of this implied consensus of &gt; 50% attribution? Ofomamad 16:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)Ofomamad</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I understand the question. The IPCC is very clear in stating that "Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations". If you read the SPM leading up to this, you get a fairly detailed discussion of the different radiative forcings. Greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the positive forcings, but the effect is reduced by some negative forcings like aerosols. I find &gt;50% a bit misleading, because it they attribute much more than half of the positive forcings to greenhouse gases, but it certainly is not incorrect (and the forcings cannot simply be added up and divided anyways). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 18:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>because I don't see that it fits the description of *important* results. Also its badly misrepresented: B+G don't predict cooling, they say: <i>If tropical Pacific SST responds to these subsurface changes in a similar way, then it could be an indication of a climate regime shift to pre-1976 conditions. Given the considerable effect that tropical Pacific SST has on global atmospheric circulation, a climate shift to pre-1976 conditions could lessen the warming trend that has existed since 1976.</i> which is very different. Also they make no specific predictions about 2006 that I can see. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>William, of course you don't see it as *important* since it conflicts with your POV, but that does not change the fact it <b>is</b> important. The specific prediction for 2006 results from the four year lag from their observation in 2002. Giese predicted a return to pre-1976 conditions which was a period of global cooling. You did not quote the entire passage. "A similar situation existed in the early 1940’s when SST records show an equatorial Pacific cooling with the period from 1942–1976 generally cooler than the period following the 1976 climate shift [Zhang et al., 1997]." If you think my wording overstates the case, feel free to edit my wording.

<dd>As for the Schmidt thing... that seems so far from reality that I'm baffled you put it in. Schmidt, of course, is with RC and won't agree with your Original interpretation of his work.

<dd>William, you know as well as I that people use the C13 to C12 ratio to attempt to prove mankind is responsible for increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Read this bit from RealClimate. <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=81" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=81" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> The NASA piece proves that the ratio widens and tightens by purely natural mechanisms, mechanisms which are impossible for us to measure. My entry did not claim that Schmidt was a skeptic, only that this report proves that isotopes cannot be used to blame mankind.<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 01:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it sez on RC: <i>There are actually multiple, largely independent lines of reasoning, discussed in some detail in the IPCC TAR report, Chapter 3. One of the best illustrations of this point, however, is not given in IPCC. Indeed, it seems not all that well appreciated in the scientific community, and is worth making more widely known.</i> So no, you can't use RC to prove that we don't know that CO2 is anthro, since we don't. Asserting that the CO2 increase is not known to be anthro pushes you out onto the wild fringes of skepticism and destroys your credibility.

<dd>The argument seems to be as follows: Development of the C12/C13 ratios are consistent with the massive influx of carbon from fossil resources and hence confirm what we expect in the first place (given that we introduce massive amounts of fossil carbon into the atmosphere). Therefore the <i>only</i> reason we have to believe that we introduce massive amounts of fossil carbon is the change in the C12/C13 ration. But 55 million years ago, another event changes the C12/C13 ratio (over about 100000 years) and hence we know nothing anymore... --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 10:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>William and Stephan - First of all, Real Climate is wrong. The IPCC does discuss the C13 to C12 ratio and says it points to the burning of fossil fuels. <i>Second, the characteristic isotopic signatures of fossil fuel (its lack of 14C, and depleted content of 13C) leave their mark in the atmosphere.</i> <a href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/097.htm#tab31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/097.htm#tab31" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> The article I linked to proves that this line of reasoning is bogus. 13C can be "depleted" by purely natural mechanisms. Seeing the hand of man where it is not necessarily active is poor science. These guys are jumping to conclusions that are not warranted. Recent studies show this line of argument is no longer valid. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 03:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ron, you start being unneccesarily dense. The primary reason for our knowledge of man's contribution to the CO2 increase is the fact that we <i>do</i> release massive amounts of CO2 - in fact, we release about 2 times more than shows up in the atmosphere, with much of the rest currently absorbed by the oceans and biosphere. The C in the CO2 we release also has a very distinct isotopic signature - essentially no C14 and very reduced amounts of C13. And this very change is reflected in the atmosphere. What is your explanation? Squirrels collecting the CO2 we produce, and storing it underground while at the same time some other source of fossil Carbon is convenienty converted to CO2 at just the right rate to fool us? Science does not do absolute proof, but this is as close as it can possibly get. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 08:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stephan, I think this whole line of argument is way oversold. I would think that to get an accurate measure of man's contribution based on isotopes, you would need a stable baseline of the isotopes. When this line of argument was first advanced to me, I was told nature did provide a stable baseline. Now I learn it does not. Is it possible to decipher man's contribution in a scenario with a changing baseline? Perhaps, but it seems to me that arguing from the total change makes much more sense than an argument based on isotopes.

<p>RC continues to misrepresent B+G. First of all, I maintain my doubt that its important enough to list. But even past that, RC has it wrong: RC added:</p>

Giese concludes the results of his study "indicate that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The lag is *about* 4 years, and the paper says this, not precisely 4. The paper cannot possibly be about an event in 2002 - "An event in 2002 caused..." is an invention by RC - because it was received in March 2002 by GRL, which means it must have been begun in early 2002 at best. Fig 1 shows temperatures to 2000 and 5-y smoothed ENSO to 2001. The paper does say <i>if negative anomalies follow a pattern similar to the positive anomalies in the mid–1970’s, then a cool tropical Pacific SST anomaly may soon weaken the global warming signal.</i> but note the if, the may, and the lack of a timescale. And later: <i>If tropical Pacific SST responds to these subsurface changes in a similar way, then it could be an indication of a climate regime shift to pre-1976 conditions. Given the</i> considerable effect that tropical Pacific SST has on global atmospheric circulation, a climate shift to pre-1976 conditions could lessen the warming trend that has existed since 1976 <i>- again, note the if, the could be, the could. And that it ends with "lessen the warming trend" - not *cooling*. Adn there is no 4-y timescale given.</i></p>

<dd>William (ie. Kim), your excessive obfuscating is growing wearisome. So the cooling trend began in late 2005. Is that really significant to readers of an encyclopedia? If you insist, we can quote the entire Giese paper. But nothing you have said above indicates that Giese's study is not appropriate for this section of the article. The main point is Giese's conclusion: <i>The results presented here do not preclude the possibility that anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases have contributed to global warming. However the results do indicate that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described.</i> Instead of trying to make the entry better, you have just deleted the information, proving that you care more for censoring science than you do for an accurate encyclopedia.

Thankfully you've removed that, but the never version is still very bad: <i>No climate models consider oceanic events as a climate forcing</i> - what does this mean? <i>All climate models had predicted 2006 would set record temperatures</i> - this is complete nonsense - where did you get it from?

<dd>William, my comment was to you but it was Kim that deleted my entry. Again, he did it without any effort to make the entry better or to prove it didn't belong - he just deleted it. Your claim I did not read the paper is completely bogus. I read the paper carefully. The timing of the observations and the cooling is just a smokescreen for your POV. An encyclopedia is not expected to use the same careful wording of a scientific paper, especially when discussing annual temperature averages. So the observations probably happened in 2001 and were published in early 2002, resulting in cooler temps in late 2005 but really affected the 2006 annual avg temps much more. This is the "about" four years I was talking about. Nothing you have said has debunked anything I wrote. "No climate models consider oceanic events as a climate forcing" means exactly what it says. Climate models consider CO2, solar variability, and other factors. Climate models do not factor in the conditions and observations of Dr. Giese. This is why Dr. Giese concludes "the results do indicate that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described." Regarding the point that 2006 was predicted to be the warmest year ever, I could find lots of such predictions - Hansen, Jones, Mann. All in all, the paper is of extreme importance. Just as Einstein was recognized as great because his theory was proven correct, so too is Giese's prediction proving to be correct. That is the main point. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 15:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Are you now backing away from that to asserting that someone predicted it? Do please provide several climate models that predict such, or take the sentence out of the article. <i>This is the "about" four years I was talking about</i> - no, you did *not* write "about" 4 years - you insisted on exactly 4 years. B+G does not make any prediction - it is far too hedged with ifs and buts, and contains no specific dates - it is only you who have arbitrarily decided that B+G meant 2006, based on your invention of an event in 2002. On your logic, B+G could have meant 2001, and therefore predicted a cold 2005, but you need to insist on 2005 being warm. <i>No climate models consider oceanic events as a climate forcing</i> - this is in essence wrong. GCMs contain oceans, which are fully able to provide forcing as in the real world. Its clear that what you are writing is your own OR based on B+G.

When you factor in the time required to write and publish the study and factor in the fact the data set is averaging annual temperatures, such approximations disappear into insignificance. The entire "four year" argument you are putting forward is nothing but a red herring. I have completely removed it, not because it was wrong but because it was inconsequential.

<p>Still you shift and turn. You have, finally, removed the blatant untruths from your text. However now B+G are no longer predicting anything, still less anything that has come true, there is no obvious claim for notability - other than it including the quote you like. Now you are left with your main point being OR: that GCMs don't consider climate shifts. You bolster this with your reading of climate forcings, but yet again you are wrong. The regime shift that B+G consider is internal to the ocean-atmos system (well, mostly in the ocean) not an *external* forcing at all. So yes, coupled GCMs contain the same physics and may well have such regime shifts. Without some backup, your assertion that these *aren't* considered is nothing but OR on your part.

<dd>William, B+G's observations led them to write that oceanic events "could be an indication of a climate regime shift to pre-1976 conditions." Most people will understand that to be a prediction. Giese's "climate shift" is not considered by any computer model considered by the IPCC since it was published after the TAR. This is self-evident, not OR. I have restored the entry. Everything in the entry itself is well-sourced and not OR.

<dd>William, you are shameless. Your reputation for being among the most POV editors on wikipedia is evidently well-deserved. IMHO Barnett's thesis has been disproven since the oceans have been cooling since 2003. However, my opinion is not in the entry. You are merely attempting to change the subject. You admitted there were no errors in my entry and you have not identified any errors now. You complain that I should be naming both B+G and not just G. Very well. I will be happy to make that change (even though B was only a graduate student at the time). However, your claim there is no prediction is wishful thinking. B+G wrote that what they observed "could be an indication of a climate regime shift to pre-1976 conditions." This is a prediction to anyone - scientist or not - who is not intentionally blind to anything contrary to the IPCC. Regardless of any of this, your main goal is to keep their conclusion out of the article - namely, that the IPCC has overestimated the role of mankind in climate change. William, you should be ashamed of yourself. You are evidently incapable of doing the right thing. I suggest we bring in other editors to decide this dispute.

<dd>Kim, to answer your question, you are incorrect. The study was performed in 2001 or very early 2002 and changes in the climate regime was expected "about" four years later (late 2005 or early 2006). 2005 was a warm year and 2006 was significantly cooler than expected since it was an El Nino year. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 00:32, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RonCram, but unfortunatly for that argument, the observations are about subsurface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific, which is according to the hypothesis correlated with air temperature by a lag of 7 years. At the time of publication it was around 7 years since the subsurface tropical pacific temp started to fall - so the effect should have been noticeable around 3-4 years ago - as i said - it is not the publication date that sets the timeline - but the observation. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimDabelsteinPetersen_ef2e.html" title="User:KimDabelsteinPetersen">Kim D.

<dd>William, I am restoring it. The point is that "subsequent to the TAR" research has been done that concluded "that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described." There is no way you can claim this is pointless as it goes to the very heart of the debate. As I stated before, I think we need to bring in some outside editors to help resolve this conflict. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 23:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Now that this bit has been removed, you have changed your "main point" yet again (previous shifts, you'll recall, include the "prediction" that wasn't).

<dd>William, IMHO the ground is not shifting. I may not have expressed myself well in the earlier post, but my position is unchanged. The main point stated as: "IPCC do not consider the Giese study" is pretty much the other side of the coin of the point just above: "Giese disagrees with the IPCC." I am not sure why you do not see those two as related. They are two sides of the same coin.

TO state that your position is unchanged is nonsense. I think you have *now* finally come to your true "main point": you want someone disagreeing with the IPCC. But just disagreeing with IPCC is not enough to make this notable (unless you are asserting that there are so few paper disagreeing that one that does is automatically notable?

<dd>Bill, thanks for your input. William, it is notable because the observations B+G made caused them to make a prediction of a climate shift to pre-1976 conditions (a cooling period even though we had rising CO2). B+G stated there would be a four year lag from the observations to lower surface temperatures. All of this has proven out. The oceans started cooling in 2003 resulting in lower than expected temperatures in 2006. The standard argument for any pro-AGW person is that "any" evidence that contradicts the IPCC is not notable. Such an argument is intellectually bankrupt. The IPCC has dramatically toned down their catastrophic warnings about AGW (see the analysis of Lord Monckton below) showing they were way off base to begin with. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 17:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now we're going round in circles: now you've shifted gorund yet again to it being the prediction thats notable. Your text used to have "prediction" in it, but was removed by me and by Vsmith who both can't see any prediction there. If you think there is a prediction, and its part of its importance, then the text you add needs to have that in. Now you're back at "4 year lag" having previously admitted to "about"; we also don't even know what its "about 4 year" *from* - please do point to the date in the paper that you expect (about/exactly) a 4 year lag from. Without this, how can any "prediction" be evaluated? Bill - the text at the start of this section reads <i>Some important results include:</i> - if you think B+G is worth having but not notable, you need to revise that text. For my part, I'd rather have it only list important things. As to Mocktons anaylsis - its trash. IPCC hasn't toned itself down - Monckton has simply got his figures wrong. But I don't suppose you bothered to check them, you just took him on trust? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<p>Lord Monckton has a very readable analysis. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>FIGURES in the final draft of the UN’s fourth five-year report on climate change show that the previous report, in 2001, had overestimated the human influence on the climate since the Industrial Revolution by at least one-third.</dd>
<dd>Also, the UN, in its 2007 report, has more than halved its high-end best estimate of the rise in sea level by 2100 from 3 feet to just 17 inches. It suggests that the rate of sea-level rise is up from 2mm/yr to 3mm/year – no more than one foot in a century.</dd>
<dd>UN scientists faced several problems their computer models had not predicted. Globally, temperature is not rising at all, and sea level is not rising anything like as fast as had been forecast. Concentrations of methane in the air are actually falling.</dd>
<dd>The Summary for Policymakers was issued February 2, 2007, but the report on which the Summary is based will not be published until May. This strange separation of the publication dates has raised in some minds the possibility that the Summary (written by political representatives of governments) will be taken as a basis for altering the science chapters (written by scientists, and supposedly finalized and closed in December 2006).</dd>
<dd>The draft of the science chapters, now being circulated to governments for last-minute comments, reveals that the tendency of computers to over-predict rises in temperature and sea level has forced a major rethink.</dd>
<dd>The report’s generally more cautiously-expressed projections confirm scientists’ warnings that the UN’s heavy reliance on computer models had exaggerated the temperature effect of greenhouse-gas emissions.</dd>

<p>I'd like to avoid using the term "consensus" in contexts that imply that all scientists agree or that "the science is settled" - as this is the position advocated by Kyoto Protocol supporters in the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, a proposition which I believe Wikipedia should not take a stand on.</p>
<p>So I propose using phrases like "<a href="../../../i/p/c/IPCC_676f.html" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> assessment of the latest scientific research". This wording is, I believe, neutral. It does not say that there is (or is not) a consensus. It doesn't even say whether the IPCC's assessment is correct. The reader can visit the IPCC article to determine in his own mind whether he should accept their report as authoritative. Just about everyone does, I guess. But I want that to be something we leave up to the reader, instead of telling them that they must believe what that intergovermental panel says. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 13:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has been brought up before. The problem is that the consensus goes much beyond the IPCC, with essentially all major scientific organizations (e.g. the G8 Science Academies, the AGU, the AAAS, the AMetS...) having issued explicit statements supporting it. Consensus does not imply unanimity. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 13:08, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. People are free to disagree, or to otherwise conclude that the consensus view is in error, but it would be heavily POV to try to conceal that there is such a consensus. There is a majority view, and then there are some significant minority views, and the article should reflect that. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMishlai_0561.html" title="User:Mishlai">Mishlai</a> 17:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a very useful clarification! I'm getting from this discussion, the idea that "consensus" can mean anything between "majority" and "unanimity". Perhaps I had misconstrued the term in the past, thinking it implied a commitment by the minority to support the majority (as in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a>).

<p>Have there been any responses to the claims made by the contributers to 'The Great Global Warming Swindle' on Channel 4, UK, on the 9th of March 2007? Such as that temperature change has always led carbon change by a gap of 800 years? This would make it impossible for Carbon to be causing temperature changes. Another point made was that CO2 makes up 0.54% of the atmosphere and that human CO2 emissions are 6 gigatons per annum of that, whilst animals and plants create 130 gigatons and still more is produced by either volcanoes or the ocean than human activity. I really think that a lot of people will turn to Wikipedia for answers to these sorts of questions, but it was difficult to see them clearly laid out in this article.--82.43.176.137 16:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is now a section on the 800 year ice core lag thing (which I did think was one of the programme's stronger arguments). The argument about CO2 only being 0.54% of the atmosphere was just meaningless. Who cares? Plutonium makes up a very small part of the mass of the Earth, but that doesn't mean we want any more of it, as it is lethal at the level of microgrammes. The absolute amount of CO2 is completely irrelevant, what matters is the effect that _increasing_ the level of CO2 has. To be honest it reduced my respect for the programme that it used arguments such as these (which are obviously fallacious). Subsequent research into the producer of the programme, and Wunsch's very public complaint about how they used his interview, have reinforced this. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlinme_d7c9.html" title="User:Merlinme">Merlinme</a> 10:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that there was a lot of information presented in the Channel 4 programme that is not mainstream knowledge and should have representation in wikipedia articles so as to present a balanced view.

<p>I dont see where B+G say "Bratcher and Giese claim the Earth was in a cooling trend from 1942 to 1975 and then saw warmer temperatures from 1976 through 2002." I don't think there is such a trend. B+G say "A similar situation existed in the early 1940’s when SST records show an equatorial Pacific cooling with the period from 1942–1976 generally cooler than the period following the 1976 climate shift [Zhang et al., 1997]." If you want them to say 42-76 (why do you say 75?) was cooler than 76 on then I'm happy with that, obviously. But if you want them to say a *global* cooling trend from 42-75/6 please quote them here <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>William, throughout the article (starting in paragraph 1) B&amp;G talk about the warming trend that began in 1976. They also predict a return to pre-1976 conditions which they describe as "cooler." I understand pre-1976 as 1975. If you think the statement should read "from 1942 to 1976," I'm okay with that. Regarding the issue of whether this is global, that is the topic of the article. Here is one example: "Given the considerable effect that tropical Pacific SST has on global atmospheric circulation, a climate shift to pre-1976 conditions could lessen the warming trend that has existed since 1976." They also write: "However the results do indicate that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described." Also, "The purpose of this paper is to bring attention to the similar, but opposite in sign, pattern as that seen prior to the 1976 climate shift and emphasize the importance of understanding the separation between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing in the climate system." The "similar, but opposite in sign" climate shift could only refer to cooling. Notice the trend from 1940s to 1970s in this temperature chart that GISS published in 1999. <a href="http://www.btw-2005.de/blog/blogs/index.php/2006/12/10/ratselhaft" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btw-2005.de/blog/blogs/index.php/2006/12/10/ratselhaft" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> There really is not much point in trying to argue against a cooling trend if that is your goal. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 23:21, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, I do indeed argue against 1942-1975/6 being a cooling trend. I would see it as a small peak around 194x, followed by a plateau. <i>However the results do indicate that the human forced portion of global warming may be less than previously described</i> - this is fair enough, and supports your (other) point. But the "pattern" stuff: no. They don't say cooling trend; and you're having to torture their words to get it out. Try replacing it with something they did actually say <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 23:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>William, I am not torturing their words. They discussed the warming trend that started in 1976. They indicate a similar climate shift is happening in 2002 but with the opposite sign. That can only mean the beginning of a cooling trend. Your argument for a plateau is not in accord with the B&amp;G. Neither is it in accord with the temperature record in which the 1930s were as warm or warmer than the 1990s (if you consider the temperature record prior to the unwarranted adjustments that were made in 2001 in time for the TAR). Did you even look at the temperature chart I linked to? If you insist on using the unreliable temperature records that are currently in vogue, the trend is still visible.

<p>This section is completely POV. It makes a bunch of unsubstantiated "rebuttals" with the only source being (IMHO very bias) realclimate.org, which in turn links to a single source. This section needs to be vastly improved and IMHO I think a separate article should be created that discusses the lag. In the following I'll provide a list of what I think is wrong with this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The main error with this argument is that it ignores whether increased CO2 levels should cause increased global temperatures, and in fact, no-one seriously disputes this (although they may dispute the level of climate sensitivity to CO2). Although other factors must have been at work in starting the period of global warming identified in these ice cores, therefore, the CO2 would have increased its effects.</i></dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm not so sure about this claim that no-one seriously disputes more CO2 in the atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperature. Where is the evidence to back this up (that no-one seriously believes this)? And I don't think that it is being ignored, I believe that what is being said is that we aren't even sure how an increase in CO2 affects temperature.</li>

Some (currently unknown) process causes Antarctica and the surrounding ocean to warm. This process also causes CO2 to start rising, about 800 years later. Then CO2 further warms the whole planet, because of its heat-trapping properties. This leads to even further CO2 release.

<dl>
<dd>Its not terribly clear to me from that graph; but even granting you the assertion, its the same thing in reverse: falling T lowers CO2 then we're into the same feedback cycle as before.

<p>Having read through the (current) final section of this article something struck me about the line:</p>
<p>"Some (currently unknown) process causes Antarctica and the surrounding ocean to warm. This process also causes CO2 to start rising, about 800 years later. Then CO2 further warms the whole planet, because of its heat-trapping properties."</p>
<p>If the initial 'unknown' process started the periods of global warming how do we know that it didnt cause all the warming and the CO2 had no real effect&#160;? If the source is unknown then it could be a short or long term driver of climate and could be relatively strong or weak compared to other factors since it is 'unknown' and its characteristics are not understood. Just a thought.... 194.6.79.200 21:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For one, because the events are (as far as is known) triggered by orbital variations which provide too small a forcing. For two, because in the process CO2 is released, which causes yet more radiative forcing. Unless you have some magic reason for believing that CO2 to have no radiative effect, its natural to suppose it does have one. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>So let me get this straight, you don't know what caused the temperature to rise in the first place, you think/believe (=don't know) that the CO2 reservoir got exhausted which lead to stopping the temperature increase. But once the CO2 peaked out, something had to have a cooling effect? And I guess you don't know what the cooling effect was.</dd>
<dd>For me the more rational explanation would be that CO2 is driven by temperature and that something else is driving temperature.

<dd>This can go in, as long as its clear that the evidence is against this having anything to do with Earth GW. As the plotu folk say: <i>Jay Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College, said that Pluto's global warming was "likely not connected with that of the Earth. The major way they could be connected is if the warming was caused by a large increase in sunlight. But the solar constant--the amount of sunlight received each second--is carefully monitored by spacecraft, and we know the sun's output is much too steady to be changing the temperature of Pluto."</i>. Ditto Neptune. In fact, when you look around there is *no* evidence for solar-caused warming on any planet <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<p>New version seems fair enough.

<dd>DWC144's reply: cf. Paillard, 2001, "Glacial Cycles", Reviews of Geophysics, 39, 3 / August 2001: "The classical Milankovitch theory needs to be revised to account both for the traditional peculiarities of the records, like the 100-kyr cyclicity and the stage 11 problem, and for the recent observational evidence of <i>abrupt</i> climatic changes, in association with the main terminations." (Emphasis added) Paillard uses the term "abrupt" or derivatives more than 25 times in this piece, and for good reason. The Vostok data shows transient peaks, which still need to be explained, particularly the implied sudden reversals off the tops, if the data is as straightforward as it seems. Intuitively, conjoint, positive feedback dynamics (e.g. T--&gt;CO2--&gt;T--&gt;CO2--&gt;T etc. posited as the comeback in this section) add to the momentum of systems. It is not that this makes it impossible to explain the previous reversals off the tops, but let us agree that the mutual positive feedback thesis does make proving up an explanation (Heinrich events??) more urgent, and perhaps more complex. In the interim, this combination does properly add slightly to the case for doubt. (That is, along the lines of pondering what would be the slope of those curves during the next millenium even in the hypothetical absence of anthropogenic global warming--which of course is to be taken for granted. Can we really rule out a relatively steep slope--one way or the other--in that hypothetical absence, given the demonstrated potential for nonlinear dynamics in the system? Even in the top horizontal band on the chart, where we currently find our planet?) I'd have rather given a brief nod to this question, and I also see no problem with identifying the boundaries of current knowledge in the Wikipedia. In response to your other comment, the section appears already to be addressing "glacial-interglacial" CO2 changes; perhaps it is bound to, because of the prominence given to the ice-core data by Gore's film, and the potential relevance of the longer term context for appraising modern developments. The record of edits shows that I tried several times to inject an element of the forgoing in the piece--I would have been happy with even a sentence--but I will concede now that my colleagues here are unprepared to build on this. I'll leave it to you to determine the rightful bounds of proper discussion in the article, but I would appreciate it if you could at least leave these comments here, on the discussion page.</dd>

<dd>Of course we'll leave your comments on the talk page. As both WMC and I have said in our comments and on this talk page, it's not the information you're adding per se we're objecting to, it's where you're adding it. I simply don't see why the "abrupt changes" are relevant to an argument about temperature leading CO<sub>2</sub>. WMC suggested that you add the information e.g. in the article on <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_age.html" title="Ice age">ice ages</a>. You may be able to find a better place for it. If you can find a source which uses it as an argument against anthropocentric global warming caused by CO<sub>2</sub>, perhaps it could even be given its own section. But I don't see it as relevant to the "Warming sometimes leads CO2 increases" section. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlinme_d7c9.html" title="User:Merlinme">Merlinme</a> 09:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The relevance is to the response given in the section (positive feedback), and specifically a clear complication the thesis entails. If not for the temperature-leading observations and abruptness in the ice core data, and the recourse to a positive feedback explanation, we'd have a much simpler presumed dynamic through geological history (e.g. orbital forcing --&gt; T and/or CO2 --&gt;T), which would present much less background noise to disentangle from modern anthropogenic contributions. Now we have an inherently unbounded feedback loop, offered in the section, combined with data showing abrupt reversals at the tops of peaks that have generally been transient in the past. Not only that, but we are currently situated in line with the peak temperatures on the chart. From a modelling perspective, even conceptually, this is not a happy situation. Parsimony is a core value of scientific endeavor; see <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>. And I would add that when the data take us far beyond parisimony we need to provide a little alert to the effect that "we now departing from the world of parsimonious explanation; we've gotta do this, but we gotta acknowledge now that this makes our answers more tentative." Positive feedback may not be wrong, and it is probably the most reasonable account, but it is not parsimonious in the broader context of this data. Let's be honest. Even Gore was willing to say that the ice core data is "complex." The difference between a scientist and a hack is in the willingness to be open about the difficulties presented by his/her own explanations. Do we aspire to be scientists or hacks here? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dwc144 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dwc144_e31c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dwc144">contribs</a>) 14:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Well no. For a start, we have the obs record, which clearly isn't compatible with a orbital linear forcing assumption. And then we have the fact that the orbital forcing is too small. Please don't confuse things with D-O events. This section is about why the CO2/T lags leads shown in the ice cores don't impact modern attribution studies, from a scientific point of view - please try and hang on to that (or, alternatively, please try to find a single paper asserting it) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>Thanks for your comments. If you don't like the Paillard, I'll find another paper when I have a chance (not this week). A reasonable suggestion. Note that I did not suggest orbital forcing alone, above. And incidentally, I'd prefer to rephrase one of your comments and suggest instead that "This section is about evaluating the extent to which the ice core data, particularly the CO2/T lags/leads in conjunction with the transients and abrupt terminations of that data, complicate or do not complicate modern attribution studies, from a scientific point of view." However, on the Wikipedia it seems that the one with the less expansive concept has a natural advantage, for it is easier and more defensible to hit the delete key than to add.Dwc144 15:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm really sorry, but I find your writing style very unclear sometimes. As far as I can understand it, you seem to be saying that abrupt reversals in temperature when CO<sub>2</sub> levels were very high, argue against the normal understanding that CO<sub>2</sub> causes warming. Please correct me if I'm wrong. If this is a true observation (and I have no idea, not being a climate scientist myself), then it is interesting, and certainly I think it is fair to say that there are questions which need answering about why greenhouse warming in the past was eventually reversed. As I understand it the normal explanation is that when CO<sub>2</sub> levels get very high, ocean acidity increases and calcium carbonate gets dissolved, increasing the ocean's capacity to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. In the long term, chemical weathering of silicate rocks then permanently removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This was the best link I could find on it, about the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM): <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news4491.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.physorg.com/news4491.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></dd>

<dd>Anyway, there may well be a place for a discussion of all this on Wikipedia, and a place for your arguments (assuming they are sourced and not Original Research). However, the argument being described in this section is specifically about CO<sub>2</sub> leading temperature change in the ice core record; it says absolutely nothing about abrupt changes in the ice core dataset. If you want to talk about that argument (or whatever your argument is, apologies if I've misunderstood), you are in the wrong section; you can't simply rewrite a completely different argument so it allows you to make your point. Either find a more appropriate section for it, or create a new section (assuming you can find a source). --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlinme_d7c9.html" title="User:Merlinme">Merlinme</a> 17:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me try to be even clearer, and I do appreciate your bearing with me. Here is a collection of a few key points, including current ones from the ice core bit, that could be registered in a section on this page. (a) The ice core data does not present a reason to discount the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on the climate, but simply a reason to believe that T and CO2 often work in tandem; (b) The abrupt reversals in that data during the past 500 k years suggest that knock-on effects or events (e.g. loss of ice cover, disruptions to ocean currents??) are likely also at work at least from time to time; (c) Given that the planet is currently in a temperature range in which such reversals have previously occurred, it is conceivable that it is currently subject to the effects of such intermittent feedbacks; (d) These feedbacks, and the rudimentary state of our knowledge about them, increase the level of difficulty involved in global climate modelling; (e) Most critically, these complications limit the ‘’precision’’ with which causation can be attributed within those models. For example, while we can likely state “mostly anthropogenic causes” with confidence, we likely cannot yet state 51% or 74% or 84.5%. (f) More research is required to understand better the feedback effects (not before acting, but just because). This line of thought is not original, but it can be referenced to very mainstream sources (e.g. the IPCC, in large part, I'm thinking). It is also squarely about the question of the page, attributing modern climate change. What’s the motivation? I think it is useful to highlight the longer term potential for disastrous, naturally caused/aggravated climatic change, because the question of how to mitigate those risks is even broader than the question of how to minimize the human footprint on the climate. (Notwithstanding that, we clearly start by simply minimizing that footprint now.)</dd>

<dd>Well no: <i>Given that the planet is currently in a CO2 and temperature range in which such reversals have previously occurred</i> is wrong: the planet hasn't been in this CO2 range for 10's of millions of years, and we have no good T or CO2 records back that far.

Within the ice core context that usually means D-O events but you're not seeing them in that record, you're seeing events that look abrupt but only because of the timescale that they are being plotted on.

<dd>Fair warning about the scale, so help me understand this. Let's take the transient peak during the interglacial at 240k years as a numerical example. I don't have the raw data, so this will be a crude, back of the envelope. Let's say that the slope (dT/dt) during the preceding warming period was 8 degrees C / 4000 years, or 0.2 degrees C/100 years. Then, let's take the first part of the cooling, during which dT/dt is, say, -2 degrees C / 1000 years, hence -0.2 degrees C / 100 years. Furthermore, let's say that the change from the warming to the cooling mode occurred during 500 years. That implies an average rate of change in dT/dt of -0.4 degrees C per 500 years, and perhaps a peak rate of twice that at a century resolution. With even higher resolution data (e.g. decadal), though this will remain total speculation, one might expect to find multiple-higher rates of change, assuming that shorter term transient feedbacks are superimposed on this "background" signal. I don't know what you get to, but is the established view that first and second degree noise of this order of magnitude is still insignificant compared to the rates of climate change ("signal strength") being seen in modern GW? Also, don't we need to invoke factors other than solar insolation to understand these abrupt changes, particularly since we're working against the T-CO2 feedback loop? The insolation chart looks distinctly smoother assuming no artifacts from estimation. Hasn't the scientific interest in esoteric missing pieces (e.g. ocean current disruptions, ice cover, low level clouds, divine intervention--just kidding) been catalyzed somewhat by this general line of thinking out of paleoclimatology? Also, have observations such as these been sufficient in your view to induce some degree of caution in modern climate modellers as to the precision of their models?</dd>
<dd>--Dwc144 14:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>0.2/100y is considerably smaller than the current warming, by a factor of 3 at least. Yes, we do need to invoke other factors than solar - as you say, the solar is smooth. And (less obviously) the 100kyr cycle is very weak - so you need to invoke non-linear feedbacks in the ice sheets, etc etc, to understand a 100kyr cycle. I'm not saying that studying this is irrelevant - just that if you look at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change.html" title="Attribution of recent climate change">attribution of recent climate change</a> you'll see its not very relevant. But it would be a good idea to read that (and the TAR) to see what *is* relevant <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 14:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>After all that hot air on my part, you're seriously positing 0.2/100y (or, say, 0.1/50y) as a representative *very high* rate of change during, say, 50 year periods during previous interglacials? Wouldn't you expect there to be a hefty right tail (in the distribution of 50 years temperature changes) given the nonlinearities (perhaps acting at different timescales) you say are likely in there? And why do you suggest that the "ice age stuff" of prior peak interglacials, which scientists are still trying to conceive of and define, is necessarily a completely different bag of tricks to what's been going on during the past 500 years? (If because the GCMers get a great fit with just CO2 a little insolation, and a couple of readily available other series thrown in to be nice, isn't there a little wedge of concern about the extremely high degree of colinearity between CO2 and temperature in the broader 500 k year picture?) To be clear, my point is not to dispute AGW; it is rather to raise the question about the degree of precision that can be claimed for the models. And I won't reiterate the reasons, stated above, why I believe this matter of precision could usefully be reflected on the page. In any case, I'll let you have the last word on this and will take it upon myself to do some more (secondary!) research in my spare time, as you suggest.</dd>
