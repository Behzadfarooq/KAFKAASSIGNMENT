there is no point to it. everyone just complains about how they hate the show which is old. yes, AOTS was reformed from the screen savers but they never were attempting to be the screen savers too. The critisism is pointless. Deal with the change somewhere else. <a href="../../../m/y/x/User%7EMyxomatosis_9c8d.html" title="User:Myxomatosis">Myxomatosis</a></p>
<p>The very fact that so many people have a problem with what the show has done makes it worth of inclusion in an encyclopedic entry. People who may not have ever watched TSS may watch AOTS, then go online and wonder exactly why some people are so upset. There are "criticism" sections in Wikipedia entries on tons of subjects. This one should stay. Whatever your personal opinions of the criticism, it exists. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambertman_d36c.html" title="User:Lambertman">Lambertman</a> 21:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A criticism section is needed, as there is a LOT of criticism of this show. You can't just have an article lavishly praising something if a huge chunk of its target audience doesn't like it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 02:35, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He's right, all I ever hear about this show, is blatant criticism. It is not bias to add a criticism page, if the majority seem to dislike the show.71.96.11.37 01:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it is not bias, and it is perfectly fine to have a criticism section but you need citations. So far every sentence needs it. You guys have a few days to get some, to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> or it will get deleted. <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonman72_ac5b.html" title="User:Konman72">Konman72</a> 09:00, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the critism section isn't too great but I do definitely have to agree with the first sentance "Opinions of the show are strongly divided. Many fans of The Screen Savers were angered by the change in the show's format from a "traditional" technology show to Attack of the Show's more pop culture based programming." It's definitely true. I've been a fan since the Screen Savers era and when the show started it was tech based but slowly did go to pop-culture. If you compare to where the show started and looked at it now you would definitely see it. You can't cite it because it just happened. What evidence can they bring? As far as the other parts I think they can go. -<a href="../../../m/y/x/User%7EMyxomatosis_9c8d.html" title="User:Myxomatosis">Myxomatosis</a> 09:11, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't matter if you or I agree with what it says.

<dd>you are missing the point. How are you going to cite the first part? You can't just be stubborn about things and do what you want. If thats the case then every sentance should be cited. It's truth. Calm down and work with everyone. I'm trying to meet you half way. It's not all about what you want. -<a href="../../../m/y/x/User%7EMyxomatosis_9c8d.html" title="User:Myxomatosis">Myxomatosis</a> 07:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not doing what I want, I'm following the rules. I actually agree with the whole section, but Wikipedia policy doesn't allow for it. Every sentence in that section needs citations. If you can't get them then they are not admissable into a Wikipedia entry. Read these, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and you should understand where I'm coming from. I'm not trying to be stubborn, I am just following the rules/policies set forth for <b>all</b> Wikipedia articles. In the words of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, <i>"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons."</i> -<b>posted by: <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonman72_ac5b.html" title="User:Konman72">Konman72</a></b></dd>

<p>Recently, someone has added a list of common criticisms about this show to the criticism section. In the beginning, it was somewhat bias, but I have taken the liberty of cleaning it up a bit. I think a small list of common criticisms is not a bad idea, so can anyone help?71.96.11.37 22:51, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think that the first paragraph was fine detailing that some fans didn't like the show due to the decline in technology content covered but I think the list was a bit overkill (and generally unverifiable). --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInaxdaze_dcc8.html" title="User:Inaxdaze">Inaxdaze</a> 01:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>True, but some of those criticisms I have seen constantly on AOTS related boards. The list of criticisms was originally shown in a very random/ bias manner, but I rephrased a good amount of them, and added quotations to many of the statements, for I have seen them quoted before. Still, you have a good point. I'll simply restore the former section, and if anyone wants to add some viable info to it, they can.71.96.11.37 16:54, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that the audition seciton is not as relevant anymore considering it's been a year and their is a 99% chance that none of the "contestants" will be announced as winner. Does anyone else agree with me that we should remove the section? -<a href="../../../m/y/x/User%7EMyxomatosis_9c8d.html" title="User:Myxomatosis">Myxomatosis</a> 05:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed last time that there was a complete list of segments that were there before AOTS started its new set. Now after they got back from E3 and the new set took effect, some of the segments are gone, both former and current. In order for a wii to be effective and accurate, ALL of the segments, including those that are deleted, should be listed. So somebody needs to add the deleted segments there please. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeishirou_Sakurazuka_2468.html" title="User:Seishirou Sakurazuka">Seishirou Sakurazuka</a> 05:04, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I cleaned up the section around that time and deleted segments that didn't need to be listed on the article. There were also a lot of segments listed that only happened once or twice. Also there were a lot of skits listed as well which are not segments. I think after a certain period of time old segments probably won't be relevant to the article. -<a href="../../../m/y/x/User%7EMyxomatosis_9c8d.html" title="User:Myxomatosis">Myxomatosis</a> 07:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be honest, I do not know why this was tagged as needing cleanup. I think the information is laid out pretty much as well as could be. I do feel that the History section needs work, but everything else looks fine (and the tables listing the show's features are quite excellent), so I don't think a cleanup tag on the aritcle as a whole is necessary. However, I am not going to simply remove it, as others may disagree with me. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I got the botmessage on my Talk Page when I logged in today, and it said that this <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show%21_9a0b.html" title="Attack of the Show!">article</a> needed cleanup. I checked it, thinking someone had shifted the tables all around or made all of the paragraphs single-sentence rambles... But it was essentially the same as it always was: tables in good shape, information about the cast, etc. This might never be a complete article (seeing as it airs 5 nights a week) but I don't think a "Cleanup" tag is necessary in this case. Maybe something more specific is required, but I would support deleting the tag. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColbeagleTheEagle_49b4.html" title="User:ColbeagleTheEagle">ColbeagleTheEagle</a> 01:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Still has the cleanup message, and I don't know why. It's not like the page is getting vandalized; it was put on Semi-Protection on <i>January 26th</i>. Any thoughts on this? The article can never really be "complete", since the show is an ongoing process. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColbeagleTheEagle_49b4.html" title="User:ColbeagleTheEagle">ColbeagleTheEagle</a> 20:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Probably not note worthy, but this Japanese writing flashes on the screen for a second during the new intro (actually, quite old now). It translates to "Attack of the Television Show!" -- タキテン 01:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well it flashed 3 times on the old intro and it had the same thing written, It was also on the promo and the basis of the theme for AOTS at the time of it's relaunch. --SU182 00:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
