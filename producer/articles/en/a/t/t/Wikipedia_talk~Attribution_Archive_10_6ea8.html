<p>What do people think about starting a roll out now? I think the recent points of contention might fall under attempts at polishing the finish rather than anything substantive?

<dd>Yes. I've just fixed the most obvious problems with it, but it still needs some work. For instance, it disagrees with this policy in regards to exactly when a self-published source may be used; I think it was written when the third exception was still included. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 13:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It also disagrees substantially on citation; and, in so doing, changes present policy.

<dd>Yes, it makes no sense to anyone who hasn't read the discussion at /archive9#Inline citations. Maybe we should postpone this issue of how to cite sources. the relevant section from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is simply "Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article." --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 00:04, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This sentence was replaced with "We encourage summarizing the cited material and moving long citations to footnotes, for clarity." I don't think it is the same as what PMAnderson intended, or maybe it is, but uhm still, what is the intention of this? I mean, what is the need for a policy to say this? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 22:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I have no strong opinion on either of them; I was attempting to satisfy the people who have a preference for footnotes over prose attribution. As long as they cover the same ground, as in the example now archived, it should be editorial discretion which to use.Prose attribution is often bad prose, and it is often a good idea to avoid it. Properly, that advice should be in the MoS, but it is harmless here. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Newspaper articles</span></h2>
<p>Newspaper articles are not automatically secondary sources. For example, a newspaper article of December 7, 1941, describing the attack on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl_Harbor_80b0.html" title="Perl Harbor">Perl Harbor</a> is a primary source, while a newspaper article comparing of that attack with the attack on 9/11 is a secondary source. Many editors confuse this and attribute the status of secondary source to <i>any</i> newspaper article. That is incorrect. That is why in the wording about sources, we need to show that a witness account of a traffic accident published in a newspaper, is a primary source, while the <i>analysis</i> of such traffic accident in a newspaper article is a secondary source. Subtle, but very significant distinction. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 16:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The recent edit to the Attribution proposed policy, adding "published in a newspaper" to "eyewitness account of a traffic accident", is an improvement for a reason other than pointing out that some newspaper stories are primary sources. It also emphasizes that Wikipedia can only use published sources. A person talking to a Wikipedia editor about a traffic accident is a primary source, but the account should not be included in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

After &lt;date&gt; WP:ATT will run concurrently with WP:V and WP:NOR as a policy for one week. During this period, it is hoped editors will familiarize themselves with the idea behind the merger. Suggesting policy innovations is not encouraged—ensuring WP:ATT matches WP:V and WP:NOR, in tighter form, is the purpose. One week after &lt;date&gt;, the historical tag will be placed on WP:V and WP:NOR, barring serious objection, and WP:ATT will become one of two content policies beside <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>."</dd>

<li>We should rephrase to make clear that the line here is whether reliable third-party sources <i>exist</i>, rather than whether we've gotten off our WikiDuff and cited them. There would never be any question that the NASA logo is attributable to third-party sources (starting, I should think, with the Britannica); the sentence is meant to exclude the sort of article that gets speedied as non-notable. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 03:34, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Jossi, I can't do it right now. I found multiple contradictions. Part of the problem is that it's too wordy and so contradictions creep in because the language isn't tight so people don't notice. Even the very beginning of it contradicted the policy by suggesting that we publish the "truth" about certain subjects, when the whole point of the content policies is to emphasize that we don't "do" truth. So the whole thing needs to be tightened in terms of the writing style, and edited to check that the spirit of the policies is adhered to, and to make sure that the letter of the policies isn't contradicted. I'll try to do some later tonight. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Jeff, it's probably not a good idea to do it right now, but very soon we'd like to replace RS with WP:ATT/FAQ, so that everything relating to sources is on ATT or its FAQ. The only reason I think we should wait a bit is that there are a small number of editors who seem very devoted to RS, so we'd need time to convince them that the page was really only moving rather than being abandoned entirely. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well for starters <i>convince</i> in change management terms is an extremely value laden term, if you're planning on being confrontational about rationalisation then you're starting the right way. Whilst I have no real problem with the concept of rationalisation I do have a big issue with what you're planning on trying to replace RS with, which is essentially a legacy version of RS which every contributor to this thread themselves criticised about four months ago. RS has moved on, it still needs a fair bit of work, but I have no big issue with where the guidance is.</dd>
<dd>First off, what authority do you envisage the FAQ actually having? In presentational terms it strikes me that it has less authority than even a guideline, and given that it's key to verifiability then I'd suggest it needs to carry the policy authority which it supports.</dd>
<dd>As badlydrawnjeff indicates, there is a need for content specific material to support the reliability debate. I've tried to raise that topic a number of times, gaining a resounding silence in terms of response. There are a number of possible approaches, which I've articulated already on the RS talk page.</dd>
<dd>I also think that there are a number of holes in the proposed policy in terms of sourcing, the uncritical acceptance of MSM as <i>reliable</i> coupled with the slavish adherence to peer review as a quality stamp is worrying.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia ..."</span></h2>
<p>I understand that this means that we cannot include something simply because it is true. It should be made clear that it doesn't apply in the other direction: we can ignore what one source says if other sources disagree and we know that those other sources are correct. For instance, generally-reliable source A may say that the Cruftyland Railroad opened in 1860, but another source that goes into more detail describes its construction up to its opening in 1861, and we have newspaper articles from 1860 and 1861 that confirm this. Either we ignore source A, or we are forced to include a statement like "source A says the railroad opened in 1860, but other sources say 1861" despite our knowledge of which is correct. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 05:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I follow your point, NE2. This principle is already in V; it isn't new. There is nothing new in here. It's all just summarized from the policies. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Basically, here is the key bit of policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. <i>"Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Then attribution is just a shorter word for "verifiable in this context means ..." During this transition week, it's better to only discuss things that might have changed. This issue raised here clearly has not changed. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 06:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think NE2's objection is that we have lost the discussion of "undue weight". <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> certainly doesn't have the phrase. Under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> if eight reliable sources say 1861, with documentation, and one source says 1860, without details, it's probably undue weight to include source A for what may well be a typo.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Due weight here <i>might</i> be "1861.&lt;ref&gt;B, C, D,....H; A lists as 1860 but gives no details&lt;/ref&gt;; but this is NE2's example, not mine, and there is a point <i>somewhere</i> where due weight is silence. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 06:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't get it, you have worked on this policy yourself, am I missing something? At the risk of pointing out the obvious: this policy doesn't replace <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. None of V and NOR mentions undue weight either, so again this is not an issue that has changed: your reasoning will still apply based on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 07:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess what I'm thinking is that I know what the sentence is saying but some people might not understand it, and think that it means that we should include every reputably published truth value of a statement, not just the one that we know to be correct. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 08:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It hasn't changed from V, and it's been there for a long time.

</dl>
<p>I would change the wording slightly from "attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true" to "attributable to a reliable published source, not <i>solely</i> whether it is true." The current construction implies that we don't have any problem with including actually false information, which is of course silly. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 01:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this is again a massive change from current policy. WP:V does not require the information to be true, really... I apologize for the following ridiculous example, but if we are going to verify whether the existence of God is true or not, we won't get anywhere. According to WP:V "verifiability" only means that any user can "verify" that what we say are really stated in the cited sources. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 05:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are you really suggesting that an editor who knowingly includes cited, but false, information, is helping write the encyclopedia? Information is superseded all the time, particularly in sciences (which is where we are most concerned about people interjecting crackpot "true" theories, incidentally) but also in social studies like history, where formerly prominent theories can fall by the wayside due to new and better research methods. (Case in point: the conventional wisdom used to be that 16th century sailors were in perpetually poor dental health, based on the exhumations of remains in sailors' cemeteries. Then the wreck of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Rose_f430.html" title="Mary Rose">Mary Rose</a> was raised, revealing what actually healthy Tudor sailors looked like. Any information from before the late 1980s on the subject is flat wrong, and unfit for inclusion in the encyclopedia, regardless of how many reliable sources allege it.) I actually agree with your last statement, "According to WP:V "verifiability" only means that any user can "verify" that what we say are really stated in the cited sources." That is absolutely correct. However, that only allows the statement, "According to Source <i>Y</i>, <i>X</i> is true," not "<i>X</i> is true." If we're going to say <i>X</i> is true, we need to have a good faith basis for believing that <i>X</i> is true. In the example cited above, there's no reason to provide the 1860 date at all. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 16:20, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To summarize, I think that truth is a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for including data, just as verifiability is necessary but not sufficient. (Cf. WP:NPOV on including verifiable but extreme minority viewpoints.) I think that's always been <i>implicit</i> in the policy, and making it explicit isn't a "massive change" at all. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 16:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blogs published by reliable-source outlets</span></h2>
<p>Very nice idea to merge the two policies. Just one question so far: Some of the wording implies that blogs are usually or always self-published: <i>"Self-published sources, such as blogs, must never be used as third-party sources about living persons, even if the author is a well-known professional researcher or writer."</i> There are a growing number of corporations and reputable media outlets whose websites include blogs. For example, the New York Times now has a few: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/topnews/blog-index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/topnews/blog-index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/ref/topnews/blog-index.html</a> . Microsoft and Adobe are examples of companies which use official, employee-written blogs, as outreach techniques. The level of editorial oversight might vary, but probably in at least some of these cases it's as high as it is for anything else published by the organization. Would it be fair to say, "<i>"Self-published sources<s>, such as blogs,</s> must never be used as third-party sources about living persons, even if the author is a well-known professional researcher or writer."</i>? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 08:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>It generally seems like a bad idea for Wikipedia to prejudice itself against a whole <i>medium of publication</i>, namely blogs. After all, we would not want others to be prejudiced against Wikipedia solely because it is online. Individuals' or group blogs should be considered similarly to other published sources of similar scale. For some blogs, that means treating them like a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanzine.html" title="Fanzine">fanzine</a>; for others, it means treating them like a newspaper. For that matter, many small-town newspapers are on about the same level of reliability as many news-oriented blogs .... --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 07:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blogs are not a medium. Reliability as a published source for the purposes of Wikipedia is based on factors involving fact-checking and lack of conflict of interest and past history of accuracy and objective editorial mechanisms.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary / Secondary sources and 'original research'</span></h2>
<p>The current text states that, "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible." In general this is certainly true, but there is a particular type of text where I strongly disagree with it. When talking about the content of a primary source (such as a book, play, transcript, et cetera), with no interpretations or conclusions, it seems to me to make more sense to cite that primary source directly than to cite a secondary source which itself quotes or references the primary. For interpretations you need a secondary source, but for simple citation the primary is the place to go. For example, a statement that "Call me Ishmael" is the first sentence of the story, should be sourced directly to <i>Moby Dick</i>... not some secondary source which says the same thing. This would seem self evident, but 'wherever possible' would argue for taking a secondary source first. In the past that wording has been 'interpreted' to argue that primary sources should be avoided. There is a sentence in the previous text explaining that the 'wherever possible' wording, "means that we present verifiable accounts of views and arguments of reliable scholars, and not interpretations of primary source material by Wikipedians"... but that clarifying sentence (that 'wherever possible' is meant for views/arguments/interpretations - not simple factual citations) has not been copied over.</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to keep it short I'd suggest changing the wording to something like, "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources <i>for analysis and interpretation</i> wherever possible." That maintains the intent of the existing policy without the additional sentence.</p>
<p>Another bit of lost text is, "However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged." I think it is important to include this for the frequent cases where people claim, incorrectly, that such collections are 'original research'. Per this lost sentence, pages that collect information from multiple reliable sources into a 'unique' (not previously published) list are NOT original research. Which is good... because otherwise almost all of our <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">Featured lists</a> would have to go. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your first point, but think that the change would be an innovation and should be held-off on. And "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources <i>for analysis and interpretation</i> wherever possible" accidentally leaves the barn door open. <b>All</b> analysis and interpretation should be attributed to reliable, published secondary sources, not merely when possible (if it's not possible, don't add it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second point is, I think , a corollary to "original prose, not original research". Articles ought to bring sources together in a unique way; they just shouldn't advance any unique ideas. I'm wondering if there should a section for this (note there's one at the bottom of the FAQ now) but am worried about bulk here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My interpretation of "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible" is that articles ordinarily should state conclusions and interpretations about the topic, which in turn requires secondary sources. The dumping of raw facts, which is what you get from primary sources, does not usually lead to worthwhile articles (but there can be exceptions). That's why it says "should" and not "must".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for "original prose, not original research", my attitude is good, free, information is the main goal, and if we can achieve that by copying a public-domain or other free source word-for-word, do it.

<p>Apologies. I don't have a lot of time at the moment to study this closely, but a cursory glance suggests that a few of points I've relied on in the past will no longer be there. (I do, however, think this merger is excellent and really reallly appreciate the clarity and organization.)</p>
<p>I've always liked this definition of secondary sources: "The informed and expert interpretation, interpolation, extrapolation or corroboration of primary sources to synthesize a conclusion." It seems like the new policy opens up the use of tertiary sources more than previously. Here's how it was constrained before: "Tertiary sources can be used for names, spellings, locations, dates and dimensions." Also, I thought this section in wp:nor was important: "Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:nor#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:nor#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>In reply to TimidGuy, using a good tertiary source is better than having no article on a subject. I think it's better to provide free access to information that is good enough than to ignore any topic unless some editor can produce a superb article on the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for scientific research, it is not feasible to limit ourselfs to academic peer-reviewed journals. We would have to eliminate sources such as <i>Scientific American</i> and the science section of the <i>New York Times</i>, the web sites of high-tech companies, and other useful sources. We would also have to eliminate textbooks, so we couldn't write about the fundamentals of science, only the topics that have been the focus of research within the time-span of the editor's journal collection. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 17:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Marskell. Good to know that's there. And good points, Gerry. The examples you cite would fall under the guideline for non-schoarly sources, and hence be admissible. But wp:rs is fairly clear in requiring peer review for scholarly sources: "The material has been thoroughly vetted by the scholarly community. This means published in peer-reviewed sources, and reviewed and judged acceptable scholarship by the academic journals." The merger notice said there wouldn't be major revisions in the merger, just a reorganization. So I assume that the intent is still to maintain this standard of peer review for published scientific studies.</p>
<p>I see in a thread above that the FAQ is still a work in progress, so maybe this is yet to be incorporated. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimidGuy_f7a8.html" title="User:TimidGuy">TimidGuy</a> 19:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TimidGuy wrote at the beginning of this secton "Also, I don't see the stipulation that scientific research that's referenced should have been published in an academic journal and peer-reviewed." I don't see any <b>stipulation</b> in [[WP:RS] about scientific research having to come from scholarly sources, only a description of scholarly and non-scholarly sources. There are some recommendations on the <b>inactive</b> page <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_examples_c543.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources/examples">Wikipedia:Reliable sources/examples</a>, but they don't carry to much weight considering the page is inactive.</dd>
<dd>Also, remember that "Reliable sources" is a guideline, while "Attribution" is a policy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes</span></h2>
<p>Centrx, could you say what you're trying to achieve with your edits, please? The problem is that some of the edits actually change the policy (as in V or NOR), and we've been extremely careful not to do that here. WP:ATT is simply a merger of V and NOR. Although there's a consensus to merge them, there's no consensus to change them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are three separate sorts of changes:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The third paragraph states that this is one of two core content policies. As a policy, this is not established without broader advertisement that this merger is in fact happening, now, and consensus for it.</li>
<li>There are several purely formal changes to spelling and grammar, which do not change the meaning and in regard to tone are more similar to the tone of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. These changes are much less significant than the many minor textual changes that have been made in the merger of the pages.</li>
<li>There are a few somewhat less minor changes which can be delayed in the interest of making the purity of the merge clearer, but which should be changed in the future and discussed if there are problems with them.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Foundation</span></h2>
<p>I haven't read too much into the history of this effort, but a quick search of the word "Foundation" in the talk archives hasn't really shown me what the Foundation's reaction to this has been. If I recall correctly from my quick glances, some people said it wasn't technically a Foundation issue. Even if it is not technically a Foundation issue it's still a big change (well, not really "change", but update), and I'd really like to know what their thoughts are on this. I know a lot of this kind of stuff is up to us to figure out, and we don't have to "ask mommy and daddy" every time we want to change something, but I am surprised at the lack of talk about the Foundation's involvement in the past discussion.

<dd>I don't think that combining/merging the two existing policies, WP:NOR and WP:V, is a fundamental or substantive change that requires the Foundation's blessing. It is more a formatting change, which makes the content policy easier to work on consistenly and coherently.

<dd>This issue of whether inline citations are needed is not changed by this policy, so the balance shouldn't have shifted on way or the other. It is still up to the quality assurance projects like GA or FA to decide how detailed or fine-grained attribution they require. In my opinion, <i>the phrase "challenged or likely to be challenged" should ensure that you don't need to cite every statement.</i> --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 06:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eventually every fact on Wikipedia should have an inline citation. Many articles start with one general reference - I do that too - but it is bad practice, because in the end the article will have to be brought up to the inline citations for every fact standard. Therefore I would actually advice to discard the entire phrase 'challenged or likely to be challenged'. Everything is 'like to be challenged' - with some commons sense in it (nobody should demand sources for styllistical changes). 'Editors should provide attribution for quotations and for any material' [they add] is much better then 'Editors should provide attribution for quotations and for any material' [challenged or likely to be challenged].--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 22:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kind of confusing</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I just read through this, and I find it kind of confusing. I guess the thing that threw me off in the beginning was the usage of "attribution". The way I see it, the difference between "verifying" and "attributing" is that when you verify something, you just list your source somewhere (preferably inline), and are free to state whatever it is as a fact. On the other hand, attribution (as explained in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) involves actually giving credit to the source in the structure of the sentence (e.g. "According to X, Y", "X said Y"), thus avoiding stating Y as a fact.</p>
<p>The current version of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> lists attributability as an aspect of reliability and gives another explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Attributability</b>—The more we know about the originator, either organisation or individual, of source material, the better. This helps us measure the authority of the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other thing that throws me off is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> don't seem that closely related to me. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says you need sources and talks about sources are acceptable, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is more about what you can do with those sources.</p>
<p>Anyways, maybe it will make more sense if I read through it on another day.</p>

<dd>I guess I am confused about the meaning of "attributability" as it is used in the context of this proposal. Perhaps someone could write a short definition in the intro? Also, attribution, as I understand it to be used in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, is something you generally do when the source is biased or less than ideally reliable, or the statement is disputed.

<li><i>Indicates the source of information</i></li>
<li><i>assigning some quality or character to a person or thing; "the attribution of language to birds"; "the ascription to me of honors I had not earned"</i></li>
<li><i>assigning to a cause or source; "the attribution of lighting to an expression of God's wrath"; "he questioned the attribution of the painting to Picasso"</i></li>
<li><i>In journalism attribution is the identification of the source of reported information.

In investigative journalism important news stories often depend on such information.</i></li>

<dd>From the 1st and 3rd definitions you gave, attribution sounds a lot like verification, although it is possible I am not picking up on the fine distinctions. In the final definition you gave, however, wouldn't it be better to avoid using a variation of the word in the definition? It is also entirely possible that this entire thing will make more sense to me when my head is clearer. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 03:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are such an experienced Wikipedia contributor that when you think about verification, you are actually talking about attribution. My definition of attribution is the following.
<dl>
<dd>Attribution is the means to ensure "that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The above is WP:V's definition of verifiability, and while attribution might have some problems, it is nowhere as confusing as calling the above process verifiability. Again, for experienced editors, the term "verifiability" simply means attribution, so this renaming may simply take time to get use to; but I think using "attribution" to describe this process is more accurate. In the world outside Wikipedia verifiability doesn't mean "that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." In the world outside Wikipedia, verifiability has strong connections to notions of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_truth.html" title="Absolute truth">absolute truth</a>, and this causes much confusion. <i>So this policy is simply using the right dictionary word to describe what we, Wikipedians, mean when we talk about verification.</i> --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 06:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyways, WP:ATT is starting to make more sense to me. &#160;: ) However, given the controversy over whether reliability is on/off and can be determined with a checklist, or whether it is a flexible thing to be determined relative to the material being cited, I am not sure this much information on reliability should be covered in a policy.

<dd>Whilst I'm not a fan of the <i>according to...</i> form of words I think you've got it. A single item can be sourced adequately and is attributable although it may not be reliable, an article made up of appropriately sourced material is attributable but may or may not be inherently reliable. Essentially source quality is what is missing from the proposal at the moment.</dd>
<dd>I'd agree with Merzul that in the vast majority of fairly vanilla, non-contentious, topic areas then people have a gut feel for what is reliable and what is not. In the more contentious areas, where source reliability is an issue, then the current wording is weak; gut feel is wholly inappropriate where different people will feel differently about source quality. Weaker quality sourcing needs a bit more caveating around it in the text though.</dd>

<dd>I think the whole plagiarism example is ambiguous. It's meant to be illustrating the point that given points A and B which have reliable sources, you can't a new point C if this argument has not been made in the sources. However, it's not at all clear from the example what points A, B and C are meant to be, particularly as the plagiarism case it is based on is quite complicated. As a result, different people have repeatedly been coming to different conclusions about what the example is trying to say.</dd>

<dd>"In Northtown there were 1000 violent crimes last year<sup>Reliable source 1</sup>, whereas in Southtown there were 2000 violent crimes in the same period<sup>Reliable source 2</sup>. Therefore there is more violent crime in Sorthtown than Northtown<sup>No source</sup>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Under the attribution policy, the conclusion that there is more violent crime in Southtown than Northtown is not permitted, where it is not backed up by an appropriate source. This is because coming to a conclusion like this requires careful consideration of the source data; for example, the two statistics might have been calculated in different ways, or using different definitions of which crimes are violent or not. Wikipedia is not in a position to verify this background research itself. Instead, a conclusion must be attributed to a reputable source, unless it is very straightforward and uncontroversial.</dd>

<dd>Right, and people have had five months to view the proposal. The purpose with running concurrently should be obvious: we couldn't just up and redirect V and NOR.

<dd>First, the proposal has changed. If people have had five months to view the same proposal, it could have been implemented several months ago. Second, in those five months there are numerous people who thought either "I don't care to become deeply involved in the formation of this; I will review it when it is actually done." or "This is going to fail anyway, as many proposals have failed in the past, so there is no reason to bother with it." Running concurrently gains no extra exposure unless the proposal is advertised, which is being done, and, even after acceptance for the page, there is no need for them to run concurrently. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistorical_f63d.html" title="Template:Historical">historical</a>}} for a while, for at least the week in which you proposed to run them concurrently. Doing that would gain more exposure even purely on these three pages; currently, there isn't even any message about a merger at the top of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> front pages, which is the only way you could transition people over.

<dd>The proposal has changed <i>to mimic current policy exactly</i>; there are no innovations to review. The principal reason to have the policy tag on while it's being announced on WT:V etc., is that people will be less likely to try and introduce changes. The policy tag forces stability on the page. But it would've been too early to redirect V and NOR at the point of announcement. Hence the three at once.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">For Centrx</span></h3>
<p>Centrx, please get on board with this. The merge of V and NOR has widespread consensus; in over two years of editing, it's the thing that attracted the second largest number of e-mails I've had over any single issue, all of them very postive, very enthusiastic. And on-wiki, I don't think I've seen any negative responses, except for you and one or two others; and yet, I feel you probably also support it in principle.</p>
<p>All that has happened here is that, instead of having the words spread out over two pages, they are now on one; the writing has been tightened; we've gotten rid of the word "verifiability," a word that caused a lot of confusion, because it was the wrong word to describe checking source material; we've found a word instead — attribution — that incorporates the idea "don't add OR but not every single sentence needs a source," which is "material must be <i>atttributable</i>, but need not actually be <i>attributed</i>."</p>
<p>That's it. There are no actual changes to policy. Everything that mattered in NOR and V has been carried over to ATT (and if you feel that a principle you relied on while editing has been left out, please tell us). Policy pages do have to remain stable, especially the core content policies; we can't have them being constantly tweaked. Therefore, instead of arguing about issues of detail here and there, can you say overall what your fundamental objection is? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Centrx, forget about RS for the time being, because this page isn't seeking to incorporate RS. Everything in RS that matters was taken from V and NOR. (I know this because I was the one who originally added them to ensure RS, V and NOR were consistent with one another, and I've made sure the consistency issue didn't deteriorate too much.)

<dd>Centrx, the proposal has been worked on by 84 editors in four months; 157 editors have taken part on the talk page; the proposal has been posted several times to V, NOR, RS, the village pump, AN, AN/I, the mailing list, the Foundation, and there has been an RfC. I've received a ton of e-mails about it — and even a three-man barnstar. It's a good proposal! That doesn't mean it can't be tweaked, but any tweaking (a) must improve the writing; (b) must be completely consistent with NOR and V; and (c) mustn't inadvertently introduce any new issue. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to admit that I was caught unawares by this merge proposal as well. I try very hard to stay up-to-date on policy changes, but Wikipedia's a big place, and it's difficult to keep track of everything. If I don't have my watchlist set on the right page, something can completely slip by. And more often than not, I'm not spending time at the policy talkpages, because I'm spending time actually writing articles. &#160;;) For something this big, I guess I would have expected an announcement in the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">Signpost</a>, but I scanned through all the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Signpost_Archives_2006_4a64.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Archives/2006">headlines over the last year</a>, and haven't seen anything related to "Attribution." So, I'd recommend making a big deal about this merge in an upcoming issue of the Signpost, to ensure that everyone's aware of it. Also, could you please provide links to some of the above discussions that you mention, so that I can get caught up?

<dl>
<dd>The removed item in question (type-of-article based criteria for reliable source, like pop culture) was not and is not part of V or NOR but instead is currently handled by IAR. There is difficulty in getting a concensus on how to word as policy the kinds of things that in actual practice are let "slide by" in terms of sourcing, especially when IAR is working just fine (or so some think). Some wanted one wording, others another wording, others perfered IAR. Some wanted tight wording while others wanted loose guidance and principles. We <b>all</b> wanted to steamline two policies into one. We are now doing that. This is a good thing. All the discussion is in the archives.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Capable of being supported</span></h2>
<p>Doc, your point about the difference between something being attributed and being attributable is well taken and lies at the heart of this policy. But in the sections you changed, the word "supported" doesn't mean it must actually be attributed in the text, simply that the source, whatever it is, must actually support the edit that is being made. That is, the edit mustn't go beyond the source material. Whether the source is added is a separate matter. But a source that supports the edit must exist, otherwise it's OR. To add "capable of supporting it" says the same thing, but it seems to weaken it somehow, and as the extra words aren't necessary, I'm hoping we can leave them out. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:06, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This page merely codifies what is already expected of editors and told them across a number of other policies. WP:ATT has long been enforced on the project.

<p>How are the advocates of this as policy intending on dealing with precedent established in the extant policies?

<dd>The main argument was that when an editor checks a source they are not "verifying" info as such, but simply checking that the info has been attributed to a reliable source. I'm not in a position to verify the content of a <i>Nature</i> article; I can only demand that "the Sun is hot" be attributed to one. Attributability? Bit of a clunker, but maybe better. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 07:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I think the name is good, and any confusion will be cleared away in a short time, as people get used to it. Verifiability is somewhat of a misnomer, as has been pointed out. "Attributability, not truth" sounds a lot less confusing to me. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm thinking more of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>: I think I've seen lots of times when someone is advancing some private theory. Telling them that wikipedia is not the place for such "original research" is the most direct way of dealing with that problem. Yes, we can tell them that they need to attribute it. But when that argument ultimately is challenged ("I don't need to attribute it because I know it to be true" or "it is obvious"), we ultimately have to invoke the principle of "no original research". <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 16:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Missing language from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></span></h2>
<p>This is much weaker on the sourcing requirements than <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's especially wobbly on the removal of unsourced material. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has a whole section on burden of evidence, and that unsourced material may be removed at any time, and the onus of sourcing is on people who want to include the information. The key principles here says "Any unsourced material may be removed," but this is undermined by the later section that says "not all edits need a source, and this policy should never be used to cause disruption by removing material for which reliable sources could easily or reasonably be found." It essentially <i>encourages</i> the inclusion of unsourced material, rather than recognizing it as something undesirable that we'd rather not have but need to keep around to avoid disruption. There needs to be much stronger language supporting those who remove unsourced information. People should not be able to point to a policy that says "material must be attributable" and claim it as justification for not actually attributing their material. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 01:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, this seems to be a major change from current policy, not simply part of a merger. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) I think it's a good thing to discourage people from <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTedly</a> going through Wikipedia and removing material that is likely true just because it doesn't have a footnote yet, but the current wording goes too far. As written it would discourage editors from removing dubious claims unless they are outright <i>absurd</i>, which is a very high standard.</dd>
<dd>Boldly moving questionable material to talk is highly desirable in some circumstances, particularly on little-edited pages, where misleading claims can sit around for months with a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag.

<dd>I believe that the goal is for the first two paragraphs here to clearly state that all material <b>must</b> be attributable. Would the addition of another sentence, reiterating this, help clarify the later part about not disrupting WP?

<dd>I think it is a question of tone rather than any real difference in poIicy.

<dd>I don't see that there is really much difference between the two policies. The following is from this policy:
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publisher of original thought. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true. Wikipedia is not the place to publish your own opinions, experiences, or arguments.</dd>
<dd>Although everything in Wikipedia must be attributable, in practice not all material is attributed. Editors should provide attribution for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged. The burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>
<dl>
<dd>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</dd>
<dd>...The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>We could add "or it may be removed" to the fifth sentence in the quote from <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> to make it more parallel, but the fact that it may be removed is already clearly implied by the "burden of evidence" sentence. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 21:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The current one only says "should," the old one says "needs," implication isn't enough, the necessity of sources needs to be explicit. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 23:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To use the distinction ATT makes: Original research needs to be removed; unsourced material needs to be <i>sourced</i>. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 16:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But this seems to say if you can't find a source, leave it and wait for someone else, instead of taking it out pending a source, which is better practice. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Night Gyr and have boldly made the change back to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> emphasis on "source it or remove it". <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
