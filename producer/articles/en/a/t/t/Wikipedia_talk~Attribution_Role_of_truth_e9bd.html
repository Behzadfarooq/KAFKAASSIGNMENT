	    <p>This <b>Role of truth</b> page provides a forum for Wikipedia editors to explore Wikipedia's <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_definition.html" title="Operational definition">operational relationship</a> to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. Some of these discussions could occur on the TalkPages of the individual <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable source</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a> policy pages. But generally on the TalkPages of these policy pages, the discussion would be primarily focussed on improving the policy text. Here, in contrast, we explore various patterns in how those policy pages actually manifest in practice from the problems of the "role of truth" as editors strive to improve Wikipedia pages ranging from <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aardvark.html" title="Aardvark">Aardvark</a> to <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zenith.html" title="Zenith">Zenith</a>, and more.</p>
<p>This particular branch of this discussion began during the discussions on the development of the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution policy page</a>. And initially, this discussion page serves to pull together the discussion on the "role of truth" where the questions arise <i>from the context</i> of examining attribution policy, but where the discussion relates to the "role of truth" and not necessarily to the decisions that must be made about the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution policy page</a>.</p>

<p>So how do we make sure that assertions in articles on living people are <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a>? It seems to me that we have to depend on the published opinions of the reliable sources within any discipline to judge whether any other particular source has verified their facts. That is, for example, in the assertion of facts about a living person, we should make sure that some secondary source has used the assertion of a primary source in a way that implies that the secondary source as a professional within that particular discipline has verified the assertion of the primary source. We could work out this <i>verifiability</i> algebra for any particular Wikipedia page as case-in-point, if you wish. Just attributing the opinion to a reliable source is not enough -- because what is a reliable source that the statement was made may <i>not</i> be a reliable source for whether the statement in the opinion is true. <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> matters, and we must depend on secondary reliable sources to assess that truth for us. And <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> matters much more for living persons than it does for the interesting and fascinating rumors on <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespearean_authorship_question.html" title="Shakespearean authorship question">whether or not Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 20:26, 26 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118085807" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118085807" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>Does truth matter? In the extreme case of some secret truth about a famous person. Would we let a whistle-blower publish that secret truth on Wikipedia? Of course we wouldn't. It's a secret so it has not been precviously published and no attribution is possible.</dd>
<dd>If on the other hand there is a lie which has been widely published, by reliable sources, then that could be included in Wikipedia, along with it's refutation, if that has also been published.

However, the vanadlism itself got quite a bit of play in the South Dakota media and this Bruno guy and is outlandish claims have gotten <a href="http://www.sdmoderate.com/2006/08/14/the-delusional-world-of-ajay-bruno/" class="external text" title="http://www.sdmoderate.com/2006/08/14/the-delusional-world-of-ajay-bruno/" rel="nofollow">significant coverage by blogs</a>. The story about the vandalism is "widely published" yet it is not mentioned in the article, because it gives undue weight.

<p>Your "false" and my "true" may coincide. But of course you've had that pointed out to you enough times now, and simply ignore it. The conflict on WP:V is between those who believe that there is an "objective" truth and those who more realistically believe "truth" is negotiated among people. Wikipedia reflects the latter notion, at least in principle. If you don't like it, you really need to consider whether you should find a fork that believes in a truth you're more comfortable with. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice point. Do you think we could usefully and simply include the breadth of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page in this policy definition? Does "Verifiability, not truth" <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_definition.html" title="Operational definition">operationally</a> mean "Verifiability, but represent faithfully the standard of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> used by the Reliable Source's profession"? What do you think? I would appreciate working this out with you comparing the professions of say <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecular_biology.html" title="Molecular biology">molecular biology</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, two different <a href="../../../o/l/o/Ology.html" title="Ology">-ologies</a> with different standards of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. Don't you think Wikipedia does a tremendous job of representing faithfully the corresponding standards of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> on many of the appropriate pages? But there seem to be troubled waters at some of the intersections of the two rivers of, shall we call it, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth"><i>la vérité</i></a> for want of a better term.

<dd>In reply to Grace Note: I'll try to do a better job of demonstrating my understanding (such as it is) of others' arguments. I think you mean that I may believe something is false while you believe that the same thing is true. Of course I realize that that kind of thing happens frequently. I'm sorry that I only have partial understanding of what you're trying to say next. You seem to be saying that there is a split between those who believe in objective truth and those who don't believe there is such a thing as objective truth. No, wait, I don't think that's what you mean. I think more likely you mean that everyone actually thinks there's a real world out there with specific characteristics, although we don't necessarily know what they are, but when doing things like writing an encyclopedia there's no use trying to get everyone to agree on what the objective truth is, so a subjective truth is negotiated instead. Sorry, that doesn't sound quite right either. The fact is, I don't quite know what you mean, or how specifically that applies to the wording of the policy. You think I might be happier on some other forum; actually, I like Wikipedia a lot.</dd>

<dd>Of course I understand that editors will often disagree about what is or is not true, and that the Verifiability or Attribution policy helps save a lot of time because people don't have to keep arguing about what is true, which is sometimes a short, effective discussion but sometimes goes on and on with nobody being persuaded of anything, but they can just see whether the material is in an acceptable source or not. I have no problem with that and am not trying to change that. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further reply: In a given situation, if there are no misunderstandings (as there often are), it's possible to establish to what extent each editor believes something to be true, and whether it's stated in an acceptable source. I think getting agreement on "OK, you believe it's false and I believe it's true" is fairly easy, probably easier than finding an acceptable source, and much easier than arguing until both editors agree on it, which could go on for several lifetimes if it's something like the existence of God. When there's disagreement, usually the editors insert prose attributions, and everybody is satisfied that the Wikipedia article is not asserting false statements. None of this logically requires that Wikipedia policy say any more than "whether it is attributable to a reliable source," period. Saying "not whether it is true" is unnecessary. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rednblu, that's a very interesting point. I think Wikipedia does quite well in that sense on scientific pages, particularly the technical ones. It presents the SPOV quite faithfully, mostly because those pages are written by practitioners. Few are going to find that exceptionable because, apart from blanket statements, few opposing viewpoints are available on specific subjects (what I mean is, many people do not believe that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, but they have not taken a view on <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplodocus.html" title="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a> specifically, so they are not represented in that article). Even if one thought that was problematic, I cannot see any hope of winning the discussion over it. I think that articles of that type have in any case a kind of synthetic truth. They are written in the language of science about science. The language of science can be taken as axiomatic for those articles. If you allow the language of science to be axiomatic, you allow the articles as true so long as they follow from that language. If you do not allow it, you do not allow that the articles are true. I think we should state that explicitly though and not pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>Our pages on "pseudoscience" are presented in the same light though, which is problematic, and I know that you have written about that. The same is true of pages on religion, which is presented from a rather nonneutral position. In neither of these areas is it as clear that we are using a particular language or standard as an axiom. We seem to be writing from a much broader reference point.</p>
<p>The position of most of the policy writers here creates a de facto operational definition of truth, without stating that openly (which is something I take issue with in the discussion on reliable sources at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_and_undue_weight_ff95.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources and undue weight">Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources_and_undue_weight</a>). Ultimately, we take the position that what the MSM reports, what scientific papers state and academics write is, if not true, <i>correct</i>, and anything else is not. I don't think a truly NPOV encyclopaedia can take any stand on the truth, and our policies on NPOV and sourcing are poor in this regard <i>if our aim is truly to be neutral</i> rather than to reflect the status quo wisdom of the day. For me, this devalues Wikipedia, making it simply a poor man's Britannica. But most editors here seem quite happy to be poor man's encyclopaedians, and run scared from vision or challenge. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coppertwig, I am saying that we cannot address objective truth because no such thing exists. I think you have entirely missed my point, which is that you cannot legislate against including "false" information if there is no way to measure what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>Here is an example. The article on the battle of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Englefield%2C_Berkshire_01be.html" title="Englefield, Berkshire">Englefield, Berkshire</a> said (before I corrected it) that the Saxons were led by King Alfred. They were led by Aethelwulf, a local noble. But were they? There are sources that say so, and I can attribute my edit to them (if I have to; naturally, facts like this are rarely attributed in Wikipedia). But if someone were to reinsert that the forces were led by Alfred, what then?</p>
<p>Have they included "false" information? I cannot know. My sources say Aethelwulf but I don't <i>know</i> that. It might be me who has inserted false information.</p>
<p>I recognise in your reply that you are trying to suggest that the policy should emphasise that I need only be able to attribute my claim. Which I agree with. But you are claiming elsewhere that we should not be explicit that we do not make claims to truth. I think it is <b>essential</b> that we do not.</p>
<p>Think about my example. Think about what it means for it to be true that Aethelwulf led the Saxons. There must be an "objective reality" (we'll allow that for argument's sake). There must have been events in Englefield in 870. But who owns the truth about it? What if Aethelwulf wrote a memoir? Would that be "true"? How can you know? See my note to rednblu above: where our articles are based on subject-specific quasi-axiomatic languages, there is a possibility of referring to the "truth", so long as the "truth" is understood to be wholly dependent on the axioms in question. Otherwise, it is pointless to talk about it <i>at all</i>, except to warn as strongly as we can that we are not dealing in it here.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><span id="measuring_truth">I would argue</span> from a different perspective. I'd say that in many cases (excluding matters of personal taste for instance) there <i>does</i> exist an objective truth, but our access to the truth is limited, as is our ability to agree on what the truth consists of. Our requirement of attribution, reliable sources, no original research that can't be independently verified, these things are our way to "measure" truth. They serve the goal of approaching the truth to the extent that we are able to do so, and they also serve the purpose of giving skeptical readers the opportunity to look at the evidence to support the various perspectives including the main/central one if such a dominant view exists. They also allow for further research by those looking for a deeper or broader view of the subject. I agree that we don't want to assert that the contents of the encyclopedia are "true," especially not that they are undisputedly true... they are only true to the extent that we can point to our sources and attempt to represent reliable info. But we <i>also</i> don't want to claim that we are entirely unconcerned with the truth. That's not actually the case. If we didn't care at all about truth/accuracy, then we wouldn't bother to require attribution at all. We would permit outright fabrication, deliberate distortion, and fanciful lies if we had no interest whatsoever in truth, or if we really believed that no such thing as truth exists.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 08:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since some people seem to think the "not truth" wording is problematic, how about the following phrasing?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether you personally know it to be true.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's what it has always meant anyway: that information has to be confirmable externally (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) and that someone else has to have cared to write it down (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>). That Coppertwig and similar arguers keep bringing up this problem shows just how confusing the previous oxymoronic wording (Truth, not truth) was and exactly why we needed to make this change. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 04:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

What it meant then was "your belief that a statement in an article is true is not enough; it has to be possible to check the statement is accurate; providing sources enables this to happen". What it has become in WP:ATT is more like "we don't care whether a statement in an article is true or accurate; all we care about is whether we can find someone who said it". --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 18:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The principle <i>"Verifiability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion"</i> is fundamental to Wikipedia; however, I think that wording it as <i>"Attributability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion"</i> is less confusing for new users. This is simply because of the English language; in normal usage, "verifiability" refers to something that is certifiably true, while "attributability" refers to something that can be ascribed to a source, whether it is true or not. This better encapsulates the basis of the dictum in question. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 09:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think that's a very good point.. the phrase <i>"Attributability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion"</i> seems much better. The word "verifiability" is open to a little more interpretation - for example, i can verify lots of things that shouldn't be included in wikipedia. i understand that in wikipedia jargon "verifiable" implies a reliable source, but in the english language it does not. the word "attributable", on the other hand, is much less ambiguous. it also makes it more clear what is meant by "not truth". <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 15:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But that is what is wrong. If it can be attributed even if it is obviously not correct then it should not be in Wikipedia except as part of quotations or NPOV balance. If I find someone saying the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Volunteer_Force_%281912%29_fc35.html" title="Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)">Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)</a> was established in 1912 (it was in fact in 1913), I am not going to include it except to point out the error. It is not good enough the respond that a source containing errors is not a reliable source, as that simply shifts verifiability a level. Accuracy through verifiability is the key. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 18:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm moving the following comments of mine here from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Role of truth</a>. I apologize for my role in creating two ongoing threads on the same topic and hope to merge the two threads here. From the above comments I get the impression that perhaps the users commenting above don't understand the issue I'm raising.</p>
<p><br />
Septentrionalis, you have a good point. The sentence "Not everything which is attributable is worthy of inclusion" is not a very effective solution to the problem. I may disagree with you about whether that sentence would solve the particular examples I mention, but I'll mention below another example where that sentence would do little or no good.</p>
<p>The problem is: The words "attributable ... not whether it is true" do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-emphasize that material that is true but not attributable is not acceptable; and</li>
<li>Suggest that material that is attributable but known to be false is acceptable, even as plain statements (i.e. without prose attribution).</li>
</ol>
<p>The original wording "verifiability, not truth" did only the first of those two things. When the word "verifiability", which includes "truth" in its meaning, is removed, the second of these two things comes into play. I think the writers of this policy generally intend only the first of the two things, and that the second comes in by accident. I attempted to hold a poll to see whether anyone actually supports the second of the two things, but apparently I didn't explain clearly enough the purpose of the poll. I would like to find wording that does the first thing just as effectively but that doesn't do the second thing.</p>
<p>For reference, the current version of the sentence on the longstanding policy page is</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>and the current version of the sentence on this proposed policy page is</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true."</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Possible alternative wordings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just delete <i>"not whether it is true"</i>. Once <i>"verifiability"</i> is gone, those words are unnecessary.</li>
<li>Revert to the original <i>"verifiability, not truth"</i>.</li>
<li>As <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">User:DCB4W</a> suggested: <i>"...not solely whether it is true"</i>.</li>
<li><i>"...not merely whether it is true."</i></li>
<li><i>"Being true is not enough."</i></li>
<li><i>"Some true material does not belong."</i></li>
<li><i>"All material must be attributable."</i></li>
<li><i>"If it's not attributable, it does not belong."</i></li>
<li><i>"...otherwise, it does not belong in Wikipedia."</i></li>
<li><i>"...; only such material is acceptable."</i></li>
<li><i>"...without this, it cannot be included."</i></li>
<li><i>"...; proving that something is true does not get it included."</i></li>
<li><i>"...; however, false or contentious material requires prose attributions (see WP:NPOV)."</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Would other users please suggest other alternative wordings that attempt to do the first thing I list above but not the second? Also, please comment on my analysis and whether the second thing is coming in by accident or is actually wanted as Wikipedia policy. Perhaps it would also help the consensus-building process if people would comment on each of the proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Here's the example I promised: Suppose the following were to happen: Someone knowingly inserts false statements into Wikipedia articles (as plain statements, without prose attribution) with the purpose of defrauding someone of money, or of harming someone, or of getting elected, or of starting a war. The person is charged with a crime, and as part of their trial in court, evidence is presented that the person knowingly inserted false statements into Wikipedia. The person uses as their defence: "Oh, but writing something in Wikipedia is like writing something in a fiction story! It isn't fraud, because there is no expectation that it be true! Look at Wikipedia policy -- it says 'not whether it is true'!" On the basis of this defence, the person gets acquitted of their crime. Afterwards, the newspapers and other media, who are to a large extent in competition with Wikipedia for the limited leisure time of potential readers, have lots of fun repeating this example over and over again and repeating that "Wikipedia is not reliable", "Wikipedia is like a fiction story" and "Wikipedia policy itself states that it's not even trying to be true." --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I thought I was pretty clear, it doesn't have a useful meaning, and makes the thing longer. I don't strongly oppose, it doesn't make the thing <i>much</i> longer, and it's not blatantly offensive or anything, so if others agree to add it, I won't fight to the death to remove it. I just don't think it adds anything not obvious to anyone who has ever thought about writing an article. It should be clear that we shouldn't add everything just because we can, we're a summary of secondary sources, not an exhaustive archive. So mark me as a weak oppose. (By the way, it doesn't seem like this section is discussing that any more, but this is where I was asked to clarify.) --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i was directed here from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion</a>.. it is a somewhat intimidating discussion thread to join, due to the long, philosophical sounding arguments. in any case, personally, i'm in favour of the phrases</dd>

<li>"Attributability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia." or</li>

<dl>
<dd>As always, no matter what one-line summary of the policy we give, there will always be exceptions.. for example, the first phrase seems to imply "Everything attributable is worthy of inclusion", which may not be true. Nevertheless, i think the first phrase gets to the point in a fairly unambiguous way, that is understandable to newcomers. The second phrase is simply less emphatic, without the <i>not truth</i> phrase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, regarding a couple examples i saw, such as "The leader shook hands with God". Reliable sources may say this, but, there are also reliable sources that contradict this (such as books published regarding the non-existence of God). to disregard the contradiction would be POV.. it would have to be qualified to "These newspapers claimed the leader shook hands with God." Similarly for the Santa Claus argument.. if there is reason to doubt the claims, such as published sources regarding the mythology of Santa Claus, then you can't simply state "A flying object pulled by flying reindeer was seen in the sky," since there are other reliable sources that contradict this, and would imply that newspapers may intentionally lie to convince children.. so it would be POV to not say so. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 15:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, user <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">User:Mlm42</a> for your suggestions. I like the second one.

<dd>Would people participating in this discussion please make it clear whether you support having the policy say something that encourages or explicitly allows knowing insertion of false statements as plain statements without prose attribution? Or whether you think it's unimportant whether it does or not? To me, it is of fundamental importance to the very meaning, purpose and credibility of Wikipedia. It may not be important to you, but would you please state where you stand on this: do you disagree with me that the words do that? Or do you see that they do that, and think it's not of much importance? Or do you actually want to encourage inclusion of such known false statements?</dd>
<dd>With regard to user Mlm42's second suggestion: any comments on this? If you oppose changing to that wording, would you please explain why?

I use "truth" for want of a better English term. Surely, when we, as users, click on that browser link to Wikipedia to look for some answer for ourselves, we come to Wikipedia looking for the "truth." Isn't that the "truth"? And surely as world-travelers, by now we know that the "truth" is: There are <i>many</i> truths. And surely as users of Wikipedia looking for answers, we want some reliable source for each of those many truths to have verified each claim in the Wikipedia page. If that is so, then our job as Wikipedia editor is to make sure that each of the -- perhaps contradictory -- truths on the Wikipedia page has been verified by some reliable source. Yes? So how do we do that? We do that by clear and self-consistent Wikipedia policy text. Attribution is only one small part of our job. Too many well-meaning Wikipedia editors read the current <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution policy text</a> and follow it faithfully to produce incredibly well-attributed Original Research that does not match with anything that any published reliable source has shown to be verified. I say Bravo! by the way to everyone who has assembled, nurtured, and protected the Wikipedia page on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. It really manifests Wikipedia's strong relationship to "truth" by ensuring that each claim on that page has been verified by some reliable source, including the implied ranking of which "truth" is more true. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 17:59, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In reply to tjstrf: No, that wording has essentially the same problem. The problem is that "not truth" implies two things: (1) true but unattributable material is unacceptable and (2) false but attributable material is acceptable. The second of these is undesirable. As far as the second item is concerned, it would be best to say nothing about truth, and let people use common sense and the status quo in trying to decide whether a Wikipedian writing a Wikipedia article means what that one says.</dd>
<dd>The word "verifiability" contains the idea of "truth" in its definition, so it negates the second item. If "verifiability" is taken away, something else needs to replace it; unless there is a consensus that when someone knowingly writes false statements into a Wikipedia article, as plain statements without prose attribution, they are actually helping to write the encyclopedia; is anyone willing to admit that they support that? And if so, what do you think the ultimate purpose of Wikipedia is? I mean, if you think the purpose of Wikipedia is to write a summary of what's in the literature regardless of whether it conforms to reality, then what is the purpose of writing such a summary? To complete homework assignments with the purpose of getting good marks regardless of whether one learns anything useful? To leave a record, after our civilization falls, of the falsehoods we believed so that some later civilization can learn from our mistakes? Or what?</dd>
<dd>I think the purpose of Wikipedia is to provide information that conforms to reality a large proportion of the time, and that requiring attribution is merely a method of trying to achieve that goal. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 18:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I deny that Wikipedia's sense of verifiability <i>ever</i> implied "truth"; it implies that the sourcing of our assertions was verifiable. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> did, and does, say so at some length. Our only hope to conform to reality is the faith that our <i>sources</i> conform to reality; if they err, we must. (To some extent, this can be avoided by choosing better sources; by acknowledging, <i>exempli gratia,</i> that a newspaper, however reliable on other days of the year, is not a reliable source when it prints flying reindeer stories; but this is a minor point.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 21:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>&lt;&lt; See the nutshell: <b>Everything in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable published source</b>. How can you engage in "well-attributed Original Research" given this principle of ATT? &gt;&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is how it is done by well-meaning editors following religiously the murky and self-contradictory Wikipedia policy text. Following faithfully the current incoherent text of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117271904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117271904" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a> including its wonderful Nutshell summary, one prolific Original Research writer protested it "was not original research since it was a simple reporting of facts and no conclusions were drawn." And each fact reported was surely "attributable" because every fact in the statement was "attributed" to a "reliable source." What was missing from the murky text of current Wikipedia policy was the requirement that every claim on a Wikipedia page must have been verified by a published reliable source. That is, following the insights of <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">User:Coppertwig</a>, the fundamental Wikipedia value here is <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. And at Wikipedia we require that each assertion on a Wikipedia page must have been verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> by a published reliable source. Mere attributability of each "everything in Wikipedia" to a published reliable source is not enough -- because much of what reliable sources publish -- even the exact words -- will not show that the well-meaning Wikipedia editor's assertion has been verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 01:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We never had in Wikipedia a rule to verify anything as truth. Not in WP:V and not anywhere else. The policy of WP:V was designed to disallow material that cannot be attributed to a reliable published source, that is the same to say that can be verified that it was published in a reliable source. Again: we never had a policy that forced editors to provide assertions that something has been verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 01:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, very good. Though we can never hope to get all editors to agree that everything in the article is true, we often get all editors to agree on what the published reliable sources have verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a>, do we not? Look at the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page itself. In my opinion, that is exactly what the editors did there. They ensured that all the conflicting and jarring truths about <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> were verified as true by some published reliable source. So it seems that <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">User:Coppertwig</a> and others have been right all this time in boring us out of our mind with the accusation: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." -- that's nonsense because verifiability requires truth. Perhaps the correct phrase is something like "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability.

<dd>I am sorry to inform you, my friends. Verifiability is very much about truth. We cannot reinvent the English language. Use your dictionary -- any dictionary. You will find no reputable English dictionary on earth that says that "Verifiability is NOT about truth." Every English dictionary still in print and selling on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-4663912-5401653?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=dictionary&amp;Go.x=7&amp;Go.y=10" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-4663912-5401653?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=dictionary&amp;Go.x=7&amp;Go.y=10" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a> will define "verifiability" as very much about truth. Let me alert you to the particular situations where it is deadly to make the mistake that you are making in asserting that "Verifiability is NOT about truth." First, if you put together articles about living people merely from the facts in "attributions" to published reliable sources, you will get pages full of assertions that are not true. And you will get us all into trouble, my friend, if you do that. At least with respect to articles about living people, "Verifiability is very much about truth." Would you grant me that? Would you grant -- us -- that?

<dd>I think the issue here is not whether or not verifiability should be <i>about</i> truth, but whether it can be about <i>enforcing</i> truth. On paper it's a great idea, but on paper Soviet Communism works great. (Oh yes, I went there) In my opinion we could (and should) have a paragraph or section explaining this little dilemma. Just off the top of my head, perhaps it could go something like this:</dd>

<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>"Though it may seem confusing, the point of Wikipedia's policy on verifiability is to ensure all content can be looked up or otherwise <i>verified</i> by the casual reader, regardless of the inherant "truth" of the information. Ideally all material on Wikipedia should be pure, incontrovertable truth, but in practice this is impossible. Truth can be at many times a <i>subjective</i> designation; there can be multiple, widely held, and well-reasoned opinions on what constitutes "truth" for a given topic. In absence of an <i>objective</i> measure of truth Wikipedia must instead rely on an appropriate approximation: the combined weight of the sources backing up the information.</p>

<p>Rednblu: "Verifiability is very much about truth. We cannot reinvent the English language." Sorry to inform you this, but we can and we did.

<p>Rednblue, Coppertwig, and perhaps (sorry, not entirely sure) JulesH are seriously muddying the waters here. "the fundamental Wikipedia value here is truth. And at Wikipedia we require that each assertion on a Wikipedia page must have been verified as truth by a published reliable source" - this is simply not true. From its inception Wikipedia has been about verifiability, not truth. Verifiability does not mean that we can verify that someone believes it to be true, it means that we can verify that someone believes it. You may <i>think</i> that for someone to believe something means that they believe it to be true, but the whole point is that it simply doesn't matter. In this context we are not twisting the meaning of the English word verifiability. Larry Sanger was using it to make a philosophical argument- one I do not believe he claimed was original to himself - that there is no objective basis for truth-claims but there can be an objective basis for verifiable claims - and I repeat, "verifiable " does not mean we verify that they are true, it means we veify that someone (who is not a Wikipedia editor) has actually made the claim. In this sense, verifiability is central to our NPOV policy. The reason people can do original research while citing verifiable/attributable/reliable sources has nothing to do with "verifiability not truth," it has to do with the way people can take a variety of claims found in diverse sources and string them together to make a new argument or synthetic claim. Simple example: I quote one newspaper article that says "all men are mortal" and another newspaper that reports that "Socrates was a man" and then <b>I</b> write in a Wikipedia article "therefore Socrates was mortal." I cited two sources but have still done OR thus violating this policy. I cannot add to Wikipedi "therefore Socrates was mortal" unless I can find another verifiable/attributable source, e.g. "Aristotle wrote (citation) that if both a and b are true, then Socrates was a mortal." What is important is not that this is true (violates NPOV and V), and <i>certainly</i> not that it logically follows from a and b (for which we have sources) (violates NOR and V) — what is important is that we can verify that Aristotle made the claim. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Well said!" I say. We would not want Wikipedia policy text to encourage the <i>editors</i> following that text to verify under their own processing power that the assertions in a Wikipedia page are true. Rather, we would want the Wikipedia policy text to require the <i>editor</i> following that text to ensure that some published reliable source has verified that each assertion in a Wikipedia page is <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a>. And we must correct the murky, incoherent, and self-contradictory Wikipedia policy text to make this clear -- that the Wikipedia editor is to ensure that published reliable sources have verified that the assertions in a Wikipedia page are <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a>. This is actually the operant Wikipedia standard being enforced today. We have to make Wikipedia policy context conform to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">reality</a>. Let us consider a concrete example, the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> page. Al Gore, bless his heart, tells us that we must face this <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inconvenient_Truth_d8a1.html" title="Inconvenient Truth">Inconvenient Truth</a>. And so we must. The proper Wikipedia standard on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> page is <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> -- not the editor's truth, not the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank.html" title="Crank">crank</a>'s truth -- but rather what the published reliable sources have verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. And of course, there are often conflicting and jarring truths on any topic. The Wikipedia page on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> lays this out for us very clearly. Accordingly, we want the Wikipedia policy text to clearly state that it is the duty of any editor changing the text on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> to ensure that some published reliable source has verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a> whatever is on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> page. The statement of standard <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT"><b>Everything in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable published source</b></a> is no longer sufficient. Rather the statement of standard must be compatible with the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_practices.html" title="Best practices">best practices</a> on Wikipedia which is something like <b>Every assertion in Wikipedia must be verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">true</a> by a published reliable source.</b> --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 15:32, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, friends, everyone, for engaging with this here. I hypothesize that Wikipedia's relationship to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> is the real trouble that we must deal with underneath all of this confusion and what looks like hysteria at this time. But I have great hope. I was moved to tears on finding what excellent quality the editors had produced on the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page. I have no idea how to proceed next on this. I am just guessing like we all are. Thank you, Xagent for applying the analysis of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page to our situation here as excellent and useful questions. I found Slrubenstein's, Jossi's, and VisionThing's analysis above to be very useful in implying, to me at least, that Larry Sanger created the "Verifiability, not truth" construction as a means of getting Wikipedia pages to record the personal truths of 1) reliable sources instead of the personal truths of 2) edit warring Wikipedia editors. For our Wikipedia situation, I am sure all of you will see some better and fuller application of the wonderful and very useful categories of truth described on that <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page. In any case, I agree with Audiovideo above -- in that it seems to me that the editors of Wikipedia have a very strong dedication to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> as a many-pathed approach to describing the facts of reality -- as seems to me is sketched very well and quite usefully on that Wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page. Why do the defenders of the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a> so strongly assert that Wikipedia has no interest in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>?

<dd>With all due respect, Rednblu, could you please try to have a perceivable thesis in your posts? For as long as I've seen you, you've had a consistent habit of making extensive, lengthy posts to policy talk pages that I can never pull any substance from beyond "we need to talk about this more" and that you generally but vaguely disagree with the implementation of our policies in certain controversial subject areas. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 06:59, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does not. <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> states "Any unsourced material may be removed, and in biographies of living persons, unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material must be removed immediately." Additionally, it states that information which "introduces an argument without citing a reliable source <b>who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article</b>" (emphasis mine). The page is quite clear on the matter, the inclusion of original research or synthesis in BLP articles is forbidden, so your assertion that it encourages this is patently false. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 08:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your answer to Rednblu's suggestion that our policy encourages OR that makes false assertions about living people, which is quite accurate, is to suggest that we should fix it by removing unsourced material. Way to miss the point, which is that if your source lies, you lie. Personally, I feel that the "include it if it's sourced" point of view is a serious divergence from what a responsible encyclopaedist should do, because it places the emphasis wrongly. Although everything we include should be sourceable, so as not to represent our own opinions, being sourceable should not be a defence for injudicious edits. All too often an editor will say "I am including this utter bullshit because I have a source for it". And it remains true that one person's "reliable" source is the next person's pack of lies. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 22:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think it is evident now that Rednblu is merely trolling. I and others have explained several times why s/he is wrong, and his/her response is always something like "Yes, excellent point, I agree: ..." and then goes on to insist on the <i>opposite</i> of what we are saying. for example, above in response to my comment Rednblu writes that I am right that "we would want the Wikipedia policy text to require the editor following that text to ensure that some published reliable source has verified that each assertion in a Wikipedia page is true." That is <b>not</b> what I said and it is <u>wrong</u> to put words in my mouth andmisrepresent my views. What I said was the opposite, and Wikipedia policy is the oppositeof what Rednblu wrote. I am not going to play Rednblu's games by pretending or putting words in his/her mouth. Rednblu wrote the above quoted remark. Rednblu, you are wrong, dead wrong. And you cannot change Wikipedia policy on this matter. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is simply a case of the word "not" getting accidentally left out of a sentence. You quote Rednblu as saying that you said something; but when I look at Rednblue's actual comment, it says the opposite: the word "not" is in there, very close to the beginning of what you quote. I think when you notice the word "not" you may find that there is no problem. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry. I guess Rednblu said two very similar sentences and I was looking at the wrong one. Still, please assume good faith. I think it's very easy to have misunderstandings when talking about this stuff (even if you do know whether the word "not" is in the sentence or not). There are a lot of fine distinctions that can be made, many of which are seen by some people but missed by others. It's not necessary to assume that someone is deliberately misrepresenting your views. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Believe it or not, Steven, it is not "trolling" to disagree with one of your pronouncements. I read Rednblu as agreeing with your premise and suggesting that he takes that as his basis for his desired policy shift. He is asking that we do not simply verify that someone said it. He asks that we verify that someone asserted it as the truth. The difference is important to him, although I'm yet to figure out why. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 22:57, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said it is trolling to disagree with me, people disagree with me all the time. I don't even think it is trolling to misrepresent me once, as you have Grace Note - people will good intentions misunderstand one another frequently. However, I do believe it is trolling to misrepresent someone consistently, which is what rednblu has done. As for the nature of the disagreement, I have made a claim about what our policy is. We can argue over whether or not this is what our policy should be, and there too we can disagree. But it is dangerous when someone consistently disregards and misrepresentes our policy, and disingenous too. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 11:48, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please allow me to start from a set of statements which when taken together IMHO may shed some light on truth vs. wikipedia.</p>
<ol>
<li>"Wikipedia is Encyclopedia", i.e., a compendium of a certain category of human knowledge (some knowledge is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">unwikipedic</a>, but may be accumuated elsewhere: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">wikitravel</a>, wikicookbook (or whatsitname), etc.)</li>
<li>Wikipedians are harvesters of this knowledge (and since "anyone can edit", the whole humankind may be w'ians)</li>
<li>Without going very deep into philosophy about the meaning of the terms "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>", "<a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>", "<a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>", "<a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a>", etc., the knowledge has its own very simple but very deep hierarchy, which is grasped in two simple items 1 &amp; 2 below:
<ol>
<li>Statements about something in the "whole world around us"</li>
<li>Opinions stated by some people about certain "statements about something"</li>
<li><b>Corollary</b>: the "opinions stated by some people" are also 'something in the "whole world around us"', which leads to the infinite chain of "<a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_buffalo.html" title="Buffalo buffalo">opinions of some people about opinions of some people about opinions...</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Regardless the definitions of "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>" (whose dicdef is remarkably tautological in wikipedia, btw&#160;:-), their common denominatior is that "truth guides us", i.e., the <b><a href="../../../u/t/i/Utility.html" title="Utility">utility</a></b> of truth, so that we can predict and plan, and our actions are based more than on <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stimulus.html" title="Stimulus">stimulus</a>-<a href="../../../r/e/s/Response.html" title="Response">response</a> chains. It is so even in most fatalistic philosophies without "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a>".</li>
<li>Any kind of "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>" maintained by a certain category of people deserves to be reported in Wikipedia, because this type of knowledge has the utility beyond this category: e.g., knowing "their truth" (i.e., "opinions of some people about...", see item <b>3.2</b>), we can predict their behavior, because "their truth" guides their behavior. Which "certain category of people" to be reported is judged by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>. It may be as small one as a <b>single person</b>: we do report on certain notable <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kook.html" title="Kook">kooks</a>, because they influence the world, if only "making a load buzz". Notice also that Wikipedia doesn't care whether the kook truly believes in his "truth" or simply pulls our leg, because the "kook's truth" (item <b>3.2</b>) may be confronted in wikipedia with item <b>3.3</b>, with all consequences of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</li>
<li>Note: While the previous statement smacks strongly of a particular theory of truth known as "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_theory_of_truth.html" title="Consensus theory of truth">Consensus theory of truth</a>", this similarity is superficial. Once again, I am to discuss only what some people <i>recognize as truth</i>, not whether it is truth indeed.</li>
<li>A Wikipedia's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues">foundation principle</a> (i.e., a principle beyond any dispute) is <i>the "wiki process" as the decision mechanism on content</i>, which is usually read as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a> (unless overriden by the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues">ultimate authority</a>). A corollary is an egalitarian absence of a special role of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expert.html" title="Expert">experts</a> as judges of any "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truths</a>". <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is the major workhop of decision-making: despite its lowly label as "guideline", <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is where the ultimate fate of any content lies, and this fate, "to be or not to be", is decided by the whole community (even if implicitely, by the absense of any "nays").</li>
<li>In absence of any mechanism for the incorporation of "<a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a>" in the process of writing wikipedia, the whole actual content of any article is a collection of two categories of statements:
<ol>
<li>"Undisputable truths", i.e., those perceived to present no trouble for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a> (but even these may be freely questioned). Among other things, this itemn includes direct citations from external sources.</li>
<li><b>Opinions</b> contributed by wikipedians. (It may seem paradoxical, but consider this: even if a wikipedian refers to some very reliable source, it is nothing but their implicit opinion that the referred source says this or that).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>"Experts" in "real world" are recognized as such by a "certain category of people" and these people delegate the experts the right to utter and judge "truth".</li>
<li>"Wikipedians" within Wikipedia and "experts" within "real world" share the same important trait: both of them are subject to <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> by their peers. In wikipedia the circle of peers is the whole <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_community.html" title="Wikipedia community">wikipedia community</a>. "Real life" experts have their own rules of the game; sometimes the circle of peers consist of a single person (and in this respect a <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kook.html" title="Kook">kook</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> are similar, the difference being the number of people that delegate them the rights to "truth").</li>
<li>If "experts" are entitled to utter and judge "truth" recognizable by a "certain category of people", then if this category <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">is deemed notable</a> by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_community.html" title="Wikipedia community">wikipedia community</a>, their <b>opinions</b> as reported by wikipedians are allowed in articles. What is more, in many cases opinons of experts are safely declared as "facts", e.g., entries from demographic tables.</li>
<li>In some cases even "experts" may recognize their limitations and formulate their statements as "opinions" or "hypotheses". In other cases experts may disagree, especially experts speaking for different categories of people. This is where <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> kicks in.</li>
<li>It is technically possible that a certain wikipedian is confirmed to be a "real-life expert", and barring any other provisions a viable scenario could be that they write something in wikipedia from their own name, while his peers perform the same scrutiny they do at conferences, during journal peer reviews, etc. After all, what's big deal: he is an expert, i.e., in charge of "truth", his "peer review" is one mouse click away in wiki environment, why an intermediate step? It must be a decision of the community <b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">sorry, wikipedia is simply not a publisher of original thought</a></b>; just as wikipedia is not a wiktionary, we simply say: there are other media for doing this. All the more, "original research" is a no-no for "ordinary" wikipedians, about whom we don't know whose truth they are representing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above train of thought was intended to demonstrate that <b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is independent of any interpretations of the meaning of the term "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>"</b> and in fact is a consensus-defined part, although a nontrivial and groundlaying one, of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. While its importance goes a beyond simple WP:NOT item, it is still an atomic decision: shall we allow experts to publish their new research in wikpedia or not? With all due respect, we are saying "not", as simple as this. As a byproduct, we cancel out various kooks and trolls. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 07:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before I proceed with a similar exposition to demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is equally intependent of "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>"</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are independent of each other</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a> is a tool to enforce both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to see opinions as to whether all the above is understandable and reasonable.</p>
<p>And a final piece for today: while in current formulations it can be shown (i.e., I can try to convince you) that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> may be ensured by means other than <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a>, it may also be shown that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a> may be extended to cover these extra means as well. Therefore for all as of today technically <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a> may be equivalent to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> + <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. And therefore in restructuring the policies related to "truth" the main decision is the choice which policy is to be considered as primary or "core":</p>
<ol>
<li>procedure-oriented rule <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a>, i.e., attribution as <b>a way</b> to ensure that statements in articles reflect truth for some notable category of people</li>
<li>goal-oriented rule <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, i.e., contributions to wikipedia <b>must</b> reflect truth for some notable category of people and we do not preclude other possible ways to enforce truth (an example of a possible way is to allow recognized experts to write from their name; <b>cool down</b>, it is just an example, I will be the first one to vote against such a possibility&#160;:-)</li>
</ol>
<p>My heart is strongly against the procedure-oriented approach, because it gives a priority to a bureaucratic way of decision-making, with all related corollaries of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_Law_e934.html" title="Parkinson's Law">Parkinson's Law</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that my reasoning brings the moment of decision closer, rather than further by wasting your time for reading my rant. -- <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 07:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Our previous three main policies (NOR, V and NPOV) were all linked, and ATT and NPOV are linked. Also, I am not sure what you mean by V is independent of truth. The basis of Wikipedia's NPOV policy - which also informed NOR - is "verifiability, not truth." Clearly, verifiability is presented as a principle <i>distinct</i> from "truth." But it is also presented as our <i>alternative</i> to "truth" as a criteria for inclusion. I think it is impossible to understand V if one does not understand how it is a radical alternative to "truth" as a criteria for inclusion/exclusion for the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Colleague, thatnk you for your interest in my text. I confess I wrote it primarily to set my own thoughts clear, rather than to influence politics: I am not a political person. Now, I would like to underline my intendent accent once more: I am demonstrating that the important relations of WP:NPOW (and WP:V, later) are <b>not</b> that they are "distinct" or "alternative" to "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>". I am saying that they are <b>independent</b> of (the definition of the) "truth". IMHO this point of view has at least three very important traits
<ol>
<li>We don't have to struggle to figure out our definition of truth</li>
<li>We don't put wikipedia in opposition to "truth" (which may be read from words "distinct" or "alternative")</li>
<li>And as a consequence, we preempt ourselves from further criticism of the validity of wikipedia's information. (I am trembling in horror waiting some nasty blogger detects this discussion and tells to the world that wikipedians <i>do not care for truth!</i> and seek for its replacement!) <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mukadderat, I agree with most of the (too) long essay above, but I have two objection.</p>
<ol>
<li>This policy actually emphasizes that not every thing needs to be attributed, what is required is <i>attributability</i>, which can be precisely defined as "reflect truth for some notable category of people". Thus, the policy is striving for the very same <i>ideal</i> that you are discussing!</li>
<li>Why then the procedural focus on attribution? Perhaps I lack imagination, so can you give one real example of an appropriate way to "reflect truth for some notable category of people" other than attribution? One option is of course original research, but that's not allowed. True, that's an independent decision, but that doesn't make it unrelated: our goal is V, and we have decided we can't do OR, so all that remains is ATTRIBUTE!</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some qualification, for example, we might allow purely analytic truths that we deduce by logic, and WP:ATT does make that exception. I any case, your argument was interesting, I hope you found this and Slrubenstein's response helpful. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 00:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree that the essay is somewhat long, but the problems with short essays for important topics is that they are either too simplistic or require certain leaps of logic or faith, or express someone's opinion, which may be easily refuted by "OK, it is your opinion. let's vote" my goal was to invoke logic based by interconnecting already accepted postulates of wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>About Objection 1: I don't intend to replace our policies: I am showing their logical place within some less disputable (or even indisputable) rules of wikipedia. Re: <i>"Attritabutability"</i>: sorry I don't see the ground of your disagreement; so far this very long text only was intended for WP:NOR. I anoly promised to continue. And in my future text it will be logically see that "immediate attribution of everything" is an overkill.</dd>
<dd>About Objection 2: Re: <i>"procedural focus"</i>: Because the policy simply dictates "how" to decide on inclusion of text, i.e., the procedure of decision, ingnoring and even "substituting" the notion of "truth". It is a well-known stumbling log in histories of many organizations that when procedures take priorities over strategic goals, then it leads to big troubles. Re: <i>"real example other than attribution"</i> Again, I wanted to cover this in the continuation, but since you are impatient, here is one: things of real world may <b>manifest themselves</b>. Imagine that instead of nice photos wikipedia will have a posibility to incorporate webcam feeds into articles. Now let us make this more encyclopedic: wikipedia has a direct feed from a device which measures the distance between continents (we know they are drifting) and the very current distance value is displayed right here: &lt;&lt;<b>13,207.3</b> km&gt;&gt;. A quite encyclopedic piece of info and very verifiable. And some bureaucratically minded people may say that this data are attributable (attributable to the device in question). But some other people may readily seen that this way of verefiability has its own very specific issues to resolve and rules to follow and hence better to be handled by a quite separate policy. If you think it is a fantasy, let's talk in 5 years. If you say that we shall scratch our head when it starts itching, I will say such an attitude often leads to disasters in many projects, and if you can easily make forward-looking provisions to eliminate future restructuring, then why not. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for being very brief, but I just want to clarify my first objection as I think that was the crucial one. You are essentially arguing that ATT is taking a procedure-oriented focus, and I was saying that it's not entirely so. ATT defines a goal-oriented ideal, that of attributability, and I think that captures the idea that we want material on Wikipedia to "reflect truth for some notable category of people", basically we want material to be attributable to experts in the relevant fields. I think you are saying that there are truths held by most people, which nevertheless can't be immediately attributable to them, for example, there are certain manifest facts that would be considered true by most people and yet they don't write it down in a published source that they think so. Well, manifest sources are available today, but this is a highly problematic issue! For example, citation indexes do serve to verify that a certain person has not published an article in the relevant field! It is not original research to report that a citation index returns zero published articles, and it is immediately verifiable. But who is it attributable to? It's a data stream, you can't attribute statements to such a source, and that might be a good thing! As it does capture what Mr Wales would like V and OR to be, I'm sure he wouldn't want us to include information that some living person hasn't published a single article on subject X and yet is selling products in this field and so on. Once we get used to attribution, we will no longer cause Jimbo such headaches, it's a pity he believes this policy weakens NOR when in fact it strengthens it. Sorry, I completely diverted from the philosophical discussion at hand, I'm going to sleep now, it's safe to ignore me&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 03:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One thing we need to be clear about (and this si semantics, not epistemology) is unattributed = unsourced, but unattributable = original research - in practice, they are not the same thing. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 10:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I thought of another compromise that I would accept, though I wouldn't find it completely satisfactory: changing the period to a colon at the end of the sentence, so it would read <i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true: Wikipedia is not the place to publish your opinions, experiences, or arguments."</i> I forget whether I or anyone had suggested this earlier.</dd>
<dd>I have no problem with the original words "verifiability, not truth". My issue is with having words such as "not whether it is true" or "not truth" without qualification by the presence of a word such as "verifiability" or "solely" or any of many other suggestions. One suggestion is to include the sentence "Not everything that is attributable is worthy of inclusion" somewhere in the first section. I see that one too as a compromise. If you search for "possible alternative wordings" above you can find quite a few alternatives I've suggested. I'm sure others can be thought up.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to find at least one user who supports the new wording who is willing to discuss back-and-forth with me long enough to arrive at an understanding like "OK, I understand that you see this meaning in these words, while I see that meaning. And I understand that you want the words to mean this, for this reason, while I want them to mean that, for that reason," and to consider at least three or four possible alternative wordings. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I just noticed the irony in the second proposal: not worthy of inclusion. I wasn't intentionally implying that the sentence about things not worthy of inclusion is not worthy of inclusion.

<p>Here is a central problem with our policy structure (and the reason it's so beloved by the likes of Steve Rubenstein). We take the philosophical basis that no claim is more valuable than another: that one does not need to engage in the discernment of the "truth" of a claim. However, having taken that as square one, we proceed to introduce means to value claims. We define certain sources as "reliable" (which surely means something like "more likely to be truthful") and we note that some things are "worthy of inclusion". But what are the criteria for worth here? Presumably, "more likely to be true" is one of them. "We agree they are more important" is another. But judging that one thing is important and another not is surely contrary to NPOV (unless our reason for judging it so is "more people say it in the Western press", which, preposterously, <i>is</i> our basis for considering something important). So we can pretend to be value neutral (which is what the "neutral" in NPOV more or less represents) while introducing our values by the back door. I don't know what our articles would look like if we were truly neutral. I don't know whether it's even possible with the rather linear approach we have taken. (Naturally, when I think about this, I think about the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a> article, which I tried hard to make inclusive. It represents one point of view: that pictures of genitals are acceptable, while dismissing another, that they are not, totally. The general argument for this is that an encyclopaedia should include this, that or the other. However, by defining an encyclopaedia in a particular way, we destroy neutrality. Instead of NPOV, we leave ourselves with an "encyclopaedia point of view". A solution that encompassed both POVs: dual articles, one with image, one without, was entirely dismissed by liberal-value zealots. But this is the kind of creative solution, possible in this medium, that an encyclopaedia truly interested in "neutral" presentation of views, should include. Instead, we have a push to create "stable" versions of articles. I do not know how we can distinguish between saying "this article is stable" and "this article is true".) Whether it matters that we take this approach to constructing the encyclopaedia depends on what your vision of it is, and how much you mind that it's simply a compendium of liberal, orthodox statements of how the world is. (This is not to mention even those areas in which the orthodox media simply have not had much to say, or are not informed enough to have much to say; or those in which the focus of orthodox media leads to representations of subjects that are not comprehensive: for instance, biographies of people who have made the news for chiefly negative reasons.) Personally, I prefer a broader interpretation. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 23:21, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the third proposal (including <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>) is the best. To put it quickly, clearly two broad interpretations of truth oppose themselves here (and I will include a third one):</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>the first one believes in absolute truth (from a Revelation or otherwise; it does not accept rival truths). This is what Wikipedia explicitly opposes, in order to be able to struggle against fanatism.</li>
<li>The second one believes in some relativity of truth (<a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_relativism.html" title="Cultural relativism">cultural relativism</a> &amp; others), and is the one supported by Jimbo Wales, when he said somewhere that we should abstain ourselves from judging what is true, or not, and simply attributes opinion to individuals (or institutions — it's quoted here, see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Role_of_truth_e9bd.html#Do_not_change_the_core_policy" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Role of truth">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Role of truth#Do not change the core policy</a>).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Both have found their limitations here, and in fact Wikipedia has worked on another model, which more or less inspired itself by works of the scientific community: if one publishes something, one should publishes the material which goes with it, in order to let the reader <i>verify</i> the statement. Without sources, a Wikipedia article is useless, even if true, because the reader can not verify what is been said. Hence the importance of attribution.</dd>
<dd>However, this seems to bypass the importance of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> which helps to restrict statements which clearly are false (even if correctly attributed) and marginal, fringe views. This is very important, because else, many articles would give way too much space to fringe, clearly false, views. Dumping in the meanwhile any relation between Wikipedia and knowledge.</dd>
<dd>In other words, if an encyclopedia has something to do with knowledge, if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and if knowledge is related, in some way or another, to truth, it is an illusion to think that Wikipedia can work without reference to truth.</dd>
<dd>Thus the importance of not dismissing truth so quickly, and of maintaining UNDUE weight. Last comment: we have noted here that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are not always the same, depending on the context. This points to another problem: if you take the case of a court judgement, one can hardly assert that a witness is "reliable" in an absolute, essential way (that is, granting him the equivalent of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">Papal infallibility</a>). One can only try to see if <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> statement is reliable.</dd>
<dd>Thus, when a globally reliable source says something which is obviously false, this must be included in the article (as it is not every day that such things happen), but with caution and alternate views (I seem to oppose my support of UNDUE, but I don't think I'm contradicting myself, the nature of the problem makes for complexity). This is particularly important in politics, which are made of lies and of public denials: a public denial of a government, when loads of others reliable sources have pointed out the reverse, must be included, but according to UNDUE: that is, it must not be presented as the absolute truth.</dd>
<dd>In two words: Wikipedia can not abstain itself from a reference to truth (least it becomes a battlefield for rival, and fringe, opinions, held by fanatics from all environments), and can not either abstain itself from UNDUE. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 18:46, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the only standard is that there's an attribution somewhere, Wikipedia will degenerate into a gossip column. If the only standard is that a statement is true, Wikipedia will become an online collection of math identities (although there may be problems there with the NOR policy!) The problem is that the attributable false trumps unattributable truth. I would expect that most entries would be both true and attributable, and that those of questioned attribution or questioned truth should be so labeled. We should be grown-up enough to admit that sometimes "the truth" isn't known, and that sometimes what we know can't be attributed. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtterSmith_4321.html" title="User:OtterSmith">htom</a> 21:08, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only standard is attribution? That's clearly false attribution! WP:ATT is saying no such thing. There are two concepts:
<ol>
<li>What sources to use, and how much to rely on each source? (covered by NPOV, especially Undue weight, and notions of reliability.)</li>
<li>What is the appropriate use of our sources? (covered by ATT.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>We need to develop a culture of <i>fair and honest attribution</i>. Perhaps it is verifiable that the policy says "not whether it is true", but the reasoning above is taking it out of context, and is ignoring the very important qualifier about source reliability. Saying that the standard is that "there's an attribution somewhere" is therefore not attributable to WP:ATT. (See how useful the ATT terminology is, I don't know how I would argue this using V and NOR.

<dd>Yes, but the way to counter that on Wikipedia, is to dispute the reliability of the source in question, either by

<dd>Also, attribution doesn't always have to be literal and verbatim. It is far more important that it honestly captures the idea. Let's say you are citing a mathematics textbook and there is a small flaw in a formula. If a few of our esteemed mathematicians agree that an index or something is wrong. Why shouldn't they fix it? <i>The idea is still attributable to the source!</i> Unless somebody challenges this, for a valid reason, and not just "Oh no, it's not the same, I can't verify that it says so!" Finally, for the killer argument: <i>so what if reliable sources are wrong?</i> Here are two possible cases:
<ol>
<li>I cite <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> about a fact, but it turns out to be wrong.</li>

<p>This may be a rehash of arguments already made, but I've never seen it put as distinctly as it should. The statement "the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true" has different meanings. To the casual reader, "not whether it is true" is a loaded statement. Most everyone not familiar with Wikipedia would read that and assume that patently false or libelous statements are perfectly acceptable, as long as you can prove that someone said them. Example (ludicrous for emphasis): What if some political pundit says "Politician A is an alien from Mars that eats puppies"? You are able to attribute that statement to someone. The fact that the statement was uttered is true, but it would be obvious to anyone that it is false. No one would object that a statement such as this should not be included in Wikipedia. It is libelous, factually wrong, and inappropriate. Wikipedia is not a gossip rag or the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>We need to more clearly define what we mean by truth. Truth as in accuracy is different than truth as in "I believe it to be true." Examples of this would be "Global Warming Is an Immediate Crisis"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and "global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Both statements are true, i.e. the statements exist and were said by the people attribted. However, reasonable people can disagree on whether they are <i>factually</i> true, i.e. is global warming a real.</p>
<p>The Wiki-definition of truth is in this second category, one that gets at underlying truth that is based on personal belief (Does God exist?) versus factual truth (Moon revolves around the Earth). We need to ensure it is clear that the policy is designed to guarantee NPOV by including both sides of controversial arguments in articles. However, it is not always that simple. In some articles, like the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a> you could include arguments that the "Earth is Flat," because it is appropriate in the context of the article. But I do not think you necessarly need to give the "Flat Earth" argument equal time in the article about the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Planet Earth</a>. In short just because something is printed and can be attributed doesn't mean it should be included. The goal is to keep personal bias out of articles, not to exclude facts or to include false information in the name of completeness. Editors should be use their collective judgement in crafting articles. <a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 21:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had seen that, and went back to read it in more detail after your post. I see your points, but the purpose of my post was, like yours, to put my own thoughts in some cohesive form. What I think you are describing is a world where "truth" is simply "truth" in all its forms. The majority of editors would agree with you, I think. We as Wikipedians know what we mean when we say "truth." However our policies are there to explain to newcomers just what Wikipedia means. Those newcomers might not understand our definition of truth. That's the point I was making. When we say "verifiability, not truth" or some form thereof, we need to be clear in what we are saying. I think a definition of truth is necessary. We need to differentiate between "truth," as in verifiable facts, versus "truth," as in "personal opinion." My global warming example one. Both Al Gore and Senator Inhofe have their own opinions about global warming, and both view their own view as fact, but they are still opinions. My fear is that people are focusing too much on the assumtion that by saying "no truth" that Wikipedia is endorsing false statements in its articles, even if one can prove those false statements were uttered by someone else. Bottom line, Wikipedia is not a place for editors to debate their own opinions or the opninios of others by proxy. Somoneone once said that "everyone is entitled to their own opinions, not their own facts." Wikipedia needs to be factual and unbiased to the greatest extent possible, and we need to be clear to newcomers just how Wikipedia's policies are meant to ensure that.<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 23:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. Then I would like to examine the "role of truth" specifically for <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. What is it that gives the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page the high quality that it has? I would say that <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> is a major component of the high quality in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page. That is, by my standards, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page summarizes quite well what the ReliableSources have Verified about gravity, and there is No original research by the editors who have written the page. Furthermore, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page gives me Attributions to where I can find the original writing of those ReliableSources that will lay out for me the standard of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> by which those ReliableSources have accomplished their Verification of the assertions on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page. And, as <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">User:Mukadderat</a> says, neither the 1) editors nor the 2) ReliableSources have established "the real truth." Furthermore, in my estimation, both the 1) editors and 2) ReliableSources have reported others' judgment, in a balanced way -- given the methods for Verification that the ReliableSources have specified. And, as <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">User:Michael Johnson</a> says, there are elements of even gravity for which <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> has not been determined in a way that ReliableSources can Verify among each others' works as being <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. And I find that the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page gives me good indications where these unknown areas are. <b>What can I extract from this?</b> It seems to me that Attribution plays only a small part of constructing a quality page such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. What matters is Verifiability; I want only the Attributions that point me to the ReliableSources that have 1) defined explicitly their method of Verification of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> and 2) actually have verified each other's conclusions. Attribution is merely a means of <i>pointing me</i> to the ReliableSources that have Verified as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> within their explicitly defined methods of Verification the assertions in the Wikipedia <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page. That is, the fundamental element of quality in the Wikipedia page is Verification. By analogy, Verification is the gold; Attribution is merely the map to get to the gold. Both are important. But for the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> page, the mere map to anything without Verification is worthless, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 04:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm starting to see what you are trying to get at, I agree "accurate" or call it even "true" information is the goal, I also agree that the way we reach this is that we attribute to sources that within the established fields of expertise have verified as "true" (in their own operative definition of the term) whatever assertion we use. However, I hope you do realize how incredibly confusing your argument is, and it is also greatly in contrast with the accepted definition in WP:V.
<ul>
<li>You are saying verifiable on Wikipedia means we are only including information that has been verified by experts to be the truth as they define it in their field.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says verification means that "any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." Nowhere does WP:V talk about things being verified as true!</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I don't mind your definition of verifiability, it's actually quite good and sophisticated. But that is not what WP:V is about at all. If WP:V would use your definition of verifiability explaining it carefully, I wouldn't mind; but having a policy called verifiability that then immediately defines verifiability to be attribution is quite ridiculous. And I still don't understand why WP:ATT is being blamed for this distinction, when it is clearly in the second sentence of WP:V. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:58, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rednblu, in scientific articles you are probably right, and a formulation at least somewhat similar to yours would be useful. However, while science is a/ willing and able to describe its basis for considering things true and b/ generally built on axioms that are implicit in its descriptions, so that contesting its truths amounts to contesting the axioms it is built on (and consequently not doing science), other areas are not as clear cut. Still, I do think that what you're suggesting more clearly describes what we actually do here, or what many aim to do. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:28, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This entire discussion is irrelevant and any claim that privileges the idea of "truth" is in conflict with our core policies. According to the original core policy, NPOV, what is "objective" is <i>not</i> gravity, but <i>that some people hold certain <b>beliefs</b> about gravity.</i> And it is these beliefs, completely regardless of truth or truthfulness, that are represented in Wikipedia. Here are some quotes from the first version of the policy, from 2002:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the easiest way to make your writing more encyclopedic, is to write about what people believe, rather than what is so. If this strikes you as somehow subjectivist or collectivist or imperialist, then ask me about it, because I think that you are just mistaken. What people believe is a matter of objective fact, and we can present that quite easily from the neutral point of view. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a></li>
<li>But even on such pages, though the content of a view is spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the <i>truth.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas provided the basis for another core policy that was developed several years ago, namely, or verifiability policy the essence of which is "verifiability, not truth." <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:23, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. The article on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> states "Gravitation is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other." That is a statement of objective fact. Gravity exists. There is no viable theorgy that "gravity does not exist" and as such you don't need NPOV on the question of whether gravity exists. Where individual beliefs or opinions come in, and where Wikipedia NPOV and verifiability is essential, is in opinions of how gravity <i>works</i>. That is where you state objective "beliefs" about the theory of gravity to explain the various viewpoints on the subject in a neutral manner. There can be alternative theories, but the central fact that gravity "is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other" is not open for debate. Atlernative theories get are listed in the article on gravity, but they do are not used in such a way to claim that gravity does not exist. The article on the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_landing.html" title="Moon landing">Moon landings</a> is another good example. The article starts from the the basis that the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> moon missions in fact took place. It is verifiable. There is a small section describing accusations that the moon landings were faked, but that section is written appropriately in NPOV by stating "so and so believes they were faked" and "so and so thinks the moon landing conspiracy theorists are flat wrong."</dd>
<dd>The point I was trying to make in some of my comments is that there are certain objective facts that exist as true. I guess my biggest problem is changing the "verifiability, not truth" to "whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true." The verifiability leaves open for some analysis if whether the statement is libelous or false. Limiting the standard to just attributability leaves open to any false or libelous statements as long as you can point to someone that said them. Jimbo has also said that just because you can attribute something to someone doesn't mean it should be included in Wikipedia, particularly <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046732.html" class="external text" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046732.html" rel="nofollow">contentious statements about living persons</a>. I know I may be oversimplifying matters, but the purpose of policy is to explain our standards of conduct to outsiders. Those that already edit Wikipedia "get" what we mean by "truth." Someone new probably wouldn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In its simplest terms you can declare "2+2=4" as fact, and you'd be hard pressed to find any reliable, verifiable source that claims instead that "2+2=5" (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28novel%29.html" title="1984 (novel)">1984</a> notwithstanding).<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 17:17, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But if somebody believes the moon landing was a hoax, clearly they think that is <i>the truth</i>. Now, do you want to engage in a long argument with them about the truth? Or do you prefer saying "Dear sir, what we personally think is true is not relevant to our discussion here, we present what the majority of reliable sources have published on the matter". If you imagine yourself being in a content dispute with someone, who thinks the moon landing didn't happen, who thinks all the NASA-presented evidence is bogus, do you really want to discuss truth with them? I accept the sophisticated view of truth given by Rednblue, but would you want to explain such notions of truth with various conspiracy theorists? Isn't it easier to just tell them "I'm sorry, truth doesn't matter, we represent the mainstream scholarly view", and go on with it.</dd>
<dd>And regarding the libellous facts, the way I understood the matter, what was inserted wasn't actually inaccurate, was it? It was one-sided and paid unnecessary attention to an obscure law-case, but I think it was accurate. It was giving undue weight to something that had not been covered by secondary sources, but I think what they had inserted was in fact "the truth". I might be wrong, but at least on <a href="../../../g/i/l/Talk%7EGillian_McKeith_efca.html" title="Talk:Gillian McKeith">Talk:Gillian McKeith</a>, there is an immense drive to include an infinite amount of criticism about her.

<dd>Yes, of course, but the only question is how practical and helpful is the terminology. I personally find the attribution terminology easier to work with. If somebody synthesizes material, let's take my favourite example (a real one):
<dl>
<dd>"People suffering from mental illness often hallucinate.<sup>[1]</sup> Religious figures are known to have been inspired by visions.<sup>[2]</sup>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Both are cited, and no conclusions are drawn in the text. I would ask the editor to not use these sources next to each other because this usage isn't exactly attributable to the second source, which never implied any connections with mental illness. I would ask for a source that explicitly makes this connection, because it is a controversial one. For me, attribution has the connotation of being fair and scholarly, respecting the context in which one uses sources. I often ask myself, would the sources in question, if they could edit wikipedia, agree to being used in this way. I find this way of thinking a lot easier than the <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">WP:SYNT</a> policy. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:17, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you more than you think. My point all along has been that we need to strive for truth in wikipedia articles, otherwise they will forever be viewed as inaccurate. What you seem to be saying is that we don't need to include every "crackpot" version of the "truth" in the article. I would agree that I would not want to give undue credence to moon hoax conspiracy theorists, because those views are readily disputed by mainstream knowledge and reliable sources. But the way I read the "not truth" portion (where attribution is the only constant) means that we couldn't even include a discussion of the moon landings because it is one person's view of the "truth," if you look at it from the standpoint of a moon hoax adherent. I believe your standard of ensuring wikipedia "represents the mainstream scholary view." Simply relying on something being "attributable" to someone is not by itself a firm enough standard in my opinion.<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 18:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steven, you have an unfortunate habit of using "we" to exclude others when in fact "we" includes them. Wikipedia does not have laws handed down on tablets. Its laws are made by the people it consists of. If they are flawed, it's perfectly reasonable that we should talk about fixing them. If you don't believe they are flawed, it's perfectly reasonable for you to defend them. I don't see your doing so though. I see you trumpeting their rightness without bothering to substantiate your position. Jossi simply wishes to close down debate.

<p>Grace Note, the character of my reaction has to do with the fact that certain people, including Rednblu and others involve din this discussion, have <i>not</i> been saying "here is a policy that we have had for many years but it is fundamentally flawed, can we have an open discussion;" rather, they have been making claims that Wikipedia is in fact based on privileging truth. I think you misunderstand my point. I am not arguing that the policy is right and opponents are wrong. I am arguing that the policy states that verifiability is not truth, and that verifiability is the standard for inclusion, not truth. In short, I am making an argument (yes, very rigidly) about what the policy states. If you and others want to change the policy I would happily join in with my reasons for taking whatever position I end up taking. But at least have the honesty to say, "We are proposing a change in the policy" rather than - and I am not sure what I am about to say applies to you, but I am sure it applies to Rednblu and several others - disingenuously assert that you (they) ar enot changing the policy but rather anyone who claims "verifiability not truth" is somehow weakening the policy. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:28, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The comment from Henrygb above is quite relevant, and I copy it here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not what it has always meant. Try the first time WP:V was labelled as policy[3]. What it meant then was "your belief that a statement in an article is true is not enough; it has to be possible to check the statement is accurate; providing sources enables this to happen". What it has become in WP:ATT is more like "we don't care whether a statement in an article is true or accurate; all we care about is whether we can find someone who said it". --Henrygb 18:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>An important distinction exists in how we can interpret the sentence "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."</p>
<p>One possible interpretation is "if a statement is true, but not verifiable, that doesn't meet the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia." This interpretation has the policy demanding that facts be verifiable. It's a reasonably tough standard, and details are provided to help define what makes a fact verifiable. It also means that, if you can meet the standards of verifiability, you can say in an article "China is a country in Asia," rather than "so and so claims that China is a country in Asia, but this is disputed by so and so's uncle."</p>
<p>One might try to construe the policy another way, such as "if it's verifiable but NOT true, it can be included." But this catches on a little hitch. The word "verifiable" includes "truth!" Something untrue can not be verifiable by definition.</p>
<p>However, if we substitute the word "attributed," or "attributable," then the possible interpretation is loosened. It can easily be construed as "if it's attributed but NOT true, it can be included." Then an arguement can be made to open the Apollo 11 article with the sentence "The Apollo 11 moon mission was a complete fraud."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations#_note-kaysing2002" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations#_note-kaysing2002" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>I'm sure no one here wants to support such an interpretation. And whatever standards are in place, it's impossible to absolutely avoid distortion, untruth, and contested facts in all articles. But I think we should recognize that our standards of verifiability exist as a measure of truth, that they are in place to attempt to set some standard for what we regard as true, and that this is quite different from claiming that Wikipedia is not concerned with truth, only attribution.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 00:43, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>But an argument <i>can</i> be made for opening the Apollo 11 article with a statement that it was a fraud. (I'm not saying I'm making, or intend to make, that argument.) You cannot verify that it was true that it succeeded. You can only verify that someone says it was. It's a very good example of something that has been sufficiently difficult to verify for some that they are sceptical of its having happened. (Whereas events that are much less well attested are not contested. That's a curiosity of historiology, I suppose. See my note above about Englefield.) The question is not whether we intend to present the truth, but how we decide which versions of the "truth" we should promote and which we should demote. Zadignose seems to be labouring under the entirely unsubstantiable notion that there is a "truth" that we could be posting if only it weren't for all the editors trying to distort it. The best approach you could make is to suggest that we should post whatever we can agree is "true". Which is more or less what we do. We have votes, more often brawls, in which whoever can muster more people who think what they want included is "true" wins and prints their truth or at worst, can elevate their truth above other truths.</p>
<p>It is a problem, although possibly not <i>our</i> problem, that people have the same modernist view of an encyclopaedia as Zadignose, and believe that it should be in some sense "true". But we are aiming for "what people think is true", not "what is true". We post what historian X thinks is true; what newspaper Y claims is true; what writer Z once said was true.</p>
<p>As I noted, in some instances, it's easy to decide, although it's a problem that we're not explicit about our basis for the decision. In others though, our policies are doomed to be incoherent. You cannot on the one hand claim to be neutral -- in other words, not have a prejudice to one version of truth -- and on the other more heavily weight particular interpretations. This is a fundamental problem with our core policies and a source of a great deal of the conflict on this website: partly because people will game whatever policy you write to try to pin it down.</p>
<p>One of the positives about shifting the policy title to WP:Attribution is that it more accurately notes what we require: not that edits can be verified, but that they are checkable in the sense that you can go look that someone actually did claim what we say they did. It would have been doubly positive if it had been written with more of an eye to explaining the basis for it and other policies here, so that we could settle what we're aiming for and why. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:24, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

All we need to do is figure out what Wikipedians are supposed to do and what the wording of the policies should be; I don't think deep philosophical discussions about "truth" are needed for that.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a>: As I understand you, you like that Wikipedia is not claiming that what it says is true. I think I like that too. I think lots of Wikipedians like that. It's normal to state something, as is done in many Wikipedia articles. To state something and then add "... and it's true!" is redundant at best and probably hubris. I also wouldn't like a policy that said that Wikipedians have to prove or guarantee that what they add to articles is true. It just wouldn't be very workable. I think the way we do things now is just fine. My point is that saying nothing -- i.e. not saying that we guarantee truth or anything like that -- is just fine, but that saying "not whether it is true" (in the way the new WP:ATT wording says it) is going too far in my opinion. Do you think we really need those words "not whether it is true", and if so, why? What do you think of my compromise proposals and other proposals above?</dd>
<dd>Merzul, thank you for displaying my two compromise proposals in a box. Users should note that I also gave a list of other alternative wordings I would be satisfied with; search for "Possible alternative wordings" above.</dd>
<dd>Merzul, you said, <i>"I don't mind any of these proposals, I only object to the Conservopedian "not solely if it is true"."</i> Just to clarify: Which proposals are you indicating acceptance of? E.g. the list above "Possible alternative wordings", including "not merely whether it is true"? Or some more limited set of proposals on this page? The way this page has been refactored it's hard to tell, sorry. Anyway, your input may be very valuable in working towards consensus, because your position appears to me to be a sort of middle ground. I hope you'll continue participating in this discussion.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilceolaire_ffe7.html" title="User:Filceolaire">Filceolaire</a> said, "<i>If on the other hand there is a lie which has been widely published, by reliable sources, then that could be included in Wikipedia, along with it's refutation, if that has also been published. Attribution, not truth, is what is important if we want to avoid being sued.</i>" In the case of biographies of living persons, I disagree with you here. Suppose there's a widely published defamatory statement about a living person, and suppose Wikipedians have an unpublished but convincing source (e.g. a highly respected Wikipedian reports having received a letter from someone involved) which convinces Wikipedians that the statement is false. Wouldn't we be safer from being sued if we removed the statement from the article? And I think it would be better to remove it not only on grounds of being sued. It would just be more likely to be an accurate article if we remove things like that. Do you think leaving it in would make us safer from being sued?</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a>: you said "<i>Coppertwig, I am saying that we cannot address objective truth because no such thing exists. I think you have entirely missed my point, which is that you cannot legislate against including "false" information if there is no way to measure what is true and what is false.</i>" OK, I think maybe I understand what you mean about objective truth not existing. For things in remote history, we really can't know what actually happened. We can only work with the records we have, imperfect as they are. I think I pretty much agree with you: I think we can't legislate <i>effectively</i> or <i>enforceably</i> against including false information if there is no way to measure what is true and what is false. I'm not proposing that we have a policy that legislates against including false information. I think maybe we already have a policy similar to that about biographies of living persons. I'm not suggesting any changes to those policies at this time. I'm suggesting deleting "not whether it is true" (or any of a number of other proposed changes in wording mentioned above, etc.) None of those proposed changes in wording seem to me to be legislating against including false information. Do you think they are? I'd like to just go back to saying nothing about whether the articles are true or not.</dd>
<dd>Grace Note, you also said, "<i>I recognise in your reply that you are trying to suggest that the policy should emphasise that I need only be able to attribute my claim. Which I agree with. But you are claiming elsewhere that we should not be explicit that we do not make claims to truth. I think it is essential that we do not.</i>" If I understand this right, you think it's highly important that we not only avoid making claims to truth, but that we also say something in the policies to state clearly that we are not making claims to truth. How about something like this? "Wikipedia cannot guarantee that everything in its articles is true." or some similar wording. I would be OK with something like that. Or to Wikipedians, "If you've checked that something is stated in a reliable source, that's normally good enough; you don't have to go further than that and verify that it's actually true." There is a subtle distinction here with the "not whether it is true" wording, which raises its head when there is actual evidence of falsehood present rather than just lack of evidence of anything other than the reliable source. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a basic question, the answer to which might help explain a certain point of view.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do we want information to be attributable/verifiable at all? Why not explicitly allow all statements, whether true or false, attributable or unattributable, original research or otherwise unsourced?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#measuring_truth" title="">I suggested above how I would approach this question</a>.
